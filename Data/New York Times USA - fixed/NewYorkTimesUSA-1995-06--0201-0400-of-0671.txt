HEADLINE: JAPAN TELLS U.S. IT WILL NOT JOIN EMBARGO ON IRAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
In a sharp rebuff to the Clinton Administration, the Japanese Government has told Washington that Tokyo will refuse to join its embargo on trade with Iran, undercutting the American effort to isolate Teheran economically for its sponsorship of terrorism and its suspected pursuit of nuclear weapons.
Britain, France and Germany have already told the White House that they will not join in the embargo. But because Japan is such a large customer -- it purchases 400,000 barrels of oil a day from Teheran -- its participation was crucial if the trade embargo was to have anything more than symbolic effect. 
 Statistics compiled by Tokyo indicate that Japan bought about 10 percent of its total crude oil imports from Iran last year. That makes Japan one of Iran's largest customers: Japanese companies purchase about 17 percent of all of Iran's oil production, but some of that is sold to third countries.
White House officials said they were not surprised by the decision and said they doubted that it was a direct retaliation for the American threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars starting later this month.
"They probably would have snubbed us on this anyway," one of Mr. Clinton's senior economic advisers said today. "But clearly they are not in any mood to do us favors."
But the decision adds significantly to the strain between the two countries as President Clinton prepares to meet on Thursday with Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, before the start of the economic summit conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
For years Japan has differed sharply with the United States on how to deal with the Iran. Tokyo argues that efforts to isolate Iran economically or diplomatically will only worsen the country's behavior. The Administration has responded that isolation, rather than engagement, is the only way to send a forceful message.
The Administration last month expanded the longstanding embargo on direct oil imports from Iran. Under the new rules, American companies and their subsidiaries can no longer buy Iranian oil and sell it in third markets, including Japan's.
The United States first imposed comprehensive sanctions on Iran during the hostage crisis that began in 1979, but lifted them in 1981. The Reagan Administration reimposed some sanctions in the mid-1980's and banned direct imports of oil in 1987.
Oil analysts doubt that Iran's overall sales will be affected very much by the expanded embargo. As American companies are dropping their contracts, others are picking up the slack. China, engaged in its own disputes with the Administration, has said it will dramatically expand its imports of Iranian oil.
While the State Department and White House officials have tried over the last month to convince United States allies to join the embargo, officials conceded from the start that it was nearly a lost cause.
At a White House briefing today, the deputy national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said, "We will continue to urge our trading partners and the other leaders of the international economy to exercise the greatest possible restraint with respect to their trade with Iran."
Other officials, however, said they doubted that the subject would be a major topic of discussion next week when the summit meeting takes place with Japan and the largest Western industrial powers among Washington's allies -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.
Mr. Berger said the Administration would press "specifically with respect to concessional trade programs with Iran that gives them actual export credits or other kinds of financing they could not otherwise get."
Last month, under intense American pressure, Japanese officials agreed to suspend one such program, involving hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for a dam project in Iran. But the program has not been killed; Japanese officials say only that the next installment of the aid will be "suspended" for an indefinite period.
The question of whether Japan is defying the Iranian embargo to retaliate for American trade pressure is a crucial one. It goes to the heart of American assertions that the automobile dispute is containable and will not infect other parts of the relationship with Tokyo.
Both Japanese and American officials have been at pains in recent weeks to insist that the trade issues have been "walled off" from the political and security relations between the two countries.
The reality is more muddied. Oil-purchase policy in Japan is commanded by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is also in charge of the trade talks. As a result, it is inevitable that the decision on Iran will be interpreted by many as a warning from Tokyo.
The White House insisted today that the trade dispute has not spilled over into other aspects of Japanese-American relations. "We still believe that we can deal with these trade issues and economic issues and keep them from affecting the balance of the relationship," said Michael D. McCurry, the President's press secretary. He said the meeting next week between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Murayama "will make clear that there are remaining a range of issues upon which we cooperate closely and we will continue to cooperate closely."
In private, however, Administration officials continue to tell their Japanese counterparts that unless the trade issues are resolved, the rest of the relationship will eventually suffer. And they say the stress on other issues at Halifax next week is largely a reflection of the widely held assessment that Mr. Murayama is on his way out of office and is powerless to broker a trade deal even if he was inclined to do so.

HEADLINE: Dole and Democrat in Talks On Regulatory Overhaul

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Eager to curb Federal regulatory powers, Senator Bob Dole is close to agreement with an influential Democratic ally on a bill that Mr. Dole may bring to the Senate floor next week, Senate aides said.
Mr. Dole, a Kansas Republicanwho, as majority leader, is the bill's most powerful sponsor, has been negotiating all week with Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who is a longtime proponent of regulatory changes and who Mr. Dole has said might draw enough support from other Democrats to head off a filibuster. 
 Today, the negotiators circulated a draft of two central provisions from a Dole-Johnston compromise, sending other Democrats scrambling to muster opposition. The provisions, which slightly soften Mr. Dole's original version of the bill, spell out the extent to which the measure would alter existing environmental laws, and set guidelines for judicial review of regulations.
The legislation on regulations addresses one of the most intensely debated environmental changes before the Congress this year: requiring proof that major regulations would reduce the risks of pollution and that the presumed benefits are worth the cost. That would block many strict environmental rules from being issued.
The House has passed similar legislation as part of a broad package of anti-regulatory measures in the Republicans' Contract With America. The Clinton Administration and its environmental allies oppose them.
Mr. Dole, along with Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, has been meeting daily with Mr. Johnston to revise the bill, which is the next item Mr. Dole wants the Senate to debate after it completes work on a telecommunications bill, probably next week.
Mr. Roth is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which unanimously approved a version of the legislation that is much milder than the version Mr. Dole sponsored.
But while the latest draft moves Mr. Dole slightly closer to Mr. Roth's version, many elements of the complex legislation remained unresolved, and its opponents today voiced doubts that the new provisions went far enough to address the concerns of the White House and environmentalists.
The White House has already begun to assemble "talking points" for Democratic senators to use next week, an effort to raise opposition to the measure even before formal debate begins. The measure could come to the floor as early as midweek but might be delayed if Mr. Dole doubts that he has enough votes to prevail.
The bill's proponents argue that too many costly environmental rules are imposed on businesses without adequate proof that the rules would reduce the risks posed by pollution, and without considering the presumed benefits versus the cost.
Opponents counter that many environmental rules are intended to provide a margin of safety to the public, and that health concerns outweigh economic considerations. They say the bill will roll back many of the environmental gains of the past 25 years.
For months, competing versions of the bill have been moving haltingly through the Senate, leaving Mr. Dole with a familiar conundrum as the legislative leader who is also running for President: whether to accept a moderate version that could pass easily, like Mr. Roth's proposal, or to fight a protracted battle for his own version, which is enthusiastically supported by business groups who could provide him important political support.
Although Mr. Dole doubtless could get enough Republican support for a simple majority in favor of his version, Democrats had threatened a filibuster, so he needs 60 senators to cut off debate and force a vote.
The version of the bill sponsored by Mr. Dole was approved by the Judiciary Committee despite strong opposition from the committee's Democrats and the Administration.
Rather than accepting the version passed by the Governmental Affairs Committee, which many business lobbyists do not think goes far enough, Mr. Dole has been seeking to draw a few Democrats his way.
But it remains to be seen whether Mr. Johnston can bring along many moderate Democrats, let alone liberals who are itching for a fight on the environmental front.
The compromise version that circulated today was not embraced by environmentalists.
"We are extremely troubled by it," said Greg Wetstone, legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The compromise said that the bill's cost-benefit tests for environmental and health regulations "shall supplement, and not supersede" provisions of bills like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
But it also contained detailed instructions for Federal agencies to take costs and benefits into account in setting rules, adding a new ingredient to decisions that are now made principally on the basis of protecting the public's health.

Treasury Market Slumps For Third Day in a Row
Prices of Treasuries took their worst beating since September amid speculation that the Japanese might curtail future purchases of United States Government securities. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.72, up from 6.61 percent on Thursday and 6.53 percent at the beginning of the week.
Some analysts said the rumor might have served as an excuse for investors to sell in a market that has run too far, too fast on anticipation that the economy will continue to slow. No one saw the trading as a sign of a major new direction in the market. [Page 36.]
 
The stock market turned sour, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 34.58 points to 4,423.99, as traders saw further evidence of an economic slowdown but without the prospects of a cut in interest rates that would help lift sagging corporate earnings. The traders were so troubled by the outlook that they ignored surprisingly good news on the inflation front. For the week the Dow was down 20.4 points. [37.]
 
Share prices plunged in Tokyo to the lowest level in nearly three years, amid discouragement over the economic outlook and the Government's rescue plan for the banking industry. The Nikkei fell 398.12 points, or 2.6 percent, to 15,044.18, its lowest close since Aug. 19, 1992. The latest development to pull down stocks was the release of the central bank's quarterly survey of Japanese business sentiment, which found that businesses had become more optimistic, despite the strong yen. That seemed to depress the market, analysts said, because it would deter the central bank from cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. [34.]
 
The dollar dropped sharply on a rumor that large Japanese investors were selling United States securities. It recovered much of the loss as traders concluded the rumor was groundless. [42.]
 
Producer Prices Flat, With No Sign of Inflation
Inflation at the producer level disappeared again in May, reflecting the slowing economy, as price declines for food and energy products offset increases for other types of finished goods, Government figures showed. [36.]
 
Tokyo Rejects Iran Embargo
The Japanese Government has told Washington it will refuse to join the embargo on trade with Iran, undercutting the Administration's effort to isolate Teheran economically for its sponsorship of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. [1.]
 
Lotus's Employees Cautioned
Lotus Development has directed employees not to buy or sell shares in the company until the board has announced its position on I.B.M.'s takeover offer. [35.]
 
Microsoft Damns the Torpedoes
Despite a Justice Department investigation, Microsoft said it had no intention of altering its plans for entering the computer on-line services business in August. [35.]

A Rockefeller Center Roadblock
A Federal bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by Rockefeller Center Properties, the real estate investment trust that holds a $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center, to wrest control of the property from its bankrupt owners. [46.]
 
ITT Completes Sale of Units
ITT said it had agreed to sell the remaining portions of its ITT Financial subsidiary for about $5.5 billion, completing a process it announced in September. [35.]
 
Steinway Agent Raided in Japan
Raiders from Japan's Fair Trade Commission confiscated documents at the Tokyo offices of the local sales agent of Steinway & Sons, on suspicion that the agent had prevented rivals from importing pianos made by the New York company. [34.]
 
Books From Rock and Roll
Brian Roylance and his Genesis Publications are turning from facsimiles of classic novels and historic documents to rock and roll, preparing to sell limited editions of books by George Harrison and Eric Clapton and about the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix. The books sell for hundreds of dollars each. [11.]

HEADLINE: 2 Nutrition Programs Win Crucial Backing in Senate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee broke with fellow Republicans in the House today and rejected the notion of giving the states responsibility for the school lunch program.
The chairman, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, also turned down pleas from some Republican governors who want Washington to replace food stamps with direct cash payments to the states. 
 The opposition of so influential a figure on both issues doomed whatever chance the governors might have had of winning control of the food stamp program. And it significantly reduced the chances that the Federal Government would relinquish the school lunch program.
After weeks of negotiations with members of his committee, which has jurisdiction over both programs, Senator Lugar said he had concluded that there was little support for turning them into block grants to the states.
Republicans in the House have already won its approval for replacing the school lunch program with block grants. But they concede that they have lost the battle for public opinion under withering fire from Democrats, who have attacked the House majority as cruel to children.
If any senators ever supported the idea, Mr. Lugar said in a talk with reporters today, "their ardor was dulled" by the spectacle of the ferocious House debate over the issue. Mr. Lugar said some Senate Republicans strongly supported the school lunch program and had told him, "Tamper with that at your peril."
But Mr. Lugar, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, said he supported giving the states new flexibility to run nutrition programs, and he proposed food stamp cutbacks intended to save $16.5 billion, or 11 percent of projected spending, over five years. A welfare bill passed by the House in March would make deeper cuts, slicing projected spending on food stamps by $20.3 billion, or 14 percent, over five years.
The Clinton Administration welcomed Mr. Lugar's proposals, saying they were more reasonable than those approved by the House. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said, "I've always known that Senator Lugar was a strong supporter of basic nutrition programs that insure needy people are fed."
Mr. Lugar's proposals come as farm lobbyists and advocates of child nutrition programs square off in a fight over how to apportion cuts in the budget of the Agriculture Department, which runs both crop subsidy programs and feeding programs.
Senator Lugar proposes to cut child nutrition programs by $2 billion over the next five years, in addition to his $16.5 billion in food stamp savings. He said he expected farm lobbyists and some Republican senators to seek deeper cuts in those programs as a way to avoid big cuts in subsidies for crops like cotton, wheat, rice and corn.
The Senator said he expected his proposals to win a formal endorsement from the Agriculture Committee next week. He will then offer them as an amendment to a sweeping welfare bill due to reach the Senate floor later this month.
For the last 10 months, Republicans have extolled the virtues of block grants, lump-sum payments of Federal money to the states for loosely defined purposes like nutrition assistance or child care.
Mr. Lugar said he was inclined a few months ago to support a block grant for food stamps. But today he said, "I changed my mind." He said he now believed that food stamps provided states invaluable assistance in responding to recessions and population growth caused by the migration of people from one region to another.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, praised Mr. Lugar for protecting nutrition programs within the fiscal constraints imposed by the Republican Congressional leadership. But Mr. Leahy said the proposed cuts in food stamps were too deep.
Mr. Leahy also said he was distressed at the rivalry between farmer and anti-hunger groups, which have for decades worked together, supporting each other's programs. "I see that coalition breaking down, becoming almost jungle warfare," he said.
Robert J. Fersh, president of the Food Research and Action Center, an anti-hunger group, said, "Senator Lugar has moved to preserve the current structure of the food stamp and child nutrition programs, and that is extremely good news for anyone concerned about hungry people."
The budget blueprint approved by the Senate last month calls on the Agriculture Committee to cut $28 billion from its programs over five years and suggests that no more than 20 percent of the savings should come from commodity programs. That implies that at least $22.4 billion of the savings will come from food stamps and nutrition programs -- $4 billion more than Mr. Lugar proposed.
Mr. Lugar said senators were free to propose deeper cuts in nutrition programs when the committee takes up a comprehensive bill to reauthorize farm programs later this year.
Mr. Lugar proposed these changes to save money in the food stamp program:
*Beneficiaries 18 to 50 years old with no dependents would generally be required to work or participate in job training at least 20 hours a week.
*The formula for calculating monthly food stamp allotments would be revised to cut benefits about 3 percent from the amounts prescribed under current law.
*The standard deduction used in calculating a household's eligibility for food stamps, now $134 a month, would be reduced to $124 and frozen at that level for five years.
*Federal and state payments to help families with home heating costs would be counted as income in determining eligibility for food stamps.
In addition, Mr. Lugar proposed small reductions in Federal subsidies paid to schools serving lunch or breakfast to schoolchildren. Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research and advocacy group, said these cuts were "very modest, ranging from a fraction of a cent to a couple of pennies per meal."

HEADLINE: Getting on a Transplant List Is the First of Many Hurdles

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
Mickey Mantle's swift progression from deathly ill patient to liver recipient made the organ transplant process look easy.
But for the 4,659 Americans waiting for livers and the thousands more waiting for hearts, lungs, kidneys, intestines and pancreases, the hurdles they must leap are so many and, often, so onerous, that the wonder is that many get organs at all. 
 Ethicists and transplant surgeons said they were not questioning whether it was appropriate for Mr. Mantle to have gotten a new liver so quickly -- he was the sickest person in his geographic area with blood type O and so was first in line when a liver from a donor with his blood type became available. But, they said, the real trick is to get on the transplant list in the first place.
These experts said that whether a patient gets on a list for an organ depends very much on the person's social circumstances and psychological profile, how rich he or she is and how well he or she is able to manipulate the organ transplant system.
Mr. Mantle checked into his local hospital, Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, on May 28, complaining that his stomach hurt. On June 6, after diagnosing liver cancer in addition to his pre-existing hepatitis and cirrhosis, his gastroenterologist put him on a waiting list for a liver transplant. A donor materialized late in the day on June 7. At 4:30 A.M. on June 8, Dr. Robert Goldstein, a transplant surgeon at Baylor, began operating to give Mr. Mantle a new liver.
But for most people the process, which can take days to months, is more prolonged.
The first requirement for getting a transplant is simply having a doctor. "A lot of folks don't have any contact with the medical system," said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, who is writing a book about liver transplants.
Once a patient sees a doctor, it is up to that doctor to decide whether to refer the patient to a medical center for a transplant. Doctors weigh factors that could determine compliance with medical care after a transplant, like whether the patients have friends and family to support them and whether they are substance abusers or are mentally ill or mentally retarded.
Dr. James L. Levenson, a professor of psychiatry, medicine and surgery at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, said that although private doctors are the first gatekeepers, the criteria they use have never been systematically studied.
If the patient's doctor decides to refer the patient to a transplant center, the next hurdle is demonstrating an ability to pay. "You have to pass the critical wallet biopsy," Dr. Caplan said. "Let's say I find out I need a liver transplant. I go to the medical center and before I get any tests done, the business office talks to me. These transplants are very expensive. It costs $10,000 to $20,000 for them even to evaluate you, and you may have to travel to get to one of these places."
It costs an average of $300,000 for the transplant and the first year of care, including anti-rejection drugs, and patients must show that their insurance will pay or that they can somehow come up with this money.
Joel Newman, who is a spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, a Richmond nonprofit group that, under a Federal contract, allocates organs nationally, said that if patients cannot assure a transplant center that their insurance will take care of their costs, they are often required to put down a deposit before their evaluation can begin.
Another factor is the ability to pay for anti-rejection drugs. Many insurance companies will not pay, or will not pay the full amount for these medications, which can cost $1,000 or more a month and must be taken for the rest of a patient's life. Medicare, which, by law, must pay for kidney transplants, is phasing in a new policy that will extend the period it pays for anti-rejection drugs for kidneys from one year to three years. But, after that, patients are on their own.
Dr. Jimmy Light, director of transplantation at the Washington Medical Center, said that the center tries to find creative ways to help patients come up with money to pay for anti-rejection drugs, but that if the patients cannot show they can purchase the drugs, they cannot have transplants.
John Mitchell, treasurer of the Transplant Foundation in Richmond, said his tiny organization tries to help those in dire need of money to pay for anti-rejection drugs. "It's a problem, I'll tell you," he said.
The group raised $15,000 last year through such fund-raisers as art auctions and bowling marathons, he said, but it was nowhere near enough money to meet the demand. Mr. Mitchell said he knows of many transplant doctors who dip into their own pockets to help patients pay for the drugs. But he also knows of at least one woman who died after having a heart transplant because she did not have enough money to pay for her medications.
Even if patients have enough money to qualify for a transplant, the transplant center must also deem them good candidates psychologically and socially. The criteria vary widely. In a survey he conducted in the late 1980's, Dr. Levenson found that the criteria used vary according to organs. Heart-transplant programs are the strictest, he said, kidney programs the most lenient, and liver programs are in between.
Among the factors that transplant centers said they weighed as contraindications are not having a spouse or relative or close friend for support, having suffered a recent death or loss of someone close to you, being a felon, having a history of criminal behavior, having a family history of mental illness, having schizophrenia, suffering from depression, having attempted suicide, being demented, having a personality disorder and being mentally retarded.
But a patient rejected by one program might be accepted by another. For example, 54 percent of liver programs said they always exclude demented patients, 23 percent said that dementia weighed against a patient, but nearly 20 percent said it was irrelevant.
Dr. Levenson also found variations in the listing of alcoholics and drug addicts. For liver transplants, most centers require that the person demonstrate abstinence for some period of time, usually from six months to a year, before the transplant. Mr. Mantle had undergone treatment for alcoholism a year and a half earlier, and had been off alcohol since then, according to a Baylor surgeon.
But insurance programs often impose their own criteria, with some refusing to pay altogether for a person with alcoholic liver disease and others imposing longer periods of abstinence than the medical center requires.
Dr. Levenson said that "justice would seem to call for the same criteria everywhere" in excluding patients from transplant lists. But, he added, "the countervailing argument is that we don't have enough experience and enough data to know exactly what the right answer is."
Savvy patients can choose the centers most likely to accept them, Dr. Caplan said. They also look for centers that have short waiting times. Organs are allocated within local regions, and median waiting times for livers, for example, range from 18 days to 443 days, depending on the organ procurement organization and where it is located.
Mr. Mantle, who was in Region 4, was in an area with some of the shortest waiting times for livers. New York, Region 9, has the longest waiting time. Mr. Newman said that some affluent patients, who can afford to go through the evaluation process more than once, get listed at several different centers simultaneously, increasing their chances of getting an organ.
The option of picking and choosing a transplant center is not available to everyone, however. Patients who belong to health maintenance organizations are often restricted to a short list of centers.
A very few patients gain yet another advantage in seeking an organ. A donor's family can designate them as the recipient. Mr. Newman said a woman in Washington donated her heart to her minister, who was on a waiting list, but not at the top. The minister got the heart. Last year, a family in Tennessee donated their daughter's heart to her father, who lived in Michigan. The family of a man in Tampa, Fla, who was a Ku Klux Klan sympathizer, instructed that his organs not be given to blacks and the local organ procurement agency agreed to the condition, arguing that to do otherwise would be to deprive needy patients.
With all its variables -- subjective, economic and regional -- coming into play, it is hard to argue that the transplant system is fair, Dr. Caplan said. But, he added, that should be no surprise. "Those who tell me they are surprised to hear that maybe someone with money or celebrity or high political office may have an easier time getting on the transplant list must have slept through the past year," he said, alluding to the nation's health care debates.

HEADLINE: Block that Raid, Mr. McCall

 BODY:
While passing its budget this year, the New York State Legislature came up with some exotic fiscal gimmicks to pay for expenses. Few were more brazen than the lawmakers' raid on a $360 million pool of money called the Supplemental Reserve Fund. The State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, has the authority to try to block the raid in court. He should do so.
The case bears scrutiny because New York City may be tempted to try something similar to reduce its own budget deficit. The state and city have many contingency funds on their books, set aside for emergencies or expenses that accrue over time, like pension costs. These funds should always be restricted to their original purposes and not raided to balance the general budget. The Supplemental Reserve Fund was established more than two decades ago to pay for future extra benefits for people already retired whose pensions have eroded over the years because of inflation. 
 Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a bill using the fund for that purpose for state retirees. It also directed New York City to make the same kind of payments for its retirees, even though the city had no comparable fund. Gov. George Pataki vetoed it at the urging of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
This week, the Legislature moved again to draw from the state reserve to supplement pension benefits, but only a part of the state reserve. Most of the reserve, it decreed, would be used to meet regular costs in the budget. This time Mr. Giuliani muted his protests because the law did not require New York City to come up with its own money for pension supplements until 1997, and because the Mayor feared that more state budget cuts would cost the city more state aid.
Now Mr. McCall is faced with a dilemma. He is the sole trustee of the fund. If he goes to court to block its use for the state budget, he will not only throw the state into deficit, he will kill the pension supplement for retirees, many of whom deserve help. But a lawsuit to prevent the raid will also send a signal that the state must not resort to gimmicks even for worthy objectives. The choice is clear. Mr. McCall should sue.

HEADLINE: Save the Job Corps

 BODY:
The Federal Government finances a dizzying array of education and training programs. Chairman Nancy Kassebaum of the Senate Labor Committee will propose a bill next week to combine 70 or so training programs into a block grant, giving the money to the states to help low-skilled or unemployed workers. Dismantling may make sense for marginally effective programs, but it makes no sense for the Job Corps, a uniquely successful program for disadvantaged youths. The Kassebaum bill is expected to preserve the Job Corps, but risk its future by turning it over to the states to run.
The Job Corps serves more than 60,000 youths between the ages of 16 and 24 at 110 centers around the country. The program is expensive, about $1 billion a year, or about $20,000 per participant. That is much higher than other programs, but consider the reasons. The Job Corps is a residential program, providing enrollees room, board, counseling, social skills instruction, education, vocational training and job placement services. Getting youths out of destructive home environments is the key. Over 80 percent of Job Corps enrollees are high school dropouts. Nearly half are on welfare and less than half read at better than an eighth-grade level. 
 The results justify the expense. A study from the 1980's showed that those who completed the Job Corps program boosted their earnings by 15 percent, and were much more likely to complete high school and attend college. Graduates worked longer, received less welfare and committed fewer crimes. Seventy percent of Job Corps graduates got jobs, joined the military or enrolled in educational programs. The study estimated that for every dollar the Federal Government spent on the Job Corps, society got back almost $1.50 in benefits such as additional output or lower prison expenditures. These numbers need to be updated, but there is no evidence they no longer hold.
The Job Corps cannot be run well by the states. It trains and places students for a national, not local, job market. As a Federal program it gives enrollees the chance to enter the center that best matches their career plans. Besides, one Federal bureaucracy makes more sense than 50 state bureaucracies. The Job Corps runs on a competitive model; private corporations compete to operate training centers, and Washington has not been loath to replace lax managers.
Critics point to centers with high costs, dropout rates and crime. There are problems. But the critics overlook the crime-prone population the program serves, and the enviable record of steering these kids into careers. High dropout rates reflect in part the program's demanding standards and swift exit for those who breach the rules.
States will not spend lavishly to aid their poorest residents. Nor do they have a good track record running training programs for the disadvantaged. The Republicans who took over Congress preaching cost-effective government should not disable the one Federal training program that works.

HEADLINE: Taiwan's President Tiptoes Around Politics at Cornell

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y., June 9

 BODY:
His countrymen wanted to hear him talk about the symbolism of his landmark visit to the United States, the significance of the trip for Taiwan's international image, the effect of it all on American-Chinese relations.
But President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, while sounding a few familiar themes about Taiwan's rapid economic expansion and steady democratization, preferred to talk about the things one might expect to hear at a class reunion: How he missed his days as a doctoral student in agricultural economics at Cornell University here. What he had been doing since his graduation in 1968. And how he appreciated the chance to come back. 
 "It has been a long and challenging journey, with many bumps in the road, yet my wife and I are indeed very happy to return to this beloved campus," he told an overflow crowd of 5,000 today, speaking in English with a heavy Taiwanese accent.
"The long, exhausting evening in the libraries, the soothing and reflective hours at church, the hurried shuttling between classrooms, the evening strolls, hand in hand" -- he recalled them all. "So many memories of the past have come to mind, filling my heart with joy and gratitude."
He did not need to say much more to get his point across. For all the buildup surrounding the first Taiwan leader to visit the United States since diplomatic ties ended in 1979, Mr. Lee would have probably been content just to stand at the lectern and smile. It was his mere presence that meant a thousand words, a diplomatic breakthrough culminating years of lobbying and foreshadowing what Taiwan hopes will be a bigger international role.
Mr. Lee emphasized that his was a private trip, but its importance was not lost on the more than 300 journalists who traveled here from Taiwan. They analyzed his every word and gesture in a reporting free-for-all befitting a papal visit.
Nor was its importance lost on several American officials, who either heralded Mr. Lee with a red-carpet arrival at the Syracuse airport on Thursday or ventured up to this rolling, beautiful campus today. On Thursday, it was Senators Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Frank Murkowski of Alaska; today, it was Representative Gary Ackerman of Queens.
Even so, caution and restraint were the watchwords today as every detail of Mr. Lee's visit -- from the canceled afternoon news conference to his wife's garden photo session on the campus -- seemed tightly scripted to insure that an already-controversial trip would not become more so.
China has been livid that Mr. Lee has been treated like, well, a president, of what they consider a renegade province. It has retaliated against the United States by canceling several official delegations and postponing talks on technology sales.
Today, Beijing issued its strongest condemnation yet of the trip. The official New China News Agency said: "The issue of Taiwan is as explosive as a barrel of gunpowder. It is extremely dangerous to warm it up, no matter whether the warming is done by the United States or by Lee Teng-hui. This wanton wound inflicted upon China will help the Chinese people more clearly realize what kind of a country the United States is."
The controversy did not escape the Cornell campus. Outside the Newman basketball arena where Mr. Lee spoke today, more than 200 pro-Taiwan independence and pro-Beijing demonstrators lined opposite sides of the street, forming a phalanx through which bewildered and bemused alumni had to pass to attend the lecture.
Mr. Lee's talk was interrupted almost two dozen times by thunderous applause, in marked contrast to the international reception Taiwan has normally gotten since its expulsion from the United Nations in 1971.
He hinted at how frustrating Taiwan's lack of international standing has sometimes been.
"We sincerely hope that all nations can treat us fairly and reasonably, and not overlook the significance, value and functions we represent," he said. "Some say that it is impossible for us to break out of the diplomatic isolation we face, but we will do our utmost to demand the impossible."
Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, and China, or the People's Republic of China, each claim to be the legitimate government of China and insist that all countries pick a side. In 1979, the United States switched from Taipei to Beijing. Since then, Taiwan has become increasingly isolated from the international community; now, only 29 countries have official ties with Taiwan.
But Taiwan has lobbied its unofficial friends tirelessly with its big bank account and smooth diplomacy, resulting in several visits by Mr. Lee to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
Last fall, Cornell invited Mr. Lee to come deliver a lecture, but the State Department refused to issue a visa. This year, Cornell asked again -- with the help of a Republican Congress that passed a nearly unanimous resolution supporting Mr. Lee's visa application. The Clinton Administration yielded to the request.
Mindful of souring relations with China, American officials asked Mr. Lee -- and the hundreds of Taiwanese-Americans who flocked here from hundreds of miles away to catch a glimpse of him -- to keep things as low-key as possible. But the feeling here was that no matter what China might do, Taiwan has done wonders for its image, as has Mr. Lee.
There has been some speculation in the Taiwan press, for instance, that Mr. Lee timed his visit to increase his popularity in anticipation of next year's presidential elections, the first time the President will be directly elected by the people.

HEADLINE: Russia and Ukraine Settle Dispute Over Black Sea Fleet

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 9

 BODY:
The leaders of Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement today that should conclude their bitter dispute over the Black Sea Fleet, improving relations between the two most important countries of the former Soviet Union.
The issue of the old Soviet fleet and naval base at Sevastopol, Crimea, has done much to fan nationalist tensions between Moscow and Kiev since the Soviet Union died in 1991. 
 It is a measure of how much the world has changed that the two Presidents, Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine, had their meeting at an American-run hotel, the Radisson-Lazurnaya, in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.
An obviously pleased Mr. Yeltsin told reporters that the signing was an important one that "finally put a period on this question once and for all."
Mr. Kuchma was more careful, as is his nature, adding, "Although some detailed issues remain, I consider this question solved in general." The main thing, he said, "is that Ukraine and Russia really agreed on strategic partnership."
But the fleet, which is both small and old, with the newest of the 635 vessels built 17 years ago, was always more of a political issue than a strategic one. A newly independent Ukraine has been reluctant to sacrifice its sovereign rights to a Russia that has generally patronized it.
For a time, the vessels flew the flags of both countries, but since Moscow paid the bills, commanders nearly always obeyed Moscow's orders, creating a dangerous series of mutinies and fistfights.
The matter was further complicated by the weird history of Crimea, an area with a large ethnic Russian population, resorts and a naval base, that was handed to Ukraine as a meaningless gesture of friendship in 1954 by the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev. The new border lost its meaninglessness after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and Russian nationalists regularly demand that Crimea be returned to Russia, along with the fleet and the base.
Many previous agreements on the issue have fallen apart, but today the two countries agreed in principle to split the fleet; Russia is then to"purchase" most of the Ukrainian share, ending up with 82 percent of the vessels.
Russia will continue to use the base at Sevastopol, paying rent to Ukraine, mostly in the form of energy supplies and debt forgiveness. But Ukraine will also be able to use other parts of the large base in Sevastopol for its small fleet, which has become Ukraine's navy. Exactly where Ukraine's main base will be is to be announced, as the two countries had decided to leave it out of the final document.
Mr. Kuchma, an ethnic Russian from eastern Ukraine, defeated Ukraine's first President, Leonid D. Kravchuk, in a bitter election campaign that centered on Ukraine's economy and relations with Russia. Since taking office, Mr. Kuchma has strengthened himself by standing up for Ukrainian sovereignty while nearby countries, like Belarus, have tried to move closer to Moscow.
Mr. Kuchma has also introduced real economic reform and budget discipline, earning a loan agreement from the International Monetary Fund and praise from Washington. He has pushed through the ratification of an important arms control treaty, has gotten Moscow to reschedule much of Ukraine's $3 billion debt for gas supplies and, most important perhaps, has forced his own legislature to grant him broader powers to appoint the Government, issue decrees and pursue economic change.
Recently, he used the example of Russia's crushing of a secessionist region, Chechnya, to disband a secessionist legislature that had its own president in Crimea. While sensitive, Mr. Kuchma's strong action to keep Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea is regarded as an important backdrop to the signing of today's deal.
For Russia, the gains are also considerable. Moscow intends to reassert its power in the Black Sea as a counterpoint to Turkey, which has its own ambitions in Central Asia. Russia is also pushing oil companies to build a new oil terminal at Novo rossisk, a Russian port on the Black Sea, rather than building new pipelines through Turkey. Even a small, decaying fleet will give Russia a presence.
Dmitry Neverov, writing in the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, noted that in 1990, in the Black Sea, there were only two large naval exercises, by Bulgaria and Turkey. In 1994, however, there were seven: four by Turkey and three NATO joint exercises.
"One could interpret these figures as testimony of increased mutual trust in the Black Sea, if one wished," Mr. Neverov wrote. "But speaking the truth, one should speak of the increased presence of NATO forces in an area of Russia's vital interests."

HEADLINE: GARDENING

BYLINE: By ALLEN LACY; Allen Lacy writes and publishes Homeground, a quarterly gardening newsletter, and is the author of "The Gardener's Eye" and "The Garden in Autumn."

 BODY:
MANY American publishers feel that the time is right for gardening books. The demographics are encouraging -- the baby boomers who enriched the authors and publishers of volumes on jogging a decade ago have moved farther into maturity. With leisure, comfortable incomes and settled ways, the theory goes, they should be ripe to take up gardening. Thus, hardly a day goes by that some new book on the subject doesn't appear in my mailbox.
Sadly, many -- perhaps the majority -- of them are early candidates for a garage sale, especially those dominated by the alphabet, following a formula that says start with abelia, end with zinnia and along the way throw in some information about the height and spread of plants, the colors of their flowers and how tolerant they are of nasty weather. 
 But it would be a grand mistake to generalize from what is merely typical, because every season seems to produce a small but choice crop to read and reread with pleasure. Joe Eck and Wayne Winterrowd's book A YEAR AT NORTH HILL: Four Seasons in a Vermont Garden (Little, Brown, $29.95) is a prime example. It is toothsome -- passionate, reflective, inspiring, endlessly quotable and filled with good humor and humanity.
Mr. Eck and Mr. Winterrowd, partners in North Hill Garden Design Associates, have been tending their five-acre jewel in southern Vermont since 1977. It is in a climate best described as challenging: Zone 4 -- only 100 frost-free days a year. I have not (yet) visited North Hill, but I have friends who have and who, when it comes to gardens, are on the picky side. The consensus is that North Hill is one of the best private gardens in North America.
"A Year at North Hill" is a book to match the garden. It joins that tiny handful of fine texts that are also literature -- Canon Ellacombe's "In a Gloucestershire Garden," Vita Sackville-West's "Joy of Gardening" and almost anything by Elizabeth Lawrence, but especially her "Gardens in Winter."
This volume delivers precisely what its title promises, a month-by-month account of a year (April to March) in the life of a garden and of the people who dreamed it into being and tend it obsessively. "It has been many years since -- if ever -- we thought of gardening as a pastime," they say. "We are actually writing about our life, or at least the hugest chunk of it." The authors have such contagious passion that I suspect a nongardener who picks up the book and starts reading could end up longing to grow Myosotidium hortensia, the spectacular but difficult Chatham Islands forget-me-not they grow in their lower greenhouse, or perhaps the Rosa pimpinellifolia. A reader would want to see it "pretty and clean, but laced with frost" in the autumn, as it is in Mr. Eck's photograph.
North Hill, like most wonderful gardens, is a retreat, a private place set apart from the public sphere, but the authors understand that within its confines the entire world is also present. History may not obviously intrude, but it is an educational and always tempting inference, because every plant has its story, whether it is known or not. This applies to everything from the onions and other vegetables that were domesticated in preliterate times to exotica discovered within the last decade -- for example, that strange and wondrous biennial Angelica gigas, a rangy plant, all knobs and knees, with half-domed flower clusters of the richest purple, first brought from South Korea, the authors say, in 1985. Mr. Winterrowd and Mr. Eck are devoted plantsmen, and it shows on every page of their book as they celebrate the rare and the uncommon. But they also know how to value and praise commoner plants, like lilacs and daffodils.
One thing puzzles me: Who wrote what? Both of the authors contribute to Horticulture magazine, and Mr. Winterrowd is the author of "Annuals for Connoisseurs," yet I can't find seams in this text; it is written in a single voice.
A writer's mind and a photographer's eye seldom inhabit the same body. I know, because I stood next to Cynthia Woodyard, one of America's very best garden photographers, as we took pictures of the same scene in a garden in Maryland. We used the same camera, same lens and same film. The difference when our slides came back was obvious. As one of my sons put it on comparing them, "You know, Dad, you can always tell a pro."
That said, I must also confess that the British writer, film maker and photographer Vivian Russell wears all of these hats successfully, judging by MONET'S GARDEN: Through the Seasons at Giverny (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $32.50). It is the handsomest book yet on the celebrated Impressionist's restored gardens at Giverny. The photos are as sumptuous and blowsy as the garden itself, with its wild profusion of plants, its wide gravel walks spilling over with nasturtiums beneath turquoise arches luxuriant with climbing roses in pink, buff, yellow and crimson. Everything seems chockablock at Giverny, as Nicotiana sylvestris fights orange cosmos, black-eyed susans and rose campions to struggle up to its aerial mastery.
Someone once may have used the word "subtle" to describe this garden, but if so, he didn't have his goggles on right. There's no more sophisticated color theory in practice here than in a kindergartener's crayon box. In an amiable democracy of color, magenta asserts its right to raise its voice alongside those of orange, bright yellow and scarlet. Ms. Russell's camera gets right into the fray, showing us what is, in fact, something of a glorious, jumbled mess. (The eye of the painter and of the garden designer may also turn out not to inhabit the same body.)
This book gives us something its rivals do not: a verbal and pictorial account of what's behind the scenes when the gardens are closed to the public. We are told, for example, that the soil here is pretty punk. At the end of each October, the garden shuts down for five months. All of its annuals and many of its perennials are ripped out and carted off for composting, and then work on the soil begins, with massive infusions of compost, manure and sulphate of potash to feed the explosion of growth in the year ahead. Judging from Ms. Russell's photographs of this work in progress, one thing is clear: by no stretch of the imagination could Giverny be called a low-maintenance garden.
THE relations between gardeners and landscape architects can sometimes be a bit testy. Gardeners thrive on plants, the more the better. Landscape architects tend more to love "bones" and permanent structures -- staircases, paths, pools. James van Sweden and Wolfgang Oehme are landscape architects known for their use of ornamental grasses and sturdy, fairly carefree, tough perennials, things like Sedum telephium (Autumn Joy) and Rudbeckia maxima (Goldsturm). Some have called their style "the new American garden," though it owes a hefty debt to the German plantsman Karl Foerster, who worked much earlier in the century. Mr. van Sweden and Mr. Oehme have designed quite a number of private residential gardens for well-heeled clients, but some of their best works have been public commissions, including the German-American Friendship Garden in Washington and Hudson River Park in Manhattan's Battery Park City.
These influential designers have probably made some gardens without water features, but the number must be small, as Mr. van Sweden's GARDENING WITH WATER (Random House, $40) shows clearly. A compendium of his work in collaboration with Mr. Oehme, it presents a convincing case for the proposition that no garden is quite a garden unless there is water in it -- from a little terra-cotta birdbath in a small city garden to an elaborate concoction of effervescent fountains, swelling waterfalls and still ponds, made to work on a grand scale by plumbing and electricity.
Gardeners with water in mind and ready to take the plunge, as it were, would do well to spend some time with this book, both for inspiration and for practical advice about what to plant, the needs of fish and how to keep the water clean and free of algae.
Among America's cities, Charleston, S.C., Boston and Philadelphia vie for first place as having the longest and richest horticultural history. It could be argued that Charleston takes the prize, thanks to its mild winters, which make it possible for such subtropical plants as hibiscus, oleanders and gardenias (named for Alexander Garden, an 18th-century Charleston physician) to grow outdoors year-round. Today the small, enclosed gardens of the city's historic district delight the tourists essential to the economy of the region, and also provide inspiration to gardeners like me, who are not of the lawn persuasion and believe that something there is that loves a wall.
Garden lovers who haven't yet gone on pilgrimage may be persuaded by GARDENS OF HISTORIC CHARLESTON (University of South Carolina, $39.95), by James R. Cothran, to plan a visit. A South Carolina native and a landscape architect and city planner in Atlanta, Mr. Cothran pleasantly surveys Charleston's long horticultural traditions. He discusses many of the most common plants that are characteristic in its gardens, like banana shrub, creeping fig and cassia. He also describes several small private gardens in such a way that readers will long for invitations from their owners to come calling. Mr. Cothran's book is appealingly illustrated with botanical prints, drawings and color photographs.
As we move west, the landscape changes dramatically. After a very cursory introduction to the history of gardening in the Golden State -- by the fourth paragraph the gold rush has arrived -- Nancy Goslee Power, a West Coast garden designer, gets down to her main business in THE GARDENS OF CALIFORNIA: Four Centuries of Design From Mission to Modern (Clarkson Potter, $50), written with Susan Heeger. She describes 30 gardens established from the Spanish colonial era to the present, and the result can only make gardeners with plots in less favored climates, like mine in southern New Jersey, long to travel, if not to move. In addition to such magnificently extravagant (and now open to the public) gardens as Filoli and the Huntington Botanical Gardens, Ms. Power explores much more personal and intimate ones up and down the state. Her own, a charmer on a lot in Santa Monica just 50 by 160 feet, was designed over a 10-year period. For a book of this kind, photographs are of course essential, and Mick Hales's are sumptuous.
Five acres in southern Vermont that add up to a gardener's Eden; Monet's Giverny, a point of pilgrimage for American tourists in France every summer; water gardens sometimes on a scale to impress a Renaissance pope; lush gardens in California -- all partake of the heroic, aspiring far beyond what most of us dream of, much less find practical to contemplate or feasible to accomplish.
Judith Moffett's HOMESTEAD YEAR: Back to the Land in Suburbia (Lyons & Burford, $22.95) is cut from different cloth entirely, for it is gentle in tone and modest in aim. Like "A Year at North Hill," it is an account of the events within a single year, but the garden is a suburban backyard near Philadelphia. Influenced by the idea of "homesteading," Ms. Moffett, a part-time college teacher and science-fiction writer, limited her teaching in the spring of 1992 and took a sabbatical for the fall with the intention of doing what she could to make the household self-sufficient. She and her husband cleared out the one-acre backyard and built raised vegetable beds. They enlarged the patch, kept hives of bees and raised ducks to eat.
It was a year's experiment only; indeed, Ms. Moffett and her husband now live in Salt Lake City. There is no elaborate dream here, and certainly no grand theory, but there is an appealing, plain honesty and some food for thought. The students I teach seem to think increasingly that food comes from the grocery store and that meat is born in polyfoam trays covered in transparent plastic film. Our poultry comes to us courtesy of Mr. Purdue or Mr. Tyson, and if I have any students who have ever killed, plucked and drawn a chicken they have kept quiet in class.
We need modest books that suggest what might happen if we turned our backs on the supermarket and tried as far as possible, for a time at least, to raise our own food with our own hands. "Homestead Year" does a nice job with these homespun realities.
 
 
 
DIRT UNDER HER NAILS
 In her new book, DEEP IN THE GREEN: An Exploration of Country Pleasures (Knopf, $24), Anne Raver may be writing most winningly about inoculating peas, or how to hear the squeak-squeak when digging clams, or about the ridiculously gregarious kitten Mr. Grey, alleged mouser. Or about the stuff in her parents' attic at the farm in Maryland, the old family place that none of the children want to keep. Or about trees in Manhattan. Or how to recognize a bufflehead duck simply by the way he flies out of the water. But at heart she isn't writing about these things. She is writing about herself. Nothing wrong with that. She comes across as an attractive person, not unlike us -- terrified to go up on a ladder to take off the storm windows and put on the screens, finding it hard to come to terms with our fathers, struck by the dissonance between rural Vermont and suburban New York, where we get the finger for going slow in a go-slow zone on Long Island. Ms. Raver writes about gardening for The New York Times, and this collection of 58 columns, all of which appeared in this paper or in her previous venue, Newsday, makes up an agreeable and varied garden of essays. They are nicely written. Fun to read. Sad. Heartwarming. Sometimes even useful. But make no mistake. Even though she is disguised as a garden columnist, this is only episodically a book about gardening. It's about life as seen by Anne Raver. Gardening is only the principal preoccupation, or maybe the organizing principle, of her life. I have no doubt that were she not interested in gardening but, say, in radio-controlled model airplanes, she could (and probably would) write a book fundamentally like this one. CHRISTOPER REED

as Heard on National Public Radio.

 IN theory, National Public Radio shouldn't work. Financed mostly by private donations, it also relies on Federal subsidies that ought to subject its news coverage to the nefarious influence of Washington politicians. As every schoolchild must know, a free press -- which means a press free of government -- is essential to a democratic system; certainly there have been plenty of examples around the world of censored, biased, government-controlled media. Soviet radio, television and newspapers were cheerleaders for a decaying system, burying economic failures, environmental catastrophes and ill-fated foreign adventures like Afghanistan. If a Soviet leader had made the equivalent of President Boris Yeltsin's absurd declaration last month that no military action was taking place in Chechnya, Moscow television would have reported it dutifully, without showing pictures to the contrary.
Even in the democracy of Israel, Government television has at times contributed to widespread ignorance by toning down news of Palestinian suffering under Israeli occupation. When the right-wing Likud bloc was in power, anguished Palestinian voices rarely got on the air.
By contrast, NPR has avoided biases that government might appreciate and reward. Its two news-and-feature programs, "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered," shame the commercial networks with more intelligent and less editorial reporting than private broadcasters provide. This anomaly persists even as Republicans threaten to eliminate funding for public broadcasting, a move that heightens the value of three recent books that display NPR's virtues.
Linda Wertheimer and Robert Siegel, two of the hosts of "All Things Considered," have each edited an impressive volume of transcripts of various touching, analytical, whimsical, historic, gripping interviews and reports. Ms. Wertheimer's "Listening to America: Twenty-five Years in the Life of a Nation, as Heard on National Public Radio" covers NPR's entire existence, from antiwar demonstrations to the Republican victory last November; Mr. Siegel collected "The NPR Interviews: 1994," which appeared last fall and includes the best of 1993 from Richard Avedon to Archbishop Desmond Tutu. And in "The Sound and the Story: NPR and the Art of Radio," Thomas Looker, a producer who has worked as a writer and reporter for NPR, goes into the studios for a meticulous examination of the personalities and processes that have revived radio's artistry, once lost beneath the gloss of television.
The most telling message of all three books is not addressed explicitly, but for anyone with the patience to read attentively, it reverberates throughout the texts of the broadcasts. It is this: The liberal political bias that some conservatives imagine simply isn't there. Nor is there any accommodation to the White House or to Congress, no matter what the party in power.
"Listening to America" includes a prescient and devastating report by Mara Liasson on the candidate Bill Clinton's tendency to shift positions -- an early indication of his inability to stand by difficult decisions. There are transcripts of stories that fainter hearts, dependent on government funding, might have shunned: Nina Totenberg's scoop (along with Newsday) on Anita Hill's charges against Clarence Thomas, Daniel Zwerdling's vivid account of the dissembling that led to the space shuttle Challenger's explosion, Brenda Wilson's caustic description of the opulence of the Reagan inaugural celebrations. "The poor, if they attended, were in disguise," she remarked.
In a foreword to "Listening to America," Bill Buzenberg, vice president for news at the network, rebuts the myth that NPR's audience consists of mostly well-to-do liberals. Polling, he says, shows that just over half of NPR listeners hold only a high school diploma and almost a third have college degrees. Nearly half have household incomes of less than $40,000. Just over one-third describe themselves as conservatives, just under one-third as liberals, and the rest are middle-of-the-road.
Perceived distortions by NPR are not political, Mr. Looker writes in "The Sound and the Story." They are created by the mechanics of technology and news gathering. "Experts" who are chosen for interviews are those with "particular verbal skills," Mr. Looker observes. "A whole range of ideas and opinions -- a vast region of experience and understanding -- eludes articulation in a two- or three-minute exchange, in the case of television, or a four- or five-minute presentation, in the case of NPR. Typically, discussions that add historical perspective or that argue more than two or three alternatives to a question will not fit into such shortened frameworks."
THE real struggle at NPR, Mr. Looker notes, is between journalism and art -- between the growing trend toward harder news and the more reflective use of sound to conjure up a sense of scene. Here, fine radio can be as rewarding as literature, for the listener must work with his imagination, in which "received language and sound mingle with inner speech; each individual consciousness tumbles through pirouettes of metaphor and meaning . . . achieving a special kind of intimate knowledge."
Newt Gingrich ought to add these books to the occasional reading list that he distributes among colleagues, but he won't. They would muddy the conservatives' purity of argument in the eternal American debate over how much government we should tolerate.
This country has always nurtured a healthy distrust of government, which can be good for democracy unless taken to the extreme by bomb-making militias. "Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness," Thomas Paine wrote a couple of centuries ago. "Society in every state is a blessing, but government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one." With that as ideological background, NPR emerges as a remarkable model of government's creative interaction with "society." It's too bad that none of these books examine how this is accomplished. Since NPR works better in radio than private enterprise does, it challenges some venerable American doctrine and needs to be preserved.

HEADLINE: PRESENT SHOCK

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS; Claudia Dreifus, a contributing writer for the Magazine, has interviewed the Dalai Lama, Joycelyn Elders and John Shalikashvili in these pages.

 BODY:
WHEN NEWT GINGRICH WAS elected Speaker of the House last December, one of his first moves was to give his fellow Representatives a required reading list that included the Federalist Papers, the Declaration of Independence and "Creating a New Civilization" by Alvin and Heidi Toffler. Not long afterward, Turner Publishing announced the mass-market release of that book -- the Tofflers' 11th -- with a foreword by Gingrich.
For the Tofflers, futurist authors who for three decades have been forecasting the ways computer technology would change society, Gingrich's endorsement was a career-reviver. Though they had published best sellers in 1970 ("Future Shock") and 1980 ("The Third Wave") and though their ideas were regularly solicited by Prime Ministers and industrialists from Singapore to Stuttgart, Alvin, 66, and Heidi, 65, had become marginal figures in American intellectual circles. 
 "If you're not writing gobbledygook that ordinary readers choke on, you're not regarded as 'serious,' " complains Alvin, sitting in the couple's spartan Los Angeles office. Heidi adds that with Gingrich's help, "a public discussion on the future has been launched. Our publishers are reissuing a lot of our books, and people are buying and reading them."
Talk to one Toffler privately and the other will phone -- to make additional points for the interview, to make lunch plans, dinner plans, updates on the lunch and dinner plans, and so forth. The First Couple of the Future are not long out of touch. Interview one Toffler separately and tales of the other will fill the conversation. The Tofflers have been married 45 years and like many long-married couples, they've spent decades working out the knots of togetherness. Heidi, outspoken in private, often steps back when Alvin is around. Alvin, in turn, accepts Heidi's smoking and her strong opinions. They often fight and argue, but seem to do so without real anger. It's more an exercise they find challenging, and perhaps even fun.
 
Q: One of your critics, former Secretary of Education, William Bennett, recently said, if the Tofflers are so smart about the future, why don't they play the stock market instead of write their books. O.K., Al and Heidi, why don't you?
ALVIN: Two points. One, his statement reveals an inordinate focus on money that says something about his values. Secondly, this is an uninformed commonplace attack on futurism, on the assumption that futurists claim to know the future. Actually, we always say that . . . .
HEIDI: . . . . Nobody knows the future. Including Bill Bennett! Listen, we don't even know the man. He seems to be saying that to write books just to expound ideas is a waste of time -- the only valid reason is to make money. I mean, compared to his enormous best seller, which earned millions, he must feel we shouldn't waste our time!

ALVIN: I don't think the issue is Bennett. I think it's a sneering attitude, held widely, about people who think about the future. It's a total misunderstanding of the functions of futurism.

Q: Explain what futurists do.
ALVIN: What Heidi and I do is look for connections between events, connections that make patterns. We are pattern detectors. We think of change not in terms of Right and Left, but in terms of a multiplicity of forces interacting. Thus: technology has a major effect. So do changes in family structure and education. What you have is a whole series of forces impacting on our lives, forces that have different time frames.
Now, all of us are futurists. We all make assumptions about what is going to happen after this moment. The difference between us and others is that most people make these suppositions unconsciously. We do it deliberately -- and build models. Our batting average has been better than most. In "Future Shock" we talked about how cloning and new birth technologies were creating new moral dilemmas, about the coming of cable television, about the workplace moving into the home. We also talked in that book about something, which was in those days called EVR, and which you now know as the VCR.

Q: So, to take your example, in the late 1960's you saw a prototype for the VCR and you asked, "How will this change our lives?"
ALVIN: Right. I had seen it. And we asked, "What will it do, what are the social effects?" Our guess was that it would help desynchronize society. The VCR meant you don't have to watch the same thing at the same hour that ABC, CBS or NBC chooses to transmit it. You can watch the 6 o'clock news at midnight.

Q: What are some changes you see on the horizon now?
ALVIN: Genetically altered agriculture. What that will mean is the customization of agricultural products, and the ability to grow food in parts of the world now considered non-arable. The ability to tailor crops to local climatic and soil conditions may make the difference between hunger and survival.
I also think we will face a crisis in eugenics. Give a totalitarian government the advanced tools made possible by the biological revolution, and we can see a world of competing eugenic strategies as arrogant regimes play God with future generations.
Virtual reality points to a boundless capacity for deception. Not simply by governments or corporations, but by hostile individuals acting on each other. We can do this today, but we are increasing the sophistication of deception faster than the technology of verification.
The consequence of that is the end of truth. The dark side of the information technology explosion is that it will breed a population that believes nothing and, perhaps even more dangerous, a population ready to believe only one "truth" fanatically and willing to kill for it.

Q: Have you ever been screamingly wrong in any of your forecasts?
ALVIN: Sure. In forecasting a throwaway society, we said people would wear paper clothes. We were right about the throwaway society, but paper clothing never caught on.

GENETIC WARFARE

Q: Before going further, would you explain the keystone to your books, your Third Wave theory of history?
ALVIN: We believe that the most basic of all changes in human social organization have been the result of three processes. Starting 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, agriculture was invented in the Middle East -- probably by a woman. That's the First Wave. Roughly 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution triggered a Second Wave of change. Brute-force technologies amplified human and animal muscle power and gave rise to an urban, factory-centered way of life. Sometime after World War II, a gigantic Third Wave began transforming the planet, based on tools that amplify mind rather than muscle. The Third Wave is bigger, deeper and faster than the other two. This is the civilization of the computer, the satellite and Internet.
But this change is not just a matter of technology. It's also of family styles, culture, politics and the structure of social organizations. If the Industrial Revolution gave us mass production, mass consumption, mass media, mass education -- the Third Wave reverses the direction: customized production, micro markets, infinite channels of communications, heterogeneous family styles, and instead of mass political movements, we see thousands of single issue grouplets.

Q: What makes you so unafraid of the future?
HEIDI: Who says we're unafraid? There are a lot of things that can happen out of the blue. The amount of damage that can be done by a small group, or by an accident, or by a lack of communication is tremendous.
ALVIN: Also, there will be massive dislocations. Just like at the time of the Industrial Revolution. And this current change is even bigger, moving faster and covering more of the planet. So there will be a lot of social upheaval. There are terrifying pieces to the future. Race-specific weaponry. You can zero in on ethnically linked genetic characteristics and target those who carry them. This is genetic warfare, a modern version of giving the Indians infected blankets. Terrifying. Absolutely.
People who think we are blindly optimistic have us confused with John Naisbitt -- who is. If you read our work, you will see an underlying melody which is bittersweet. Life is a mix of events and forces and processes that have diverse consequences. Some will look good to us, but our grandchildren will hate them. Others will look bad, but they will have a side effect that produces wonderful things.

Q: Was the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City in any way related to dislocations you've been forecasting?
ALVIN: It didn't surprise us. In 1975, in a book "The Eco-Spasm Report," we actually talked about private armies and paramilitary groups. In, "War and Anti-War," we looked to the danger of electronic terrorism. The kind of terrorism we've seen until now is no different from that described by Joseph Conrad in his novel "The Secret Agent," published in 1907. Today's terrorists are technological klutzes compared to what's coming. New methods will soon be available. Intelligence experts know that there are probably 10 crucial electronic nodes in our society, which if struck could literally shut America down. A terrorist could shut down the Federal Reserve computers if he attacked those computers with an appropriate virus, and spread financial chaos.
The fact that there are now paramilitary groups around the country reflects intense alienation, linked to paranoid theories of history -- and intensified by millennialism. My hunch is that we'll see a proliferation of political and religious sects, some of them armed with weapons of mass destruction that go far beyond fertilizer bombs.

MEETING NEWT

Q: When did you first meet your pal Newt Gingrich?
ALVIN: I always thought it was in 1975. But recently, he reminded me that we had met earlier, in 1971 or 1972. I had given a speech in Chicago after "Future Shock" came out. And he had flown up from Georgia, where he was a young professor, to hear me. He was obviously bright and anyone who took the trouble to fly all the way from Georgia for my speech was obviously . . . [laughs] a man of impeccable judgment.
Then in 1975, at the initiative of some Democrats, we organized a seminar in the Senate, the Conference on Anticipatory Democracy. This is where we argued that Congress was a particularly anti-future place. Newt came to this. Later, he organized the Conservative Opportunity Society and he invited us on occasion to speak to them. There were times when he and his wife, Marianne would come to New York and stay at our place. There were times when I would go to Washington and stay at his.
It's a great fascination to people that we're friends with Newt Gingrich. But it is totally neglected that we talk to the Democrats, too. Some of Newt's ideas, we disagree with strongly -- prayer in the school, family values, the Christian Right. We are not Newt Gingrich. Newt Gingrich is not Toffler. Can we put that in caps? NEWT GINGRICH IS NOT TOFFLER! We are friends who think together and very often disagree. However, he does want to move in directions we think vitally important. We do think that de-bureaucratization and de-centralization and a weakening of Washington and a dispersal of power downward is where we must go.

Q: Have your lives changed much since Gingrich put your works on the required reading list for Congressmen?
ALVIN: The phone hasn't stopped ringing. The dominant reaction has not been to our work, but to Gingrich. In today's society, Gingrich is a lightning rod. We are perceived to be standing next to the lightning rod.

HEIDI: And we've struggled for 30 years to get our ideas recognized. And they are, everywhere else in the world. They aren't here. It's too big a country. I think also we don't have a tradition in this country of revering the intellectual. This is why Hemingway and the others were expatriates.

Q: In Washington, a lot of important Republicans are upset that you are so close to their man.
ALVIN: I'm sure that's true. And the further right you go, the more true it is. We're not Republicans -- so they're not keen on our having any intellectual influence on their leader.
HEIDI: One of the things Newt said when we first became friendly was, "Look, you're going to agree on 80 percent of anything I say, and detest the other 20 percent." But you know what? I can't think of a single friend that isn't true of!
ALVIN: Besides, we cannot agree with 100 percent of anybody's view. We have friends whose ideas we detest, absolutely. It may shock some of your readers, but we once spent three hours with Nicolae Ceausescu. We have spent lots of time with world leaders whose ideas were thoroughly detestable. You can learn from ideas you detest.

WHO'S BRILLIANT?
 
Q: Heidi, people who've interviewed you say that you're more interesting when Al isn't around. Is that true?
HEIDI: Oh, it's hard when we are together because Al wants to be liked more than I do. Al doesn't feel as strongly about things as I. And maybe that's one of the reasons why Al and I have such a good partnership. Somebody once said that when I'm talking, Al is listening very raptly -- as if he's hearing it for the first time. That's because Al never knows what I'm going to say. I pretty much know what Al is going to say. Newt and I are more similar in temperament, in strength of conviction. Al is a Libra, he's more balanced and less of a social animal. I'm a Leo, an individual.

Q: How did this Libra and this Leo get together?
ALVIN: At N.Y.U. This was the late 1940's. I had a very close friend, now a world-famous scientist, who was dating a young woman. And she had a friend who was Heidi. I had come back from the South where I gone to register voters for the Progressive Party. I went to the campus and there was Heidi, and that was it.

Q: What attracted you?
ALVIN: She was smart, beautiful and she paid attention to me. From the beginning, we argued about everything. It's part of the creative tension between us. She will say something, I will attack it almost instantly. I will say something, she will give me hell. We'll do that till we sort out our views.

Q: Heidi, what was your first impression of Al?
HEIDI: An air person -- somebody who was up there. After we met, Al worked at a bookstore. The day after he got paid, the money was gone -- he bought books with it. I had to supply him with lunch and carfare. I was supporting Al from the day I met him!

Q: Does being married make for greater efficiency in futurizing?
ALVIN: Oh, I don't know if it's incredibly efficient. We work hard. We're a one-family think tank, an "electronic cottage," a term we invented in "The Third Wave." There is no line that I write that we haven't discussed. I do the writing. Heidi can write. But she doesn't enjoy it. The thinking, the organizing, the structuring and the outlining we've always done together.
HEIDI: We talk to each other in shorthand. After all these years together, we're like those comics who give punch lines and everybody laughs because they already know the joke.

Q: But what happens to your writing when you fight?
HEIDI: If it's about something intellectual, we keep arguing, trying to convince each other. . . .
ALVIN: No, it's simple. Heidi says, "You're a moron." Now, if the argument is about the kinds of things most couples fight over -- one person is neat and the other one is a slob -- those are the things that can really make you angry.

Q: Heidi, how do you feel when people dismiss your contribution to the books you two have written because you're merely "The Wife?"
HEIDI: "Wife" is the worst word in the English language. I remember once we were at a meeting in New Orleans and Al introduced me by saying, "This is my wife and my collaborator." And people looked around for "The Collaborator." "The Wife" couldn't be that. There had to be another person. It bothers me when men come up to me and say, "We just want to tell you how wonderful we think your husband is, giving you all this credit." What they're really saying is, "I wish I could be as generous with my wife -- you obviously don't merit it."

Q: Your feminism must give you some problems in conservative circles. For instance, last January while both of you were speaking at a Washington conference, Arianna Huffington accused Heidi of "Second Wave" thinking because of her advocacy of women in politics.
HEIDI: Oh, I don't think she even knows what Second Wave means! To her, it's just an epithet. She was talking about the Republican Party and volunteerism. I said the Republican Party doesn't have much of a future unless it has more candidates who are black, minority and women. And she said this was a Second Wave idea -- it wasn't important to hold office. So I said, "Women have volunteered for hundreds of years and they got nothing for it." I didn't say, "Why did her husband dump $28 million down the drain, if it wasn't important to be in the Senate?"

Q: Huffington's said to be quite brilliant.
HEIDI: To me, she is not brilliant. But I haven't heard a single woman say she's brilliant, so maybe that says something. I think, also, we have tendencies to believe that if somebody was a Rhodes scholar or went to Cambridge she has to be brilliant.
ALVIN: Well, look at Clinton. He attended Oxford. I don't think he's brilliant. He's intelligent, quick, articulate. But I have not heard a single original or profound idea out of Clinton. Not that I expect a lot from politicians during political discourse. Maybe if I sat down in a room with Clinton, and we spent a few hours talking, my image of him could change entirely.

Q: Are there any Democrats you like?
ALVIN: Tom Daschle and Al Gore. I think Gore is probably the best thing that the Democrats have, but his hands are tied. On reinventing government, he's all right, but tepid. The changes he'd like to make, he cannot. The Democrats need the Civil Service unions and their votes -- and that effectively blocks the Democrats who wish to reinvent government. The idea of privatizing shakes those unions.
HEIDI: We try to talk to Democrats about our ideas. I remember, some years ago, Al spoke at a Democratic midyear policy convention. On the platform was the then-head of the U.A.W., Leonard Woodcock. I sat with Woodcock's lawyer. When Al finished, I said to the lawyer, "Would it be possible to get together with you and Woodcock to talk?" And he turned to me and said: "Why would we want to do that? I didn't understand a word your husband said."

WHO'S THIRD WAVE?

Q: What defines a Third Wave person?
HEIDI: A Third Waver understands that there's a profound shift in this country and that knowledge is the key factor in production.
A Third Wave person says: "Teach people how to think. There are no facts. Everything is open to interpretation."

Q: Let's play a game: Who's Third Wave and who's not. What about Bill Gates, Ross Perot, Lee Iacocca, to name three industrial leaders.
HEIDI: Gates? No. I don't think so. I think he's a technician, a programmer. Obviously very shrewd, but I wouldn't characterize him as Third Wave. As for Ross Perot, he doesn't understand that we're moving to a world that's pluralistic. The idea of running this country like a business, it's insanity. Finally, Iacocca. Oh, God, no. His claim to fame was that he got the Government to lend Chrysler all that money. But his view of the world is Second Wave. He's one of the people who're responsible for the American automobile industry being overtaken by the Japanese and the Germans.

Q: As a young person, were you influenced by science fiction writing?
ALVIN: More by movies about scientists. I've been a movie buff since I was a kid and it really troubles me that the stuff coming out of Hollywood now is absolutely . . . sick-making. "Dumb and Dumber"? At the time, when society needs to move from a brute force to a brain force economy, we put out this [expletive] that teaches kids that being stupid is O.K.
Now, "Forrest Gump" was different. I don't think it popularizes stupidity. What it's doing is answering "The Bell Curve." It says that life is not just I.Q. That there are other virtues and sometimes there is a kind of wisdom that comes up in the strangest places.
HEIDI: I think one of the reasons we see all of these movies about dumbness and nothingness is that people feel overloaded by information. Their knee-jerk reaction is, "I can't keep up, so let's glorify stupidity."

Q: What was your take on "Jurassic Park"?
ALVIN: "Jurassic Park" was spectacular in its effects, deleterious in its philosophy. It was essentially science-phobic, depicting science as evil, with only occasional modifying remarks. I think it comes from their hating their math and science courses in college.

Q: Is Newt Gingrich really a Third Wave man?
ALVIN: Well, I believe that Newt picks up on the core of Third Wave ideas. Newt wants to make it easier for people to work at home. He is in favor of continuing to explore space. He has an image of an American society transformed by information and knowledge. And I believe that Newt is not racist and not uncompassionate.
For instance, Newt and the Republicans were regarded as heartless when they made fun of the Democrats' "midnight basketball" provision in the crime bill. Newt made fun of that all over the place. But what I heard Newt say was, "If they had said, 'Let's not have midnight basketball, let's have midnight computers in the black communities,' I would have supported that."

Q: So you didn't find his "Let 'em eat laptops," proposal absurd?
HEIDI: Oh, he caught himself on it the next day. I think Newt was saying that since information is the critical factor today, he doesn't want poor children deprived of access. We were with him and he said: "I think I made a mistake. Because who is going to give them to the kids?" I think this was a wish of his. And so he came up with a centralized solution.

Q: What I find puzzling is that your books forecast a new era of personal freedom, diversity in life styles and tolerance of minorities. Yet, your friend Gingrich rails against gays in the military, single mothers, "counter-cultural" McGovernites.
HEIDI: I think if you sat down with him, you'd find . . . the Speaker was divorced himself and he understands perfectly well. I think when Newt says, "Family Values," he means that we have responsibility. Newt is a tolerant person. If he were against diversity, he would disown his sister, who is gay. When a friend of his, a member of Congress, came out of the closet, a lot of people shunned him. Newt didn't.

Q: You've said in other interviews that people try to get at Newt by getting at you?
HEIDI: That's the downside. The upside is that with Newt's help a public discussion of the Third Wave has been launched.
ALVIN: So our ideas are beginning to be part of public discourse as they were not in the past. We're pleased -- not just as Mr. William Bennett might say, "because it means royalties." The important thing is that the ideas are going to be discussed.
HEIDI: The thing we want people to know is that we're not conservatives. We're not Republicans. We're not Democrats. We are authors!
ALVIN: Sometimes I wonder if we're Tofflerites.

HEADLINE: ART;
At Fifth Ave. and 104th St., Latino Cultures Intersect

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
THE CRAMPED STAFF OFFICES of El Museo del Barrio are already hitting summer temperatures on a mild spring day. Susana Torruella Leval leads the way to a large empty room on the third floor of the hulking 1921 building -- once an orphanage -- that the museum calls home. The windows overlook the elegant Conservatory Gardens in Central Park at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street in Manhattan, but the walls need a paint job, life-size puppets are propped in the corners and children shout in the courtyard below.
This has been a banner year for the museum. It celebrated its 25th anniversary and promoted Ms. Leval, 51, from chief curator to director. She oversaw the completion of a $400,000 refurbishing of the galleries and organized three ambitious thematic exhibitions of Latino art, which have proved to be the biggest draws in its history. The third and best of them, "Reaffirming Spirituality," is on view through Aug. 16. 
 But there are problems. "Economically, it's a hard time for museums our size," Ms. Leval says of her institution, which drew 19,000 visitors during the last year and has a current annual budget of $1.3 million. "The anniversary shows have been our equivalent of blockbusters, but given the prognosis for arts funding, the next year will be one of retrenching. We'll have a big exhibition of Taino art -- pre-Columbian work in which we have important holdings -- in the fall of 1996. But until then we're going to be looking at our permanent collection." That collection, which contains 8,000 pieces, ranges from wooden Puerto Rican santos, some dating from the 19th century, to contemporary prints, paintings and sculpture from the Caribbean.
El Museo's difficulties are shared by other culturally specific institutions. "We're all struggling so much," says Joan Rosenbaum, director of the Jewish Museum, which, though larger, also caters to a specialized audience. "Even with Susana's great energy and charm, El Museo won't survive without a serious commitment of private and public resources."
Ms. Leval quotes with some amusement the lament of Michel Laclotte, director of the Louvre until last year: "The crowd is the beast that is devouring us."
"I was fascinated to hear a museum director speaking in those terms today when we've been trying to get everybody and their uncle in the door," she says. "We're competing with movies and baseball games; we're being asked to be all things to all people, from the traditional, timeless temple of beauty to a forum where real-world issues are debated. Personally, I see no reason why any institution should have to choose one role over another."
In her view, institutions like El Museo are crucial voices for American racial and ethnic identity. "Many people come to this country to transform themselves, and very often you rediscover the culture of your homeland when you're away from it," she says. "You see it more vividly. I think artists will show all of this in their work in some form or other."
Certainly El Museo has transformed itself over the years. It springs from the civil rights movement of the 60's, years when Puerto Rican artists picketed the Museum of Modern Art, where they felt unrepresented. El Museo started in 1969 in a public-school classroom in East Harlem, then as now one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. It later moved to a series of storefronts, sponsoring free workshops taught by artists who were also community organizers.
The relocation to Fifth Avenue in 1977 was controversial. "One of the great things about El Museo early on was its accessibility," says Ms. Leval. "You could walk right in from the street. The move got us city funding and put us at the top of Museum Mile, but to get from Third Avenue to here -- well, you had to want to get here."
Ms. Leval has the task of making the museum visible while keeping the connection to its original community. A major step in that direction is the planned renovation of a city-owned firehouse at 104th Street and Lexington Avenue, in the heart of El Barrio. "We want a lot of our education programs to take place there, and we want to establish a community gallery where artists can teach workshops in exchange for studio space," she says.
Another contentious issue involves the museum's constituency. "We are El Museo del Barrio, and as long as we have that name, that is our core community," Ms. Leval insists. But the barrio has changed. What began as a Puerto Rican institution now represents many other Hispanic populations -- Dominican, Mexican and Central and South American -- that have come to New York in the past quarter century.
The artist Juan Sanchez, whose highly political art often deals with the Puerto Rican struggle for independence, feels that Ms. Leval is taking El Museo in the right direction. "Susana and I disagree on certain political issues," he says. "But she's maintaining the integrity of an institution started by activists, and she's casting Latin American art in the international perspective, giving it the exposure it deserves." The artists in Ms. Leval's anniversary show range from the Young Lords, Puerto Rican community advocates of the 1970's, to artists of the 80's and 90's like Andres Serrano and the painter Ernesto Pujol.
The artist Marina Gutierrez adds: "In a contentious time, with so much anti-immigrant sentiment, Susana is interested in being positive and welcoming, which is very much part of the culture she comes from."
MS. LEVAL WAS RAISED in Puerto Rico. She came to New York in 1962 and graduated from Manhattanville College, where she studied art. She worked at the National Museum of American Art in Washington and the Museum of Modern Art, started a dissertation on Matisse at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and began publishing critical writing on Latino art. She abandoned the Matisse project to help found the short-lived Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art in SoHo, where Mr. Serrano, among others, had his first New York show in 1985.
"The minute I said to the academic world, 'I am no longer a student; I am a professional, even if I was curator in a place they never heard of,' they started talking to me," she said.
That dialogue has not, in Ms. Leval's opinion, included the mainstream art world. "I visit other museums all the time," she says. "I have to know what's happening out there in order to understand what I'm doing here. But I don't find the traffic moving in the other direction. A lot of art professionals just don't come here."
But she is convinced that specialized institutions will always be of value. "Here, we show art right up to the minute," she says. "Instead of being encyclopedic, we're a place where new languages can be tracked and nurtured. This doesn't mean that all of the new art we show will last, and this is where the false issue of 'quality' comes in. All of us worry about quality all the time. It's easy to see 100 years later, but it has to be a provisional term for contemporary art.
"I'm amazed by people who say that after a certain period -- the good old days -- quality suddenly ended. At the same time, I object to people who won't deal with the question of quality because it has been used so much against people of different ethnicities. I say, don't throw the concept of quality out. Retake it. Make it your own."
Ms. Leval believes that a major aspect of quality is familiarity. "We've all been told that certain art is good, so that's what we look at," she says. "And if you only look at one thing, that's what you'll judge everything by. I think it's enormously hopeful that people are starting to be more open to entering other people's worlds, to seeing how other people define themselves."
She cites as an example the difference between the issue-oriented political art shown in many North American museums and galleries in the past 20 years and the work of the artists who founded El Museo.
"To understand the artists with whom I work, including those who founded El Museo, you have to know that their art isn't just about specific political causes," she says. "Many of these artists are grass-roots cultural activists, teaching kids for free in the neighborhood workshops as if it were still the 60's. Now they're no longer young; they're trying to support families, to fight for housing, to change things on their block and still make their art. Its a different time, but they're living by the tenets they set early on, and that's something I have the highest admiration for. Their lives and their art are of a piece.
"If you understand that view, you stop talking in terms of esthetic right and wrong. I was once watching Pepon Osorio constructing one of his glittering installations. This one included a jeweled chandelier, and I kept referring to the fake pearls. He said to me: 'They're not fake pearls. They're not fake anything. They're plastic pearls. For many people, plastic pearls are what they have and what they want.' Pepon's admonition has stayed with me."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Sublet Space;
Conventional Ideas About Subleasing Are Changing

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to subleasing, three things have seemed almost axiomatic: Short-term sublets are unmarketable; landlords always see sublessors as competitors, not collaborators and sublet tenants only go for bargains.
Well, try to convince the Bank of Boston of the first. It found two tenants to split 20,000 square feet that the bank had under lease for three more years at 2 Penn Plaza, at 33d Street. One sublessee was opening its first New York office; the other was expanding. 
 "Neither wanted to commit for the long term or spend a lot on building their space," said John L. Peters, a Cushman & Wakefield assistant director who handled the deals.
Now try to persuade Arthur Bocchi, who handles leasing at 666 Fifth Avenue, at 53d Street, of the second. He cut the annual rent that his primary tenant, Bertelsmann A.G., was paying on 66,000 square feet by $15 or so a foot -- the amount, after subtracting the cost of customizing the space, that Bertelsmann could have received from a sublessee -- and took the space back himself.
He combined it with other space in the building, and rented the resulting four-floor package, at market rents, for 15 years to the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.
And as for bargain-hunters, ask Alan L. Stein about the 97,220 square feet of lushly appointed space that NBC has out for sublet at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, at 49th Street. NBC, which has decades left on its lease, is asking $45 a square foot. Rockefeller Center is asking for $38 for 80,500 square feet of empty space at 50 Rockefeller Center, a less glitzy building nearby.
"I know of at least one tenant that is talking to both of us," said Mr. Stein, the Center's senior vice president of sales.
Yet another effect of the last recession has been to turn conventional thinking about sublets on its ear. The shortage of both very large and very small blocks of space in prime buildings, coupled with a general reluctance on the part of many business people to lock themselves into long-term leases, has turned even short-term sublets into marketable commodities.
"No one used to take sublets of three or five years seriously, but they certainly do now," said Andrew H. Roos, an executive vice president of Williams Real Estate.
Would-be sublessors are not facing universal good news, of course. The demand for sublease space is nowhere close to exceeding supply. There are about 8 million square feet of sublet space available in Manhattan, nearly 5 million square feet of it in midtown. Although that's less than one-seventh of the nearly 59 million square feet of total space available, it is enough to put a damper on the entire real estate market.
"Sublets are a depressant on the market in that if there were no sublet space, rents would be higher," said H. Henry Elghanayan, chairman of Rockrose Development, which owns Carnegie Hall Tower, at 152 West 57th Street.
SINCE few landlords include sublet space when they report their vacancy rates, an "occupied" building can actually be awash in space. The brokerage firm Wharton Property Advisors recently gathered some fairly eye-opening statistics on that point. The firm notes that 90 Park Avenue, at 40th Street, is generally considered a full building, yet 28 percent of its space is available for sublet. At 750 Lexington Avenue, at 59th Street, a 1 percent vacancy rate becomes 11 percent, when adjusted for sublet space. At 1 Battery Park Plaza, on Bridge Street, a 4 percent vacancy rate becomes 12 percent when adjusted for sublet space.
"There's a lot more space out there than meets the eye, and that's a good negotiating tool when you are looking to rent direct space," said Ruth Colp, a Wharton partner.
In some size categories, though, there is little space of any kind, so sublessors and landlords can happily coexist without cannibalizing each other. According to Robert L. Billingsley, a partner in the brokerage Colliers ABR, there are only 27 contiguous spaces of 100,000 square feet or more available in prime buildings right now; four of them are sublets.
Small spaces, while certainly more plentiful, have grown scarce as well.
"Decent space of 5,000 to 20,000 square feet has gotten so hard to find that I've actually had potential sublessees compete with each other for sublet space," said William Hedman, a senior managing director at the Edward S. Gordon real estate firm.
In fact, space-hungry tenants continue to chase space that no longer exists. Last year a tenant at 535 Madison Avenue, at 54th Street, asked Mr. Hedman to find a sublessee for 7,700 square feet. Soon after, the primary tenant decided to keep the space.
"I'm still getting constant calls on that space, even though I haven't marketed it in eight months," Mr. Hedman said.
Nor are potential sublessees insisting on basement prices. Lloyd Lynford, president of REIS Reports, which tracks real estate trends, said that sublet rents averaged about 94.4 percent of direct space rents -- a bargain, maybe, but not a steal.
"This time around, no one is holding a fire sale," said Mr. Roos of Williams. Barry Gosin, Newmark Real Estate's chief executive, agrees. "Tenants aren't yet unloading their space," he said. "If they do, it will have a real impact on market rents."
Actually, many primary tenants may never have to deeply discount their space. Mr. Hedman said he had four tenants vying for about 5,600 square feet of park-view sublet space at 9 West 57th Street. Although the space will undoubtedly rent for less than comparable direct space, "it looks like we'll get $2 or $4 a foot more than we were asking six months ago," he said.
Space shortages are not all that is fueling the sublet market. The proverbial "flight to quality" is helping, too. Brokers report sizable interest from law firms and others looking to trade up neighborhoods. "Firms that are in secondary locations are really looking into Park Avenue sublets now," said James J. De Luca, an assistant director at Cushman & Wakefield.
AND the economic downturn has taken the cockiness out of many executives and small-business owners. Many trust the nascent economic recovery enough to start that business they have been talking about, or to open that branch office in New York. But, with so many of their recession-inflicted wounds just barely healed, they no longer take their long-term success as a given.
Thus, they no longer view a five-year sublease on as-is space as too short, or as compromising their concept of the ideal office; rather, they see it as giving them the flexibility to grow, contract, leave town, trade up or down in space -- in other words, to be controlled by their primary business's performance and prospects, not by their long-term commitment to expensively appointed office space.
Last year the Du Pont Company's fibers group took a five-year sublet for 18,000 square feet at 1430 Broadway, at 40th Street. "Du Pont simply does not know what this business will look like five years from now," said Mr. Roos, who represented Du Pont.
At 1185 Avenue of the Americas, at 47th Street, the EDS Corporation, a computer services firm, just sublet 2,500 square feet of as-is space for two years.
"That would have been unthinkable in the past, when tenants always preferred nicelybuilt-out, long term space," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W&M Properties, which manages the building.
In contrast, some long-term sublets are languishing. Randy Kohana, a senior managing director at the brokerage Julien J. Studley, has been seeking sublessees for seven floors that The Gap has under lease at 3 East 54th Street. "The lease has 11 1/2 years to go, and that long term has become a drawback," Mr. Kohana said. He said he finally had one floor leased, and was close to leasing four others, all to subtenants who insisted on assurance that, if they did want to leave after a few years, they would be able to seek sublessees of their own.
The competition from sublet space has caused many landlords to take the if-you-can't-lick-them-join-them approach. Many are agreeing to extend leases for those sublessees that do want a longer term, figuring that this way, they will save the cost of marketing the space and building it for a new tenant when the sublease runs out. And sometimes landlords will even help potential sublessors advertise that willingness.
Williams Real Estate, which is trying to find a sublessee for about 100,000 square feet of Digital Equipment's space at 2 Penn Plaza, recently held a broker's breakfast to promote the space. Representatives of the Mendik Organization, which owns the building, came to tell brokers that they would entertain proposals to extend the lease beyond the three years remaining.
"A couple of years ago you couldn't get a landlord to help you repackage the stub end of a lease like that," Mr. Roos said.

ART TREASURE TOUR
The Connecticut Department of Economic Development has developed a fine arts project aimed at promoting tourism and increasing local interest in the state's considerable treasury of art.
The department has outlined a journey from Greenwich to New London, Storrs, Hartford, other cities and back to Greenwich, with stops at 11 museums along the way in which Impressionist paintings are an important part of the collection.
Details of the Connecticut Impressionist Art Trail are contained in a pamphlet that describes each museum, the artists represented there and something about the town, its restaurants, accommodations, and the scenes that inspired Impressionist paintings.
Group tour information may be obtained by calling 800-879-4222. For other information or to obtain a pamphlet, call the nearest Convention and Visitors Bureau located in Fairfield County, New Haven, Mystic, Northeastern Connecticut, Hartford or Central Connecticut.
The museums listed are the Bruce Museum and Bush-Holley House in Greenwich, Weir Farm in Wilton, the Yale Art Gallery in New Haven, the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London, the William Benton Museum at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co. and the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, the New Britain Museum of American Art, and the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington.
Prominently featured are works of the American Impressionists including Childe Hassam, John Twachtman, Theodore Robinson, J. Alden Weir, Mary Cassatt, Leonard Ochtman, William Chadwick, Willard Metcalf and Henry Ward Ranger. But the French Impressionists are also represented along with works by American artists who followed other styles, such as Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer and George Bellows.
 
CONCERTS FOR A ZOO
 To raise money for the Professor Beardsley Research Station, the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport is offering a series of summer concerts on Saturday at 7 P.M., rain or shine, with Hugh Blumenfeld. The singer-songwriter-guitarist has recorded several award-winning albums since receiving a doctorate in poetry from New York University. Currently he is an assistant professor of English at Eastern Connecticut State University. Admission is $7, free for children under 5.
On July 15, July 29 and August 12, the Five Chinese Brothers, Patty Larkin, and The Nields will perform, respectively, all starting at 7 P.M. with the same $7 admission charge. The number for reservations is 331-1557.
The research station, for which a structure exists but needs extensive renovation, will serve as a special educational center for children. It will replicate the various habitats that exotic zoo animals come from, with walls of canvas, thatch and bamboo, cargo boxes and other trappings of expeditions. There will be a raised platform for the professor's desk, lab counters with microscopes, artifacts, pillows to sit on that are covered with ethnic fabrics, and the air will be scented with spices. The project is expected to be completed over the next year at a cost of $50,000.
The 33-acre zoo is open daily from 9 to 4 at Noble Avenue, featuring North and South American animals. It also contains a farmyard with goats, rabbits, poultry and a cow, and participates in the Species Survival Plan of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. The Siberian tiger, red wolf and golden lion tamarin are its current survival plan animals.
 
DARIEN HORSE SHOW
 One of New England's grandest horse shows gets under way for its 66th year on Monday at the Ox Ridge Hunt Club in Darien. Competitions are scheduled through Sunday, beginning daily at 8 A.M. and continuing until the sun goes down. Throughout the week more than 100 classes of hunter, jumper and equitation events will be held.
Highlighting the event is the $35,000 Ox Ridge Grand Prix, an official U.S. Equestrian Team regional show jumping championshop beginning at 1 P.M. on Sunday. Among the competitors will be Lise Quintero, the defending champion; and Chris Kappler, 1993 Ox Ridge grand champion, both of whom represented the United States at the Volvo Show Jumping World Cup in Sweden two months ago.
Also participating will be Joe Fargis, Olympic Gold Medalist, and a number of world-class competitors and international champions.
A large Boutique Garden will have outdoor accessories and indoor collectibles for sale, and on Friday from 5 to 8 P.M. a Country Fair will be held, offering Mediterranean and California-style foods, live music to dance by, the magician Amazing Andy, pony rides, a petting zoo, face painting, and games. Admission will be $4.
Horse show admission will be free on Monday. Tuesday through Friday the charge will be $5 per car, on Saturday it will be $5 for adults, $3 for children over 5 and people 65 and older. Sunday's admission will be $7 for adults, $5 for children and the elderly. For more information, the number is 655-2559.

Goethals Plan Would Give Commuters More Elbow Room

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The overloaded Goethals Bridge may soon have a twin.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has proposed a $350 million structure parallel to and south of the Goethals between Elizabeth and Staten Island. That would allow westbound traffic to traverse the existing bridge; eastbound traffic would use the new one. 
 The deal is not complete, however. Its 1,600-page draft environmental impact statement was released just two weeks ago. But if things go as planned, the bridge could be in use by 2001 and serve as the first additional New Jersey-Staten Island link in more than 60 years, joining the Goethals, the Outerbridge Crossing and the Bayonne Bridge.
That could be a big if. The plan has cemented opposition from transportation advocates and Staten Island residents, who complain that the result will be more congestion and less money for mass transit.
"This has no economic benefit to Staten Island," said John A. Fusco, a Staten Island member of the New York City Council. Traffic is already heavy, he said, and building a bridge would only add to the borough's traffic problems.
"They just want to collect more tolls and ease traffic out of New Jersey," he said.
That is a position that Kathleen A. Donovan, chairwoman of the board of the Port Authority, said she understood, but rejected. "We're not doing this in a vacuum," she said. "We're doing it because people are coming to us and saying they want better, safer access."
The project would be the first New Jersey-Staten Island connection since the Bayonne Bridge was built in 1931, and the first river crossing since the lower deck of the George Washington Bridge was built in 1966.
There is little doubt the narrow Goethals (pronounced GOTH-els) -- built in 1928 and named after George W. Goethals, builder of the Panama Canal and first consulting engineer of the Port Authority -- is a difficult drive.
The bridge has two 10-foot, shoulderless lanes in each direction, giving motorists who are next to an increasing number of trucks a crowded feeling.
And the number of vehicles is growing: in 1993, 2,924 eastbound vehicles used the bridge each hour during peak times. The maximum capacity is 3,200.
The Port Authority has estimated that if no bridge were to be built, the number would climb to 3,596 vehicles an hour, well over the maximum.
The Port Authority has estimated that if the bridge is built, the number would climb to 4,184 vehicles an hour, but the capacity would increase to 4,900.
Under the proposal, the Port Authority would build a structure south of the existing Goethals Bridge, which connects the Staten Island Expressway on the island's north shore with the New Jersey Turnpike and Routes 1 and 9.
The new bridge would have a smooth rainbow arch, unlike the existing bridge, whose arch resembles a parenthesis on its side. There would be three 12-foot-wide lanes on each bridge, with room for shoulders and rail transit.
The proposal, under environmental review since June 1993, has already cost the Port Authority $20 million, with another $22.7 million earmarked to be spent by 1997, said Peter Ciano, the program manager for the Port Authority's Staten Island Bridges Program. If all the permits are granted on schedule and the governors of New York and New Jersey authorize construction on schedule, work could begin by 1998. For now, tolls are expected to stay at $4 for Staten Island-bound traffic.
But some transportation advocates are hoping that doesn't happen.
They note that the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and Gowanus Expressway are scheduled to undergo major renovations soon, lasting several years. They say the Port Authority should concentrate not on automobiles but on rail freight to ease the New York area's dependence on trucks. Only 5 or 10 percent of all freight is carried by rail and the rest by truck, compared with the national average of about 40 percent rail, said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a nonprofit group in New York.
They also question the Port Authority's commitment to mass transit, especially after the agency's recent announcement that it would abandon plans to build a 22-mile railway between and its airports in Queens.
A better alternative, Mr. Fusco said, would be to build a light rail transit system from Manhattan and Brooklyn through Staten Island to New Jersey. But the Port Authority disagreed, saying there isn't enough demand to support such a system.
There will be public hearings on Tuesday at New Dorp High School in Staten Island and on Thursday at Elizabeth City Hall.

Activities for Children

 BODY:
School's out, or will be soon. What activities do the children at your house have planned for the summer?
 
Sight and Sound
At Imagine Tomorrow, children in groups of eight work on projects that integrate all of the elements of multimedia. They can construct videos with special effects, design computer games with themselves as characters, and watch their ideas come to life as they produce interactive stories. The projects require planning, logic and critical thinking skills. Children schedule their time, outline their ideas, write their script, and plot their games. In addition, they learn how to find information on on-line services and multimedia encyclopedias. The kids are learning and having fun. There are centers inPark Ridge, Madison and Bernardsville, and two more will open this summer, in Denville and Middletown.

Last month, Chatter asked for opinions about the way the news media covers New Jersey.
 
Look to the Shore
We have wonderful restaurants and entertainment down here. There is an abundance of well-received live theater (especially the Henderson Theater in Lincroft, which is currently featuring a new original play by the writing team of Milmore and VanZandt, who have many situation comedy credits to their name, as well as some off-Broadway New York productions) and an active alternative and jazz music scene.
The northern shore communities are anything but summer tourist attractions, and it would be nice to see more reporting on us down here. Also, there is hard news going on in urban areas like Long Branch and Asbury Park, where attempting to rebuild is a daily struggle.
LEE-ANN NIBBLING
Long Branch
 
Covering the Arts
You solicited opinions about the way the news media cover the state. In my view, superbly well except perhaps for the performing arts. There is an explosion of dance events and plans by indigenous regional and touring companies which deserve to be chronicled. Last year I discovered the formation of a performance center and school in upstate New York, at which four New Jersey companies are committed, among others, to presenting seminars, classes and performances. The story has been under-reported everywhere.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Are Good Times Gone For the Funds Industry?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
THIS cannot be a good sign for the mutual fund industry: Jeffrey N. Vinik, who calls the shots for the $44 billion Fidelity Magellan fund -- the biggest fund in the galaxy -- has been reduced to touting his favorite technology stocks at a shopping center shoe store.
Improbable as it may seem, that was the scene one evening last week as several hundred people were shoehorned into the Salvatore Ferragamo boutique at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The multitude came not to buy fine Italian leather goods, but to hear Mr. Vinik's outlook on the stock market and the economy. 
 Although Mr. Vinik can sure draw a crowd, conversations with many of the attendees suggested that they were more interested in his personal working habits and his investment ideas than in buying shares in his -- or any other -- mutual fund.
Applying the contrarian way of thinking so common on Wall Street, anything that becomes too popular, like a high-flying stock, bears some caution, their views suggested. And while fund news and superstar managers still grab headlines, signs abound that individual investors may have had their fill and that the fund industry's growth is slowing markedly.
The most telling sign is that even with stock prices hitting new highs almost daily, the flow of fresh cash into equity funds remains below last year's levels. And that could ultimately affect all investors, because any further decline in cash flows could spell trouble for the aging bull market.
As less cash flows in, fewer new mutual funds are being started. The Investment Company Institute, a fund industry trade group, reports that the total number of funds grew to 5,539 at the end of April, which puts this year's growth at an annual rate of 9 percent, half the growth rate recorded each of the last two years.
At Morningstar Inc. of Chicago, the large fund research and publishing company, revenues will grow only about 5 percent this year, to roughly $33.5 million. That's quite a falloff from last year's 50 percent sales increase and from the 100 percent increases recorded in each of the two previous years.
Fund companies concede that the easy money has been made. "The very rapid growth phase of the mutual fund business is pretty much over," said Roger T. Servison, a managing director at Fidelity who oversees the company's retail marketing and sales. Because individuals tend to invest based on recent performance -- last year wasn't stellar for either stocks or bonds -- and because interest rates on bank deposits have been rising for a year, not as many people have been coming into mutual funds this year, he said.
And while the masses clamoring to meet Mr. Vinik last week expressed plenty of interest in the stock market, mutual funds seemed decidedly out of fashion.
"I own no mutual funds; I only own shares directly," said Gerald Mazzalovo, chief executive of Moda Imports Inc., owner of the Ferragamo emporium, which hosted Mr. Vinik's appearance along with Worth magazine, a financial monthly published by Fidelity's parent company.
"I'm here to get a competitive edge," said Abraham W. Tu, senior portfolio manager at I. A. Rabinowitz & Company, a New York investment bank. "Maybe he'll give some advice, reveal his strategies." But Mr. Tu said he wouldn't be buying shares of Magellan -- or any other fund. "I buy individual stocks," he said. "I go through what the funds are buying and make my picks."
As more and more people become responsible for investing the money in their pension and 401(k) retirement savings programs, mutual funds are likely to remain a big business -- just not as big as once envisioned.
According to the most recent data from the Investment Company Institute, net equity fund sales in April were below the level of a year ago, and fund companies have said that equity sales fell in May from April.
John C. Bogle, founder and chairman of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds, sees an easy explanation. "Once burned, twice shy," he said. "It's extraordinarily true in the bond business, and to a somewhat lesser extent, in the stock fund business." The funds in which investors have recently suffered the most -- bond funds, international equities and small-company aggressive growth funds -- have been the slowest to attract new money, Mr. Bogle said.
Morningstar's experience shows just how quickly circumstances can change.
"We've cut back on marketing quite a bit in response to slowing fund sales," Joe Mansueto, chairman and founder of Morningstar, said in an interview. The number of subscribers to Morningstar's most extensive collection of fund information has fallen from more than 50,000 to close to 40,000, he said.
Part of Morningstar's sales decline might stem from Value Line Inc.'s introduction last year of a less expensive mutual fund guide, which was followed by a cut-rate product from Morningstar. Now, both companies report slower growth.
"The market for that kind of information is certainly not in a rapidly growing mode, as it was two years ago, but it's still a good business," said Stephen Savage, editor of the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey.
Mr. Mansueto insists that for the long term, "we don't see anything out of the ordinary" affecting sales trends. But fewer people are signing up for the company's three-month trial subscriptions, which means fewer become long-term customers.
In addition to a decline in sales growth, paid attendance was down by nearly a quarter, to just over 300 people, at last month's Morningstar Mutual Funds Conference, a gathering of investors and managers in no-load fund companies.
Other companies also have altered plans in response to the declining appetite for mutual fund information. Several potential suitors have talked to Morningstar about buying part or all of the privately held company, but all have passed so far.
One frequently mentioned suitor, Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, began exploring the possibility last year of creating a weekly tabloid just on mutual funds, but those plans appear to be on hold. The company is moving ahead, however, with a mutual fund newswire, aimed at institutions and marketed through its Telerate division.
And at the fund companies themselves, even the most chronically optimistic people hint at some wariness about the future. Taking note of the size of the crowd that turned out to greet him last week, Mr. Vinik compared his apparent popularity to the relatively poor rating these days of President Clinton, and suggested his was the less enviable position. "If Bill Clinton were a stock, I'd buy him," Mr. Vinik said. "Based on this turnout, I hope I'm not a sale."
 
 
 
Working in Peter Lynch's Shadow
 WHAT do people want to know of Jeff Vinik, the accomplished manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund?
 "Do you work as many hours as Peter Lynch did?" asked one eager fan during Mr. Vinik's appearance in New York last week.
 It seems that despite his own admirable record, Mr. Vinik can't escape the specter of his legendary predecessor. While most of the people at Mr. Vinik's publicity party were subscribers to Worth magazine, in which Mr. Lynch writes a column, they seemed fixated on comparing the two men.
 "I don't own Magellan fund because of the change in manager," said Gail Diamond, making clear she was referring not to Mr. Vinik's appointment in July 1992, but to Mr. Lynch's decision to step down in May 1990. (Morris J. Smith ran the fund for those two years in between.) "I didn't think anyone<PP192>could do as good as Peter Lynch."
 Since Mr. Vinik took over, the fund's assets have doubled, recently surpassing $40 billion. This year, Magellan is up 19 percent, and since Mr. Vinik took over, the fund has compiled a 15.6 percent average annual return, according to Lipper Analytical Services. During Mr. Lynch's 13-year reign, the fund's average annual return was 29.2 percent, according to Lipper.
 Mr. Vinik was nonchalant about the comparisons. "Peter was Peter and I'm me," he said after the event. "I'm not trying to beat him or compete with him. I'm just trying to do a great job."
 Perhaps he's doing it more efficiently. "Peter said he worked 80 hours a week," Mr. Vinik said. "I work about 70 hours. So I guess I only work about 85 percent as much."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Recession? Markets See Little To Fear

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Is this economy entering into a recession? If so, it will be one of the least anticipated in Wall Street history.
Last week, Alan Greenspan used the word recession in acknowledging that the economy was slowing a bit faster than expected, but he quickly said a recession would not occur. In that sentiment, he was in accord with the overwhelming Wall Street opinion. Most believe in a soft landing, in which the growth will slow but not stop, and then gradually accelerate again. Those who disagree tend to think that growth will be surprisingly strong. Any respectable contrarian is tempted to think a recession is a sure thing. 
 There has been talk that the bond market's surge this year was a precursor of a recession. The popular image of a bond trader is of someone who loves to see (other) people thrown out of work and thinks a recession is second only to a depression in desirability. So the plunge in 30-year Treasury bond yields from 7.62 percent in early March to 6.5 percent on Tuesday would seem to be an indication of some pleasure.
Then there is the fact that the Federal Funds rate -- the rate the Federal Reserve all but fixes on loans between banks -- remains at 6 percent while, at last week's lows, rates on all government obligations out to seven years were lower than that. We are dangerously near to an inverted yield curve, in which long-term rates are lower than short-term ones. And that is historically a prelude to recession.
But if you delve a bit into the bond market, it is clear that bond traders were no more in a recessionary mood than were stock traders when they pushed the Dow Jones industrial average almost to 4,500.
A recession is not, of course, terrific news for all bond owners. Those who buy corporates and municipals have to confront the issue of credit risk, that is the possibility that they won't be paid because the borrower doesn't have the money. In times of economic worry, bond buyers tend to demand bigger premiums for that risk, but until very recently, there has been little sign of worry. Consider the TED spread, the difference between Treasury bill and Eurodollar rates. It collapsed early this year, and has only begun to rise in the last 10 days.
Or look at Woolworth, which sold bonds at the beginning of this month. It is rated at the lowest possible level better than junk, after a series of reversals. Yet it had to pay just 1.18 percentage points more than was being paid on comparable Treasuries. "That rate factored in a turnaround that we have yet to see," commended Carol Levinson, whose Gimme Credit newsletter monitors the corporate bond market.
At the end of 1993, when there was not much reason to fear a recession, 30-year industrial bonds rated triple-B, the lowest investment grade rating, yielded 7.59 percent, or 1.18 percentage points more than triple-A bonds, according to figures supplied by Ryan Labs. On Wednesday, those triple-B bonds yielded 7.55 percent, almost the same, although the yield on triple-A bonds was significantly higher than it had been. The spread was just 0.56 percentage points.
What is really going on here is a desperate search for yield, with little concern about the economy or the risk of not being paid back. The lessons of 1994, when the bond market tumbled, are rapidly being forgotten, and those of 1990, when bond defaults zoomed, are ancient history.
It is no fun to agree with everyone, but the bet here is that a recession is not on the horizon. Still, the narrow credit spreads appear to be overdone, and the chances are that they are slated to widen.

HEADLINE: The Urban Gollfer

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTINB 

 BODY:
With its verdant fairways and stately trees, Van Cortlandt Golf Course in the northwest Bronx shimmers like a slice of summertime heaven. But here, as on the city's dozen other municipal courses, heaven comes with a decidedly New York inflection.
 Korean grocers arrive before sunrise to get in a round before work, Spanish (including appropriate curse words) is common, and one of the many clubs within the club is made up of black golfers. Homeless people live in a tunnel they have furnished that connects the second and third fairways, and neighborhood children sometimes dart onto the 16th fairway to steal balls. Tournaments are both frequent and maniacal: outings sponsored by nearby Irish bars are outdone only by the police and firefighters' get-togethers, which sometimes degenerate into games of bumper carts. 
 This is big-city golf played in a big-city context. Last year, a contractor illegally dumped tons and tons of construction debris on the 17th fairway, killing 90 trees. Two years ago, a morning threesome arrived at the 14th green to find a dead man dangling from a maple tree. A year or two earlier, a golfer had his cart stolen; he retrieved it a half-mile away and finished the round. Corpses are occasionally found on the opposite side of the lake in front of the clubhouse. Freeways built in the 1950's slice through the course. Low-flying planes drop toward La Guardia Airport like street pigeons.
 But golfers -- a handful in limousines and multitudes on the No. 1 subway line -- keep streaming to Van Cortlandt, which celebrates its centennial this year. Golf reference books confirm that it is the oldest municipal course in the nation, a surprisingly tradition-laden place: its old-fashioned wooden lockers beneath gaping skylights were filmed in the movie "Wall Street" to connote a sort of clubbish timelessness. In January, Golf magazine named Van Cortlandt one of the "golfiest" places in the United States. When the Three Stooges played the course a half-century ago -- an event commemorated by a picture on the clubhouse wall -- they were serious, serious, serious.
 This year has been the busiest at the course in more than a quarter- century. Rounds -- which because of the freeways slicing through the course -- can be 4, 14 or 18 holes -- are running about 60 percent above preseason estimates by the American Golf Corporation, the California-based company that operates Van Cortlandt and six other city courses. Early projections were for 15,000 rounds to have been played by now, far fewer than the actual total of 24,000. In fact, the pace is brisker than in 1969, when a record 55,000 total rounds were played.
Indeed, municipal golf in New York City, which the National Golf Foundation calls one of the country's most golf-deprived areas, is rising like a smartly struck wedge shot. Total rounds played on the 13 city-owned courses last year exceeded 850,000, up from 535,822 in 1980. In part, this is because the city's links are just about the only game in town: the only private golf club in the city is Richmond County Country Club on Staten Island.
 The downside of this popularity: golfers almost always need a reservation to tee off. Reservations cost $2 per player, in addition to greens fees. Seven foursomes are booked an hour, with an eighth slot reserved for walk-ons.
But in a metropolitan region that the golf foundation ranks 289th of 302 areas in per capita golf holes, it is worth the wait to addicted floggers. And the price is surely right: greens fees for city residents at all municipal courses are $15.50 on weekdays and $17.50 on weekends, $6 less than for those without resident cards, which cost $6 a year. By contrast, public courses in Westchester County and New Jersey charge nonresidents at least $35 in greens fees. (Westchester residents, by contrast, pay $12 on weekdays and $15 on Sundays.)
Most important, the convenience offered by many city links is dazzling. "You can be out on the course by 6, done by 9 and back in the city showered and shaved by 9:30. Boom!" said Larry Wasserman, a lawyer preparing to tee off the other morning. "Where else can you do that?"
The 75-acre Van Cortlandt course is in sprawling, 1,146-acre Van Cortlandt Park -- a craggy wonderland of horse trails and old farmhouses, forests and wetlands that was one of the great Bronx parks, along with Bronx Park and Pelham Bay Park, acquired by the city in the late 1880's.
The course was the brainchild of a group of well-to-do golfers in Riverdale, who had hoped to persuade the city to build them a private country club. Instead, the city built a nine-hole public course on a rolling patch of wild carrots and hay at a cost of $624.80. The New York Sun on May 5, 1895, reported, "The park links should be popular with business men, clerks and mechanics, when they learn the benefits of golf."
And so it was. In less than five years, the course was expanded to 18 holes. By 1913, about 700 golfers a week were playing. City officials raced to capitalize on the sport's popularity, building or acquiring 12 other courses by the 1930's. Because of its easy accessibility, Van Cortlandt became the glamour destination for celebrity duffers. Babe Ruth, Joe Louis, Sidney Poitier and Willie Nelson have played there.
But golf's local popularity peaked in the 1950's and 60's, followed by a slide that was accelerated by the city's population decline in the 1970's. The quality of the courses, which were maintained by the Department of Parks and Recreation, sank, too, especially during the fiscal crisis. By the early 1980's, the number of golfers had dropped to half the level of the late 1960's. Greens kept getting smaller because of inadequate maintenance, even though the department work force was widely regarded as bloated.
But in 1979, when Gordon J. Davis, then the Parks Commissioner, suggested selling the course in Forest Park, Queens, he was greeted by a hailstorm of protest from Queens golfers, parks officials said. By the early 80's, the city's golf courses were running $2 million a year in the red. The solution: in 1983, private concessionaires were hired to run them.
This private enterprise approach has turned the city's golf courses around financially; last year, they raised $1.8 million for municipal coffers. Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern calls it one of the earliest and most successful privatization initiatives in city government. "The operation of golf courses," he explained, "was one area not cut out for socialism."
As the private companies took over, attendance climbed. In part, Mr. Stern says, this was because maintenance improved. But it also reflects a rising tide of interest in golf: for the fourth straight year, the number of courses built in the United States has increased, and nearly one of eight Americans now plays golf, according to the National Golf Foundation.
Participation has broadened to include women, who account for 37 percent of the two million Americans taking up the game each year, the golf foundation says, as well as an array of ethnic groups. The number of black and Hispanic golfers is growing, and more and more Japanese and Koreans are enthusiasts of the city's courses.
Public courses, not private clubs, are benefiting from golf's resurgence. The golf foundation reports that the number of public courses has grown by 40 percent over the last 20 years, while private clubs have declined by 8 percent. Fewer than half of the duffers are white-collar professionals, it says, with 40 percent blue-collar or clerical workers. Shouts of "Yo!" are as likely to resound on municipal links as "Fore!" Blue jeans far outnumber knickers.
But even with this growth in interest, it is easier to play on the city's courses than it used to be. In the early 1960's, courses were so congested that golfers would arrive at 2 A.M. at Van Cortlandt and other popular public courses to throw their names in a lottery for tee-off times.
Once a player has teed off, golfers say, he or she is likely to encounter one of the bigger annoyances of the city's courses -- hackers whose plodding play holds up all behind them. Interminably. And, invariably, they do not know enough to let players behind them play through.
A typical comment came from Kirk Michel, an investment banker who likes to play at Van Cortlandt before work. "I tell anyone who's not a golfer to come after 12 on weekends," he said. "Because I don't want them in my way."
But even with its share of novice slowpokes, Van Cortlandt carries a serious look this year, as rain and special centennial grooming have combined to give the course its best appearance in memory. There is fresh sand in the bunkers, and fairways and greens feel like plush carpet.
But the truest charm of the course is in its legends, its characters, its special jokes and gentle breezes. For the old-timers and those who have heard their stories, Titanic Thompson, a legendary golf hustler, is as alive as the rambunctious boys catching bullfrogs at the 12th hole.
This is a public course that staged a Halloween costume tournament five years ago; the Bride of Frankenstein played 18 holes in a wedding gown. It is a place where trees have been planted to commemorate dedicated golfers, some of whom had their ashes strewn over the course.
A recent Monday was a typical day at Van Cortlandt. About 6 A.M., Arty Appell, the 75-year-old short order cook in the clubhouse, was holding court with the regulars, one of whom asked for two eggs on a roll. "I'm too tired," Mr. Appell sighed lazily. "Maybe when you wake up," the regular chirped.
The cook, a scratch (no handicap) golfer and self-acknowledged hustler, makes fun of all sartorial pretensions, accusing a man in plaid shorts of imitating Chi Chi Rodriguez. He points to pictures of Willie Mays and other celebrities over the grill. "I never had an opportunity to beat them out of some of their money," he says with more than a twinge of regret. "But some of my buddies got into a few of their pockets."
Mr. Appell makes it clear that Van Cortlandt does not exactly aspire to be Augusta National. "If the starter says you're going with these or those two guys, you just go and play with them," he says. "It don't make no difference what color or creed or nothing they are."
He tells of his own tournament, among the many held each summer. Usually, the proceeds go to somebody's bachelor party, but no golfing buddy is heading down the aisle this year, so orphans in Ireland will benefit.
Outside the clubhouse, a crowd gathers. The golfers scratch their heads and try to figure out how to help an injured baby skunk, just one example of the wildlife that increasingly roam the course. A family of coyotes regularly visits the fifth green, deer are spotted occasionally and snapping turtles just a tad smaller than Toyotas lurk along the wooden walkway between the ninth hole and 10th tee. Crows, wild turkeys and pheasants are frequently spotted.
A threesome of friends assembles: Vito DiBenedetto, a retired banker; George Innes, a retired transit worker, and Joe Stanton, an unemployed iron worker. At the first tee, they greet the starter, Al Luciano, a retired newspaper delivery man who volunteers in sending golfers to the first tee in return for free greens fees. It was Mr. Luciano whose cart was stolen as he teed off on the 14th hole. He chased it to the Kingsbridge Armory on Jerome Avenue, where he recovered it, though the thief escaped. Mr. Luciano returned to play the final four holes.
The three comrades wave to Andy Rodriguez, who two years ago discovered a dead man who had hanged himself on the hole he was playing, the 14th. Mr. Rodriguez is 84, does not use a cart and plays every day of the year. Behind him are four Korean Air pilots, who keep clubs in a locker and take turns using them during layovers in the city.
On other days, Mr. DiBenedetto, Mr. Innes and Mr. Stanton volunteer as marshals, patrolling the course in an effort to speed up play. Mr. Stanton ticks off the important things for golfers to remember if they hope to avoid a queue of muttering players behind them: Do not wait too long between shots, cut down on practice swings and give up looking for lost balls after a few minutes. "Some of these guys examine their putting lines like they were pros," he groused. "You'd think they were putting for a birdie instead of a 10 or 11."
Golfers keep arriving. There is Tae Chun Ko, a Korean-American, who owns a pizzeria on Madison Avenue and is finally finding time to relax after raising two daughters in a new land. There is Jeff Willbanks, a bartender, who yearns to celebrate his 35th birthday with a 35 for the first nine. And there is Edith Harrington, who lives within walking distance of the course and forgets her troubles when she takes out her clubs.
Maguire Neblett, a 34-year-old Manhattanite, who makes her living styling models' hair, is a good example of golf's growing popularity. She never played until three years ago, and now tees off at Van Cortlandt three times a week. One day a week, she volunteers to tend the gardens around the clubhouse, in return for free golf. The course was where she met a man she may marry. They agree on at least one thing: the first tee would be a great place for the ceremony.
"Golf has become my passion," she said.
Bill Young, by contrast, is a proud emblem of Van Cortlandt's past. He is 80 and cannot play much anymore because of arthritic hands. But he recalls every millisecond of his two holes-in-one at Van Cortlandt, and can look at the course today and visualize the grand old holes, before the Major Deegan Expressway wove weird discombobulations in 1953. Mr. Young recalls the old Scotsmen who gave the course its early flavor, and its first Japanese golfer, Jimmy Yoshita, who came to America in 1919.
Despite Van Cortlandt's relatively short length, he insists it is not easy, not by a long shot. "You think it's a straight putt and it will leak off an inch or two," he said. "There are subtle breaks here and there."
Perhaps the wisest golfer at Van Cortlandt is one of the most talented women who plays there, Way-Sun Oh, a nurse at Columbia University. She says golf is so expensive in her native Korea that the city's public courses "seem like heaven."
She says she has never tried to better her scoring, which is good enough to have won her the club championship at the Mosholu Golf Course, another municipal course in the Bronx. "It just happened," she explained. Her approach to the game is equal parts fatalism and adventure.
"Wherever the ball goes, I enjoy," she says. "A different story starts each time it lands."

How Do the Bulls Think? With a Smile

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It's been a long time since it was a good idea to be bearish on the American stock market. In fact, the market has never before gone this long -- since 1990 -- without a single decline of 10 percent or more.
The following was written by a professional investor who is, as you might suspect after reading it, quite bearish on the stock market. He has been, in his words, "around for more than one market cycle." 
 He has lately lost more than a little money through selling technology stocks short -- that is, betting that they will decline. In fact, tech stocks have been market leaders.
The author titled it, "Things I've Learned in the Last Year." Whether for reasons of modesty or to avoid humiliation, he does not want his name used.
 FLOYD NORRIS
 
A STRONG economy is good for earnings, which is good for stocks.
A weaker economy lowers interest rates, which is good for stocks.
Share repurchase programs shrink the available float, which is good for stocks.
New share issuance raises book value and infuses liquidity, which is good for stocks.
Acquisitions promise synergy, which is good for stocks.
Divestitures rid companies of losers, usually past acquisitions, which is good for stocks.
A weakening dollar increases our competitiveness, which is good for stocks.
A strengthening dollar would encourage foreign investment in the United States, which is good for stocks.
Capital gains tax cuts favor equity over debt, which is good for stocks.
No capital gains tax cuts help reduce the deficit (since no one ever cuts spending), which is good for stocks.
The collapse of Mexican and other developing markets induces American investors to invest their funds in the United States, which is good for stocks.
Recovery in developing markets creates stability, which is good for stocks.
Trade conflicts with Japan show our resolve, which is good for stocks.
Resolution of trade conflicts shows unity, which is good for stocks.
Mutual fund investors, who historically have invested heavily at tops -- as in American and foreign bond funds, biotech funds and emerging market funds -- will be correct in American equity funds, because this time is different.
Mutual fund managers were right to retain the lowest cash reserves in 20 years at a time when stock yields are at a 70-year low.
All-time high price-to-book values, which once were considered signs of market excess, now are deemed irrelevant because huge write-offs have depressed book values. But it is O.K. to ignore the higher earnings that stem from the absence of depreciation from the written-off assets, thereby artificially depressing reported price-earnings ratios.
Fund managers have discovered the perpetual motion machine. Concentrating new investments in stocks one already owns pushes up their price and enhances performance, thereby attracting new money that can be invested in the same stocks, thereby pushing their prices still higher, etc.
The market always mysteriously rises at the end of the day.
Momentum is forever. More analysts recommend Intel at $115 than at $60.
Everyone will know when to sell, and there will be willing buyers at that time.

Is It Time to Refinance? Homeowners, Start Your Calculators

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
AS mortgage rates have fallen the last few months to tantalizingly low levels, many people have begun wondering whether they should refinance.
"We are getting a lot of calls about refinancings, and more activity, too," said Bruce R. Lublin, president of the Homerica Mortgage Corporation in Harrison, N.Y. "If rates fall further or even stay where they are, I can see a little boomlet occurring. It's probably already happening." 
 Preliminary figures for the week ended June 2 showed that 24 percent of the mortgages made nationally were for refinancings, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade group in Washington. That portion has more than doubled in two months.
The refinancing surge, however, is nowhere near the crush in 1992 and 1993, when 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dipped below 7 percent and some adjustable-rate mortgages had initial rates as low as 3 percent. Back then, more than 70 percent of all new mortgages were refinancings.
Although rates are not scraping rock bottom as they were then, they are still low by historic standards and sufficient reason for homeowners to take notice, said Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Butler, N.J. The average adjustable rate is now 5.85 percent, only 1.7 percentage points above its all-time low of 4.15 percent on Oct. 29, 1993. (Adjustable-rate mortgages came to the scene in 1980.) And the fixed rate, at 7.71 percent, is less than 1 percentage point above the 6.87 percent of Oct. 15, 1993 -- the lowest since 1965.
"Rates have also gone down so far, so fast recently that the drop has virtually erased the rise in interest rates that occurred over the past year," Mr. Gumbinger said. The recent high on a fixed-rate loan was 9.41 percent on Dec. 16, whereas adjustable loans peaked a little later, at 6.90 percent on Jan. 20, according to HSH.
In the short term, the percentage of refinancings probably will not go much higher, mainly because many homeowners who took out high-rate loans in the 1980's have already refinanced. A few, however, could not do so in 1992 or 1993 because of credit or other problems, and those people are now jumping at an unexpected second chance.
More common on the refinancing front are homeowners who took out one-year adjustables a couple of years ago and who have watched their rates rise above today's fixed rates.
Thomas and Francine Rinaldi of New Rochelle, N.Y., recently prepaid their one-year adjustable mortgage. Its rate started at 5.25 percent two years ago but was scheduled to hit 8.75 percent on Aug. 1. And the loan could have risen to 10.75 percent next year, because the rate was permitted to rise two percentage points a year and six percentage points over the loan's life.
In its place, the Rinaldis took out a "10-1" mortgage, a hybrid loan that is fixed for 10 years and that adjusts annually thereafter for 20 years. Hybrids, which usually have fixed rates for 5, 7 or 10 years, are technically adjustable loans. Their rates, while higher than on one-year adjustables, are lower than on mortgages fixed for 30 years. The Rinaldis' new loan came in at 8 percent and required no points, or upfront fee.
"We wanted to lock in a lower rate, and also take some money out," said Mr. Rinaldi, a food service equipment salesman who also restores houses. "If we hadn't taken the money out, our payments would have dropped a bit, maybe $50."
The original $155,000 mortgage had $154,000 remaining, but as part of the refinancing, the couple took out $39,000, which they plan to use to buy another house; they also borrowed $6,000 to cover closing costs. With improvements, their two-family home has appreciated in value to $299,000 from the $175,000 paid in 1993. Their new $199,000 mortgage costs $2,052 a month, including taxes and insurance, up from $1,669.
Deciding whether to refinance can be a cumbersome chore. For starters, many of the rules of thumb about when and how to do it have become outdated. The old formula was called "2-2-2," meaning refinancing was practical if borrowers had been in a home at least two years, intended to stay at least two more years and refinanced at a rate at least two points lower than their current mortgage rate. But that applied when people were refinancing from one fixed-rate loan into another fixed-rate loan and when refinancing fees were high.
A couple of calculations now serve as a better guidepost. Homeowners should add up how much they would pay in closing costs, fees and points on a new loan. Then they should figure out how much their monthly payments would drop. (Savings depend on the size of the loan and the interest rate. The payment on a $100,000 mortgage refinanced to 7 percent from 8 percent will decline by $69.70, to $699.21 from $768.91.) By dividing the monthly savings into the total cost, homeowners determine how long it will take for the transaction to pay off -- and then must decide whether they will keep the home that long.
Homeowners taking cash out in a refinancing need to do essentially the reverse. They should calculate how much more they would pay each month and multiply that by how many months they intend to keep the loan. Then they can compare that added cost with the lump sum received.
To make refinancing even more appealing, some lenders are offering hybrid mortgages at what they call "zero cost." In exchange for a fee equal to about three-eighths of a percentage point on the new loan, the borrower pays no points, appraisal fees, document preparation charges, credit report fees or other fees.
For people sitting on a high-rate mortgage or an adjustable that is headed up, it looks like time to get out the calculator.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
This Stock Market Sails a Sea of Calm

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
THE last few weeks on Wall Street may have seemed pretty turbulent to many investors, with the Dow industrial average swinging up -- and down -- by 80 points or more in a single day.
By most measures of volatility, however, 1995 has been fairly typical. And the last three years have been practically placid. This calm makes a future storm more likely, though, and that means investors should think about how to weather it. 
 To be sure, some sectors have been more volatile. Semiconductors, casinos, autos, footwear and computers all had average annual stock price swings of more than 20 percent during at least one of the last three years, according to a recent report by David L. Babson & Company, an investment counselor in Cambridge, Mass. And some stocks have swung that much in a single day. When I.B.M. made its $3.3 billion bid for the Lotus Development Corporation on Monday, for instance, Lotus stock rose nearly 90 percent, to $61.4375.
The broad indexes, however, have not budged nearly as much. During the last 50 years, the average annual range of the high and low on the Standard & Poor's 500 has been about 18 percent, said H. Bradlee Perry, a consultant for Babson. In 1995, though, the spread so far has been only 16 percent. And for 1992, 1993 and 1994, the high and low points deviated only 10 percent, 8 percent and 9 percent, respectively -- the lowest three-year level of volatility in 50 years.
The Dow has been just as quiet. Jeffrey Rubin, an analyst with Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn., noted that the Dow had not closed up or down more than 2 percent on any day this year, and the average spread between the daily highs and lows had been only 1.68 percent for 1995. Since 1980, the average has been 1.90 percent.
What does all this calm mean for the stock market? "Chances are that it is going to get more volatile," Mr. Perry said. "If you were worried about volatility in '92, '93 and '94, you haven't seen anything yet. Just the fact that we have a pretty enthusiastic market right now increases the risk factor of that."
Mr. Perry also said that future volatility could be amplified by the millions of people in mutual funds. These investors, he said, can instantly move in and out of the market with toll-free telephone calls. Then there is the market's tendency to react to news, no matter how arcane. For example, last September the Dow surged 58.55 points -- or almost 1.5 percent -- after a low regional inflation report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, a drop in jobless claims and a rise in business inventories.
Indeed, with 1995 bumpier than the three preceding years, the market may already be leaving the calm behind. For investors, that signals both opportunities and dangers. Mr. Perry said long-term investors should not try to jump in and out of stocks but should stay abreast of volatility "so they don't act irrationally when the pattern changes."
They should also make sure that their stocks are realistically valued. "The most vulnerable stocks in a sharp market downturn are usually those that are the most popular and are overpriced," Mr. Perry said.
And if the market falls, he added, "Investors should consider stepping in and buying bargains."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CONEY ISLAND;
The Blockhead's Final Bow?

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
For 15 years, the Sideshows by the Seashore and the Coney Island Museum, on the Boardwalk at West 12th Street, have offered the boardwalk stroller a chance to see the very last "10-in-1" sideshow in the country. There are an escape artist and a snake charmer and eight other acts, including Mike Wilson, "The World's Most Heavily Tattooed Man," and "The Human Blockhead," who promises to bang nails into his head and "live to laugh and joke about it."
But the sword swallower may well be on the unemployment line this summer, and the Human Blockhead may have to find work in the construction business. Arts funds were withdrawn, the lease has expired and the museum owes $20,000 in rent and is being evicted. 
 And it looks as though McDonald's may be thinking of moving in: agents came to look in May, the same day the eviction papers were served. A spokeswoman, Laura Vega, confirmed that McDonald's was looking at sites in Coney Island, though she did not say where.
"It's kind of ironic," said Dick Zigun, the museum's director. "In helping to gentrify this boardwalk, which was ridden with gangs, arson and violence in the 70's, we actually helped make it safe for places like McDonald's to set up here."
Until recently, Coney Island U.S.A., the nonprofit organization that owns and operates the sideshow and museum, was receiving over $30,000 a year in city, state and Federal grants that helped preserve an almost extinct part of American entertainment history. "P. T. Barnum began sideshows in this country in the 1840's in lower Manhattan," Mr. Zigun said. In the 1860's, they started in Coney Island and grew to their heyday in the 1920's, with the Dreamland Circus Sideshow and its 300 midgets in a Midget City.
Without this aid, Mr. Zigun said, the show cannot go on. "We have a staff of 12, a 45-minute show and a 150-person capacity," he said. "It's still theater, and that is a hard sell in today's world. If we're a wacko arts group, we have to be."
But Sherry Simon, a spokeswoman for the National Endowment for the Arts, said Mr. Zigun's application "did not show sufficient artistic merit and excellence, the two criteria for the grant."
Mr. Zigun says the museum, which also runs the annual Mermaid Parade on the Boardwalk, has plenty of merit. "We've brought honky-tonk chic to the Boardwalk," he said. "That brings tourists, crowds and hipsters, and the neighborhood appreciates it."
Fans can attend a Sideshow of the Stars benefit on June 26 at Irving Plaza. It will be a traditional 10-in-1 sideshow, but with several twists. The actress and model Karen Duffy will be in the Blade Box, and a talk-show host, Jon Stewart, will sit on the belly of Indio -- who will be lying on a bed of nails.
Mr. Zigun hopes to pay the back rent: he says he has no quarrel with the landlord and hopes to regain his lease. And in any case, he doesn't want to just hand over the building, on which he says the government has already spent $120,000. "It is McDonald's that is insensitive to the neighborhood and the art world," he said. "In essence, this has become the freaks from the sideshow against the clown from the hamburger stand."

The Blighted House Next Door

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII

 BODY:
Moline Street in Bellerose is a well-kept block of neat, single-family homes, a picture of residential pride. Then there is the house at number 89-29.
Over the years, the ceiling in the back of the city-owned house had been chewed through by rodents and blown away by wind. The gutters were breeding grounds for pigeons and rodents, whose carcasses were strewn throughout the house. 
 After years of complaints from neighbors, the city Department of Health cleaned up the dilapidated, Colonial-style home two week ago. The city now plans to renovate the home and sell it, but neighbors, angered by the unpleasant memories of filth and what they call municipal ineptitude, want it torn down.
"It's a potential hazard," said Sally Martino-Fisher, the district manager of Community Board 13. Despite the cleanup, neighbors said, a moldy stench still wafts through the cracks and pigeons still flutter about, leaving droppings. That, Ms. Martino-Fisher said, means the house could be a breeding ground for disease, and she contends that it is structurally unsound.
In March, E. Randy Dupree, assistant commissioner of the Department of Health, declared the house a public health hazard." but that declaration was rescinded after the home was cleaned up. The Department of Buildings, which inspected the house on Wednesday, said despite problems -- the bathroom floor is in danger of collapsing into the kitchen, a rear wall is damaged and the chimney is out of plumb -- the house may be safely rehabilitated. And the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which owns the home, said its guidelines call for rehabilitating city-owned properties deemed structurally sound.
"There is a severe shortage of housing in New York City," said Mara Neville, a spokeswoman for the housing agency. "Our policy is that in buildings where they are not structurally unsound, we will try to renovate them so families can live there."
Ms. Neville said the department took over the house in 1990, when the owner died and his daughter could not pay thousands of dollars in back taxes. She said the daughter rented the house from the department and paid rent of about $360 a month until the end of March. Because the woman had been paying rent until then, the department had no authority to order a cleanup, Ms. Neville said, but neighbors said the house had been unoccupied for years.
"H.P.D. inspectors drove by the house all the time and they never get out of the car to go inside to see what it was like," said Patricia Fallacaro, who lives next door. "It has no business owning houses." JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: New Isolationists Weaken America

BYLINE: By Arthur Schlesinger Jr.; Arthur Schlesinger Jr. is professor emeritus in the humanities at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York. This is adapted from the forthcoming issue of Foreign Affairs.

 BODY:
The United States will never -- unless Pat Buchanan, the Republican Presidential candidate, has his way -- return to the isolationism of no "entangling alliances."
 It will continue to accept international political, economic and military commitments unprecedented in its history. It will even enlarge some, as in the curious mania to expand NATO, which would commit United States forces to the defense of Eastern Europe from, presumably, the menace of a Russian Army that cannot even beat Chechnya. 
 But such enlargement hinges on the assumption that other nations will do as we tell them. The isolationist impulse has risen from the grave, and it has taken the new form of unilateralism.
 The Clinton Administration began by basing its foreign policy on the premise that the United States could not solve the world's troubles all by itself. "Many of our most important objectives," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, "cannot be achieved without the cooperation of others." The key to the future, in the Clinton view, was collective action through the building of international institutions and through multilateral diplomacy in the spirit of Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
 But the incentives for international collaboration have faded. The Republicans' capture of Congress gave unilateralism new force and momentum. In a perhaps ill-judged attempt at conciliation, President Clinton issued Presidential Directive 25, which restricted United States participation in collective-security operations and declared that "the United States does not support a standing U.N. army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for participation in U.N. operations."
 Predictably, this retreat failed to appease the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, who promptly accused Mr. Clinton of still cherishing the "multinational fantasy" and of a continued desire "to subordinate the United States to the United Nations." Nor did it appease the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who argued that international organizations too often "reflect a consensus that opposes American interests or does not reflect American principles and ideals."
 The House has already passed a Gingrich-backed bill with the Orwellian title of the National Security Revitalization Act. This bill would cut financial support for current U.N. peacekeeping operations by more than $1 billion and limit the President's ability to approve new peacekeeping missions. The effect, should the bill be enacted, would be to eviscerate the American role in collective security.
 For its part, the Senate has under consideration Mr. Dole's Peace Powers Act, which would amend the U.N. Participation Act of 1945 to give Congress a statutory role in the relationship between the United States and the United Nations. This bill, Mr. Dole tells us, "imposes significant new limits on peacekeeping policies which have jeopardized American interests, squandered American resources and cost lives."
 Among other things, the bill would generally forbid our troops to serve under foreign commanders and, in the words of The Washington Post, "would make it difficult if not impossible for the President to commit U.S. troops to new or expanded U.N. operations or even continue support for ongoing activities."
 "The American people," Mr. Dole says, "will not tolerate American casualties for irresponsible internationalism."
 Sir Nicholas Henderson, the former British Ambassador to Washington, characterizes the situation as "the rejection by the Republicans of the main plank of U.S. foreign policy for the last 50 years." And it is not as if America is at present deeply involved in collective security. The United States stands 20th on the list of nations making troop contributions to U.N. operations, well behind such world powers as Bangladesh, Ghana and Nepal.
 Despite the popular impression that foreign aid is a major charge on the budget, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently reported that the United States, once the world's top aid donor, has cut back its allocation to a mere 0.15 percent of its gross domestic product, placing it last among the 21 industrial nations. If Congress has its way, foreign aid will be cut still further.
 Nor can it be said that this recoil from collective security misrepresents popular sentiment. A public opinion survey by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations and the Gallup Organization shows that, while Americans are still ready to endorse euphonious generalities in support of internationalism, there is a marked drop-off when it comes to committing not just words but money and lives.
 The wave of neo-isolationism draws strength in part from the understandable desire to concentrate on improving things at home -- a desire justified by the neglect of domestic problems during the Reagan-Bush years. The neo-isolationist enthusiasm also results from waning popular confidence in the bureaucracy, competence and peacekeeping skills of the U.N.

Neo-isolationism gains further support as America (indeed, all nations) confronts the ultimate price of collective security. For the essence of collective security remains, as Churchill said, the readiness to act against evildoers "by force of arms." Denied military enforcement, and with economic sanctions of limited effect, the international community's effort to restrain aggressors becomes hortatory.

Are Americans prepared to take a major collective-security role in enforcing the peace system? How to persuade the parents in Xenia, Ohio, that their children should risk their lives in Bosnia or Somalia or some other place where vital American interests are not involved? How many stalwart internationalists in the Council on Foreign Relations would send their sons to die in Bosnia or Somalia?
 Dying for world order when there is no concrete threat to one's own nation is a hard argument to make. For understandable reasons, our leaders are not making it. We have a professional army made up of men and women who volunteered for the job -- and the job, alas, may include fighting, killing and dying. But let a few soldiers get killed, and the Congressional and popular demand for withdrawal becomes almost irresistible.
 Surely this flinching from military enforcement calls for a re-examination of the theory of collective security. Despite two hot wars, a draining cold war and a multitude of smaller conflicts, the Wilsonian vision is as far from realization today as it was three-quarters of a century ago.
 In the United States, neo-isolationism promises to prevent the most powerful nation on the planet from playing any role in enforcing the peace system. If we refuse a role, we cannot expect smaller, weaker and poorer nations to insure world order for us. We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood, words and money.
 Perhaps our leaders should put the question to the people: What do we want the U.N. to be? Do we want it to avert more killing fields around the planet? Or do we want it to dwindle into impotence, leaving the world to the anarchy of nation-states?
 National interest narrowly construed may be the safer rule in an anarchic world. But let us recognize, as we return to the bomb, that we are surrendering a magnificent dream.

HEADLINE: The World;
Sure, Ebola Is Bad. Africa Has Worse.

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KIKWIT, Zaire

 BODY:
WITH the gruesome death of scores of people from the Ebola virus last month, this lost city of 500,000, and with it a largely forgotten continent, was suddenly, if momentarily, found.
 For weeks now, the scenery of Kikwit has been utterly transformed as space-suited scientists scurry about the government hospital compound and white Red Cross vehicles comb neighborhoods whose dirt roads had lost all habit of bearing vehicles. Foreign doctors and foreign correspondents uneasily rub elbows, one group hoping to bare the secrets of the scourge and the other hoping to flash the news. 
 Meanwhile, from only a few hundred miles to the east, word has filtered out of an older scourge: 250 people have been stricken with polio. Simultaneously, deadly cholera rages in Mali. To the south, in Angola, 30,000 people were recently infected with sleeping sickness. And a few weeks back, thousands died when meningitis swept across a broad belt of West Africa.
 Unlike Ebola, all of these plagues are easily mastered by modern medicine, so Westerners need not fear their spread. But all of them already have killed, or likely will kill, far more Africans than today's celebrity virus. And for Africans, the troubling question arises why none of this continent's daily, deadly encounters with mostly preventable diseases hardly provokes a flicker on the screen of the world's conscience.
 If it is true that Ebola represents a formidable and intriguing scientific puzzle, for many Africans it also seems true that these days the world's most miserable continent can only capture the West's attention by fulfilling new superlatives of human catastrophe or primordial exoticism.
Hence, death by the thousands in annual measles outbreaks, or a toll of millions from malaria, are non-events for an outside world that has already moved on to associating Africa with endemic H.I.V. infection and has found an even more spectacularly grim image of a diseased continent: Ebola.

 
 
A Savage Stereotype
 For Britain's Sunday Telegraph, indulging in one of the oldest stereotypes about the continent, the newest epidemic was an example of "savage African diseases ready to break out anywhere at any moment."
 By the same token, a world already jaded by the scale of death in Rwanda and Somalia scarcely notices that in nearby Sudan, where slavery on a large scale is still commonplace, many thousands have been starved to death or killed in a civil war.
 "Where Africa is concerned, there is a constant search for tragedy with a new face, like what else is new in genocide," said Ali Mazrui, an African scholar at the State University of New York at Binghamton. "There is a hardened insensitivity to things which happen in Africa which are regarded as on the margin of human importance, even if hundreds of thousands die, which can only be called malignant neglect."
 A United Nations official in Liberia who threw his hands up at the lack of international effort to help end that country's civil war put it differently. "Let's face it," he said on condition of anonymity, "the world's threshold for suffering is just higher in Africa than it is for other places."
If this statement is true, many Africans say that with the end of the cold war there have been subtle changes in the criteria that determine when outside powers focus on African misery. Backing dictators on the basis of ideological fidelity for three decades, East and West both ignored questions of human rights or economic development.

 
 
Bloody Hands
 Long is the list of tyrants, like Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire or Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, whose hands were bloody with their own people's slaughter and who left their economies in ruin while enjoying the indulgent support of Washington, Paris, London, Moscow or Havana.
 Now the West is quick to condemn African dictators, but, many African intellectuals say, it is shockingly stingy when it comes to compassion for the people whose lives they have wrecked.
 "They have learned how to sanction people, it seems," Guillaume Ngefa, president of the Zairean Association for the Defense of Human Rights, said of foreigners. "But as they sit back and watch the destruction of whole societies, it doesn't seem they have learned how to assist."
 This kind of attitude nearly played a catastrophic role even in the Ebola outbreak. Zairean doctors in Kikwit say they had been sending S.O.S. messages for weeks about the spread of an unusually virulent diarrheal disease before they succeeded in getting any serious foreign attention.
 The reason, they said, was that after three decades of propping up President Mobutu, the West had all but severed its ties to Zaire.
 "Kikwit hospital literally begged for help," said Dr. Dan Fountain, an American missionary physician who practices near Kikwit. But he said the initial response was that Bandundu was not one of the three provinces that aid organizations had decided to work in.
 He said the Zairean director of Kikwit hospital asked him, "What do I need, a full-blown epidemic here before anyone notices?" The answer, it turned out, was yes.

HEADLINE: For Noncandidate Gingrich, All New Hampshire's a Stage

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: KEENE, N.H., June 10

 BODY:
Racing by helicopter from event to event, Newt Gingrich barnstormed today around this first-in-the-nation primary state like a full-fledged Presidential candidate, greeted by overflow crowds, demonstrators and 130 news organizations as he tried to dispel the notion that he would rather be President than Speaker.
Even as he basked in attention and ovations that the eight declared candidates for the Republican nomination have yet to receive -- 23 television cameras recorded his arrival at the Manchester airport on Friday -- Mr. Gingrich told New Hampshire residents that he had been playing coy about his intentions for 1996 only to lure people into paying attention to his ideas. 
 Mr. Gingrich, like the Wizard of Oz showing off the levers on his thunder machine, explained to audiences how he was manipulating reporters to get his message across.
"I decided to be cynical," the Georgia Republican told 800 people Friday night at the politically influential Nashua Chamber of Commerce dinner. "What I've learned is, if I keep the door open just this much, they'll all show up. And I could teach. And they'll actually cover it. They'll go, 'Ah-hah! This is a very sneaky way to run for President.' "
Mr. Gingrich spent the day making the most of the opportunity he created, chattering away about weighty subjects, and then successfully maneuvering a half-serious invitation from President Clinton into a commitment that the two would meet, one on one, for a discussion of the issues on Sunday.
Between the fund-raisers and helicopter hops and preparation for a "moose watch," negotiations went on over what form their meeting should take. White House officials and Mr. Gingrich's aides went round and round over whether the two men would get together for the kind of joint appearances usually limited to the last weeks of a Presidential campaign, although both sides were emphasizing to their fullest that all they had in mind was a dialogue.
The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said this afternoon that Mr. Clinton would be "delighted" should Mr. Gingrich join him at a senior citizens picnic that had been arranged for the President. But the White House had been anything but delighted by the Speaker's counter-invitations that the President swing by a Republican event in the morning, or that they find a bigger venue for the picnic.
White House officials made clear that Mr. Clinton would not be altering his schedule to suit Mr. Gingrich.
Finally, Mr. Gingrich agreed to attend the picnic, which will be held in Claremont, N.H. The Speaker said: "I would hope that it is a very friendly, very positive dialogue and the people say afterward, 'It is nice to see that leaders who belong to different parties and different branches can actually find some way to deal with each other that isn't hostile.' "
Mary Ellen Glynn, a White House spokeswoman, said this evening: "We will be delighted to see the Speaker in New Hampshire tomorrow. It will be a good chance for the President and the Speaker to address the issues that affect the citizens of New Hampshire and the elderly, in particular. It should be a productive dialogue."
Mr. Gingrich has emphasized that really all he wants to do is frame the debate for whoever really does run next year. And he said that is fine with Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who is the leading candidate in every major poll for the Republican nomination for President and the one who arguably has the most to lose by Mr. Gingrich's continued display of his power to draw a crowd and articulate the big ideas of the day.
"The truth is, Bob Dole thinks it's fine I'm up here, because he understands what I'm doing," Mr. Gingrich said. "I'm trying to shape the entire language and ideas of the 1996 campaign."
His central theme is that America is in crisis -- with 12-year-olds having babies and 17-year-olds unable to read their diplomas -- and what he describes as a liberal media elite too bored and cynical to write about it.
He laid out his solutions in nine specific strategies, including balancing the budget, decentralizing government out of Washington, re-establishing the work ethic and asserting American leadership around the world.
He gets particularly strong applause for calling for the death penalty for those who smuggle drugs into the United States. And he would like to force rock stars and athletes who use drugs to perform two days of community service a week, like picking up trash, which he said would be a more severe penalty than making them pay a fine.
Mr. Gingrich's style is persuasive to many here. "It doesn't make any difference if he runs, the message is there," said an admiring Ed Ellis, 50, a marketing executive and a Democrat who heard Mr. Gingrich in Nashua on Friday night. He voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 but said Mr. Clinton had demonstrated no leadership. "He doesn't know which way he's going when he gets up in the morning," said Mr. Ellis, while he believes Mr. Gingrich gives a strong sense of what he wants to do.
As the commander who shaped last year's historic Republican takeover of Congress, Mr. Gingrich may lay easy claim to setting the agenda for 1996. But doing so also reinforces the perception of him as the engine driving the Republican machine, and it continues to cast his party's declared candidates in his shadow.
Besides, Mr. Gingrich hardly had trouble getting access to a microphone before he became a noncandidate.
But Mr. Gingrich said it was very hard, even for him, to get his message out unfiltered. He said that he shut down his daily Speaker's press briefings in Washington -- in which he was frequently asked about ethics accusations against him or the details of policy -- because the questions were too "nitpicking." He added, "I don't mind occasionally talking about the trees, but when we're arguing over a beetle on the bark, I think there's something wrong with the whole style."
It is different in New Hampshire, he said, where his staff has accommodated the gaggle of reporters and camera crews with bus caravans, telephones and filing centers, because here, he is talking about ideas. Besides, the press is a handy prop to have along. Mr. Gingrich gets great mileage out of deriding the press corps while using it at the same time to amplify his voice.
All of that said, several New Hampshire residents who have been listening to Mr. Gingrich this weekend think he is not really running for President and they do not want him to, partly out of fear that he might lose. His visit coincides with polls that show that if he entered the primary, Mr. Gingrich would not do even as well as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who is running a distant second to Senator Dole.
Jim Smith, a retired geneticist, who heard Mr. Gingrich speak here at Keene State College this morning, said he would support him for President because he is "the best possible candidate of all" and he could beat Mr. Clinton. But because Mr. Gingrich probably could not win the party nomination, Mr. Smith does not want him to fail. "We would be better off as a party to have him exactly where he is, at least for the next four years," he said, rather than risk losing him as Speaker, too.
Some are taking Mr. Gingrich's visit in the spirit in which they assume it was intended.
"He's just having fun," said John Byrnes, a retired Keene police officer. "And you people are having fun following him around and inventing all these things. But it's great for the state of New Hampshire, all the money you bring in." He laughed about how Mr. Gingrich was "raining" on Mr. Clinton's parade, "and poor old Billy Boy is sweating it out down there."
Indeed, Mr. Gingrich cannot help but fault Mr. Clinton, for perceived sins old and new.
In response to Mr. Clinton's criticism that the House-passed foreign aid bill was "isolationist," Mr. Gingrich noted that Mr. Clinton had been the Texas field director for Senator George McGovern's 1972 Presidential campaign, which "was far more isolationist than anything we've ever done."
And he casually asserted that the Presidency had become "relatively less important" than the legislative branch, and that this was "a past tense statement of fact," no mere burst of hubris.
He said the drug problem would be easier to solve if the Administration demonstrated a tough attitude against drugs, not a soft attitude.
He said that the war in Bosnia was "a historic mess" for which both parties were responsible, one that might have been prevented several years ago if the United States had established what he called a Balkan economic development bank and a Balkan trade zone.
But he also faulted Mr. Clinton for the current muddled policy in the Balkans. At a breakfast fund-raiser here this morning, he cited the decision not to destroy Serbian positions when Capt. Scott F. O'Grady was rescued from hostile Bosnian territory last week. American fliers had determined that Serbian radar had pinpointed their location, but the Americans were denied permission to fire on the Serbs, in part to protect United Nations hostages.
"It is inexcusable to allow Serbian radar to work," Mr. Gingrich said. "If we're going to fly aircraft over Bosnia, we should have set the ground rule -- they turn on the radar, we kill 'em." Big applause.
He also erupted in anger at the notion of United Nations peacekeepers who wear "baby blue helmets" and do not look or act like soldiers. "Any system which would put soldiers out in such an unmilitary manner as to allow them to be taken hostage is a disgrace to civilization," he declared to much applause. The United Nations model in Bosnia, he said, "is utter, total insanity."
His solution is to use the threat of overwhelming military power from the United States to force the Serbs to the negotiating table.
He had been asked what he would do about Bosnia if he were President. But in answering, he was careful to say, "As Speaker the advice I would give the President is this." And the audience applauded again.

HEADLINE: 2 Rivals in A.F.L.-C.I.O. Are Seeking Its Presidency

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Now that Lane Kirkland has decided not to seek re-election as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., an unprecedented battle for the leadership of the union has broken into the open, with the two contenders promising to revitalize the federation. It is a pledge that may be hard to fulfill in a time of weak public support for unions.
The contenders are Thomas R. Donahue, who has been Mr. Kirkland's second-in-command for 16 years, and John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union, whose more than 1 million members are mostly janitors, window washers and other building service employees. 
 Mr. Donahue and Mr. Sweeney are expected to announce their candidacies this week. They were freed to do so when Mr. Kirkland, bowing to pressure from within the federation, told other union leaders last week that he would not seek a ninth two-year term as president.
The leadership struggle is in part a reaction to Republican gains in last year's Congressional elections. Angry that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had been unsuccessful in lobbying a Democratic Administration and Congress -- and alarmed by the prospect of a Republican-led Congress -- the leaders of a dozen major unions within the federation began to urge the ailing Mr. Kirkland in February to retire at the end of the year, when his term expired. What the organization needed, they said, was a more aggressive, charismatic president. Their choice was Mr. Donahue.
But Mr. Kirkland, who is 73, refused to retire, and Mr. Donahue, 66, said he would not run against his boss, whom he has served as secretary-treasurer since Mr. Kirkland became president in 1979. Mr. Donahue announced in the spring that he would retire rather than oppose Mr. Kirkland.
That changed early last week when Mr. Kirkland began to tell leaders of the 81 unions in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that he would not run after all. Mr. Donahue quickly started to canvass them for support but found it had dwindled.
The Sweeney campaign "has gone too far down the road to pull back," the president of a major industrial union said yesterday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Discussing his re-emergence as a candidate, Mr. Donahue said in an interview yesterday, "What I said was that I would never be a candidate against Lane Kirkland, and since Lane has now indicated that he does not intend to run again, I have said that in the light of that I want to examine a candidacy which I believe can be a unity candidacy."
Mr. Donahue's appeal for support, which includes the reminder that up to a few weeks ago Mr. Sweeney himself supported his candidacy, does not play well in the Sweeney camp, which contends, among other things, that Mr. Donahue is too identified with Mr. Kirkland's lackluster policies to revitalize the labor movement.
As of last week, Mr. Sweeney's loyalists appeared to control enough votes among the labor organization's 13.3 million workers to insure Mr. Sweeney's election at the federation's annual meeting in New York in October. But with the election still months away, Mr. Donahue shows no signs of yielding.
Mr. Donahue and Mr. Sweeney, who is 61, are part of the aging white male hierarchy that leads and dominates the union movement in the United States and has never in the 40-year history of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. fielded two competing candidates for president. "The campaign debate itself is revitalizing the federation," a union president said.
Complicating the struggle, white men are declining as a percentage of total union membership, while women, African-Americans and Hispanic workers represent a rising share. In recognition, Mr. Donahue and Mr. Sweeney are the first candidates for federation president to promise to have a member of a minority as a running mate.
The Sweeney camp, which has scheduled a news conference in Washington for Tuesday, is expected to announce then that Linda Chavez-Thompson, who is Hispanic, will be Mr. Sweeney's running mate as secretary-treasurer, union officials said. Ms. Chavez-Thompson is a vice president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Richard L. Trumka, 45, president of the United Mine Workers, is also to be on the ticket, in a newly created post of executive vice president -- if the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council agrees to create such a post. Mr. Trumka, who is white, is one of the nation's youngest union presidents.
Mr. Sweeney, who was in Vancouver, British Columbia, this weekend for a meeting of his union's leadership, could not be reached for comment. Mr. Donahue, who has not announced his potential running mates, has emphasized that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. under Mr. Kirkland brought five minority members onto the federation's 33-member executive council and greatly expanded the hiring of members of minorities for the organization's staff. Mr. Donahue said he would continue this push for diversity.
Beyond minority representation in the leadership, there are two burning issues. One is how to mobilize the grass-roots membership in support of legislation and candidates favored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The other is how to make the A.F.L.-C.I.O. more effective in helping its members organize nonunion workers at a time when American labor law makes organizing difficult and workers often fear losing their jobs if they antagonize management.
"Revitalizing the A.F.L.-C.I.O. may be a little like pushing on a string, absent either labor law reform or a change in sentiment among workers and managers," said Barry Hirsch, a labor economist at Florida State University.
Mr. Sweeney brings to the campaign a reputation for having doubled the size of his union's membership, to more than one million men and women, at a time when union membership nationally has fallen. Much of his emphasis as a union leader has been on organizing.
Mr. Donahue, whose union career has been mostly as an A.F.L.-C.I.O. official, argues that he has increasingly sent federation representatives into the field to help unions conduct strikes. He is also largely responsible for doubling the money that the federation spends on training organizers.
"It is more a question of spirit and style than fundamental differences on issues," Mr. Donahue said of himself and Mr. Sweeney.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE SERBIAN ROLE;
WESTERN OFFICIALS SAY SERBIA HELPS BOSNIAN COMRADES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
Even as the West courts Serbia's President in hopes of bringing peace to Bosnia and winning the release of the 52 remaining United Nations hostages, his military is secretly assisting the Bosnian Serbs, American and European officials say.
The Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, vowed last year to seal the border between Serbia and Bosnia, and he won an easing of United Nations sanctions as a result. Mr. Milosevic insists that since then only non-lethal aid has been sent to the Bosnian Serbs, an assertion generally accepted by United Nations monitors. 
 But American and European officials with access to intelligence reports said the Yugoslav Army was paying the salaries of many Bosnian Serb officers and also supplying their forces with fuel, spare parts, training and ammunition.
Several American analysts said the Yugoslav Army, which is dominated by Serbia, provided the parts and technicians to maintain the Bosnian Serb air defenses that shot down a American F-16 jet fighter on a NATO monitoring mission. The system remains electronically linked to the Yugoslav Army's computers and radars, although there has been no evidence that the Yugoslav Army was directly involved in shooting down the plane, officials said.
While there are differences about precisely how much military materiel is flowing to the Bosnian Serbs, American experts say the assistance has enabled the Bosnian Serbs to remain an effective fighting force. Even those skeptical of the reports agreed that the supply line had not been cut off.
"Despite what Mr. Milosevic would like you to think, they have not severed their ties," one Administration official said. "The support is there."
That view is not universely embraced by Administration policymakers, who have urged the negotiations with Mr. Milosevic, nor by Government intelligence analysts. Some say Mr. Milosevic is acquiescing in his military commanders' support of their Bosnian Serb colleagues, rather than actively directing it. Others question the extent of the Yugoslav shipments described in what one official termed "anecdotal" reports.
In response to questions, Defense Secretary William J. Perry issued a statement that said while what he called "leakage" persists, he knew of no "credible evidence" that the Bosnian Serbs were receiving a broad range of military help from the Yugoslav Army.
Since the Bosnian Serbs began fighting three years ago against the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, American intelligence agencies have mounted extensive efforts to eavesdrop on communications and compile satellite photographs of military movements.
This has produced persistent reports that the Bosnian Serbs have continued to receive help from the Yugoslav Army. Yugoslavia now consists of Serbia and Montenegro.
According to American and European officials, the reports say the Bosnian Serbs' trucks, tanks, and other heavy equipment are maintained with parts supplied by the Yugoslav Army.
American officials said they have evidence of regular conversations and consultations between the Yugoslav Army's general staff in Belgrade and the officers directing operations in Bosnia. They said Bosnian Serbs wounded in battle are flown to Yugoslav military hospitals.
 
U.S. and West Face A Thorny Question
 Intelligence reports about Mr. Milosevic's continuing role in the war raise a nettlesome question. Should the West lift economic sanctions against a Government that appears to be sustaining the Bosnian Serbs' war effort, even as it pledges to do the opposite?
Several American and European officials said that having decided not to directly confront the Bosnian Serbs, the West has little choice but to bargain with Mr. Milosevic. That conclusion, said a European official, has made both Washington and its European allies more eager to play down reports of military assistance to the Bosnian Serbs.
"The guy is a key factor to a resolution, " one senior American official acknowledged, referring Mr. Milosevic. "Whether we want to deal with him or not, we have to."
The talks are at a delicate turn. Some of the lesser economic sanctions against Serbia were lifted last year after Mr. Milosevic announced he would close the border with Bosnia. Now, the five nations trying to find a peace formula for the Balkans is offering to suspend the remaining sanctions if Mr. Milosevic recognizes Bosnia.
But he rebuffed that offer after an American envoy, Robert Frasure, insisted on an independent means of reimposing the sanctions if Mr. Milosevic reneges. American officials said Mr. Milosevic wants that matter solely in the hands of the United Nations Security Council, where the Russians, historical allies of the Serbs, hold a veto.
 
Good Cop, Bad Cop: A Serbian Version
 American officials disagree about the significance of the split between the Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Radovan Karadzic, and Mr. Milosevic. Over the past week, for example, Mr. Milosevic said he had intervened to gain the release of about half of the United Nations soldiers taken hostage by the Bosnian Serbs after NATO air raids on a Bosnian Serb ammunition depot. Then, Mr. Milosevic cited his cooperation on the hostages as an argument for lifting the sanctions on his terms.
The military relationship between Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs began long before war erupted in April 1992. In the months before the conflict, the Yugoslav Army moved tons of tanks, artillery and heavy equipment to Bosnia, where there were already huge stocks of ammunition from the time when Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of Yugoslavia. After fighting broke out, the communication networks left behind by the Yugoslav Army remained tied to Belgrade.
That summer's campaign of "ethnic cleansing," in which Bosnian Serb soldiers and paramilitary militias rounded up Muslims and detained them in camps or drove them from their homes, were directed by officers in the Yugoslav Army's headquarters in Belgrade, according to a former American official who was briefed on the European intercepts of military communications.
The Yugoslav Army's heavy weapons remain the Bosnian Serbs' key military advantage over the more numerous Bosnian Government forces.
There also were extensive personal ties. Gen. Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, was a career officer in the Yugoslav Army and was selected to lead the Bosnian Serbs by Mr. Milosevic shortly before the war began.
As the war continued, the Yugoslav Army openly supported the Bosnian Serbs, sending convoys of trucks and oil tankers across the border. At times, elite Yuguslav Army units reportedly joined the fighting. This open support prompted the West to ban all trade with Yugoslavia.
 
Oil Tankers Head for Croatia
 Belgrade proved adept at evading the sanctions and smuggling goods. But the sanctions still hurt, and by last fall, Mr. Milosevic was looking for a deal to end them. He offered to close the border with Bosnia, and allow an international mission to monitor his compliance.
On Oct. 3 of last year, two Western mediators -- Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Soltenberg of the United Nations -- announced that the border had been closed. At the same time, however, Lord Owen declared that oil tankers and trucks going across Bosnia to the Serb-held areas of Croatia were not subject to the cutoff.
Immediately, American officials say, 50 to 60 oil tankers a week began showing up at the border with papers indicating they were traveling to Croatia. The international monitors had no means of checking whether, as many American officials suspect, they dropped their cargo in Bosnia.
In rural Serbia, several Yugoslav Army officers told American diplomats that they were still running supplies to Bosnia. Since then, American officials agree, there has been some tightening of the border, with fuel shipments to Bosnia initially cut as much as 50 percent. This has prompted fuel shortages in Bosnian Serb territory.
But the officials asserted that the military assistance and fuel deliveries have continued, and that the Bosnian Serb army has had no difficulties in sustaining operations. Indeed, two American experts said this week that the cross-border traffic was increasing.
American officials agree that the deliveries of fuel and repair of vehicles are an essential element of the support from Belgrade. The Bosnian Serb forces are outnumbered, yet American officials say they maintain the upper hand along a 1,000-mile front by moving armor and heavy weapons rapidly to counter the Government's offensives.
 
Who Is Paymaster For Bosnian Serbs?
 Another aspect of Belgrade's support is more basic: The salaries of many Bosnian Serb officers serving at their headquarters in Pale, near Sarajevo, and elsewhere are paid by the Yugoslav Army. The Bosnian Serbs use the same currency as Yugoslavia, and one official said, "We've seen instances of Pale Serb commanders going to Belgrade and saying, 'Hey, where's our cash?' "
The air defense radars illustrate the continuing ties. Brig. Gen. Selmo Cikotic, the Bosnian Embassy's military attache in Washington and a former Yugoslav Army officer, said the radars in Bosnia and Serb-held Croatia remain linked to Belgrade.
General Cikotic, who was himself an air defense officer, asserted that the SAM-6 missile that shot down the NATO F-16 jet last week was equipped with a Russian-manufactured modification supplied to the Bosnian Serbs Yugoslavia.
American officials could not confirm that detail, but said spare parts for the system were sent by Belgrade. The operator who fired the SAM-6 missile had either "prior training" or "current technical assistance" from the Yugoslav Army, one Administration official said. "It's not something someone could just up and do, and be successful."
Asked to assess the true relationship between the Yugoslav Army's general staff and Bosnian Serb forces, an American official pointed to the recently appointed commander of Serbian forces in Croatia: Lieut. Gen. Mile Mrksic. Until a few weeks ago, the official said, General Mrksic was serving on the general staff Yugoslav Army in Belgrade.

HEADLINE: Treatment for Many Ills;
An Area Centers on Lincoln Hospital

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Tony Glenos, the owner of the Donut Shop on 149th Street in the South Bronx, paused in his morning routine of flipping bacon and stirring home fries to wipe his hands on his grease-stained apron and gesture across the street. "Today they get paid over there," he said with a jagged-tooth grin. "Everybody will spend more money here today."
Payday at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, the huge, rust-colored brick building that dominates the view from Mr. Glenos's window, does not go unnoticed by the 250 small-business owners in the neighborhood. "The hospital gives a little bit to every business here," Mr. Glenos said. "If there was no hospital, I'd close, and everyone else would." 
 Like the huge factories that once brought middle-class stability to today's poor neighborhoods, New York City's public hospital system has evolved into an economic and cultural engine, driving growth and dominating the predominantly low-income neighborhoods they serve. Besides being among the largest employers in their communities, these hospitals attract and sustain small businesses, including health-care-related services.
As city and state officials start to shrink the public hospital system, saying it would save money and improve care, they are only beginning to confront the economic and political reality that the hospitals have become a source for much more than health care in their communities.
Lincoln alone has annual total revenues of about $280 million and produces more than $500 million for other health-service companies in the city, according to an internal study conducted by the City Health and Hospitals Corporation in 1993. Another 7,600 jobs created at other health-service companies throughout the city also depend on the hospital and account for $205 million of the city's annual household earnings.
The hospitals corporation study found that $17.8 million a year was paid to employees who live within the five ZIP codes that comprise Lincoln's primary service area. Estimating that people spend about 60 percent of their income on food, rent and other local expenditures, the study found that $10.7 million of employees' income was reinvested in the neighborhood.
The surrounding community also draws on Lincoln for everything from meeting spaces to meals for the homeless. It has provided medical training for high-school interns -- and enough patronage jobs to build the power base of Ramon S. Velez, the community organizer and political baron of the Bronx, who has often been accused of putting his own interests ahead of Lincoln's and the community's.
Like other public hospitals, Lincoln has often been accused by city and state officials of providing poor health care. Most recently, hospital officials acknowledged that several babies had been injured because of delivery-room mistakes.
Maria K. Mitchell, the Mayor's special adviser on health policy and his recent appointee as chairwoman of the hospitals corporation, says that changes in the hospital system could be expected to improve care.
"Everybody thought that Detroit would be gone after the automobile crisis when the Japanese market really took over," she said. "And they did succeed because they figured out a different way to do things. They retooled, they re-engineered, they figured out how to pay attention to quality, which, by the way, is probably a big problem in the H.H.C. system."
 
Source of Money, Direct and Indirect
 But perhaps no single place better typifies the importance of hospitals to their neighborhoods than Lincoln. Situated in one of the poorest sections of the city, Lincoln provides livelihoods for people who range from Mr. Glenos of the Donut Shop to Roberto Rodriguez, who was raised in the nearby Patterson Projects and is now the hospital's executive director.
Of the 3,300 people employed at Lincoln, 60 percent live in the Bronx, according to statistics compiled by Lincoln and the hospitals corporation. An additional 1,000 local residents are classified as volunteers, and many of them receive small stipends for services like changing beds and bathing patients.
Beyond the hospital, there are 59 health-care-related businesses in Lincoln's ZIP code that employ more than 700 people. "I don't think of Lincoln as the economic engine here," said Neil Parisher, senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, "I think it's more of a locomotive, because it's pulling a lot of stuff."
With 609 beds and 26,000 in-patients, 160,000 emergency room visits and 400,000 clinic visits a year, Lincoln is the hospitals corporation's busiest site after Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn. And it is emerging as the most profitable, having averaged an $8.9 million net operating surplus for the last three years. Its neighbors, mostly Hispanic and African-American, have a median household income of $16,500, according to the 1990 census; 89 percent of them pay their hopital bills through either Medicaid or Medicare.
Because of its heavy patient load and its efficiency, it is unlikely that Lincoln will be shut down. But, like other public hospitals, it is anticipating cuts in its Medicaid reimbursements and city financing, and they are prompting concern.
"It could have a devastating blow to us," said Rev. Reuben Diaz, executive director of the Christian Community in Action Home Attendant Program, a Bronx-based nonprofit provider of home-attendant care that employs 1,300 people. It is financed through the city's Human Resources Administration, and Mr. Diaz said that about 50 percent of his 900 clients -- all on Medicaid or Medicare -- receive their treatment at Lincoln.
Gregory Chugranis, whose family-run flower shop has been in the South Bronx for 89 years and who moved the business opposite Lincoln 15 years ago, said the hospital "sort of brought this area to life."
Before it was built, he said, you could count the shops and restaurants on one hand. "Now they're all over the place," he said. "No doubt, Lincoln is the anchor. It's more than just a neighborhood hospital."
 
Community Leaders Use Their Clout
 Lincoln's current home was built in the mid-1970's, when Mr. Velez, then a fast-rising community leader, organized an unlikely coalition of doctors, the Young Lords street gang and the Black Panther Party to lobby City Hall to replace the hospital's decrepit building at 141st Street and Concord Avenue.
Dr. Frank Williams, director of oral surgery and president of the medical staff at Lincoln, recalled that Mr. Velez was "the single person most responsible" for the new building, which opened in 1976. Because of that, Dr. Williams said, Mr. Velez has significant clout in the hospital's operations. And that has helped him build an empire of social service programs and become a fierce power broker in the Bronx.
A controversial man who has amassed a personal fortune through a tangle of nonprofit organizations and private companies, Mr. Velez said his primary goal has been "to make sure there was community involved in the administration and that hospital jobs went to people in the community." In addition to operating a nonprofit home-attendant concern that depends on Lincoln patient referrals, Mr. Velez has also run Federally funded jobs programs that screen candidates and refer them to the hospital for work.
George Rodriguez, a close associate of Mr. Velez and the current chairman of the hospital's community advisory board, frankly acknowledged that the two of them have been "very instrumental in getting jobs to certain people." He and Mr. Velez have influenced hiring at all levels, he said, "all the way down to housekeepers and maintenance, and on up to top administrators."
Even though Mr. Velez is not as visible a force as he once was since coming under fire in recent years, hospital officials say his presence can still be felt. One former administrator, who would speak only on the condition that he not be named, said that when he tried to lay off unproductive workers, he was sometimes informed that they were "untouchable." Mr. Velez denied that such tactics were ever used.
Mr. Rodriguez, who as chairman of Bronx Community Board 1 is supposed to help Lincoln serve its community, has his own financial ties to the hospital. He runs a nonprofit home-attendant service, which employs 300 people and receives many of its Medicaid-sponsored patients from Lincoln referrals. The walls of his cluttered Third Avenue office are covered with photographs of himself with New York City mayors dating back to John V. Lindsay. There is even a photograph of him with Lincoln's former executive director, Dr. Carlos Molina.
"He was a gentleman," Mr. Rodriguez said, "but we weren't involved in selecting him. He was imposed on us. So we got him out."
Roberto Rodriguez (no relation to George), the man who replaced Dr. Molina as executive director in 1992, acknowledged that Mr. Velez and other community leaders have a "quiet presence" at the hospital. "Not once since I've been here, in three years, has Ramon Valez or anyone approached me about a job, not arm-twisting or threatening," he said. But Mr. Rodriguez acknowledges that he has discussed the hospital's operations with Mr. Valez. "He's a leader here," Mr. Rodriguez said. "How do you turn a deaf ear?"
Mr. Rodriguez, who was raised across the street from the hospital, said that he had been accepted by local power brokers because he was a known quantity. He has gone about his job at Lincoln like both a chief executive and a community organizer. At nearby Paul Robeson Intermediate School last year, Mr. Rodriguez sat in on a budget session and "really offered some suggestions that were helpful to me," said John Crawford, the school's principal. "He is really reaching out and making the hospital the focal point of this community."
 
Place of Opportunity For Local Youth

The effect the hospital can have on neighborhood youth is evident in Mustafa Stanley, 18, who was stabbed in the neck, chest and shoulder three years ago while "hanging with the wrong crowd," he said. After spending the last year as a high-school intern in the radiology department at the hospital, Mr. Stanley is now frantically searching for financial aid to begin pre-med studies this fall at Norfolk State University in Virginia. "I can play basketball," he recently said. "You know, I could be like the next Michael Jordan. But I want to be a trauma specialist. I want to make a difference."
Rosa Diaz, a student at Hostos Lincoln Academy, a local magnet school, who said that if she wasn't volunteering at the hospital she "would probably be in the streets, being a follower." Instead, Ms. Diaz, 18, spends her afternoons in a uniform following the directions of doctors and midwives at Lincoln's women's health clinic.
The hospital's emergency room is where the community turns for practically anything. Besides handling thousands of trauma cases each year, Lincoln's emergency room staff helps local residents who are searching for food, shelter and counseling, or even things like diapers, baby formula and aspirin. "Oftentimes people just need to be plugged into social services," said Dr. Peter Wyer, an attending physician in pediatric emergencies.
Some patients come in feigning problems in an attempt to obtain controlled medications, said Dr. Victoria Paz. Anti-depressants like Prozac are used by addicts to prolong the effects of heroin, and drugs like Valium and Zanex are taken as downers and can sell for as much as $3 each on the street. Dr. Paz said that tighter restrictions in recent years have allowed the hospital to minimize such abuse, but that the problem still exists.
On a recent Friday evening, the area outside the adult emergency waiting room was unusually quiet. Dr. Ramnath Kapoor, a chief attending surgeon in adult emergencies, had just finished up with a 25-year-old woman who had come in complaining that she couldn't move her arm. After six hours of testing and X-rays, said Dr. Kapoor, "we realized what she was really looking for was shelter." The hospital called in social service workers to help her find somewhere to stay, but in the meantime, "she got two meals, she saw the doctor, she got cleaned up," Dr. Kapoor said.
"No private institution would have ever touched such a patient," he added. "But we make her feel like she's somebody."
Estimating that 10 percent of the 160,000 visits each year that are classified as emergencies are actually for something other than medical problems, he said, "We are an emergency room, but we give more than medical care."
In the winter, when the temperature drops below 40 degrees, one section of the emergency waiting room is converted into a shelter, where as many as 25 homeless people, some of them families with small children, sleep and receive meals. Each Thanksgiving, emergency workers prepare dinner for the homeless.
The auditorium has been used for performances by local theater groups and high school graduation ceremonies. Community groups ranging from the National Council of Negro Women to the Gay Men of the Bronx meet regularly in the conference rooms, which this month are being used to conduct seminars for first-time Bronx home buyers.
"This is not a hospital isolated out there just for medicine," Dr. Williams said. "It encompasses the entire community and all of its activities."

HEADLINE: After Decades of Wariness, Forces of U.S. and India Begin to Cooperate

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: COCHIN, India

 BODY:
More than 250 miles out in the Indian Ocean, Capt. Kizhupalli Mohanan of the Indian Navy leaned out from an observation deck aboard the Abraham Lincoln, straining to catch a view of an F-14 Tomcat fighter as it screamed down over a cobalt-blue sea toward one of the newest nuclear-powered American aircraft carriers.
For Captain Mohanan, a grizzle-bearded navy pilot with hundreds of carrier landings behind him, there was little of the first-timer's thrill in the full-throttle roar of the Tomcat's engines and the cracking impact of the 30-ton fighter hitting the deck one. 
 But there was novelty in the experience nonetheless, for Captain Mohanan commands the Vikrant, an aging Indian aircraft carrier, and this was his introduction to the United States Navy at sea.
Back on land at an Indian Navy air station at Cochin, Captain Mohanan was asked if he thought that the Indian Navy could benefit from a widening of the tentative military contacts now being taken up between the two nations after decades of estrangement.
His face lit up. "Oh yes," he said, standing beside a navy transport plane that ferried a group of Indian officers to the American carrier. "Indeed I do."
The Vikrant commander's enthusiasm was an apt symbol of how things have moved between the two navies. More than 23 years ago the Vikrant was involved in an incident that stood for many years as a symbol of the wariness, and sometimes hostility, that characterized relations between India and the United States for much of the last 50 years.
In December 1971, when Indian forces entered what was then East Pakistan to seal the victory of the rebels fighting to create Bangladesh, President Nixon sent a naval battle group led by the aircraft carrier Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi interpreted the deployment as a military threat; the Vikrant, patrolling farther north, was placed on battle stations.
The Enterprise sailed away. But among Indians, the incident has stood as an emblem of the United States' readiness to assert itself militarily in what many Indians regard as their backyard -- and as a marker of Washington's unwillingness to accept India for what it believes itself to be: a regional superpower with wide-ranging military interests.
"Of course, the Enterprise could have sunk the Vikrant in 20 minutes," said Jasjit Singh, a retired Indian fighter pilot who is director of the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, in New Delhi. "But, for us, that was never the point."
What was, Mr. Singh said, was that the United States had tried to dictate terms to New Delhi on the creation of Bangladesh, an issue of crucial strategic importance to India.
Now planners in Washington and New Delhi say the time has come to start developing the closer military ties that many on both sides hoped might develop after India gained independence in 1947. Partly, the changes have been made possible by the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was India's closest ally, and its principal source of military hardware.
Russia remains a major military supplier; in one of several recent arms purchases, the Indian Air Force bought two additional squadrons of MIG-29 fighters, at a cost of more than $2 billion. But because American policy in the region is no longer aimed at containing Soviet power, the nexus that made Pakistan a fulcrum of American military policy for decades has been broken.
In turn, Washington and New Delhi have been freed to seek a new military relationship that is no longer hostage at every turn to American ties with Pakistan.
Equally important, India is now in its fifth year of economic reforms that have featured moves toward dismantling the socialist economy built in the 1950's, when Soviet influence in India was rapidly gaining, and toward market principles.
Although total foreign investments have been modest so far compared with elsewhere in Asia, American companies have led the way, creating a momentum that has energized relations across the board.
The new military relationship was on show recently at both ends of India, in the visit of the Indian officers to the Abraham Lincoln, and in ceremonies in New Delhi organized by the United States to commemorate the last time Indian and United States forces worked closely together, in World War II.
The New Delhi ceremonies focused on veterans of the India-China air bridge across the Himalayas, known among American fliers as the Hump, that kept American and Chinese forces in China supplied from 1942 to 1945.
During their four hours aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a group of Indian officers had lunch with Rear Adm. Jay B. Yakely, commander of a carrier battle group comprising four surface ships and a submarine that sailed from San Francisco in April for a six-month deployment in the Persian Gulf.
Afterward, the Indian officers, including Rear Adm. John C. DeSilva, commander of India's western fleet based in Bombay, toured the hangar deck, watched flight operations and fanned out to discuss technical issues with American officers.
When Admiral DeSilva was asked if the presence of an American aircraft carrier off the Indian coast raised uncomfortable memories for India, he said: "We meet here as fellow sailors, as members of the brotherhood of the white uniform. The ocean is our street, and we are like neighbors. When we meet, we like to shake hands."
Admiral Yakely, a veteran carrier pilot who served on the military staff in the White House under Presidents Bush and Clinton, was equally circumspect, although he did say that having aboard Indian naval fliers -- several of whom trained in the Soviet Union -- was a measure of how the world had changed.
"I spent 20 years of my life preparing for the possibility of a war with the Soviet Union," he said. "My job was to keep their Bears and their Badgers as far away from our carriers as I could. Now, it's a different world."
On a visit to India in January, Defense Secretary William J. Perry signed an agreement that set a framework for expanded military contacts, including joint naval exercises, training exchanges and high-level consultations on military and security issues.
For now, the two Governments seem eager not to rush the pace; although the Perry visit emphasized areas in which the two countries can cooperate on military matters, major political obstacles remain.
Among these are the tense relations between India and Pakistan, and differences between Washington and New Delhi on nuclear weapons. India shunned the recent United Nations meeting that renewed the treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, and has rejected American proposals that would cap the secret nuclear weapons programs of both India and Pakistan.
But looking to the future, many Indians say they believe that the United States has crossed a crucial threshold that could herald much wider military cooperation.
In his New Delhi office, Mr. Singh offers visitors photocopies of a speech Mr. Perry made to the Foreign Policy Association in New York after his India visit, with heavy underlining in the section where the Defense Secretary said, "India wants to retain its nuclear capability to deter the Chinese military, which is superior to India both in nuclear and conventional capability."
To some Indian military experts, Mr. Perry's words suggested that the limited military contacts could give way, as China's military might grows, to something much broader, possibly even to having Washington encourage Indian military growth as a counterbalance to China.
"The United States is going to have to look very carefully at where its long-term interests lie," Mr. Singh said. "And when they do, they'll find that it doesn't make any sense to deal with us any longer as though we were a boy in short pants."

HEADLINE: Number of Mexicans Fleeing in Boxcars Alarms U.S. Officials

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HARLINGEN, Tex., June 10

 BODY:
Economic crisis and drought in northern Mexico have driven increasing numbers of Mexicans into suffocatingly hot boxcars or other spots on rail cars to make their way into the United States to search for work and hope.
"I think a lot of them don't realize how dangerous it is," said Charles Dill, an agent with the United States Border Patrol. "A rail car is not a safe place." 
 According to the Federal Railroad Administration, 529 people were killed and 450 were injured while trespassing on railroad tracks or train yards in 1994. Some of those killed were hit by trains; others died trying to hop them. The agency does not have a breakdown of how many were illegal immigrants.
But illegal immigration is certainly up this year because of the economic crisis and drought, said a patrol spokeswoman, Letty Valadez. Arrests in the McAllen sector for the first five months of this year are up 31.5 percent from the same period in 1994 -- to 82,041 from 62,387.
The potential for tragedy is compounded by immigrant smugglers -- known on the border as "coyotes" -- who can be as careless as their often uneducated and desperate clients are trusting, border patrol agents and rail companies said.
The smugglers often lock their human cargo in boxcars without food or water, telling them that someone will let them out when they reach a destination such as San Antonio or Houston.
"To victimize people like that is just unbelievable," said Mike Furtney, spokesman for Southern Pacific Lines of San Francisco.
"We appreciate that some of these people are in tough economic straits, but we don't want them to get hurt any more than they want to get hurt," he said.
Sixty-two people were discovered in a sealed car at the Union Pacific yard in Harlingen on May 26, including seven women and two children. More than half were among 102 people rescued a week earlier from a boxcar at the Southern Pacific yard in Harlingen.
On May 10, Southern Pacific workers discovered a group of 48 immigrants pounding on the door of a boxcar in which temperatures had reached 120 degrees. Five were hospitalized for dehydration.
"If we had been in there two more minutes, I think I would have died," one immigrant said.
In 1987, 18 immigrants died in a stifling freight car in Sierra Blanca, near El Paso.
John Bromley, a spokesman for Union Pacific, said illegal train-hopping carried a financial cost along with the safety risk. Although he did not have precise figures, Mr. Bromley said companies must hire extra inspectors and delay shipments so that the trains could be searched.
He said some loads were pilfered during transit, upsetting the company's clients.
In addition, last month the border patrol charged Nestor Ibarra Osuna, a 28-year Union Pacific employee, with conspiracy to transport illegal immigrants. Investigators said the 54-year-old advised smugglers about which freight cars were most likely to be searched.
Mr. Dill, a 17-year veteran of the patrol's Harlingen station, says he always sees increases in illegal border crossers when the Mexican economy stumbles.
"I can't fault them," he said. "If I were in the same situation, I'd probably do the same thing."

HEADLINE: Crash Focuses Attention On Equipment Conditions

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The Transit Authority has spent 13 years modernizing the New York City subways, including the antiquated signal system, which is suspected of having contributed to a fatal train crash last week. The job is about half done, and will not be completed until 2020.
A project to replace subway switching towers, which has been under way for 35 years, should finish sooner, about 2010. By then it will be time to start over. 
 Meanwhile, the pace of maintenance work is slowing. The Transit Authority is eliminating 23 maintenance positions and abandoning plans to add safety workers.
The subways have begun to look a lot better in the last few years. Cars are cleaner and more reliable, and crime and graffiti are down. But the accident last Monday, in which a J train slammed into an M train on the Williamsburg Bridge, killing a motorman, has focused attention on the condition of the system's soft underbelly: the tracks, switches, signals and other vital equipment whose upkeep and improvement require time spans so long that they are practically abstractions.
Since 1982, the Transit Authority has modernized about 40 percent of the subway signal system, but even so, today only 52 percent of the signals are in "a state of good repair"; meaning, among other things, that they are no more than 50 years old, according to the engineers who run the system. Modernization is expected to be completed by 2020, but that date is far from certain. "That's provided we get the same level of funding we anticipate, and it keeps up with inflation," said Dr. Nabil N. Ghaly, the head of the signal division.
Dr. Ghaly's time scale and caveat apply to many of the subway's crucial components. After 13 years of intensified effort and $20 billion, there is a sense of timelessness to the modernization of the subways, and a planning horizon that is uncommon in government. Dr. Ghaly, who is 49 years old and has spent 26 years at the Transit Authority, is discussing projects that will outlast his career by 10 years or more.
For example, in the late 1950's, when Robert F. Wagner was Mayor, the subway system set out to replace its 225 switching towers, each with operators pulling mechanical switches, with 32 remote-controlled master towers.
Today, 25 master towers have been built, allowing 173 of the old towers to close. Work continues on the other 7 new towers, so the last 52 old towers can be closed. By the time work is finished, around 2010 or so, it will be time to start replacing the first master towers, which will be 50 years old.
Of course, signal system modernization, like most subway projects, could go faster if more money were available, but in an era of budget cuts, planners are now delaying parts of the modernization program.
The Transit Authority had $9.6 billion in its capital budget for modernization of the entire system, including buses, from 1992 to 1996, but had to scale back plans when New York City reduced its contribution by $500 million. Most prominently, it has delayed the renovation of 17 stations.
Some less visible improvements will also be delayed. Engineers had planned since 1992 to spend $10 million to upgrade the signals on a 4 1/2-mile stretch at the northern end of the No. 5 line, to allow trains to run in either direction on either of the two tracks. Now the job will be delayed 10 years or more.
Engineers put off rebuilding the Franklin Avenue Shuttle in Brooklyn. They cut $44 million out of a program to modernize station lighting. And the elevated White Plains Road line, from 149th Street to 241st Street in the Bronx, was supposed to undergo a structural rehabilitation; now the authority plans to issue a contract only for the stretch from 149th to 180th Streets, for $45 million. The line north of 180th Street will have to wait.
Maintenance has also been cut back. The signal repair force will lose 11 people working as maintainers, about 1 percent of the total. Twelve technician jobs will also be cut, leading to longer maintenance cycles for public-address and emergency telephone systems, and for some subway lines. A fire safety specialist job will be eliminated, and a safety manager position that was to have been filled this year in the stations division will not be.
A spokesman for the Transit Authority, Jared Lebow, said that none of these cutbacks would compromise safety, and there is little evidence that cutbacks have made the subways more accident prone. The pattern of accidents is inconclusive. There were 7 collisions or derailments in 1991, 8 in 1992, 13 in 1993 and 8 in 1994. Halfway through 1995, there have been 4.
The Transit Authority also records deaths and injuries on the subways, but officials say that the statistics have little bearing on how they operate the trains. Most injuries result from incidents like passengers' falling between cars or down stairs, Mr. Lebow said. Accidents per million passengers have been constant at around 4.2, officials say.
Outside experts generally do not focus on the specifics, but they say they are worried.
"We're very concerned whether these cutbacks in inspections and maintenance might have contributed to the accident, or might contribute to future accidents," said Gene M. Russianoff, staff lawyer of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy group. Cutting has been going on for a few years, he said.
Deferred maintenance is always a bad idea, said Samuel I. Schwartz, a former deputy city transportation commissioner, now a professor at Cooper Union. "I don't think anyone riding the system understands about the bridges and the tracks and the switches and the signals," he said. "Those will always be hidden, and the public will never be clamoring for those things until there is an accident."
David L. Gunn, president of the Transit Authority from 1984 until 1990 and now chief general manager of the Toronto Transit Commission, struck a similar note. What everyone wants, he said, is "stations, and fare collection systems and all that stuff." But he said he put priority "on the nuts and bolts, if you will, tracks, power, things like that."
"You can always do a little more," he said in a telephone interview. "We were assuming that there would be a third capital program, and given that assumption we thought we were moving ahead in a fairly comprehensive way."
There was a third capital program, due to be finished next year. But Gov. George E. Pataki recently asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency, to delay issuing $690 million in bonds that are part of that program. Even before that, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani balked, as Mayor David N. Dinkins had before him, at paying $500 million of the city's share.
The immediate effect of slowing modernization is on efficiency. Outdated signals, for example, cost passengers time. Often it is the signals, not tracks or trains, that control how many trains can be pushed through a station; if they were modernized, engineers say, stations that can handle only 26 to 30 trains per hour now could take 36 to 40 trains. In a system in which building new track is almost impossible, that would be a major capacity improvement.
But that would take a major investment, in signals and cars to match.
The signal system on the Williamsburg Bridge, now 77 years old, was scheduled for replacement, but the Transit Authority decided to delay until the Department of Transportation finished rebuilding the bridge. The signal system's possible role in the accident last week is now under the scrutiny of the National Transportation Safety Board.
Investigators have found evidence of a defect that may prove to have been crucial, a trip bar meant to trigger the train's emergency brakes that did not rise high enough from the side of the track.
Engineers use a formula to determine the condition of signals. Physical condition counts for 50 percent, age for 35 percent and engineering -- whether the design of the system is close enough to modern standards -- for 15 percent.
The Jamaica line, from 121st Street in Queens to Chambers Street in Manhattan, ranks at 64.3 percent, in a system in which 58 is a passing grade. It ranks 17th of 34 lines in the city.
But the stretch on which the accident occurred last Monday had a lower rating. The rating for physical condition of the 66 signals on the route was 38.9 percent. Since it was built in 1918, the age rating was 25 percent. The engineering rating was 53.1 percent, and the overall score was 36.2 percent.

Lukas Knows The Count On Anything

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
D. WAYNE LUKAS had just won yet another triple crown race yesterday -- Thunder Gulch had something to do with that -- when somebody asked him to test the microphone for the news conference.
"One, two, three, four, five," Lukas said, deadpan. 
 Nobody got it.
"Come on, you got to be quicker than that," Lukas twitted the slow-witted reporters.
Five, get it? D. Wayne has now won five straight triple crown races, which nobody ever did before. That was the point of yesterday. Five straight triple crown races is a biggie. And D. Wayne did it with three different horses -- the 1994 Preakness and Belmont with Tabasco Cat, the 1995 Kentucky Derby with Thunder Gulch, the 1995 Preakness with Timber Country -- which tells you that wealthy people trust D. Wayne Lukas with their expensive horses. That is a biggie, too.
Racing needs more biggies, particularly a triple crown horse, to draw people back to the Belmont. The joint is haunted by the big red horse who came thundering down the straightaway in 1973, winning by 31 lengths. At the Belmont, everybody knows there will never be another Secretariat. That's history. That's tradition. It's also a downer.
The Kentucky Derby and the Preakness are gigantic garden parties, but the Belmont is becoming a drag. Yesterday's attendance on a cool but unthreatening afternoon was 37,171, the lowest Belmont in at least half a century. It's nice to know that racing in New York is not trying to show up poor baseball, a sign of professional respect from one sport to another.
The Belmont often used to draw in the 50's and 60's, but last year the attendance dropped to 42,695. The lowest attendance on record was 38,477 in 1959, and yesterday the crowd fell below that.
Where was everybody? Maybe thousands of people decided not to come after hearing that Timber Country was scratched from yesterday's Belmont, late Friday afternoon. The Preakness winner had a fever for a brief time, but Lukas took no chances and scratched him.
Poor Lukas. He was now down to one triple crown horse. He started this season, five weeks ago with three -- Serena's Song, Thunder Gulch and Timber Country. He raved about the toughness of Serena's Song and the potential of Timber Country, and he conceded Thunder Gulch was a "stepchild." But Lukas is cool. When Thunder Gulch stole the Derby, he promptly said with a straight face that he had always liked the colt.
He loved him even more yesterday when the afterthought rumbled past Star Standard (with Julie Krone apparently trying to keep her horse from lugging out) to take the Belmont, too. It's almost too late for Thunder Gulch to get a huge amount of respect, but Lukas is getting his. And he wants all of it.
When he finally whipped the audio into shape yesterday, Lukas bristled at a question that he only began racing thoroughbreds in 1978. He delivered a rather crisp travelogue of all the bush-league tracks where he not only raced horses but built his own barns, too. He didn't just put away his basketball coach's whistle in 1978 and start training horses. D. Wayne Lukas was not born yesterday.
He's heading down the stretch toward 60 on Sept. 2, and he sends horses out in twos and threes sometimes. And yes, the trainer from Wisconsin is still hungry.
"Wayne's going for this record, it gets a little heavy," admitted Gary Stevens, who was relieved he hadn't messed up Wayne's personal triple crown.
Lukas was asked about his place in history. He gave the feeling he has one. "Statistically, we have made a place," Lukas said. "We've carved out a spot in the sport."
Then he gave a few reasons for his success: "All the great ones, Charlie Whittingham, Woody Stephens in his heyday, had an unbelievable work ethic." And, "You have to have a feel for it. I change my mind daily." And, "You have to have a bad memory, there are so many setbacks, they'll eat you up." And, "The owners have to believe in your philosophy."
There was a rough period a few years ago when the economics were bad, but the owners believe in D. Wayne Lukas -- a hot hand in a chilly age at the Belmont.

HEADLINE: Common Sense on Immigration

 BODY:
A bipartisan Federal commission proposed last week that the United States slash legal immigration by one-third and virtually close the nation's borders to "extended" family members of American citizens. President Clinton swiftly embraced the report. But after representatives of Asian and Hispanic immigrants complained bitterly, the President's press secretary volunteered that perhaps the White House had not carefully considered all the issues.
 The press secretary spoke the truth. The White House seems to have reacted before deliberating carefully on an issue that begs for deft handling. Immigration, along with affirmative action, promises to become an incendiary issue in the 1996 elections. It plays to racial fears. It plays to economic fears of workers whose wages have stagnated for two decades. The President can easily embrace the commission's basic policy thrust: admit more skilled, and fewer unskilled, workers. But he should hesitate before endorsing its proposal to reduce immigration levels and impose a "fee" on employers who hire foreign professionals. 
 The emotional issues aside, immigration is a tough subject to get right because so little is known about its economic impact. Historically, the United States has been enriched by a steady influx of energetic and ambitious immigrants. But no one knows whether current levels, about 900,000 a year, are too low or too high. There are, however, disturbing trends. Twenty years ago, immigrants and those born in America were equally educated and earned equivalent wages. Since then, the percentage of immigrants who have dropped out of high school has risen and their wages fallen. In the 1970's, immigrants collected relatively little welfare; now they depend on welfare more than the native born do.
 Since the early 1970's, the gap between the earnings of college graduates and high school dropout has risen by more than 50 percent. Experts disagree, but many believe that low-skilled immigrants have driven down the earnings of low-wage native-born workers who compete for the same jobs. A study by Prof. George Borjas of the University of California estimates that perhaps a third of the increased inequality can be traced to immigration.
 The commission would lower annual immigration from 900,000 to 550,000. It would reserve 400,000 slots for members of an American citizen's nuclear family (primarily young children and spouses). But it would end the current law's preferential treatment of siblings and other extended-family members -- a provision that has inflamed Asian-American and Hispanic families.
 The commission would reserve 100,000 slots for workers who receive job offers from American employers -- a drop from current levels but high enough, the commission believes, to accommodate employer demand. But, in a change from current law, few of these job-based slots would be allocated to workers who lack a college degree.
 The logic of the plan is clear. For humanitarian reasons, immigration slots would first go to members of a nuclear family. All other slots would be restricted to skilled workers. The total would bring immigration back down to the levels of the early 1980's. These proposals are defensible.
 But they come at a cost of shutting out brothers, sisters, adult children and others whom America has often welcomed. Thus Congress will be obliged to raise and debate alternatives. Congress could create additional slots for family unification, but choose among the applicants on the basis of skills they would bring to the work force. That could unite families, recruit skilled workers and protect the nation's low-wage employees.
 Some of the commission's ideas are hard to defend. It would, for example, tax employers who recruit skilled foreign workers and make the employer pay them above-market wages. That idea runs counter to the goals of bringing valuable skills to the economy and closing the earnings gap between high-paid and low-paid workers.
 The forthcoming debate on immigration will take surprising turns. The ordinarily unified Republicans are deeply split -- with Senator Alan Simpson and Gov. Pete Wilson urging restrictions while the House majority leader, Dick Armey, urges the opposite. The commission has provided some reasonable words on a deeply sensitive issue. But they are surely not the final words.

McMullen's 'Suiteheart' Plan: Run the Arena

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

 BODY:
INCHING their way south, the Devils were on a bus last night to Philadelphia for today's fifth game of their Stanley Cup playoff that is now 2-2 after yesterday's 4-2 loss. But the bus wasn't going on to Nashville. At least not yet.
"We're not going to do anything," John McMullen was saying, "until our playoffs are over."
In a two-and-a-half-hour conversation with three New York Times reporters at his Norton Lilly International shipping headquarters in nearby Secaucus, the Devils' owner insisted that "it's not too late" for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to keep the team in Byrne Meadowlands Arena but it can't keep dawdling.
"You know what Nashville is offering," McMullen said, as if talking to the state agency. "Give us a proposal." 
 Around that same time Friday afternoon, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was telling the Devils to put a proposal on the table.
So while all the country-and-western fiddlers in Nashville fiddle, the Devils' future in the Meadowlands is burning.
Nashville is offering a new $120 million arena, a $20 million relocation payment, 100 percent of game-ticket revenue (including luxury suites), 75 percent of parking fees and 40 percent of gross revenue on concessions. Even so, McMullen indicated he would keep the hockey team here if the Devils operated the arena.
"I want to run it," he said.
That's the crux of this power struggle. McMullen wants a luxury-suiteheart deal here in order to lift the Devils to the economic level of other National Hockey League teams with new arenas either already open or under construction. But the sports authority doesn't want to relinquish its control over the 19,040-seat (for hockey) arena in its Sports Complex with Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands race track.
"The sports authority doesn't care about us; they'd rather have us leave," the 77-year-old shipping tycoon said. "They told us, 'We can make more money with rock concerts.' "
In the N.H.L. bylaws, 24 guidelines pertain to the possibility of a team moving to another market. McMullen was asked to respond to those guidelines that mostly pertain to the Devils-to-Nashville situation. The guidelines and his answers:
Are the Devils financially viable where they are? "No."
Have the fans historically supported the club? "Yes."
Have the Devils historically operated profitably? "No."
Has he made a good-faith offer to sell the Devils to someone who would keep the club here? "I don't intend to sell."
Are the arena authorities willing to remedy any deficiencies in the arena? "No willingness as of yet."
Would the departure of the Devils to Nashville damage the N.H.L.'s image? "I don't think so."
Would a proposed transfer adversely affect traditional rivalries? "Our rivalry with the Rangers, yes."
If the Devils leave, would the sports authority sue the N.H.L. to enforce its lease? "Ask the authority."
When the questions and answers ended, Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' general manager who accompanied McMullen to Friday's meeting, issued a reminder.
"The commissioner," Lamoriello said of Gary Bettman, "is the sole interpreter of all the bylaws."
Bettman has described the Byrne Meadowlands Arena and the Devils' television contract as "substandard." Bettman also has suggested that the sports authority's conduct "presents a very serious issue." To that, Charles Francis, the authority chairman, insisted that it has honored all its obligations, commitments and responsibilities to the Devils.
McMullen remained bitter that the authority suspended the Devils' lease on Dec. 22 during the N.H.L. labor dispute.
But when Lamoriello was asked if he had visited Nashville, as reported, to talk to officials there in December before the arena lease was suspended, the general manager declined to answer.
So it goes, this power struggle between the Devils and the sports authority over the hockey team's future either here or in Nashville.
Although the Devils' arena here opened in 1982 and is considered to have better sightlines than Madison Square Garden, McMullen sounded transfixed by the new arenas that will enable the Boston Bruins, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Buffalo Sabres, among others, to retain so much more income than the Devils do now.
That's why McMullen wants a luxury-suiteheart deal involving control of the Byrne Meadowlands Arena, the equivalent of having your cake and eating it, too. So far that cake has fallen flat with the Governor and the sports authority.
The more John McMullen talked on Friday, the more his heart still seemed to be in New Jersey, where he was born and bred and lives. He complained that "nobody has ever said 'thanks' to me" for bringing the Devils here in 1982 after purchasing the Colorado franchise and for building a Stanley Cup contender.
But any multimillionaire businessman's heart is only as true as the best deal he can make.

HEADLINE: The Bureaucracy: What's Left To Shrink?

 BODY:
Republicans have been complaining loudly that government is America's No. 1 growth industry, bigger than cars, computers or even health care. The only way to curb this rampant monster? Shift more and more responsibility from Washington to state capitals and city halls.
 You'd never guess from all that complaining that the Federal bureaucracy, far from burgeoning, has been shrinking. Nor would you guess that all the growth in government has occurred at the state and local level. 
 It's true though.
 The Government's own employment data, reported every month since 1939 by the Department of Labor, show that Federal jobs, not counting the military, are a smaller share of all jobs now than at any time since the eve of World War II. The ratio of Federal bureaucrats to American citizens is lower -- a lot lower -- than it was when Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House. Since the end of the 1980's, while the economy has added 8 million jobs, the number of civil servants has dropped, to 2.8 million from 3 million.
 Granted, nobody would argue that a smaller Federal payroll means that the Federal Government is less powerful than it used to be. It is spending as much money as it ever did. Equally important, Washington makes the rules. Robert Higgs, an economist and author of "Crisis and Leviathan," the conservative classic about the natural tendency of government to grow over time, points out that government employment "only counts the people who work for the government, not all the people who are only doing what they're doing because of the government."
 Nonetheless, the image of a Government vastly more bloated than it was in the golden 1950's and 60's is clearly misleading.
 The shrinkage of the Federal bureaucracy isn't tied to one political party, either. It started not when Ronald Reagan moved into the White House, but when Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton were in still in college, in the mid-60's, not long after Lyndon B. Johnson coined the term "Great Society."
 And the bureaucracy's failure to grow in lockstep with the economy can't be traced to any single group of workers. The number of civilian defense workers, who account for a bit more than a quarter of Federal employees, dwindled after Vietnam and the end of the cold war. But so did the number of postal workers, who make up almost as large a share of the total. And so did the other categories, include everyone from Department of Agriculture meat inspectors to national park rangers to National Institutes of Health physicians.
 What growth there has been in government employment, it turns out, has been at the state and local level, exactly where the Republican reformers think government should be most active. But this shift is no product of the recent anti-Washington mood. The biggest expansion of payrolls took place in the 1950's, 1960's and early 1970's, when the 75 million-strong baby boom generation flooded into schools and suburbanization placed heavy demands for roads and other public works. And while some of the growth in state and especially local government jobs undoubtedly reflects mandates like Medicare that are imposed by Washington, most of it has been driven by education. Half of the 17 million state and local workers work in the schools.
 Indeed, as states and local governments have taken on larger roles, the Federal Government's function has changed as well. As entitlement programs have grown, much of what Washington does involves gathering taxes and transferring money to people who get Government checks, whether it's farmers who get crop payments, mothers who collect welfare, students who receive subsidized loans or people who get Medicare reimbursements.
 "The Federal Government has gone from being a service provider to being a provider of cash," said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization in Washington, "and that doesn't take a lot of people."

HEADLINE: In Budget Battle Between Mayor and the Council, the Devil Is in the Details

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
There is a small nursery at New York Foundling Hospital in Manhattan, supported by the taxpayers of the City of New York, where troubled parents can drop off their children for a day or so when for whatever reason -- drugs, illness, domestic violence -- they feel they can no longer cope.
It is only one of scores of programs that have given New York City its national reputation for expansive social services. And it is one of the programs that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says the city can no longer afford. 
 With the city facing a $3.1 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins in less than three weeks, the Mayor and the City Council have moved the fight over the city's budget from the abstract political debate of recent months to the specific debate over whether the city will continue to pay for places like the Foundling Hospital nursery.
Saying the city had to end what he often calls "out of control" spending, Mr. Giuliani, the Republican who has pledged to wrestle the city's fiscal problems under control, has proposed a $31.1 billion budget that includes the largest cut in total spending since World War II. His budget would reduce spending to myriad services, affecting millions of New Yorkers in ways large and small -- from schoolchildren to the mentally ill.
To the Democrats on the City Council, as well as advocates for various services, the Mayor's budget has put on the chopping block some of the very services and programs that have made up the city's historic mission: to provide for the young and old, the ill and the poor.
The budget would, for example, sharply cut music and arts classes and summer school in public schools, while junior varsity sports and the summer youth competition known as the Big Apple Games would be eliminated. It would slash funding for foster care and for preventive services intended to keep the children of troubled families out of foster care.
It would trim the city subsidies of cultural institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Arts, while hitting more than 400 smaller arts groups even harder. It would cut street-cleaning in central business districts and on major highways, reduce recycling outreach efforts and end financing for virtually all the city's youth services.
"The impact of these cuts are going to be the worst anybody has seen in years," said Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Democrat from Manhattan. "There are people who think they are immune to all these cuts, but they're going to feel it every way."
As the Mayor and the Council continued to negotiate over the weekend -- mostly, as with the state's budget process, behind closed doors -- many Council members have pledged to restore many of the cuts. But they acknowledge that the sobering reality of the city's nagging budget problems leaves little room to preserve them all.
In fact, the realization last week that the state's budget had given the city $670 million less in assistance than the Mayor sought has made a difficult task even more so -- with Mr. Giuliani proposing still deeper cuts to schools, hospitals and welfare recipients.
The League Treatment Center, which operates five-day programs in Brooklyn for mentally retarded and disturbed adults and children, faces a $500,000 cut from the city, which triggers another $1 million in cuts in matching state funds -- 10 percent of the center's $15 million budget.
The executive director, Hannah Achtenberg Kinn, said although the cut may not mean closing, it could mean ending special work programs for retarded adults. "These are vulnerable, vulnerable people," she said. "Where will they go?"
Council leaders have called for softening the blow of some of the cuts by finding other, still-unspecified ways to balance the budget. They say the Mayor should agree to such measures as selling assets or refinancing debt, which cost the city in the future but mean fewer cuts now. The Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, has also proposed raising property taxes on single- to three-family homes that are used solely as rentals, raising $80 million that he said could offset the worst budget cuts.
"A budget hole of this size can't be solved with cuts alone," the Council's finance director, Thomas L. McMahon, said.
So far, Mr. Giuliani has rejected those ideas, forcing the Council's negotiators into a difficult calculus: each dollar restored in one area means they have to propose another dollar to cut elsewhere.
What is at stake are scores of services and programs like the center at Foundling, called the Crisis Nursery. Taken singly, each makes up only a fraction of a $31.1 billion budget -- the nursery, for example, receives only $93,000 a year from the city -- but together they add up to millions.
Mr. Giuliani has argued that the city must wrench down the size of government if the city hopes to revive its sluggish economy. Even so, he says that the budget cuts will still leave New York with the most generous services of any city in the nation. And he has characterized the most dire warnings raised by his opponents as exaggerations, saying the budget cuts last year have not markedly affected people's lives.
"Believe me, you will hear all of the predictions about how terrible all these cuts are going to be," the Mayor said recently. "You will hear the same predictions you heard last year. The end result is I'll stand here a year from now, and we will not have the kind of impact those people who argue in favor of this spending and try to pretend it will happen."
But for the people who run the Crisis Nursery, the Mayor's budget has raised the specter of closing a program they say has saved children from abuse, neglect and even death.
Opened in 1982 with the support of Mayor Edward I. Koch, the nursery operates as a respite for children who face abuse or neglect. The nursery can accommodate 10 children, offering meals and beds and everything in between. For parents, the nursery tries to locate needed services -- from detox to counseling -- to prevent abuse and to hold families together. It also operates a 24-hour hotline.
The $93,000 the nursery gets from the city's budget enables it to receive three times that in state matching funds -- its entire budget except for administrative support from the Foundling Hospital.
Echoing the criticism by other advocates, Sister Helen Murphy, the executive director of Foundling, said the cuts would prove counterproductive. "It's cheaper," she said of programs like the nursery. "That's a horrible word to use when you're talking about people, but it costs less to have them in preventive services than in foster care."
Not all the Mayor's cuts would fall on the neediest. Many, advocates say, would land squarely on the working and middle classes -- from the cuts to local arts groups to the elimination of junior varsity sports in high schools in all five boroughs to the reduction in the city's subsidy to the Transit Authority, which could end free passes on subway and buses for schoolchildren.
For Adenike Cumberland, a sophomore who lives in Far Rockaway, Queens, and rides the subway to high school in Manhattan, the cut in subway passes would cost her parents dearly since an extra $2.50 a day quickly adds up. "I don't know how I'd get to school," she said, "unless I swim across the bay."
To critics of the Mayor and to an extent the Council, it is the budget's impact on ordinary New Yorkers that has often been obscured in the political and fiscal debates.
"The Mayor has looked at the budget as a purely mathematical problem," said Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens Committee for Children, a nonprofit advocacy group that has criticized Mr. Giuliani's cuts to schools and youth programs. "The fact is what's at stake is not as flat as that: it's human."


GRAPHIC: These are the highlights of budget cuts proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani that are the subject of the some of the sharpest disputes with the City Council. The cuts do not include an additional $400 million in contingency cuts to libraries, day-care centers and hospitals that Mr. Giuliani has said he will impose to cover a shortfall in aid from the state budget but that the Council has vowed to oppose.
 
BOARD OF EDUCATION -- $754 million
Chart: "AT STAKE: New York City Budget Cuts"
Sharply reduces arts and music programs, counseling, after-school programs, junior varsity sports and summer school for all but graduating seniors.
Assumes $190 million in savings from the teachers' union still to be negotiated by the Mayor's office.
As it stands, officials warn that $400 million in added cuts would be passed on to local school districts, prompting cuts to the classrooms and possibly layoffs of teachers, principals and aides.
 
SOCIAL SERVICES -- $189 million
More closely screens eligibility of recipients of welfare and Medicaid recipients.
Cuts $50 million from foster care, reducing payments to private agencies and foster parents and $10 million in preventative services designed to keep families together and their children out of foster care.
 
SUBWAYS AND BUSES -- $128 million
Ends the city's subsidy of free passes on subways and buses for schoolchildren. The city expects the Transit Authority to pick up the cost, which is has not said it will do.
 
HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- $23 million
Includes a $13 million phasing out of a program that renovates apartments for the homeless.
 
YOUTH SERVICES -- $20 million
Would eliminate most city-funded youth recreational and educational programs except the Beacon Schools, the after-hour programs at 37 schools.
 
CULTURAL AFFAIRS -- $18 million
Cuts $6.6 million, or 10 percent, from the city's major museums and arts groups and imposes a 5 percent reduction in energy subsidies.
Cuts $10 million, or 80 percent, from over 450 smaller arts and theater groups, a part of which would be made up with a program under which the city provides $7.5 million in matching grants for groups that raise new funds.
 
SANITATION -- $16 million
Eliminates special cleaning in central business districts, cancels planned growth in the number of motorized litter patrols and closes three of seven residential bulk dump sites. Also cuts $6.4 million in recycling education and outreach programs.
 
TRANSPORTATION -- $14.5 million
Eliminates monthly discount fares for private express buses, and raise fares overall by $1, to $5 per trip.
Reduces funding for arterial cleaning and maintenance and pothole repairs.

HEADLINE: Research Park Rising on Site of Audubon Ballroom

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THE grainy black and white photographs in the architect's office show an empty room with folding chairs pushed haphazardly aside. Tiny black dots ringed with white chalk -- bullet holes outlined by police technicians -- pepper the podium.
After a decade of major and minor confrontations among a kaleidoscopic array of city agencies, Washington Heights residents and officials of Columbia University, 40 percent of that room -- where Malcolm X was assassinated on Feb. 21, 1965 -- still stands, newly shrouded in white sheetrock and waiting for its promised museum and memorial. 
 Only five years ago the building, the Audubon Ballroom, a fanciful entertainment complex built in 1912 at Broadway between 165th and 166th Streets and decorated with red foxes and a blue and green tympanum of Neptune and a maiden riding a tempestuous sea, was destined for destruction. But through the efforts of Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, along with a number of community groups, about two-thirds of the exterior of the two-story complex has been preserved and a painstaking $7 million restoration has just been finished.
A new six-story, $28 million structure of gray-painted aluminum and green glass, designed by the architectural firm of Davis, Brody & Associates, has been built about 15 feet behind the facade of the old building. The terra-cotta encrusted structure once housed, in addition to the ballroom, a 2,500-seat movie theater, a 200-seat cabaret and a downstairs bistro where magic tricks were performed.
The new 105,000-square-foot structure is part of a planned five-building Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park across the street from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The new building was built by Columbia University to house individual laboratory facilities for a group of still undetermined emerging biotechnology companies, and is just receiving its finishing touches. Along Broadway and wrapping around the corner of 165th Street, all the bays of the original decorative facade have been restored, but the huge brick back end of the old San Juan Theater has been demolished, leaving what is now an empty lot.
After the first commercial laboratory building fills up, Columbia plans to build another commercial laboratory on the lot. Mitch Gipson, the Columbia official in charge of leasing, said he was negotiating with three or four companies that were looking for anywhere from 1,000 to 12,000 square feet apiece in the building that has just been completed.
Some of these potential tenants "are quite serious and some are just kicking the tires," Mr. Gipson said. Columbia plans to spend about $5 million inside the new lab, fitting out what is now raw space for its tenants, building partitions, lab benches and other amenities.
GROUNDBREAKING for the second building in the complex, the 170,000-square-foot, $65 million Center for Disease Prevention, is scheduled for June 19. This second building, across St. Nicholas Avenue, is to be an academic research center. Davis, Brody is the architect for the entire project, including the restoration.
John S. Torborg, project architect for Davis, Brody, said the large ground floor space at the corner of West 166th Street will become a 3,200-square-foot restaurant similar to West End Gate, a restaurant at Broadway and 114th Street, across from Columbia's main campus. It is set for an October opening, he said.
A 550-square-foot shop is to be rented to one of the city's large coffee bar chains. A 3,250-square-foot Barnes and Noble is scheduled to open sometime in July.
Above the two restaurants and the book store will be a city health clinic promised to the residents. Bids for construction are out, and the city is negotiating with health-care providers.
In the southern half of the ground floor, bounded by West 165th Street, is a Chemical Bank branch that opened for business in February.
On the second floor, above the Chemical Bank, is the space for the memorial to Malcolm X. Money to restore the exterior of the historic building and renovate the interior shell came from a combination of city and state agencies, primarily the Urban Development Corporation and the Economic Development Corporation; the original seed money was provided by Ms. Messinger's office.
But there is some confusion about where the $1 million to furnish the memorial museum -- a rough estimate from the architects -- is to come from. "Money's always been an issue," said Mr. Gipson of Columbia. "It's never been resolved how you'd pay for it. Everybody is aware of the issue."
According to Howard Dodson, head of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, who is part of an advisory committee named several years ago by then-Mayor David N. Dinkins and charged with developing a plan for the memorial, the "ball is with the city."
"Somehow, millions of dollars were appropriated for the buildings and no funds were appropriated for the specific activities within it," Mr. Dodson said. "I'm sure eventually there will be a memorial."
According to Marty Algaze, a spokesman for Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, the ball is in Mr. Dodson's court.
"We're waiting to get a proposal on the table" from Mr. Dodson's group "so we can discuss where the funding will come from -- whether private or city," Mr. Algaze said.
Dr. William Polf, Columbia's vice president for strategic planning, said that although the university was only involved in an informal way, his associate, Mr. Gipson, may have come up with a possible solution that is to presented to the parties involved in a week or so. He declined to elaborate. Mr. Gipson also declined to comment, citing the "extremely political" nature of the discussion.
Right now, plans are going ahead to finish the lobby to the memorial -- which the architects said was once the elaborate niche-filled, plaster-decorated entrance to the movie palace. The terrazzo floor has been restored and extended to what will become a curving lobby stage.
A life-size bronze statue of Malcolm X by Gabriel Koren has been commissioned with city money; a maquette was finished several weeks ago. Another large mural -- depicting Malcolm X's life -- is being designed by Daniel Galvez, a West Coast artist, for the long wall in the memorial space.
THE wooden stage, where Malcolm X was standing when he was shot, has been dismantled and preserved, but the architects said it was so rotted that a new one must be built, perhaps symbolically incorporating some sections of the old one.
Lew Davis, a partner in the architectural firm, said the outside of the new building, with its gray aluminum panels and green glass windows echoing the Alpine green of the wooden trim of the old Audubon, was designed as a "background building" to show off the ornament and style of the older building.
J. Max Bond, another partner, called the building "neutral and gridded" and said the six-story height echoed the height of neighborhood tenements.
On the 166th Street side, where several bays of the 1913 building were demolished for the entrance to the new laboratory, the new building is neatly fitted to the old, with the creamy terra cotta of the old butting the limestone-colored concrete of the new.
The project is not without its critics.
"In terms of a fitting memorial to Malcolm X, it still strikes me as an injustice," said Michael Henry Adams, a Harlem preservationist. "To take part of something, tear it down, build on top of it and present it to the people is an injustice."
But Mr. Adams said he had been wrong several years ago, when he announced it would be better to tear the Audubon Ballroom down than to leave just fragments.
"I think now that I was wrong," he said. "It's just like people might say it would be better to tear the Parthenon down rather than leave it in a ruinous condition; they still can learn from it. And people from all over the world will come to see the Audubon. Thee quality of the architecture is so high; they retained all the plasterwork and the terra cotta for all to see."
The decision not to save the whole building, he said, will nevertheless be judged by history "to be as irresponsible an act of vandalism as the destruction of Penn Station."
"Unfortunately," he said, "we don't seem to learn much from our mistakes."

HEADLINE: The World;
Racism? Mexico's in Denial.

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
SHROUDED in mystery and myth, the heroes of Mexico's Aztec past are honored in glorious monuments all over the country.
 But the living descendants of Moctezuma are not allowed to eat in some of Mexico City's best restaurants. 
 Although all Mexicans are considered equal under the country's Constitution, Mexican society remains deeply divided on racial lines. And as the richest and poorest of the 91 million Mexicans are driven farther apart by such sweeping changes as the North American Free Trade Agreement, many Mexicans are starting to discover the dangers of their own deeply ingrained -- yet rarely acknowledged -- brand of bigotry.
 The racial inequities are not just limited to the Maya Indians in the state of Chiapas who took up arms on the very day Nafta took effect more than a year ago, in what is slowly taking on shades of a national civil rights movement for Indians. Indigenous people all over Mexico, and those with Indian features -- and dark skins -- all feel a degree of the same kind of intolerance.

 
 
Bigotry? What Bigotry?
 While Mexicans typically deny that discrimination exists, the not-so-subtle racial undertones of their society are apparent to foreigners who live and work here since Nafta was passed. When Henry B. McDonald, director of the Cushman & Wakefield Real Estate office in Mexico City took his family out for dinner last November, he didn't think twice about inviting his 45-year-old housekeeper, Gabriela Miranda, an Indian. It was a Friday night and they went to a popular Italian restaurant called Prego in the Polanco section of Mexico City.
 "We got there early by Mexican standards, around 7:45, and the place was empty," Mr. McDonald said. "But we stood there waiting and waiting until finally the maitre'd came along and told me, in English, that domestics are not served here." Mrs. Miranda was not wearing a uniform, Mr. McDonald said. The restaurant simply assumed that because she was an Indian she was a maid.
 The restaurant manager, Mario Padilla, acknowledged that it is policy at Prego and other top restaurants to prohibit servants and drivers, many of whom are Indians. "The type of people who usually come to restaurants of this class all have servants, but they usually leave them at home," Mr. Padilla said. He said the restriction was needed to protect patrons against people who "lack discretion" and try to bring their servants. He denied the policy was discriminatory. "We're not racists," he said. "We're just trying to protect the image of the restaurant."

 
 
Social Tension
 Now that Mexico is struggling to overcome an economic crisis caused by the peso's devaluation last December, there is concern that racial tensions will flare. More than half a million Mexicans have been thrown out of work in the last six months, and the struggle to survive is likely to be decided on the basis of education, access to money and cultural connections, all of which are based in large part on racial identity.
 "There is going to be a sharp increase in social tensions," said Sergio Aguayo, a human rights activist in Mexico City, "and some of it is going to be racially inspired."
 Bias against Indians has long been more economic than personal. Sixty percent of Indians over 12 are already unemployed and of those who work most earn less than the minimum wage of about $2.50 a day.
 But most Mexicans say bigotry does not exist here. Schoolchildren are drilled on the life of Benito Juarez, a Zapotec Indian who was President of Mexico in the 19th century, and told that his election proves all Mexicans are equal. Mexico has no affirmative action laws. The National Commission of Human Rights has never received a discrimination complaint and does not even have a process to handle one.
 Complicating questions of race is the mixed lineage of most Mexicans. From the Spanish founding of Mexico, social class has been determined by racial purity, with those born in Spain at the top, and full-blooded Indians on the bottom. But over centuries of intermarriage, nearly all Mexicans are considered part Indian.
 Now it is the degree of Indianness, or the darkness of brown skin, that determines status. Many Mexicans living in the cities rely on hair dyes, skin lighteners and blue or green contact lenses to appear more white or European and less Indian.
 "Yes, Mexicans honor their Indian roots with statues," said Miguel Acosta, an investigator at the Mexican Academy of Human Rights at the Autonomous National University of Mexico, "but historic roots are not at all useful when it comes to eating or just living today."
 Mexico City has the highest concentration of Indians in the country, yet most times they are nearly invisible, showing up only in knots of beggars at busy intersections and among the feathered dancers who perform for tourists. No Indians serve in the Cabinet of President Ernesto Zedillo and only a handful are in the Congress, although 1 in 10 Mexicans is considered Indian.
 The racial insensitivity extends to blacks, although few live in Mexico. A recent commercial on national television featured a dark-skinned man in a white tuxedo telling viewers that at Comex, a Mexican paint company, "they're working like niggers to offer you a white sale."
 There were no complaints about the ad "because we don't have a racism problem -- that's the key to it all," said Marisela Vergada, an account executive at Alazraki Agency, the large Mexican advertising firm that produced the 20-second spot. "It is simply an expression that everyone uses."
 Such "expressions" pop up in a commercial for packaged toast that features a black baker boasting that his skin color gives him the expertise to recognize the right shade of toast. Aunt Jemima pancake mix goes by the brand name "La Negrita" here.

 
 
'Racial Hierarchy'
 The few blacks who live in Mexico are either immigrants or the descendants of about 200,000 African slaves brought here before slavery was abolished in 1829. While researching a book about African slaves in Mexico, Colin A. Palmer, a history professor at the graduate center of the City University of New York, said he quickly noticed that beneath an initial friendliness "a racial hierarchy existed in Mexico."
 "It is based on skin color, with white the higher value as opposed to those who are brown and those, God forbid, who are black," Professor Palmer said.
 Mexican society's denial that discrimination exists makes it more difficult to combat. "In that regard it is worse than in the United States, where it is recognized and a lot of people of good will are trying to change it," Professor Palmer said. "By and large in Mexico it is unrecognized and unaddressed, which leads to a perpetuation of the status quo and a continuing assault on people of African or Indian descent."
 Visiting Americans sometimes get a taste of the same bigotry. Michael Waller, president of Cleveland Telecomunications Corp., of Solon, Ohio, accompanied United States Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on a Nafta-related business trip to Mexico a year ago. He said Mexicans were eager to talk to an American businessman on the telephone. But that changed when he arrived.
 "It was obvious from the moment I came into the airport and people reacted as if I had been beamed down from the Enterprise," Mr. Waller, who is black, said. "I guess what they expected was what they saw on TV, the Crips and the Bloods, you know, that kind of thing." He said that when he did not receive a single follow-up letter, he decided to focus on multiracial Brazil, where he now has several deals pending.

HEADLINE: ...and Then There Were 2

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SURELY, when Americans talk about the need to shrink government, this can't be what they have in mind.
For the first time in its 61-year history, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Government agency responsible for safeguarding trillions of dollars of investors' money, may operate with only two commissioners, both Democrats. 
 Set up in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash to restore faith in the nation's securities markets, the commission was deliberately established as a bipartisan agency whose five voting members were to be selected by the President and confirmed by the Senate. These men and women police the securities industry, voting on whether to take enforcement actions against companies believed to have violated Federal securities laws. They also determine the rules by which everyone involved in the nation's stock and bond markets must play.
But of late, the commission is a child of neglect, an odd status for one of the few Government agencies that actually makes money -- lots of it, in fact. No one powerful has it in for the agency, but no one particularly cares about it either. What's more, the White House, which already has a record of botching high-level appointments, has its hands full, what with the crisis in Bosnia and the battle of the budget. So, unlike vacancies on the Supreme Court, which all of Washington would be scrambling to help fill, the S.E.C. is making little progress filling the openings for its $115,700-a-year commissioner jobs.
"It's a deplorable situation," said A. A. Sommer Jr. a former S.E.C. commissioner appointed by President Carter. "The failure of the Administration to make timely appointments tends to signal the Administration doesn't consider the commission important."
Two seats have been empty since the departures last year of Mary L. Schapiro and J. Carter Beese Jr. And barring immediate intervention from the White House and Congress, the shortage of commissioners will become more acute this month when Richard Y. Roberts, who was appointed as a Democrat but now considers himself a Republican, is expected to step down.
That would leave only Arthur Levitt Jr., the commission's chairman for the last two years, and Steven M. H. Wallman, a newcomer who is just learning the ropes, in place to conduct business. To avert total gridlock and "preserve its flexibility" in the event its numbers dwindle even further, the agency changed its rules in April so that one commissioner, rather than the customary three, could function as a quorum should it become necessary.
But the remaining commissioners are painfully aware that anything they tackle on their own could be challenged in court later. "I'm hopeful that the process will develop to nominate and recommend to the Senate very, very quickly," said Mr. Levitt. "I need and want commissioners."
A White House spokeswoman, Ginny Terzano, would not discuss candidates, but said the Administration was "in the process of filling the vacancies." A spokesman for Senator Bob Dole, the Republican majority leader, said he could not be reached on Friday.
AT least some Washington officials insist that nominations are imminent. But at the very least, the delays pose some awkward problems for those who have to hold down the fort while the politicians deliberate. For instance, the sixth floor of 450 Fifth Street in northwest Washington, where the commissioners could once be found vigorously debating one issue or another, is eerily quiet these days. Because sunshine laws require that any gathering of commissioners sufficient for a quorum be publicized in advance, Mr. Levitt and Mr. Wallman can't be seen talking shop much at all.
And what to do, for instance, if they split down the middle on a crucial vote, as they are likely to do given their different temperaments and agendas? Mr. Wallman is an intense corporate lawyer who favors easing the S.E.C.'s filing requirements, while Mr. Levitt is a genial businessman who is more concerned with winning points with small investors by cleaning up the municipal-bond business. They've already been said to have some dust-ups. "It's become the incredible shrinking agency," said a former commissioner who insisted on anonymity.
The situation would almost be funny except the agency has so much on its plate. The mounting debate in Congress over securities litigation reform, which would make it harder for individuals to sue companies, would place more of the burden of investor protection on regulators. Mr. Levitt, a popular figure here, has come out swinging against many of the proposals, but would be helped greatly if he had a Republican commissioner by his side.
In coming months, the S.E.C. must also weigh in on such fundamental issues as how the nation's regulatory framework applies to banks, insurers and securities firms as the barriers between their activities under the Glass-Steagall Act erode. The agency is also expected to play a role in reviewing the operations of the country's second-largest stock market, operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers. Its market-makers, the firms that buy and sell over-the-counter securities, are under investigation by the Department of Justice for possible violations of antitrust law.
"I think it is important for the commission, the people who work with the commission and the people the commission regulates to know where it is headed," said Philip Feigin, the president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which represents state regulators. "For all Arthur Levitt's energy and the like, it's still an incomplete vision."
Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, issued a similar warning last month in a letter he sent President Clinton. "It will be very difficult for the commission to conduct routine business with only two commissioners," the letter stated, "much less to make important policy decisions for our nation's financial markets."
In essence, it chided the President for squandering an opportunity to shape an important Government agency: "The new appointments which you must soon make will comprise the majority of members of the commission and will in large part determine the course it wil follow over the next five years."
THE calming presence of the agency's commissioners would also be handy, to say the least, if the stock market suddenly developed a bad case of nerves. With just two commissioners, both of whom have hectic travel schedules, the agency could have no commissioner in Washington on a day when stocks plunged, a growing possibility as the Dow Jones industrial average flirts with new records daily.
There's also little doubt the agency could use all the help it can get to fight its battles on Capitol Hill. Those include a turf war over which regulatory body will be given the authority to monitor securities issued by banks or insurers.
Then there's the struggle to keep its budget intact. Last year, the commission collected $588.2 million just in fees it levies on companies that register with it, and it only cost $260.3 million to run, leaving taxpayers with a tidy $327.9 million surplus. For all that, the Republican Senate, for example, held up the agency's budget last fall, temporarily forcing the S.E.C. to cancel some investigations and make plans to shut down its electronic filing system.
It's no wonder Mr. Levitt is feeling a bit underappreciated these days. A longtime Wall Street executive who cofounded the brokerage firm that eventually became Shearson Brothers and later was acquired by Smith Barney, he also headed the American Stock Exchange before Mr. Clinton asked him to join the S.E.C. Since his arrival two years ago, Mr. Levitt has struggled to clean up the municipal-bond business and expand what companies disclose to investors.
He is optimistic that the staffing problem will be remedied soon. But like most everyone else in Washington, he is hard-pressed to explain why it has taken so long to replace the two commissioners who stepped down last year, let alone deal with Mr. Roberts's imminent departure, which was announced a year and a half ago.
Ordinarily, there would be plenty of takers for such a prestigious job, despite the fact that top securities lawyers, the most obvious candidates, can usually make several hundred thousand dollars more in private practice. "I can't believe there's any dearth of qualified and interested candidates," said Ms. Schapiro, a former commissioner who now runs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
But what has made the job a little less attractive, at least in the opinion of one securities lawyer, are new conflict-of-interest rules requiring anyone who leaves the job to wait five years before doing business with the agency.
A bigger hurdle by far, however, appears to be the White House's skittishness about mishandling another high-level nomination. After being criticized for bungling the nominations of Zoe Baird for Attorney General and Dr. Henry W. Foster for Surgeon General, to name just two of many, the process has become even slower as the White House seems determined to head off another Republican attack.
Thus, for tactical reasons, even though President Clinton has the power to name one more Democrat to the commission, he appears to be delaying until the Republicans come forward with a Republican name for him to propose, so that the two can be considered in tandem.
BY most accounts, no one expects the White House to risk any political capital trying to fill the fifth seat on the commission: it lapses next June anyway, and the Republicans seem to prefer waiting until 1997 when they might have one of their own as President. "White House appointments tend to get all wrapped up in political subtleties," said James Doty, a former S.E.C. counsel who is now a lawyer for the Washington firm of Baker & Botts.
What has also struck many people formerly or currently involved with the commission, is that many of the names that have surfaced as possibilities seem heavily motivated by a desire to win approval from an important constituency or Washington ally, suggesting that President Clinton does not feel he can singlehandedly strongarm his choice through a Republican Senate.
For instance, Ellen Seidman, a White House aide who once worked closely with Robert Rubin, the current Treasury Secretary, is sometimes mentioned as a candidate and would presumably have Mr. Rubin's support. Likewise, Brian Borders, the president of the Association of Publicly Traded Companies, an industry group that enjoys broad backing from small business, was briefly considered a candidate.
In the current cutthroat climate in Washington, even people once regarded as shoo-ins like Dennis Shea, a key aide to Senator Dole, have either removed themselves from consideration or been swallowed up by political intrigue. The frontrunner for the Republican bid is now thought to be not Mr. Shea, but Norman S. Johnson, 64, a Salt Lake City securities lawyer and one-time S.E.C. staff attorney. He is believed to have the support of Senators Dole and Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican.
As of last week, the White House was said to be settling on Isaac C. Hunt Jr., 57, the retiring dean of the law school at the University of Akron in Ohio, as its nominee for the remaining Democratic seat. The first black to graduate from the University of Virginia Law School, he, too, worked for a time as an S.E.C. staff attorney and went on to serve on the Kerner Commission that investigated the 1967 race riots.
To be sure, a lean S.E.C. won't bring the securities markets to a halt. Other agencies, such as the commodities futures commission, have made do with just two commissioners for periods of time. Mr. Levitt and Mr. Wallman are both well-respected, and the agency is known for its strong and capable staff. "The public shouldn't worry that the job isn't being done," said Ms. Schapiro. "It will weather this. Still, it's nice to have more hands on deck."
But even if the long-awaited list of names were announced tomorrow, it could take months to get through Congress, and then the appointees would have to get up to speed. Other forces in Washington are also at work that could set back any progress. For instance, though he strongly discourages such talk, Mr. Levitt's name is being bandied about as a possible replacement for Ronald H. Brown as Secretary of Commerce should Mr. Brown have to step down as a result of a likely investigation into his business dealings.
IN the meantime, the agency will have to make do with less than its full complement of commissioners. For instance, sometimes, a commissioner simply needs to be on hand to assist with a breaking insider-trading case, where it's necessary to convince a judge to freeze assets before they disappear.
It may also have trouble signing off on the bigger initiatives investors expect it to take. The S.E.C.'s general counsel, Simon Lorne, himself said to be a possible candidate for a top job, believes that the agency acted well within its authority when it amended its rules on quorums in April to insure that the agency could "take effective action in the event, however unlikely, that there would be a period with only one commissioner in office."
But outside lawyers aren't so sure. Defense lawyers are already said to be delving into whether a decision reached by just two commissioners, let alone one, would be legally binding. "The issue hasn't been resolved by the courts, so nobody really knows the answer," said Harvey Pitt, a former S.E.C. counsel and lawyer with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.
More troubling, even if the S.E.C. can legally operate with just one or two commissioners, it does so at the risk of its reputation. "The credibility and moral authority of the comission's actions and decisions are somewhat hindered," said Mr. Pitt.
That is at least in part because the agency has had a long unblemished record of acting independently of the commissioners' politics, as when it investigated possible securities violations by George W. Bush, the son of the former President.
Besides insuring that both major political parties are represented, the whole point of having a five-member commission, rather than an agency headed by an individual, such as the Food & Drug Administration or the Office of the Comptroller, is the belief that five minds are better than one in making critical decisions. "I was made better by my colleagues," explained Joseph A. Grundfest, a former commissioner.
Walking back to his office from lunch one afternoon a few days ago, Commissioner Roberts was stopped by a colleague who asked whether he is still at the agency. "Thirty days," the commissioner replied with a smile. Is Mr. Roberts the only one counting?

HEADLINE: For Now, the Job Outlook Is Brighter

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THREE years into the recovery, there is finally a window of opportunity for graduates entering the job market. Analysts and career counselors say the employment outlook this spring is better than it has been in five years for high school and college job applicants, with recruiting activity up and salaries on the increase.
But the advice from the experts to would-be workers is: hustle or else. 
 There are signs that the economy is slowing again, suggesting that the period of opportunity may be short lived. Career counselors and economists say that anyone hoping to get a foot in the door had better do it soon. What is more, competition is keen for the best positions.
"Things may be looking up at the moment, but grads are also having to work harder and do more to land a job than they did 5 or 10 years ago, especially those who want their dream job," said Thomas S. Corbin, an economist with the New York State Department of Labor. "The late 1980's were a golden time. It was easy to find work. The 1990's have been harder."
Computer-related occupations -- like programming and managing information systems -- offer the most opportunities for graduates, studies show. After that, the job market is good for those majoring in engineering, sales and marketing, accounting and finance and medical and health care services.
Salaries are highest for chemical engineers, who can expect to earn close to $41,000 their first year on the job, according to data compiled by the Collegiate Employment Research Institute at Michigan State University. Mechanical, electrical and industrial engineers will earn from $33,493 to $35,713 a year.
Computer science jobs pay about $33,000 a year, nursing jobs about $30,078 and accounting positions about $28,022, according to the research institute. Those in journalism and telecommunications are at the bottom of the scale, earning slightly less than $21,000 their first year.
Recruiting at colleges reflected the upbeat trend this spring, with a return to campuses of manufacturing employers, many of whom had been absent several years. Manufacturers represented automotive, electronic equipment and chemical and allied products fields, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers in Bethlehem, Pa. Colleges also reported that more companies were being represented at career and job fairs and said those employers had made early job offers to top candidates.
At Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, Carole Bieber, coordinator of career services, said that 54 employers showed up for the spring job fair in Purchase, which was sponsored by Sarah Lawrence and three other colleges, Purchase, Manhattanville and Marymount. "It is indicative of the new opportunities for liberal arts majors," Mrs. Bieber said. Recruiters attending the fair represented nonprofit agencies, law firms, advertising agencies, publishing houses, financial services, health care and human services and sales. At the Pace University campus in White Plains, Joan A. Mark, executive director of cooperative education and career services, agreed that graduates were facing "a brighter job market this year, despite all the downsizing and right sizing that is still going on."
But she has advised students to include work internships and previous job experience on their resumes in order to land an entry-level job in an extremely competitive market.
She also reported that the Internet was beginning to play a crucial role in job searches.
"All the talk now at the conferences is cyberspace, tele-interviews, writing a scannable resume," Mrs. Mark said last week on her return from a meeting of the National Association of Colleges and Employers. "Technology will increasingly play a role."
At Mercy College, Jean Harris, director of cooperative education, said students who know ahead of time what kinds of jobs they want and understand how to market their skills fare best. "I tell the students to target a career and not to go out there just looking for a job, any job," Ms. Harris said. "Job applicants have to be clear about what they want."
Vaneet Sekhei, a 23-year-old accounting major who graduated last month from Pace University, heeded the advice of his career counselors and landed an internal auditing job with Chemical Bank in Manhattan. He included three work internships on his resume, along with top grades, and began looking nine months ago.
"It's not my dream job, but it's very close to it," said Mr. Sekhei, who will be earning $30,000 a year when he reports for work later this month. "The jobs are out there, but you have to keep going at it until you find the right one."
Other students worked part time -- even at low-paying jobs like stock clerks -- hoping to parlay temporary positions into full-time employment. Others visited their schools' career-counseling offices daily to peruse the latest listings.
But for some, no matter which tactics they take, their search for employment has not proved fruitful. Consider the case of Michael Gayle, a 26-year-old Mount Vernon resident who graduated with honors this spring from the State University of New York at Albany.
The economics and political science major, who made the dean's list and was an intern in Dean Witter Reynolds' assistant stockbrokers program and was an intern management assistant for Pitney Bowes, said he has been searching for an entry-level banking position since December.
He observed that many companies were offering sales-type positions, on a commission-only basis, but he and many fellow students cannot afford to accept those jobs. "We have our student loans to pay back," he said.
Many graduates said that despite some figures showing a brighter job outlook, their experience was that conditions have not improved.
"The word on the street is that it's actually a bad year," said James Martucci, 23, who graduated late last month from Mercy College with a degree in business administration and management. "Things are tougher now. We're having to work double time to find work."
Graduates may be observing a skepticism among employers about the future of the economy, following the sluggish performance of economic indicators in recent months. Although the economy appeared to be in a recovery, employers remained conservative about hiring, and many reported that jobs obtained by college graduates were not guaranteed, according to Career Development and Placement Services of Michigan State University.
"On the negative side of the ledger were corporate right sizing, potential layoffs, potential consolidation of business operations, slower employee turnover, cost-cutting measures and increased utilization of technology and automation," a report on recruiting trends from the university said. It added that companies intent on cost saving looked for college graduates "as a cheaper payroll expenditure."
At Westchester Community College, Pauline Sonenshine, a placement coordinator, said graduates looking for jobs in the county were "having an especially tough time," because the local economy had been slower to recover from the recession. "It's still a little better than last year," she said. "There are more openings. The pay is better."
But the market remained competitive, and the versatile student who had experience in more than one field was most sought after, she said.
Using a different terminology to describe a similar phenomenon, Mr. Corbin at the State Department of Labor observed the "promising growth of the hyphenated fields."He said: "Employers are looking for biologists-writers or computer technicians-teachers."
Also, he said that with the ranks of middle-management depleted, employers were looking for mature new hires that could work independently and manage themselves.
At the high school level, the outlook for well-trained graduates -- even those who were not college bound -- was also improving, said Dr. Joseph Schwartzberg, director of occupational education for the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Education Services in Valhalla.
By contrast, high school graduates without vocational skills "are lost, they're in trouble -- on the nowhere track," Dr. Schwartzberg said.
The job placement success rate for vocational students was especially high this year for paraprofessionals and technicians, he said. Licensed practical nurses, air-conditioning and heating technicians, computer-repair technicians and automobile mechanic were in high demand.
Starting salaries for licensed practical nurses ranged from $25,000 to $35,000, Dr. Schwartzberg said. For technicians, starting pay was about $25,000 a year.
For those planning to take at least some college courses, the outlook was even brighter. Keith Millar, an 18-year-old vocational student from New Rochelle is in a three-year apprenticeship program as a cabinetmaker with a custom furniture company. He plans to take college-level business courses and go into business for himself someday.
"For students like these," Dr. Schwartzberg said, "the opportunities are endless."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Patrice Kunesh;
Defining How a Tribe Governs Its Land

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
PATRICE KUNESH of North Stonington is a counselor for the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in eastern Connecticut whose tasks include drafting amendments to the tribe's constitution.
Ms. Kunesh, a member of the Hunkpapa band of the Lakota -- the most famous member of that tribe was Sitting Bull -- is a native of Minnesota, and a 1989 graduate of the University of Colorado Law School. She worked for the Native American Rights Fund from 1988 until 1994, where she was part of a team that examined the constitutions of five tribes, including the Mashantuckets. 
 In addition to developing expertise on tribal governance, Ms. Kunesh has worked on water, oil and gas rights, tribal jurisdictional issues, and Indian child welfare matters. In 1994 she accepted a position with the Mashantuckets, the first and still one of only two federally recognized Indian tribes in the state.
Ms. Kunesh discussed tribal governance issues at her office in the Mashantucket Community Center recently. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 established constitutions for tribes -- why does the tribe need its own?
A. We have more than 500 recognized Indian tribes in the United States. Each one of those tribes is a distinct and unique sovereign nation. The Federal Government in some respects doesn't want to deal with each unique tribe, so they gave them a boilerplate constitution, or governing document.
It's very much like the Federal Constitution. What the Indian Reorganization Act constitution has is oversight by the Secretary of the Interior for many of the tribal government's actions.
Tribal governments under the Act see themselves more as puppets of the Secretary of the Interior, and those constitutions don't recognize the unique history and culture of the individual Indian tribes. We've had a system of government here for hundreds of years. The classification of that system was reduced to writing and submitted to the Secretary for Federal recognition. We wanted to maintain a system of government that reflects our history and our customs and culture.
Q. Can you give examples of how a constitution could reflect the history and culture of the tribe?
A. It's the structure of the government. A unicameral government, which you see in a lot of tribes, would have all the governmental functions in one body -- the judicial, the executive and the legislative. That creates, necessarily, some conflicts, when the person who makes the law also has to interpret the law and enforce the law. There are other tribes that have a bicameral body, a legislative-executive and a judicial.
Second, just the name of the tribe is very important. A lot of the names of tribes you see are not the names they call themselves. The Standing Rock Sioux, for instance -- Sioux is not an Indian name. We call ourselves Lakota. What Sioux actually means is enemy.
Another important part of the constitution is the preamble. Much like the preamble to the Federal Constitution, many tribal constitutions acknowledge a relationship to the Great Spirit, and that really sets the tone for the rest of the document.
The constitution defines membership -- how does a tribe decide who is eligible to be a member of the community? It defines how officials are elected -- in some tribes you have officials elected for life, in some tribes they are inherited positions, in some leadership follows through patriarchal or matriarchal lines.
Q. If the tribe has had a structure in place, why the efforts to change it?
A. With the introduction of a very strong and successful economic development project, the tribe has seen an opportunity and probably a need to take a look at its governing document and ask, "Does this give us adequate protection? Does this define the government structure? Does this allow us to do as much as possible with our community?" I think you will find it's not unique to this tribe, that tribes all over the country are reviewing their constitutions.
We're also looking at the underlying structure, the law and order code. This tribe has not had the resources before now to develop a tribal court system, or a law enforcement system, or public safety system, with emergency medical services and fire services. We're doing a lot of code writing, ordinance drafting. And in a business sense, the tribe is exercising its sovereignty, which impacts the governing document.
Q. Why are these governance issues getting so much attention?
A. One reason is the casino. I think, though, that a lot of the attention is because the tribe has been almost an overnight success story. My sense is the local people don't have a good understanding of the development of Federal Indian law and tribes. I think we were invisible to them before, and now we are so incredibly visible that they are reacting to it.
Part of our responsibility is to educate them, or share with them our history and our culture. We've always been here, but we haven't always been visible, and that's made a lot of people uncomfortable.
Q. Are the Mashantuckets coordinating with any other tribes on self-governance issues?
A. We're in contact on a national scale. Skip Hayward, the Mashantucket tribal leader, is on the board of directors of the Native American Rights Fund, which is active in Indian law on behalf of tribes all over the country. Through organizations like the United Southern and Eastern Tribes, the National Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Gaming Association, we converse with other tribes about what they're working on and how they've addressed certain issues.
Q. How common are the governance structures between tribes?
A. The general systems are fairly similar. There is a tribal council, there is a chairperson or a president, there is a section of law and order code. How they implement that is quite different.
Q. How much autonomy does the tribe have in criminal matters?
A. We have a law and order system on the reservation, where we prosecute violations of tribal law. Under the Indian Civil Rights Act, the tribe can sentence a person up to one year for each offense, and a fine of up to $5,000. If we were to incarcerate someone, we have a arrangement with a private detention facility in Central Falls, R.I.
Many tribes have agreements with the state so the law enforcement officers are also state officers. Under that system tribal officers can arrest for violations of state law, and turn them over to the state authorities. We are open to that kind of dialogue here, because we see there may be a need for it. That's not to say we have a law and order problem on the reservation.
Q. Taxes are becoming another issue involving reservations. What is the state authority in this area?
A. As tribes become more of an economic presence in a state, they are competing with the state in many respects, and the state wants to see how far it can extend its regulatory jurisdiction on the reservation.
The Federal Government has always said the states have no authority to impose their tax laws in Indian country. But what about activities on trust land? That's where states are getting more aggressive.
The Supreme Court has said where the tribe is engaged in activity involving non-Indians, the tribe has to facilitate the flow of taxation. For example, in the New York case last year, the state was trying to tax the tribe's sale of cigarettes to non-Indians, and the court ruled that sales to non-Indians are taxable, sales to Indians are not. Income for tribal members living on the reservation is not taxable by the state, though tribal members pay Federal income tax. The tribe's payroll, however, generates hundreds of millions of dollars in state income tax, because we have 11,000 employees.
Whatever resources the tribe produces on its own land are not taxable. Natural resources such as gold or coal or oil, there's been more activity by the state to try to tax that, but the Supreme Court has said that if it's a resource generated by the tribe on its property, that's not taxable.
Q. The Mashantuckets have generated controversy over attempts to expand their reservation. What is the legal basis for that expansion?
A. After a time period where the Federal Government had defined Indian territory by reservation, a lot of the reservations were broken down into smaller parcels called allotments, which were held in trust for 25 years and then a lot of them were sold. Between aboriginal territory and then reservation territory and then allotment territory, millions of acres of Indian territory were lost. Just when the allotment act was passed in 1877, 92 million acres of reservation land were lost.
One of the things the Indian Reorganization Act did was stop further allotment. It held everything in trust. And it authorized tribal governments to acquire land and put it into trust. This "land into trust" activity the tribe has been doing comes under that authority of the Indian Reorganization Act.

HEADLINE: Schools Face Renovations of Aging Buildings

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
RISING student enrollments are creating problems for school districts that are also plagued by shortages of space and aging buildings that need repairs, renovations and expansion.
Many districts are asking voters to approve bond issues of several million dollars to finance such improvements. 
 Since the early 90's, when the state drastically cut aid to education, most districts have been putting their money into programs, services and salaries, mostly ignoring their buildings and equipment.
Many buildings on the Island are more than 50 years old and need new doors, windows, roofs, furnaces, insulation and other repairs. Changes in education are also dictating renovations like larger classrooms and upgraded electrical capacity for machinery like computers. Districts that sold or rented out buildings as enrollments declined in the last 10 years may not have sufficient space.
"The 80's would have been a perfect time to redo buildings, when school budgets allowed for such repairs," Superintendent Ed Mavragis of Amityville said. "But now, at the same time that student population is growing, the economic climate is difficult, and things are wearing out from age. This is the worst possible combination of factors."
Increased enrollment across the Island has created a space crisis, said the president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association, Bruce Brodsky. By the year 2000 the association projects the populations in the 127 districts to total within 2,500 students of its peak, in 1984, of 430,000, and then to continue to climb.
Districts that sold or rented buildings are forced to consolidate classes, redistrict or add portable classrooms, Mr. Brodsky said.
Districts have also had to renovate to keep up with changes in education, said Roger Smith, an architect with the firm of Burton, Behrendt, Smith & O'Callaghan in Patchogue. Older buildings were constructed with small classrooms, cafeterias and libraries that are no longer adequate, he said. Older schools often had inadequate electrical service and inadequate access for handicapped students, to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act, he added.
"Many old buildings were constructed for second floors to be added, but it's hard to build a second floor when kids are in the buildings 10 months a year," Mr. Smith said. Hewlett-Woodmere recently completed the first phase of a long-range modernization plan, with the renovation of the 600-student Hewlett Elementary School. The school was built more than 50 years ago with small classrooms and large bathrooms, said Superintendent Bert Nelson.
"During that era desks were screwed down to the floor and kids stayed put," Dr. Nelson said. "Buildings had small classrooms, while large bathrooms were a necessity, since going to the bathroom was a large group activity, with the whole class going at the same time."
The architect for the redesigned school, Michael Spector of the Spector Group in North Hills, said computers were critical in the design plan. Libraries are no longer simply books, tables and chairs, but electronic centers.
"Our goal," Mr. Spector said, "is to create space for kids that is exciting and innovative, so that they look forward to coming to school."
The renovation cost $9 million, $3 million of which came from a capital reserve fund from the sale of one of the district's oldest buildings. The remaining $6 million was financed by a bond issue.
Island Park recently approved a $6.7 million bond issue for repairs for two school buildings. Safety was a problem, said Superintendent Erich Stegmeier. In February a gymnasium wall moved, and the gym was closed, he said. "We were faced with a very serious situation," he said. "There has been a rapid acceleration of ground sinking at both our buildings, causing interior and exterior walls to move. We are most concerned about assuring the safety of our pupils, staff and the public."
Two years of repairs and reconstruction begin in the summer.
In the spring voters in Levittown approved a $19 million bond issue for three years of capital improvements in all 14 schools there, beginning in the summer. The work includes roof repair, window and door replacement, kitchen improvement, asbestos removal and improving access for the handicapped.
"These repairs are not optional," the assistant superintendent for business and finance, Dr. Alan Groveman, said. "They are vital to the education, safety and welfare of the children."
An important factor in winning voters' approval was convincing taxpayers that a bond issue was the cheapest option, said Dr. Groveman, and that it would cost less than including the projects in the operating budget.
He added that the bond allowed the district to receive yearly state aid of more than 50 percent of the district's costs, as well as provide an increase of $1.24 per $100 assessed value, compared with $2.60 if financed through the regular budget.
Bond issues usually have minimal effects for taxpayers, Superintendent Elliott Landon of Long Beach said, because they spread the financial burden over 20 to 25 years.
In Long Beach a $10 million bond issue is financing work that begins in the summer, including renovations at Lido Elementary and Middle School, adding modular classrooms and a new gymnasium, replacing doors and windows and adding eight permanent classrooms.
In poorer districts, bond issues have met resistance. But Wyandanch recently approved two issues totaling more than $10 million to rebuild a school that burned down, renovate three other buildings and connect two schools, to operate with one principal.
"It was a difficult effort to win approval for the bond," Acting Superintendent Anthony Pecorale said. "But if it didn't pass the district would have had to go on a split schedule. While most districts on the Island are growing in student population at a rate of between 2 and 3 percent, Wyandanch has a growing enrollment of more than 10 percent. For the average homeowner the bond issue will mean a tax increase of about $70 a year."
In some communities voters said no. Last month Oceanside defeated a $5 million bond issue. Several factors contributed to the defeat, said Superintendent Elliot Garfinkel. It was the third bond proposal in eight years, Dr. Garfinkel said, adding that many voters also disapproved of the renovations, which would have meant moving some students to other schools.
Oceanside has added 500 students in four years, said Dr. Garfinkel, and growing enrollment has to be addressed. "For next year we'll have to rent portable classrooms," he said, "while the board continues to explore options of how to address this issue."
Several districts are working with community groups and architects to decide on building repairs and renovations and how to finance them.
The Garden City Board of Education is to decide soon whether to submit a bond issue to a vote, said the assistant superintendent of business, Daniel Bryan. In September, the district plans to reopen an early childhood school that had been leased, he said.
"In addition to needing new classrooms to house the increasing number of students," Mr. Bryan said, "there's the normal wear and tear that must be addressed like roof repair, new ventilation and electrical systems. It's nothing exciting, but these are things that have to be done."
In Syosset, renovations have been planned for the high school and two middle schools. The repairs are essential, Superintendent Carole Hankin said. "We've got windows that don't open, doors that don't shut," she said. "We're not going to do what we'd really like to do, but what must be done, a little at a time, so we won't have to close down the high school during the renovations."
A bond issue will probably be put up for a vote in the fall, Dr. Hankin said, adding: "It will be a minimal tax raise for the average homeowner. This is a long-term investment that will benefit the kids who are now in the schools and those who are coming."
Amityville is reviewing proposals from two architects to renovate its 750-pupil 70-year-old elementary school. The interior is to be gutted, but the traditional exterior will be retained, to fit in with the village architecture, Mr. Mavragis said.
"Every time we turn around we've had to throw in another $10,000 to repair broken pipes or fix other problems," he said. "Patch jobs just won't do it anymore. The school has an undersize cafeteria and undersize classrooms, with only one outlet in each room. The school is simply running out of years."
The district plans a vote in the fall for the $10 million of renovations, Mr. Mavragis said.
"We've got to reach local civic and community groups to win their support," he added. "As soon as the board approves the plan, we'll go on the road. This is a serious undertaking to convince the public that we're talking about an investment for the next 50 years, for both the kids and the community."

HEADLINE: Competition Is Cutthroat At the Paris Air Show

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: LE BOURGET, France, June 11

 BODY:
"World's No. 1 missile technology for all your needs," reads the pitch at this week's Paris Air Show for Spetstekhnika, a Russian company specializing in advanced air-to-ground destruction techniques.
Need a retreaded fighter aircraft, cheap? "Defense budget cuts have forced Canada to sell their recently upgraded F-5 fighters," says a sticker on one of the planes, originally designed by the Northrop Corporation (now Northrop Grumman) of Los Angeles but modernized by Bristol Aerospace Ltd. of Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
 Prices are negotiable, and prospective customers from around the world have until next Sunday to place orders for the latest available civilian and military aviation products at the air show, a technology bazaar that opened Saturday on the field where Charles A. Lindbergh landed in the Spirit of St. Louis after the first solo trans-Atlantic flight in 1927.
The United States Air Force stole the show today by flying in the Spirit of Missouri, one of its six supersecret B-2 batwing stealth bombers, designed by Northrop Grumman to be almost undetectable by radar. This one stayed only for an hour before returning across the Atlantic to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.
With military budgets shrinking everywhere and commercial aviation in crisis in many countries, the competition to woo customers is cutthroat, and many European competitors argue that the American giants are getting an unfair advantage from today's cut-rate dollar.
President Jacques Chirac of France, who visited the show today to see a flypast of the Dassault Aviation Group's Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters, said he would call on President Clinton and other leaders meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, later this week to take stronger international action to keep the dollar stable against other currencies.
Suspicion runs strong in France that the Clinton Administration, despite denials, is using the weakness of the dollar to improve the American balance of trade, since the cheaper it is for foreign customers to buy dollars, the more American exports they are likely to buy.
"When the greenback plummets, European aircraft manufacturers suddenly see everything crumbling around them; their productivity gains -- and their profits are wiped out," said the French aerospace monthly Revue Aerospatiale in a special issue on the show. "We are in the presence of a monetary war in which the weakest of the hard currencies is used as an offensive weapon."
American aviation manufacturers exported $38 billion in advanced technology and equipment last year, down $1 billion from 1993. Of the total last year, $12.4 billion was sold to customers in the countries of the European Union, which sold $8.5 billion in aerospace products to Americans.
The Clinton Administration is pushing aviation exports hard, and sent Thomas F. McLarty, the former White House chief of staff, to say so publicly. "The President has noted and recognized early that international trade is the key to economic growth and the key to the creation of high-skill and high-wage jobs in the American work force," Mr. McLarty said.
Shortly afterward, the Lockheed Martin Corporation and Russia's Khrunichev Enterprise announced plans to offer joint commercial satellite launches with Atlas and Proton next year to fight the inroads made by the European Space Agency, whose accomplishments are highlighted by a mockup of its big Ariane-5 rocket launcher towering over the runways here.
And the Boeing Company's new B-777 twin-jet intercontinental airliner arrived today to go head-to-head with the four-engine A-340 of Airbus Industries, the biggest European civil aviation manufacturer. Russia's Ilyushin-96M airliner, powered by four American-made Pratt & Whitney engines, is also on display.
Boeing announced agreement today on letters of intent by Air Europa of Spain, Lauda Air of Austria and Eurobelgian to buy 12 of its 737-800 short-range passenger planes; Lauda Air has already ordered four B-777's.
The V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft produced for the United States Army, Marines and Air Force by Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter division, in partnership with Boeing, is also attracting attention from potential civilian customers as well as military ones. It hovered like a helicopter Saturday and then zoomed past spectators looking like a twin-propeller airplane.
Many American companies refused to come to the last Paris show two years ago after a scandal about French Government and industrial espionage aimed against them.
This year, there was a spy scandal in France about reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to bribe highly placed French officials to reveal secrets about trade policy.

HEADLINE: Unicef Asks Broader Aid For Children

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 9

 BODY:
The United States now ranks lowest among 21 industrial countries in the amount of foreign aid it gives in relation to its gross national product, according to a new study by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund.
Although American aid is second only to Japan's in dollars -- $9.7 billion as calculated by international organizations using 1993 figures -- it represents 15 hundredths of 1 percent of G.N.P. 
 The Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands lead the list, with levels above 80 hundredths of 1 percent, and in those countries, as in the United States, aid budgets are facing new cuts.
The general reduction in foreign aid comes at a time when Unicef is urging all countries to look at the situation of children in the broadest terms, including the environments in which their mothers live.
"The child can't really be seen as separate and on an island," said Carol Bellamy, Unicef's executive director. "You can adopt some concrete objectives and go out and seek to achieve them, but the child has to be seen in the broader context of the community."
In an interview here last week before leaving for Berlin, where she released the report today, Ms. Bellamy said the Unicef board had recently approved clean water and education programs that would benefit whole villages and people of all ages.
Taking a broader look, she said, means that programs can be tailored to national needs and levels of development: basic survival in a country like Chad or children's rights in Argentina or Chile.
Among its recommendations, the report calls for campaigns to attack vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition, the precursors to disease in many countries, and to ameliorate or end deprivations and social abuses of children that weaken them and ultimately threaten their lives.
"In all regions of the world," the report said, "children continue to be malnourished, to be plagued by preventable disease, to be denied even a basic education."
Unicef says that about 200 million children worldwide suffer from vitamin A deficiency, which impairs the immune system and can lead to blindness and death. One million to two million children's lives could be saved each year by vitamin supplements, the report says.
About half of the 13 million children who die each year are victims of three major illnesses: pneumonia, diarrheal disease and measles. While measles is in retreat, the report says, pneumonia, the single largest killer of children, is not. And AIDS is now a threat. About one million children now have the virus that causes AIDS, many in Africa and Asia.
With the world population growing fastest in the poorest countries, where children are likely to live in the worst conditions, Ms. Bellamy said the reduction in aid was especially unfortunate.
"None of us benefit if our partners in development are being hurt, because we are actually all in the same development boat," she said.
Ms. Bellamy, a former Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala and director of the Peace Corps before she joined Unicef in May, said she had the point of interrelationships driven home when she became City Council President in New York in 1978.
"Here in New York City -- the industrialized world -- we had not had a full-scale immunization program for a number of years," she said. "A third of all youngsters in New York City schools and close to a half of poor youngsters were not immunized. So we started a program to get all kids immunized.
"There is a direct connection between that investment in aid and health care back here in the United States. If polio breaks out one place in the world it can just come back and spread again. The walls between nations are now very thin curtains."

Owners Ready to Resume Negotiations

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Ready or not, the owners apparently are finally prepared to resume negotiations with the players for a new collective bargaining agreement. That is the word delivered by people who attended the owners' meetings in Minneapolis last week.
Although Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, and the chief negotiators haven't said anything about the resumption of talks, one owner said during the weekend that, based on the discussion at the meetings, he expected talks to begin "very soon." 
 Another person made that timetable a little more specific, saying he expected something to happen in the next 10 days to two weeks.
"We're going to see some prompt action," the second person said. "They'll see what happens with the N.L.R.B. thing, then move on to the next stage. It will be very quick."
Negotiators for the owners and the players have not met since March 30, the day before a Federal judge issued an injunction that prompted the players to end their strike and return to work. But lawyers for both sides have been meeting in discussions for settlement of the National Labor Relations Board charges against the owners.
The lawyers will meet again this week. If they reach an agreement or even make progress toward one, they are expected to ask for a postponement of the trial on the N.L.R.B. charges scheduled to begin next Monday before an administrative law judge.
Talks for a collective bargaining agreement then could resume.
"We've got to get an agreement," said the owner, who spoke on the condition he wouldn't be identified. "That was stressed. The pressure's on, and it's coming from all directions. Huizenga, Angelos and others spoke, people from different positions. The consensus clearly is let's get it done."
Wayne Huizenga of the Florida Marlins is considered a hard-liner, Peter Angelos of Baltimore a moderate. From one extreme to the other, the owners and the players believe it is imperative to reach an overall agreement to show the fans it's safe to return to the ball park.
To be in position to resume talks in even two weeks, the owners' negotiating team will have to work quickly. The owners haven't selected a chief labor lawyer to replace Chuck O'Connor, whom Selig has dismissed, and they don't appear to be certain about their approach to the key economic issue -- how to put some form of restraint on player salaries.
When they adjourned talks, the owners were trying to get a luxury tax on payrolls, having abandoned their initial strategy of getting a salary cap. Some owners want to return to the cap, but others have said that strategy surely would precipitate another work stoppage.
John Harrington of Boston, chairman of the negotiating committee, has hinted at a new wrinkle the committee could be developing.
Some people on the management side are talking about the possibility of the N.L.R.B. settlement discussions producing an impetus that will enable the negotiators to begin resolving issues one by one.

A Chinese Puzzle

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
In China over the last month a number of high-ranking establishment intellectuals have joined activists for democracy in petitions to the Government. They called for a more open society -- for "a spirit of tolerance," as one petition put it.
The Communist authorities responded by detaining some of the signers and keeping others under house arrest. In the days around June 4, the sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, there were stern warnings against dissent. 
 The pattern of protest and crackdowns seems familiar. But there are important differences this time, ones that raise questions about where things are going in Beijing.
One change is the participation of the intellectuals, members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The most significant of the petitions was drafted by Xu Liangying, a 75-year-old physicist who translated Einstein's work into Chinese, and signed by, among others, Wang Ganchang, 88, a key figure in the design of China's first nuclear weapon.
"It is the first time these establishment intellectuals have joined the democratic activists," Prof. Merle Goldman of Harvard said. "Until now they have kept them at a distance. The party leadership may find the change disturbing."
The question is why people in a privileged position as academicians decided to speak out for democracy with the activists. And why now?
Some China scholars in this country say the reason is that the Communist regime faces a time of transition from the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who is 90 years old and has not been seen in public since last October. The intellectuals see a chance to influence the direction of the leadership that will succeed Mr. Deng -- to push it toward more tolerance and independent thinking. One way for a new leader to establish his identity is to differ from his predecessor's policies, as Mr. Deng did with Mao Zedong.
The official view of the student democracy movement that was crushed in Tiananmen Square is one key to change. The petition drafted by Xu Liangying called on the authorities to "re-evaluate the June 4, 1989, incident according to the spirit of 'seeking truth from facts,' and release those people who remain in jail."
The Xu petition is in many respects a remarkable document. It says the Government should "never again regard individuals of independent thought as 'hostile elements' and submit them to repressive attacks." It asks the authorities to "boldly end the ignominious tradition of literary inquisitions that has persisted in our country since ancient times."
That petition and the others ought to end any lingering tendency among Americans and Europeans to think that Chinese intellectuals are any less eager for freedom of thought than, say, Russians were in the Soviet years. They are an answer, too, to the contention of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew that Asians value freedom less than order and economic progress.
The Communist Party Secretary at Mr. Xu's research institute called him in and asked him not to disturb "social stability." Mr. Xu said later, "I told him what we're doing is good for social stability."
The petitions for freedom are also a comment on the difficulty of framing American policy on human rights in China. A year ago President Clinton stopped tying renewal of China's trade status under U.S. law to its human-rights record. Since then repression and torture have increased. It is not clear how the U.S. can bring effective pressure for decency on a totalitarian regime that evidently fears for its survival.
The most powerful symbol of the Chinese regime's use of extreme, lawless methods to repress nonviolent demands for democracy is the case of Wei Jingsheng. He was arrested in 1979 for his part in the Democracy Wall movement, was tried in secret and served nearly 15 years in solitary confinement.
In September 1993, when Beijing was trying to win the year 2000 Olympics, Mr. Wei was suddenly released. He spoke out for freedom, undaunted. On April 1, 1994, he was detained again. Not a word has been heard since from him or about his condition or whereabouts.
If a new Chinese leadership wants to win the world's respect when it comes to power, its first act should be to free Wei Jingsheng.

HEADLINE: Black Leaders of Diverse Views United at Meeting, Chavis Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 11

 BODY:
Declaring a three-day conference "fruitful and successful," the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. said the National African American Leadership Summit would organize a million men for a march on Washington in the fall.
Mr. Chavis, the former head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said his group adopted a constitution and bylaws at its second annual meeting. 
 "The N.A.A.L.S. has taken on more of a sense of permanence in terms of building our organizational infrastructure," Mr. Chavis said.
Representatives from more than 100 African-American organizations attended the summit, which was intended to unite black leaders across religious and political lines. The entity includes the Nation of Islam, the National Black United Front and several N.A.A.C.P. chapters.
One goal, Mr. Chavis said, is to mobilize black men for the Million Man March in Washington on Oct. 16, which will follow another meeting by the summit.
There, the group will encourage participants "to take responsibility for raising our families, to take responsibility for ending the drugs and violence that plague our communities and to move forward in terms of our economic empowerment," Mr. Chavis said.
Other issues discussed at the Houston conference were protesting the scheduled execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black journalist in Pennsylvania, and fighting recommended "right-wing cutbacks" in Congress.
Mr. Abu-Jamal, a former award-winning radio reporter, is scheduled to die on Aug. 17 for the 1981 shooting death of a police officer. Supporters say Mr. Abu-Jamal, who insists he is not guilty, was framed because he supported the radical MOVE organization.
Other goals of the group include black economic and political empowerment.
"We want to serve notice on the Congress of the United States, to Newt Gingrich and to all of those who are voting and recommending these right-wing cutbacks on health care, on education, on welfare, on scholarships for black students," Mr. Chavis said, adding, "We are not going to stand still."
Mr. Chavis supported a similar agenda before he was dismissed from the N.A.A.C.P. post in August for using group money to settle a sex discrimination claim without telling the board of directors.
Even before the ouster, Mr. Chavis had clashed with board members over his desire to collaborate with the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and about his secret meeting with black nationalists in March 1994.
On Friday night Mr. Farrakhan attended a town meeting that was a part of the weekend conference.
Mr. Chavis said he sensed, during the various sessions, that "there is a bonding taking place."
"Despite all of the tactics of groups trying to divide and conquer us," Mr. Chavis said, "we're coming together and we're going to stay together."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Developing Electronic Cash Card

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation's dominant software business often seems like a license to print money. But now the company wants to go a step further and make cash itself, at least the electronic kind.
Microsoft is developing a plan to offer plastic cards embedded with microchips, known as smart cards, that can be used to make payments, said Warren T. Dent, the director of business development for the company's consumer systems division. 
 "I hope in a year or so we are testing something with a stored-value card," Mr. Dent said. The initial test may be with Microsoft's own employees before the technology is offered more widely, he said.
 Microsoft would be entering what has rapidly become a crowded field of companies hoping to become to electronic money what Microsoft is to computer software. In July, two large British banks will begin testing Mondex, a so-called electronic purse card, which stores cash. Mondex is economical for small purchases because merchants would not need a telephone link to a central computer. The card's current value is imprinted on the card, which means losing the card is like losing cash. A debit card, by comparison, is more like an electronic check.
Mastercard International and Visa International are also developing chip cards that can hold cash, as are Bank of America and other banks. Separately, a number of independent companies have started to create schemes for sending payments over the Internet, in which cash is loaded onto computer disks rather than on smart cards.
Microsoft is working with chip manufacturers to develop the specifications of its card, and then expects to approach banks that would stand behind the payments on the card. Executives of several of the country's largest banks say they have been approached by Microsoft.
"No matter how much technology you have, one day someone will outfox you," said Richard Lonergan, executive vice president of Visa. "The bank card systems have the risk-management and early-fraud- detection systems that they don't have."
 Microsoft might have difficulty finding partners. It frightened many bankers with its now-aborted plan to acquire Intuit Inc., the maker of Quicken personal finance software, which was seen as an attempt to dominate the market for computerized banking and payments known as electronic commerce. Microsoft's chairman, William T. Gates 3d, did not make any financier friends when he was quoted as calling bankers "dinosaurs."
Last week, Mr. Gates tried to mend fences at a meeting in Seattle of the 100 top executives of the world's largest banks. "I actually said the computer systems of banks are dinosaurs," Mr. Gates said at a news conference after the meeting.
 Mr. Gates said Microsoft would develop smart cards, software programs and other programs that would work with banks.
"In no way will we be competition to banks in what we're doing," Mr. Gates said. "We're coming up with ways for banks to use our technology. We will never be in the business of doing what banks do."
Microsoft officials have long expressed a desire to write operating systems and software for computerized devices of all shapes and sizes. The company has already introduced a watch, in conjunction with Timex, that stores telephone numbers and appointments.

 Digital smart cards look like credit cards, but they have an embedded microchip that can perform a variety of functions. Microsoft is developing a smart-card system that would compete with several others aiming to replace cash with digital money that would be stored on a card and be spent for small purchases.
 Unlike today's debit cards, which electronically transfer money from a customer's checking account, the cash value would be digitally stored on the card itself. Retailers would use a smart-card terminal to deduct the amount for each purchase. At least four other organizations are developing such cards, which they plan to begin testing over the next year:

HEADLINE: On the Annual Scoreboard of New Magazines, It's Sports 67, Sex 44

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
Sex sells -- no doubt about that. It may come as a surprise, however, that for the first time in five years, sex has fallen out of first place as the leading topic for new magazines.
With 44 new sex magazines last year in the United States, 51 fewer than in 1993, the category ceded first place to sports, which accounted for 67 of the 832 magazine start-ups. 
 But the sex category, which also fell behind food magazines last year, is not about to fade away. A subgroup with myriad possibilities is growing that could reverse the decline: ethnic sex magazines, including titles like Black Satin, Hot Salsa and Exotic Blondes of Scandinavia.
All of this arcane information comes from "Samir Husni's Guide to New Consumer Magazines," an annual compilation of thousands of facts about magazines. For the first time in its 10-year history, it is being published as a full-fledged book by Hearst Magazine Enterprises, a new division of the Hearst Corporation. The guide, published this month, also offers data on subscription prices and numbers of advertising pages.
Mr. Husni, the director of the magazine service journalism program at the University of Mississippi, goes about the counting and collecting of new magazines in a decidedly old-fashioned way. Every week for 10 years, he has made the 80-mile round trip from his home in Oxford, Miss., to Memphis, where he tours bookstores and newsstands, looking for new titles. He also receives information through the mail from publishers, and his students help compile the lists.
Unscientific as his method may be, Mr. Husni notes with some amusement that no one has come up with a better way to count new titles. "There is no other way," he said.
If counting start-ups is a hit-and-miss proposition, counting magazines that have ceased publication is even more difficult, and Mr. Husni does not list them. Companies love to trumpet the magazines they are starting but rarely send out releases when magazines are shut, unless the titles are so well known that their demise is real news. When asked why a magazine has not appeared for a while, publishers tend to say that it has been suspended and that its future is up in the air.
The 832 start-ups of 1994 were a record, beating the previous high in 1993 by 43 titles, Mr. Husni said. In 1985, the guide's first year, 231 titles were introduced.
Mr. Husni's guide covers the gamut. It ranges from the highly promoted Family PC, published by the Walt Disney Company and the Ziff-Davis Publishing unit of Forstmann Little & Company, to Soap Opera Hair (a how-to magazine for achieving the hairdos of your favorite soap opera stars), published by Starline Publications of River Edge, N.J.
There are now about 4,000 magazines in the United States, up from 2,500 in the mid-1980's, Mr. Husni estimated. And the big publishers are back in a start-up mood after the recession of the early 1990's, when companies were more apt to close publications than to start them.
The bulk of the new magazines, though, come from a growing number of small entrepreneurs whose narrowly aimed publications -- The Medieval and Renaissance Times, say, or Tattoo Savage ("radical tattoos and body piercing for those who walk on the wild side") -- are making their presence felt on newsstands around the country. Most of their revenues come from circulation rather than advertising.
"This is where the major corporations are waking up, as all of a sudden more and more of these little magazines are starting to take away from the big pie," Mr. Husni said. "The big corporations have started to launch new magazines like crazy."
Still, start-ups remain a risky business, whether they come from media giants or small entrepreneurs. Of the magazines started in 1985, he said, just 3 of every 10 that appear four times a year or more are still in business.
And in 1994, for the first time, the average cover price of new magazines climbed to more than $4, to $4.15. Ten years ago, it was $2.60.
Though sports magazines took first place last year, the category's total of 67 new titles was down 17 from 1993. The 45 new food magazines took second place, helped by the growing popularity of titles featuring lean cuisine and quick recipes.
Third place was a three-way tie, at 44 apiece, among sex, music and a catchall group of publications specializing in crafts, games and hobbies. The computer category was next, with 41.
Fast-growing categories included military and naval magazines, with 24 new titles, up 16 from 1993, and health publications with 31, up 13.

HEADLINE: For Police, She's a True-Blue Friend

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 9

 BODY:
She has all the accouterments of a good Cambridge liberal. She lives in a big house not far from Harvard Square. She drives a green Ford Explorer; has a Labrador retriever, Charlie, and is married to a Harvard University economist.
But from her basement office, using a small computer and an array of printers, Cynthia Brown has become the darling of a hefty segment of the nation's law-enforcement community. Ms. Brown publishes a 40-page, tabloid-style newspaper designed for, and written partly by, the police. At $12.95 for a one-year subscription, American Police Beat is read by more than 150,000 officers nationwide. Among its subscribers is Rush Limbaugh, the radio and television talk show host. 
 In a world in which police officers often feel that they are under attack by a relentlessly hostile media, Ms. Brown's publication is a welcomed exception. "I never imagined such a paper could be produced," said Tom Scotto, the president of the New York City Detectives Endowment Association and head of the National Association of Police Organizations. "Cynthia Brown puts out the best law-enforcement newspaper I've ever seen."
There are other police publications -- newsletters mostly with local or limited circulation. Only American Police Beat has a national audience and tackles issues that the police say are neglected by the mainstream media: lack of support from police chiefs, the newest vogue in weapons, the effect of affirmative action on white officers. There is even a police horoscope.
Ms. Brown, a slight, energetic woman, admits that her Cambridge neighbors don't all share her views about the police, whom she calls "some of the best, most caring and concerned people I've ever met."
A few doors away, for example, is the house of Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School professor and a member of the O. J. Simpson defense team, who said on television earlier this year that police officers, during their training, are taught to lie.
In her next issue, Ms. Brown carried a response by Thomas Nee, a vice president of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association. "This statement has libeled and slandered police officers nationwide, and demeaned and degraded the integrity and credibility of every public safety officer," Mr. Nee said. He suggested that Mr. Dershowitz should be sued.
The June issue leads with a lengthy feature on four police officers in Riverside, Calif., whose homes have had liens placed on them after they were sued for shooting a suspect who was fleeing arrest. A radio dispatcher had alerted the officers that the suspect, Brian Forett, had shot a person in the neck and tied up two other victims in their house while making off with three guns and 250 rounds of ammunition.
"You can't do police work like you used to before," said Joe Scanlon, a retired detective from the Los Angeles Police Department and an ardent fan of Ms. Brown's paper. "My main beef isn't crime on the streets, it's the public's attitude." Speaking by phone from his home in Anaheim, Calif., Mr. Scanlon, whose son is a police officer in nearby Fullerton, said: "It's like the old Kipling saying about the British army, you're great when there is a war on, but after that, you're just a bum."
Ms. Brown, who grew up in an affluent Boston suburb and whose father, Daniel Rossborough, was an advertising executive, was converted to the police cause in the 1970's when she volunteered for a pilot community policing project in Boston's poor, racially mixed South End. The program was led by a young lieutenant, William J. Bratton, now police commissioner in New York, and was supposed to break down long-standing barriers between local residents and the police.
"At first I was taken aback by how conservative the police were," Ms. Brown said. But as she spent time with them, she said that she realized that they usually managed to maintain "their self-control, compassion and a sense of humor" despite the danger and drudgery of their tasks.
Ms. Brown, who financed the paper by mortgaging her family's home, said she started the enterprise because "there really was no vehicle where the street cops could communicate with each other."
She has turned it into a kind of family operation: She writes the editorials -- most recently attacking people and organizations that have derided police officers as thugs and fascists. Law-enforcement officers throughout the nation contribute articles, as does her son by a previous marriage, Mark Nichols, a college student.
Ms. Brown's husband, H. James Brown, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and director of Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, set up the accounting system. Her father faxes her advice on advertising from his home on an island off Maine.
The paper has yet to make a profit, Ms. Brown said, so she and her husband, sit on the floor every month to stuff copies into mailing envelopes.
But they are encouraged by letters to the editor from police officers nationwide, like the note sent by Gene Gentile, president of the Lawmen Motorcycle Association of Hauppauge, N.Y.: "In each issue we find great encouragement and inspiration. Your courageous stand for truth is a welcomed beacon of light and a fountainhead from which we can derive nourishment and vigor in our daily battle against an ever growing criminal society."

HEADLINE: A Giuliani Voting Bloc Is Eroding

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
At a recent City Hall news conference, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced an appointment that would otherwise have drawn little attention: the new chairwoman of the Mayor's Commission on the Status of Women. But in a uncharacteristic act, the Mayor prominently noted that his selection was a woman of Hispanic background.
Such an observation seemed distinctly out of character for a Mayor who has habitually eschewed any mention of ethnicity in announcing his appointments. But to many, the emphasis on Amalia V. Betanzos's background underscored the depth of the problems the Mayor is currently having with Hispanic New Yorkers. 
 The troubled relationship took an embarrassingly public turn yesterday, when Mr. Giuliani was met with intermittent booing as he marched in the annual Puerto Rican Day parade. The reception was a striking turnabout for a man whose support among the city's largely Democratic Hispanic voters helped propel him to the Mayor's job less than two years ago.
But poll after poll in recent months has depicted a sinking level of support among Hispanic New Yorkers for the Republican Mayor. A survey released Thursday by Baruch College and Louis Harris and Associates showed that Mr. Giuliani's support among Hispanic people has sharply declined recently, with 62 percent of the 1,005 surveyed saying they disapproved of his performance, compared with 39 percent in a survey by the same pollsters a year ago. Some Hispanic leaders said the results stem from a growing dissatisfaction with Mr. Giuliani's policies.
"The Mayor's handling of the budget certainly indicates a departure from programs that Latinos believe work, because these programs have been of help to many of them," said Luis Miranda, president of the Hispanic Federation of New York City, an umbrella group of more than 50 health and service agencies and the group that commissioned the poll. Mr. Miranda resigned in March as chairman of the Health and Hospitals Corporation after disagreeing with the Mayor over the depth of cuts in Medicaid.
Interviews with leaders of Hispanic neighborhood groups and civic and service organizations as well as ordinary Hispanic New Yorkers indicates a current of discontent with Mr. Giuliani, with many singling out his budget for criticism. They complain that cuts to youth programs, education and social service programs have disproportionately affected Hispanic New Yorkers.
"He has done a deplorable job based on cutting, cutting, cutting," said Daniel O. Camejo, a 27-year-old Cuban-American who is assistant director of a housing management organization in the Bronx. "On education, he has no agenda other than to be contentious with the Chancellor and to cut the budget for community colleges. And on everything else, he has been insensitive."
The complaints echo those voiced by many black New Yorkers. But while Mr. Giuliani received no more than 5 percent of the black vote, nearly 4 of every 10 Hispanic voters cast their votes for him in 1993, and the Mayor has worked to maintain, and expand, that support.
For Mr. Giuliani, the poll results point to a potential weakness that could undermine a re-election bid, and are evidence that his spending cuts to close the city's huge budget deficit are beginning to have a negative political impact.
Hispanic New Yorkers provided Mr. Giuliani with an estimated 78,000 votes in 1993 in a race the Mayor won by about 50,000 votes. Several aides to the Mayor said that they find the poll results deeply disturbing and that since Mr. Giuliani won the election by only 3 percent, he cannot afford to alienate any group that supported him. Moreover, they say they are frustrated that the Mayor's successes in crime and job creation have not resonated more among Hispanics.
"This is one group where we thought we would expand our base," said a senior aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. "This is a problem."
While New York's Hispanic community is diverse and far from monolithic, Mr. Miranda said that the poll results indicated that discontent with Mr. Giuliani stood at comparable levels whether the respondents were Puerto Rican, Dominican or Cuban, immigrant or native born.
In acknowledging the dropping poll numbers, Mr. Giuliani said that he has had to make difficult budget decisions that are bound to be unpopular. But he contended that his crime-fighting initiatives, coupled with his efforts to stimulate small businesses, would ultimately have a positive impact on his image among Hispanic people.
"I am confident that as we stick to our agenda and we accomplish the things we can accomplish for this city, those numbers will go back to where they were six or seven months ago," Mr. Giuliani said. "At budget time, mayors, governors and others have to make difficult decisions, and we have to work our way through that."
But many contend that the Mayor, in seeking to keep Hispanic support, has broken some of his rules of governance by making appointments based on nationality, not necessarily merit, and by failing to take strong stands that would antagonize Hispanic people.
Ms. Betanzos's appointment was the second of a Hispanic official in the last month; the Mayor also named Raul Russi, the head of the State Parole Board, as the new City Sheriff.
The appointments came after the departure of two of the most prominent Hispanic officials in the Giuliani administration, including Carlos M. Rivera, a special adviser to the Mayor. After he was dismissed in February, Mr. Rivera accused the Mayor of being "insensitive to Hispanic people."
Also, some city officials suggest that the Mayor's concerns about Hispanic support led him to remain silent on the plans to help finance the building of a huge Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem, despite the Mayor's longstanding support for superstores and similar economic initiatives. The project was bitterly opposed by owners of small markets, many of them Hispanic merchants. It was eventually approved.
Mr. Giuliani has vehemently denied that ethnicity had any role in his position, explaining that the decision was better left to the board of Manhattan elected officials who had to sign off on the initial stage of the project.
Ninfa Segarra, a Deputy Mayor and the only Hispanic person among the Mayor's senior aides, said that Mr. Giuliani's troubles in the polls are due in part to the administration's failure to convey the progress the Mayor has made in economic development, public safety and education. "We have to make sure our message is clear enough to indicate that we, and the Latino community, have similar goals," she said.
To that end, Ms. Segarra said, the Mayor has been active in meeting with Hispanic journalists, appearing on more Spanish-language radio and television programs and meeting with influential Hispanic New Yorkers. "Maybe he needs to do it more aggressively and more frequently," she said.
Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group, agreed that the administration has been seeking to increase its visibility among Hispanic people.

Cordiant Explores Cuts in Operations

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Cordiant P.L.C., continuing to look at cutting costs, is exploring the possibility of eliminating duplication in the service, back-office and other noncore operations at the United States offices of its two agency networks, Bates Worldwide and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide.
"We're developing task forces to consider efficiencies," said Judy Torello, a spokeswoman for Bates in New York, in areas like office services contracts, purchasing, telecommunications and computer services, employee benefit programs and administrative systems. The task forces will focus on outside core areas like account management, creative services and research because Cordiant wants to continue to operate two separate agency networks to avoid potential conflicts among clients. 
 Cordiant has sought to cut costs since its former chairman, Maurice Saatchi, assumed large debts to finance a skein of acquisitions in the mid and late 1980's. Those economy efforts have accelerated since Mr. Saatchi was ousted in December and several large accounts left Bates and Saatchi & Saatchi in protest. The company's problems are expected to be addressed by top managers tomorrow at the Cordiant annual meeting in London.

Fishermen Want to Tell Tales

BYLINE: By DAVE STOUT 

DATELINE: LONG BRANCH

 BODY:
It is not easy to catch fish for a living. "These are hard times for working fishermen because of declining stocks of fish and increasing Federal regulations on what you can catch," Nils Stolpe of the New Jersey Seafood Harvesters' Association said last week. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey seems to agree with Mr. Stolpe. Last week, the authority awarded Mr. Stolpe's association and another commercial fishing group, the Association of United Boatmen of New Jersey and New York, $50,000 a year for three years to help them inform the public and business interests about the challenges they face.
"We'll work to build up the image of commercial fishing and make the public aware of its contributions to the character and economy of the Jersey shore," Mr. Stolpe said.

HEADLINE: Let's Bring Public Pensions Into 21st Century

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On behalf of the more than 500,000 retired public employees in New York State, I must respond to "The Education of George Pataki" (editorial, June 5), which links "pension sweeteners" to legislators' pet projects. 
 I doubt that a 1983 retired former cafeteria worker or school nurse trying to survive on an average annual pension of $7,343 would agree that a monthly increase of $35 to make up for a loss of $209 in monthly buying power is unconscionable.
Many of the 44,000 retirees represented by the Retired Public Employees Association do not receive Social Security payments, and they must somehow get by on pensions based on substandard salaries from years past.
Money for pension supplementation for state and most local government retirees is already in the Supplementation Reserve Fund, and would require no additional expenditures that would affect taxpayers.
We have suggested a task force to overhaul the state's public pension system, inaugurated in 1921. We hope you will take up the cause with us to redesign the system to meet the needs of a 21st-century economy, rather than the conditions of a 1921 economy.

HEADLINE: CURB ON MOB AIDS GARMENT MAKERS

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Three years after prosecutors claimed they had broken the Mafia's choke hold over vital trucking routes in New York City's garment industry, many manufacturers say that shipping costs have dropped sharply and that dozens of new trucking companies are competing for business.
Garment manufacturers estimate that in three years, the average price for shipping a dress, a pair of jeans or a blouse has plunged to 15 to 20 cents from 40 to 45 cents. 
 Prosecutors said the falling costs reflected the demise of a mob cartel that had inflated prices and milked customers for half a century. Members of the Gambino crime family, they said, had forced manufacturers to use trucking companies they owned or controlled, stifling competition with threats of violence and adding a mob "tax" of about 7 percent to the price of finished garments.
The system crumbled in February 1992, officials said, when Thomas Gambino, now 65, and Joseph Gambino, 58, agreed to give up routes controlled by their companies in exchange for avoiding possible prison sentences.
Since then, total shipping costs in the city's garment industry have fallen about 20 percent, said Robert J. McGuire, a former New York City Police Commissioner who was appointed by a state judge to oversee the terms of the Gambino brothers' plea bargain.
"For the first time in decades," Mr. McGuire said in an interview, "customers are shopping for truckers and willing to move if they don't get the right prices or good service."
"In the old days, nobody considered they had an option to change once they were in the clutches of a company with organized-crime connections," he added. "Now we have unprecedented competition, with new truckers actively seeking business."
Most manufacturers said it was too soon to determine whether falling costs would lead to cheaper clothing or to higher wages for their employees. But in a report issued last month, Mr. McGuire said gross annual fees for the 9 trucking companies that took over routes from 11 companies accused of mob ties had declined to $23.4 million in 1994 from $27.5 million in 1992.
Daniel Zar, who designs and sells dresses in the midtown garment district in Manhattan, and Thomas Wong, who manufactures them, said in interviews that lower prices would save each of their companies about $40,000 in shipping costs this year.
And Louis Chan, who started a trucking business, Jetsway Company, only five years ago, said the end of Mafia influence had allowed him to acquire new customers and to expand his small fleet in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn to 12 trucks from 3.
Mr. Wong, the owner of T and L Fashions at 129 Lafayette Street in lower Manhattan, said that before the court order, he had no choice in truckers. Nor could he negotiate prices.
"Once the shop belonged to a trucker, you could not use any other company," he asserted. "There were no physical threats. But if they found out you used someone else, the bottom line was you had to pay them anyway to get off the hook."
Michael Slattery Jr., a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mr. McGuire's deputy, said that in the last three years about 75 new trucking companies, known as independents, had emerged. Unlike established companies with dozens of trucks, the new companies often have only one or two trucks or vans, he said.
But while the new competition has been a windfall for garment manufacturers, it has created tensions between the established trucking companies that took over mob-controlled routes and the newer independents. The bigger companies say their prices are being undercut by new companies that hire undocumented immigrants, pay low wages without Social Security taxes and do not provide health and welfare payments to their employees.
"Sure, there's a lot of competition out there and it's a good time for the manufacturers," said Alan Rubin, the president of Conduit Rapid Delivery, which took over the customer lists of several companies that prosecutors said had been owned or controlled by members of the Gambino crime family. "But these new companies have no unions, no cargo insurance, no terminals and no overhead."
City officials estimate that the garment manufacturing industry generates about $14 billion a year in gross sales and wages for the city's economy. About 1,000 designers or wholesalers and sewing factories -- mainly companies with fewer than 50 full-time employees -- operate in the city.
Because of an increase in garment factories in other states and countries, the industry's economic importance to the city has steadily declined. Since 1961, the number of garment industry employees in the city has dropped from 260,000, to 80,000.
In February 1992, the Gambino brothers interrupted their trial on state charges of extortion and running a trucking cartel to plead guilty, each to a single felony count of illegally restraining trade. If convicted of the most serious corruption charge, they could have faced 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison each.
They were spared prison sentences by paying a $12 million fine and agreeing to get themselves and their associates out of a business they had long controlled: the trucking of unfinished clothing, known as cutwork, and patterns from companies along Seventh Avenue to sewing shops and factories in Chinatown and elsewhere. The Gambino companies also transported the finished garments from the factories to warehouses for distribution by manufacturers.
The agreement, however, did not affect the Gambino brothers' ownership of several long-distance trucking companies that haul garments to and from warehouses, airports and storage centers used by department and chain stores.
The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, whose office brought the indictment against the Gambino brothers, contended that their companies had fixed prices for cutwork and finished garments and refused to allow customers to switch to other truckers. Prosecutors said the Gambino brothers' companies compelled manufacturers and contractors to pay them even if an independent trucker was used for an emergency delivery.
Mr. McGuire, the president of Kroll Associates, a private investigation concern in Manhattan, oversaw the liquidation of the 11 trucking companies that prosecutors said were owned or affiliated with the Gambino brothers. He is empowered under the court agreement to insure that competition exists among the companies, known as covered companies, that have taken over the old Gambino-controlled routes.
He has prohibited the companies from fixing prices, dividing territory and transferring and selling the rights to clients. The companies also are banned from requiring wholesalers and contractors to use their services exclusively.
"This is a new approach to solving an endemic problem of organized-crime infiltration of an industry," Mr. McGuire said. "Sending one organized-crime figure to jail and having him replaced by another has no long-term effect. This is a systemic attempt to change the fundamental way business is conducted in the garment industry and to level the playing field for all competitors."
Mr. Slattery, senior managing director at Kroll Associates, said English and Mandarin Chinese copies of Mr. McGuire's rules, titled "Know Your Trucking Rights," have been distributed to more than 500 contractors and manufacturers in the city.
"Our analysis shows that there has been an explosion of about 75 new, independent truckers serving the marketplace," Mr. Slattery said in an interview. "All of the covered truckers have suffered from the increased competition by lowering their prices, shifting their business or simply losing customers."
Mr. Slattery said the Gambino brothers' fine, of which about $10 million has been paid so far, was being used for the oversight and other costs.
The Kroll company, which is authorized to monitor the industry until February 1997, has received $2.3 million for legal and auditing expenses, Mr. McGuire said. The Manhattan District Attorney's office received $1.6 million, and the state police got $1 million as reimbursements for the cost of their investigations of the Gambino companies, Mr. McGuire said.
Twelve contractors that were found to have been overcharged by the Gambino companies have received a total of $700,000 in compensation, he said.
The state has been paid $2.4 million and is to receive whatever is left after final expenses for Kroll Associates, Mr. McGuire said.
Thomas Gambino, who avoided a possible prison sentence in 1992, was convicted in 1993 on unrelated Federal accusations of running gambling and loan-sharking rings and of being a capo, or captain, in a crime family.
He was sentenced to five years in prison but is free on $500,000 bail while awaiting a ruling on an appeal of his conviction.
The Gambino brothers' father, Carlo Gambino, died of natural causes in 1976.

HEADLINE: Experts See Peril for U.S. Pact To Buy Up Russian Bomb Fuel

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Three years after Russia agreed to provide the United States with uranium from scrapped Russian nuclear weapons, the deal is unraveling, prompting a quiet struggle to save the accord, Federal and private experts say.
Russia was to get $12 billion in desperately needed hard currency, and the United States was to get 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium, which was to be diluted to make fuel for American nuclear power plants and ultimately electricity for consumers. 
 In addition to bolstering national security for the United States, the agreement was expected to strengthen the shaky Russian economy, reduce the risks of nuclear accidents and theft and, less explicitly, help disarm a former foe. Further, it was not expected to cost taxpayers anything, since revenues from the sale of reactor fuel were to offset the total $12 billion cost.
But efforts to carry out the three-year-old deal have been stymied by administrative missteps, disagreements over pricing for the uranium and even trade disputes, the experts say. On Tuesday, the Senate Energy Committee is to hold a hearing on aspects of the deal, which the Russians are privately threatening to drop.
The unraveling of the deal is on the agenda for Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Victor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia, who are to meet late this month in Moscow. The Administration wants to resolve the problems, if only to give Russia a source of nuclear revenues other than Iran and rogue states interested in acquiring atomic weaponry.
Republicans have strongly criticized the Clinton Administration for not pressing Russia harder to drop plans to sell Iran nuclear reactors, which could serve as the basis for an atomic-bomb program.
The innovative agreement was announced by the Bush Administration in August 1992 and was carried forward by the Clinton Administration, which negotiated a detailed contract in 1993.
The deal, a high point of nuclear disarmament at the end of the cold war, represents a substantial part of the Russian nuclear arsenal, but far from all of it. Russia is estimated to have 1,200 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium, as well as 170 metric tons of plutonium, the other critical ingredient for making warheads. Even so, 500 metric tons is enough to build more than 30,000 bombs as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima -- and enough to run the 109 operating nuclear power plants in the United States for about a decade.
After many delays, a small initial shipment of less than a ton of the Russian uranium is expected to arrive in the United States this month. It is part of an initial order of 6 tons, but private experts say the prospects for significant deliveries beyond that are dim.
The accord is lost in a "quagmire of incompetent implementation" and is "in danger of coming completely undone," Richard A. Falkenrath, a fellow at the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, concluded in a recent report.
Thomas L. Neff, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who proposed the deal in 1991, said in an interview: "The patient is in need of a heart transplant. Unfortunately, it seems we have only plastic surgeons."
The Administration has yet to develop a position on what steps to take and appears leery of speaking out. Senior officials were contacted at the State, Energy and Defense Departments, but only deputies would talk and then only on the condition of anonymity, saying some analysts were overstating the problems and that remedies in any event were sure to be found.
But they added that no consensus exists on what steps to take while insisting that a solution is reachable if only because the stakes for national security are so high.
"Hard things can be made to work," said a State Department official who is laboring on the issue. "This is worthwhile. It's worth putting a lot of effort into."
An official at the Energy Department said: "The situation's not simple. This is the only real money in the U.S.-Russian relationship. It's high stakes because of the big money and it's complex because of all the different constituencies involved. But I don't think things are as bad as people say. Like anything else, the devil is in the details, and we're working on those."
Some analysts say one trouble is that the deal tries to mix private gain and public policy. A federally owned corporation, the Enrichment Corporation of Bethesda, Md., which was chosen to carry out the deal, is deadlocked with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy over pricing, with no signs of compromise.
"Serious difficulties have arisen in the way of meeting the original expectations of both parties," Victor N. Mikhailov, head of Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, said last week in a letter to Lynn E. Davis, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs.
More broadly, many analysts say the deal was problematic from the start because it was so novel, involving substantial East-West transfers of nuclear material rather than its disposition by individual states, as in more usual forms of arms control.
William H. Timbers Jr., president of the Enrichment Corporation, said in an interview that the White House and Congress would fix the flaws and allow the deal to go forward. He added that analysts were unduly pessimistic, and that perhaps they had been misled by statements from Moscow.
"The Russians are very tough and wily negotiators," he said. "We try to be the same way."
Natural uranium is made up of a mix of isotopes, or different forms of the same element. Less than 1 percent of it is uranium 235, the fissionable isotope used in bombs and reactors. Uranium for most American nuclear power reactors is enriched to a level of about 4 percent uranium 235, while fuel for bombs is enriched to more than 90 percent.
The idea of reversing the usual process and diluting warheads was suggested in 1991 by Dr. Neff of M.I.T., who argued that it could aid Russia's transition to a market economy while helping to avoid a series of nuclear perils.
In 1992, President Bush announced the 20-year accord to buy 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium, hailing it as "making the world a safer place to live."
The Enrichment Corporation was chosen to carry out the deal, even though its specialty was concentrating uranium 235 rather than watering it down. Moreover, the company enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the United States on such work, enriching uranium for about $60 per separative work unit -- the standard measure of the effort used in processing varying amounts of the material -- and selling it to utilities for $120.
In contrast, the deal called for the company to buy the uranium from Russia for $82 per separative work unit in its first annual order, giving it a lower profit margin. In response, the company has unsuccessfully sought to recoup the difference from the Federal Government, and also unsuccessfully sought to drive the Russians down to a price of $68 per separative work unit on future orders.
More positively, the Russians, with an advance payment of $60 million, are starting to ship the initial order of six metric tons after overcoming dilution hurdles. The first shipment is to arrive by ship this month, said Mr. Timbers of the Enrichment Corporation. It consists of 0.786 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium from warheads that has been blended with other uranium to form 24 metric tons of reactor fuel.
The enrichment-pricing dispute is compounded by one involving world trade in uranium ore. As the Soviet Union collapsed, the Russians began selling ore at low prices in the United States, and the Commerce Department brokered agreements to stem this flow as a way to protect the domestic uranium industry.
This curtailment affected the deal because the Enrichment Corporation is having Russia dilute its bomb-grade uranium in Russia with Russian low-enriched uranium. But that material is now barred, in effect, from the United States market by strict trade quotas.
The company's plan is to circumvent the problem on a technicality by paying the Russians only for the enrichment costs and not for the uranium itself (about one-third of the product's value) until after the trade quotas expire in 2004. The Russians are objecting, saying they want the money now.
Solutions to these problems are being debated in the legislative and executive branches, including the National Security Council. The Administration seems to be moving toward a stance that favors relaxing the uranium-sale quotas so the Russians can be paid full price and putting the Enrichment Corporation on notice that it can be replaced if it is intransigent in its enrichment-pricing stance.
The force of such threats is limited, however, since getting a new agent would undermine the Enrichment Corporation's virtual monopoly and lessen its value, which currently stands at about $1.5 billion. The Government wants a high valuation so the Treasury reaps the maximum benefit when the company is sold, an action now planned for 1996.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, a Republican of New Mexico who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has introduced a bill that takes a different approach by creating a futures market that would generate cash now for delivery of the Russian nuclear material after the trade restrictions have expired. The bill's features, and the Administration's response, are to be discussed at the hearing on Tuesday.
Private experts say such steps are too timid, and many are calling for the replacement of the Enrichment Corporation or at least the reassertion of strong Administration control over the company and the deal. National-security concerns, they say, are being held hostage to corporate greed and domestic politics.
Among other solutions, Dr. Falkenrath of Harvard suggests that the Government throw open the process to competitive bidding. The Enrichment Corporation would have the first purchase option each year, which could be picked up by other companies if it showed no interest.
More boldly, he suggests, the Government might simply forgo the commercial route and buy the Russian bomb-grade uranium outright, feeding it slowly into the domestic market and eventually recouping its expenses.
"Those responsible for the national security of the United States," Dr. Falkenrath said in his report, could thus salvage the deal "from the quagmire of incompetent implementation where it now resides."

HEADLINE: At Fair for Survivalists, Fallout From Oklahoma

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., June 11

 BODY:
In their first big gathering since the Oklahoma City bombing, leaders and members of self-styled citizen militias converged here with hundreds of survivalists and seekers of self-sufficiency and holistic health for a Preparedness Expo, at which they did their best to distance themselves from the nation's worst act of terrorism.
The event was billed as a consumer fair to educate people about how to prepare for emergencies, including hurricanes, riots and "threats to our personal freedom." Booths were selling as much survival gear as herbal remedies. 
 For the first time in seven years, news cameras and tape recorders were banned, a sign of the resentment some groups hold against those who they say have unfairly linked them to the April 19 bombing that killed 167 people in Oklahoma City. Both suspects arrested in the attack, Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols, have been widely described by news organizations as militia sympathizers.
Some militia members said publicity had helped increase their numbers by making people aware of their movement. Bob Starr, who said he was the commander of the 112th battalion of the "Militia at Large of the Republic of Georgia," said membership in his group had quadrupled since the bombing, although he declined to give specific figures.
"It has done nothing but wake people up," he said. "They're beginning to see that government will do anything to restrict our freedoms."
In a speech on Saturday, a former Green Beret commander who is a leader of what he calls a Christian patriot movement, James (Bo) Gritz, spoke about current events that he said had fulfilled Bible prophecies. But he digressed to rate Mr. McVeigh as merely a driver who could not possibly be the "Rembrandt" behind what he called a sophisticated and highly professional demolition job. Mr. Gritz thought a Federal Government operative was a more likely culprit.
"Somewhere, somebody says, 'If this happened it would probably clear the way for some progressive programs,' " he told an audience of 450 people. "That's all it takes."
He then made a pitch for his paramilitary training videos, which came in a three-tape set for $60 and "would make you as qualified to wear a Green Beret as any Special Forces soldier," he said.
Dan Chittock, a 36-year-old entrepreneur who has organized the show since 1989, said 2,000 to 3,000 people came to the Orange County Convention Center for the three-day event, which ended today. Among them were newcomers who said they were looking for a different point of view, regulars who swapped conspiracy stories, and the curious. These included some members of the Loyal Order of Moose and the Women of the Moose who migrated to the Expo from their 107th annual meeting elsewhere in the hall.
A retired postal worker who said he also attended last year said he was increasingly alarmed by the "decay of society" and wanted to learn to prepare for emergency situations, like finding out what kinds of edible plants are in the woods.
"This is a very unstable world we live in," said the 55-year-old man, who like many other participants refused to give his name. "What makes us immune to wars?"
But first-timers like Roy Olsen, 33, a communications technician from Boynton Beach, Fla., said he was taken aback by the paramilitary aspects of the fair.
"I was looking into self-sufficiency more in the way of getting myself a farm together," he said. "I didn't know it was more militia type."
Mr. Olsen, who bought a juicer and was considering leaving early as he waited for a lecture billed as "Preparing for the Economic and Political Convulsions of the 90's," said he could not help but feeling a little paranoid.
"Last night I started having bad thoughts. Gee, I can get on an F.B.I. list," he said.
As men in camouflage mingled with naturopathic doctors, and browsers strolled by displays of gold jewelry, Army field manuals (including "Explosives and Demolitions") and information on how to obtain news about the paramilitary movement on the Internet, familiar militia themes echoed from the stage. There were warnings about the United Nations and a movement toward a single world government, the so-called New World Order.
There were attacks on the anti-terrorism bill in Congress that would give law-enforcement officials expanded powers and on what speakers saw as efforts by the anti-gun lobby to use the Oklahoma bombing as an excuse to force Americans to disarm.
"My definition of gun control is hitting the target with every shot," Mr. Gritz told the crowd on Friday night during a panel discussion.
In a fiery speech on Saturday night, Mark Koernke, who comes from Michigan and calls himself a militia strategist and who until recently had talk show on short-wave radio, said patriots were not anarchists or anti-government. They are, he said, unwavering defenders of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which militia members say makes every American one of them.
Mr. Koernke urged the audience to prepare against any possible attacks on "the republic" and to teach their children to put differences and infighting aside and take advantage of the attention showered on them. He also advocated using the political process by moving together to towns where they could create majorities and control the local government.
"We're literally a vast movement," he said. "This is not the time to sit back. This is not the time to hide."
But for some, it was time to take off from the serious programs and go to Walt Disney World nearby. These included Jack McLamb, a retired Arizona police officer who wrote a booklet warning of a plan to unite the world under the United Nations by 2001. The booklet, "Operation Vampire Killer," was among the papers found by the F.B.I. while searching the pickup truck of Mr. McVeigh's sister, Jennifer.

HEADLINE: The Hamptons-Bound Find Luxury in Coach

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Outside, the Saabs and Land Rovers air-kiss each other's bumpers as they crawl east on the Long Island Expressway.
Inside, the ladies come and go, their drying toenails held apart with puffs of cotton as they pad about, from the styling chair, to the table laden with salmon sandwiches and fresh strawberries, to the marble-floored toilet cubicle. 
 Margarita Levitin, 26, a Cindy Crawfordesque brunette with wraparound sunglasses tucked into the deep V-neck of her black sweater, lights up as she watches a video on fashion trends, courtesy of Vogue. "Fendi furs!" she exclaims. "The best!"
This is the Magic Bus, circa 1995, where the magic is makeup and the destination is the summer swirl of high-society weddings and see-and-be-seen restaurants of the Hamptons.
The luxury bus, officially the Gil Gamlieli Beauty Express, began offering its mobile pampering this summer to clients willing to spend $250 and up -- usually up -- for a three-hour salon session on wheels. Leaving from Mr. Gamlieli's Upper East Side salon on Friday afternoons and returning Monday mornings, it offers almost every usual beauty service except hair coloring and cutting (scissors are deemed too dangerous for the road).
"It's amazing, amazing, it's really amazing," Mr. Gamlieli, an Israeli-born stylist with a long face and luminous eyes, says of the interest the new bus service has evoked. "I really like the feeling we hit the right thing at the right time.
"Europeans went crazy about it," he says. "They say, 'Only in New York.' "
For those who question the wisdom of applying coats of foundation and hairspray on the way to the beach, the answer is simple: The Hamptons are so much more than a beach.
"The weather's not like New York City, but you get the same people," says Donna Lourie, 30, a travel agency owner on her first Beauty Express trip. "People think they're very laid-back out here. I don't think so. They're the same. And for the single person who's actively looking, this is the place. It's a scene. It's a total scene."
To prepare for last weekend's scene, three women -- Ms. Lourie; Ms. Levitin, an unemployed clothing buyer, and Linda Siegal, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who runs a concierge service -- board the bus at 2 P.M. Friday. All hair washing, coloring and cutting has already been done in the salon.
"This is definitely hot and new," Ms. Siegal says as the blow-drying and face-painting get under way. "Who cares if you're sitting in traffic, if you're getting your nails done?"
Passengers are cosseted by a staff of four -- Mr. Gamlieli, a manicurist, a makeup artist and an attendant who offers coffee, champagne, fruit and sandwiches every 15 minutes or so. The bus's driver and owner, Hilik Swimir, says the coach, with its long leather seats and divans, microwave, refrigerator and television, is worth about a half-million dollars.
Unexpectedly, the bus jounces as it hits a pothole.
"Hilik!" Mr. Gamlieli calls in cheerful annoyance.
"I'm sorry, it's really bumpy today!" Mr. Swimir calls back.
"Tell us, 'Now is the bumpy time,' like in the airplane!" Mr. Gamlieli implores.
The bumpy time can be tricky: one weekend the makeup artist had to ask for a mascara stop, and lip-liner can present a major challenge. Boxes of powders or swabs crash to the floor once or twice a trip.
As the bus hits a smooth stretch of highway, the talk turns to the dates the women are planning for the weekend, and to the hard work they have put in all week that lets them feel deserving of this special treatment.
Ms. Siegal, who runs the concierge business, tells of a dinner she is planning for connoisseurs of Scotch and cigars, at "only $125 a plate." Ms. Lourie's nails, done in Pretty in Pink, are drying. Mr. Gamlieli describes the super-bus he plans for next summer, with a giant water tank to allow shampooing on board.
Ms. Lourie mentions some of her clients, "Young guys making millions -- they don't know what to do with all their money."
"Where are they?" Ms. Levitin asks, half-smiling.
The conversation switches to the impending death of Broadway, and Brooke Shields's inability to sing, dance or act. A giant souffle loaf, filled with various crustless sandwiches, is broken open, and the networking begins.
"Next week we'll sit down and we'll talk," Ms. Siegal says to Ms. Lourie. "I could refer you a lot of business."
Mr. Gamlieli observes with approval, "I think New York grows so fast a new generation of business ladies."
Ms. Siegal heads back to have her hair blown out. Ms. Levitin, her hair now retro-mod with a 60's-style flip and side part, is getting black 50's-style eyeliner to match. Ms. Lourie notes that this is the first time she has had the luxury of letting her pedicure dry. Usually, she says, she crams her wet toes into her shoes and goes back to work.
"I'm, like, in shock," Ms. Levitin says when her makeup is done. "I don't recognize myself. I'm like Nancy Sinatra in the white boots."
Time for the Vogue trend report on video. The passengers watch fitted suits parade along the runway.
"This is how the French have looked for years," Ms. Levitin says. "When you go to Paris, they're so put together."
On the video, beauty gurus preach: "The lip is pale this season. The nail is ultra-groomed."
The regular bus between Manhattan and the Hamptons, the Hampton Jitney -- $36 for a round trip -- passes going the other way. The Beauty Express passengers laugh with cheery disdain.
Ms. Siegal is looking at herself in the mirror, at the bold blue shadow on her eyelids and the swirling blond curls that Mr. Gamlieli dubs "the romantic look."
"I do not feel like me at all," she says. "This has been the most enjoyable ride I've ever had to the Hamptons. I never do this -- I don't pamper myself enough. I get manicures and pedicures but I never blow my hair dry. I never have my makeup done."
Mr. Gamlieli, pinning up Ms. Siegal's hair, is thrown onto a seat as the bus rounds a sharp curve.
"Hilik!" he calls. "Tell us before!"
Coffee is offered all around, and fragrant hot towels. The vegetation has grown flat; the sea is near. Ms. Siegal and Ms. Levitin chat about restaurants.
"Everywhere I go, no matter where I go, I know people," Ms. Levitin says. "You know where I haven't been yet? Robert De Niro's new sushi restaurant."
"I was there last night," Ms. Siegal says.
The bus glides into Southampton, and a Mercedes convertible whizzes by.
"I want to be in that car," Ms. Levitin says, then reconsiders. "But then, the hairdo . . ."
"Keep it for Sunday," Mr. Gamlieli recommends.
The bus lurches up to the beach. A sign says weekend parking is $20 a day. Mr. Gamlieli weaves his plans out loud for beauty services by the shore: conditioning to protect hair and bring out highlights, "a quick bikini wax for the women who forgot it, and she's really embarrassed."
The passengers walk off the bus. Ms. Levitin lights a cigarette and wiggles her Ballet Slipper pink toenails in the soft sand.

HEADLINE: A Rare Nudge for a Drop in Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today made its most public effort to persuade the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, with Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, saying that any help from the central bank in preventing a recession would be appreciated.
Asked on the NBC News program "Meet The Press" whether the Federal Reserve should reduce interest rates to prevent the American economy from slipping into a recession, Mr. Panetta said, "Well, it would be nice to get whatever kind of cooperation we can get to get this economy going." 
 Asked if his comments were an effort to jawbone the Fed into cutting rates, Mr. Panetta replied with a laugh, "Is that what it's called?"
The Fed raised short-term interest rates seven times between Feb. 4, 1994, and Feb. 1 of this year. While many on Wall Street were anticipating a rate cut before too long, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, implied on Wednesday that such a step was unlikely. In remarks that sent bond prices tumbling and interest rates up, Mr. Greenspan raised the possibility of a recession but said he thought the economy would recover later in the year.
The decisions on interest-rate policy that the Federal Reserve makes in the next few months are likely to have more influence on President Clinton's re-election prospects than any other economic policy decisions in the next year and a half. Changes in short-term interest rates, which the Federal Reserve directly controls, can take a year to affect the economy fully and are the biggest single influence on the pace of economic growth in the United States.
Mr. Panetta's comments represented a breach of the Administration's policy for the last two years of refraining from comment about the highly independent central bank. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin imposed the ban on such comment while serving as head of the White House's National Economic Council.
The ban reflects the view of the Administration's economists and Wall Street veterans alike that nudging the Federal Reserve accomplishes little, particularly when done in public. The central bank has been known in the past to do the opposite of what the White House desired in order to demonstrate its indepenence.
White House criticism of the Federal Reserve also tends to unnerve financial markets, driving down bond prices and the value of the dollar and driving up long-term interest rates. That is because investors worry that if an Administration succeeds in jawboning the Federal Reserve into lowering short-term interest rates for political rather than economic reasons, the resulting faster money supply growth and possibly faster economic growth will eventually lead to higher inflation.
When Mr. Greenspan abruptly canceled a speech in Houston on March 18, 1994, because President Clinton had called him to the White House, financial markets were thrown into turmoil. The bond market gave up a week of gains and long-term interest rates climbed.
The Federal Reserve might be vulnerable to pressure now because Mr. Greenspan's term expires next March, and he is widely believed to want President Clinton to appoint him to a third term. At the same time, Mr. Greenspan is described by close associates as eager to leave a reputation as an inflation fighter and is unlikely to sacrifice that reputation by slashing interest rates now if he thinks the economy's condition does not warrant such a move.
Notwithstanding his comment today on the Fed, Mr. Panetta said he did not anticipate a recession. "Everybody's a little concerned about where it is right now, but I think we all feel that it isn't going to go into a recession," he said. "We're going to see a period of growth take place at the end of this year and into next year."
Mr. Greenspan was in Basel, Switzerland, today for a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements. In remarks there to journalists, he repeated his assessment that the odds had diminished of the United States having a severe, inventory-led recession. But the likelihood of a brief economic downturn had risen, he noted, repeating the gist of his comments last Wednesday.
"Because of the dramatic slowing of the economy, the probability of the type of severe inventory recession that we would have had -- had the economy kept going and still been strong at this point -- the probability of that scenario has gone down dramatically," he said. "The probability of a modest adjustment -- whether you call it a recession or not -- has obviously gone up as a consequence."

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Wider Links With Cubans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Once the furor over new rules on Cuban immigration dies down, the Clinton Administration plans to make an important shift in policy by announcing expanded contacts between Americans and Cubans as a way of undermining Fidel Castro.
Officials are quick to say that they plan to continue to isolate Mr. Castro and maintain the economic sanctions of the last 30 years, which the White House actually toughened last summer. But they contend that the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe demonstrated the value of increased contacts in the form of, for example, educational exchanges. 
 So far, they have held off out of concern that Cuban-American groups and Congressional Republicans would criticize the increased contacts as moves toward normalizing relations with Havana.
Among the many steps under consideration are allowing American news organizations to open bureaus in Cuba, funneling money and fax machines to Cuban human rights activists, and arranging exchanges of American and Cuban clerics, students, academics and artists.
"Eastern European officials told us that these tools made a real difference in bringing down Communism," said a senior policy maker.
Some of President Clinton's foreign policy advisers were pressing to announce the moves early last month when the Administration announced it would send boat people seeking refuge here back to Cuba. Many Cuban-American groups, especially the powerful Cuban-American National Foundation, condemned the change as a concession and a step toward normalization.
Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is probably the Administration's chief adviser on Cuba, has warned against actions that might be construed as steps toward normalization until the anger dies down among Cuban-Americans.
"If a better climate gets created in two to three months -- that's about how long we think it will take -- then we have a moral obligation to take further steps to help people on the island push for democracy," a senior State Department official said.
Administration officials say the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 embraced two strategies to weaken Mr. Castro: tightening the trade embargo and increasing contacts among people of the two countries. The philosophy was that a greater flow of Western ideas to Cuba would speed Cubans' embrace of democracy.
"There is a strong sense in the Administration that we should be more aggressive in advancing the aims of the Cuban Democracy Act," said a top Administration policy maker on Cuba.
Senator Graham had told the Administration that the timing should turn in part on whether Havana fulfills its pledge to avoid reprisals against boat people sent back to Cuba. If there are reprisals, the reasoning goes, that will provide ammunition to critics who say the Administration was misguided and naive to trust Havana's promises.
"If there are credible stories of people repatriated being beaten up or worse, it will weaken the Administration's hand," Mr. Graham said.
Administration officials acknowledge they are wary that announcing increased contacts might widen the schism with the Cuban-American National Foundation. But they say that many Cuban-Americans, upset that their relatives are trapped on the Communist island, are lobbying for increased contacts as a way of breathing intellectual fresh air into Cuba.
Officials say they have been considering the new policy for months, and Cuba's recent decision to release its two most prominent political prisoners could help the Administration make this decision.
Responding to pleas from the United States and France, Mr. Castro freed the two prisoners 10 days ago in what was widely viewed as an effort to earn good will with Washington. The two, Rolando Indamiro Restano Diaz and Sebastian Arcos Bergnes, had been held more than three years on charges of seeking to subvert the Cuban state.
Officials said there was no link to whether Cuba hands over Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive financier arrested last week.
Judging from its recent remarks, the Cuban-American National Foundation does not trust the Administration to increase contacts in a way that turns up the heat on Havana.
"If such steps are pursued with the original intention -- to force open Cuban society -- and are used in an offensive way against Castro, then it's something we endorse," said Jose Cardenas, director of the foundation's Washington office. "But we worry that with this Administration, it will just mean Cubans and Americans sit around and have coffee, the Americans spend hard currency in Cuba and then everyone goes home. We can't be very excited about that."
Some Cuban-Americans say Castro might resent the moves and try to block some of them.
 Having defied the foundation's influential president, Jorge Mas Canosa, on immigration policy, the Administration seems less daunted about defying him again, partly because he is raising money for the Republican Party. Moreover, the Administration dismisses Mr. Mas's claim to speak for all Cuban-Americans since polls show that almost half the Cubn-Americans in Florida support the new immigration policy.
Another indicator of coming changes was the selection last month of Richard Nuccio, known as a pragmatist open to expanded contacts, as the President's special adviser on Cuba.
Several of the Administration's policy makers on Cuba say allowing American newspapers or networks to open bureaus in Havana should be a priority because it would -- at least in theory -- advance democracy and help focus attention on Cuba's human rights violations. But Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who heads the House Subcommittee on Western Hemispheric Affairs, says such a move would only prop up Castro with hard currency.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who wrote the Cuban Democracy Act, asserts that the Administration should have allowed news bureaus in Havana months ago.
"If Castro gains $7 million in foreign exchange from having newspapers and networks in Havana, that's money I'd welcome him to receive," he said. "These news bureaus will make it impossible for Castro to harass human rights people the way he has in the past."

HEADLINE: If Devils Leave New Jersey, Life on Rte. 3 Will Not End

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
The New Jersey Devils are threatening to skate into the Stanley Cup finals and then keep right on skating to a new home in Nashville. So the Stadium Cafe, across Route 3 from the Devils' home ice at the Meadowlands Sports Complex, should be a good place to listen to the fans' anguished cries, standard background music for any team on the verge of packing its equipment bags.
"Oh yes, I heard about that last night," said a waitress, nonchalantly, as she headed off to find the owner, Craig Petrillo. 
 Clearly, she just didn't get it. Mr. Petrillo, 32 and muscular, proudly displays a picture of the Devils' general manager, Lou Lamoriello, taken in his restaurant. Mr. Petrillo must be quite the Devils fan.
"Not a big one," he said sheepishly.
But what if they leave? He is not rooting for it, he said, but added, "Personally, I don't think it will be a tremendous blow."
New Jersey is used to being viewed by outsiders as just a string of rest stops along the highway, a way station for transients, the latest of which may be an ice hockey team.
The relatively subdued response to the Devils' threat to leave New Jersey is fitting, given that the response to their presence for many years was the equivalent of one fan clapping. Winning has brought them a surge in popularity, particularly among younger fans, as well as a fan club with a telephone line and an E-mail address. But their lure is peaking just as the team is slouching toward Nashville.
The fate of the Devils does not rank with the wrenching sports dramas of our time -- the flight west of the Dodgers and the Giants or the midnight exit of the Baltimore Colts. There is the usual back and forth between team owners and public officials about the terms of the Devils' lease, but there are no schoolchildren collecting nickels to make up the difference, no fans raising money to buy the team, no season ticket holders chaining themselves to the Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
Hockey buffs are beginning to speak up, though. "My husband and I gave up our nine-year subscription to the Metropolitan Opera four years ago so we could invest in season tickets for the Devils," Nicki Silverstein of Pompton Lakes, N.J., wrote to The Record of Hackensack.
And Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the state's premier Devils fan, did to the Devils negotiations what Bill Clinton did to health care reform: she sent in her spouse, a friend of the Devils' owner, John McMullen, to try to smooth out inequities the teams sees with its lease. So far, the First Gentleman has had no more success than the First Lady.
And a New Jersey businessman, Robert E. Brennan, recently made an unsuccessful attempt to buy the Devils and keep them at the Meadowlands.
Hockey is a lower-rung sport in terms of fan attendance, and when the Devils arrived from Denver in 1982, New York City area hockey fans had considered the Rangers part of the family for three generations. Few households have room for a stray hockey team. Those that did already had the Islanders.
"I was a Rangers fan growing up. My father was a Rangers fan. My son was a Rangers fan. And if he has a son, I'm sure he'll be a Rangers fan," said Ben Leuzzi, the owner of the Verona Sports Center in Verona, N.J. Mr. Leuzzi even knows some of the Devils players, and wishes them no ill. But when the Devils and the Rangers play, "I throw all that away. I'm a Rangers fan."
Even as the Devils attract more fans as they move closer to the Stanley Cup, the moment of romance is being threatened by their potential exit.
"The love affair's just beginning, and what you have now is the possibility of coitus interruptus," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College who studies the sports industry, and a former New Yorker who roots for the Rangers. "Any human with a grain of intelligence in that situation will defend themselves, will not totally involve themselves emotionally in the team."
But what do kids know about romance? "My son is up in arms if the Devils leave New Jersey," said Linda Casale, a secretary in the New Jersey Supreme Court who lives in Nutley. Her 13-year-old son is part of the suburban hockey craze, and the Devils are the closest team to his house. Her husband is a different story.
"My husband is a die-hard Rangers fan," Mrs. Casale said. "That's what he grew up with. My son is in his glory with the Rangers out and the Devils going for the Stanley Cup. I kind of enjoy my little son giving it to Dad."
Hockey is a booming street sport, thanks to Rollerblades, which makes it possible to play in a driveway or playground just like baseball and basketball. When Brick Township in Ocean County announced an in-line skate hockey league for kids 5 to 17 this year, "We expected to have six to eight teams," said Bob Auriemma, the high school ice hockey coach. "We ended up with 22."
Mr. Auriemma coached Jim Dowd, one of the Devil players, and frequently comes to the Meadowlands to watch his most famous student. He can see the Devils' following growing stronger, but, he said, "They're battling with the old loyalties with the Philadelphia Flyers and the Rangers." Which brings up New Jersey's painful, endless search for an identity.
The Meadowlands sports complex has drawn an unprecedented four professional teams, but the two most prominent, the Giants and the Jets, refuse to put New Jersey in front of their names. So the state is left with the New Jersey Devils and the New Jersey Nets, a team widely derided for its losing ways.
"They're just a bunch of overpaid cry babies," Joe Poalillo, 38, said of the Nets as he dined late last week with his buddies at the lunch truck parked outside the Berlin & Jones envelope plant in East Rutherford. "They don't represent New Jersey. They belong in Connecticut."
Janice Ballou, director of the Eagleton Poll at Rutgers University, said she was hardly surprised that the threatened Devils' departure had not caused an uproar. The attempted escape of a team with a long tradition in a particular city would be different, she said.
"The arena is not in a real town," she said. "If it was the Newark Devils and it helped the local economy and people there really rallied around the team, then it might be different. The Meadowlands is sort of a nebulous place. East Rutherford is not really a town."
Yale Glazer, a 23-year-old legal intern for a state court judge in Hackensack whose family moved from the suburbs of Baltimore to Bergen County five years ago, said he still winces at the memory of the Colts' unexpected exit from Baltimore in 1984. He said it hurt Baltimore, but he doubts that the soul of New Jersey will suffer if the Devils leave.
"I don't think New Jersey really has an identity," he said.
But what does he know? He's just another transient.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Even at the Stadium Cafe, across Route 3 from the Devils' home ice, there is little anguish over the team's threat to move. "I don't think it will be a tremendous blow," said the cafe's owner, Craig Petrillo. (Dith Pran/The New York Times)(pg. B5)

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid HAs Its Uses

BYLINE: By Brent Scowcroft; Brent Scowcroft, president of the Forum for International Policy, a foreign affairs foundation, was national security adviser under President George Bush and Gerald Ford.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Foreign assistance is again undergoing the "perils of Pauline" as it wends through the Congressional gantlet. This happens yearly, but the dangers today seem especially ominous. With the search for budget economies so desperate, using up funds for what detractors call foreign giveaways when programs to assist needy Americans are being slashed seems unconscionable to many.
Foreign assistance, with us since the Marshall Plan, has been perhaps the most unpopular legislation to come before Congress for some years. The increased peril it faces arises mainly from the loss of the justification the cold war provided. 
 The case for foreign assistance is simple, basic -- and misunderstood. The core argument is that foreign assistance is a fundamental instrument of foreign policy.
There are three main ways through which, separately or in combination, we can exert influence abroad. One is traditional diplomacy. Another is economic or military coercion. When diplomacy alone is inadequate and coercion too extreme or inappropriate, we have to turn to foreign assistance -- the use of economic incentives.
Why the difficulty in persuading Congress and the nation of its merits? One reason is that some foreign assistance programs, however meritorious, have become so encrusted with activities and outlays that have so little to do with our direct national interests that the main purpose of the programs has become obscured.
In the cold war, our aid programs could carry this burden, but now the entire economic assistance edifice is endangered. We must refocus the programs to make them directly relevant to our national interests. For example, we need to emphasize the security requirements of countries of particular concern -- Israel and Turkey, for example. We have to strengthen stability in areas of strategic interest: Gaza, Jericho, Poland and Czechoslovakia. We should see the Central American peace process through to its conclusion.
We need to suitably compensate countries that provide military installations as well as cooperation and support on issues of particular importance to us. For example, we recently offered incentives to Caribbean countries to accept Haitian and Cuban refugees.
We need to be able to respond quickly to unforeseen circumstances and unusual opportunities. For example, right after the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, we helped Panama pay off its debts to international financial institutions, thus making other economic aid possible.
When Fidel Castro leaves the scene, economic assistance to Cuba may be needed immediately to ease the transition. A contingency fund for that purpose would be useful.
Support for democracy and for sustainable economic development serve our interests, but they are not top priorities. For example, help for the Development Fund for Africa would flow from the American tradition of compassion and altruism. And while our contributions to such international financial institutions clearly benefit us in the long term, we should base such aid on our wish to promote global prosperity rather than to promote specific American interests.
Like it or not, America has inherited the mantle of world leadership. In searching for budget cuts, we must not destroy foreign aid, a crucial means of exercising that leadership.

HEADLINE: How Albany Works, Lesson 1: Lobbying;
The Beverage Industry Pushes Hard for a Tax Break, and Succeeds

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 10

 BODY:
The economic studies calling for cuts in beer and soda taxes landed in legislators' offices last year along with complimentary cases of Pepsi. In March, soda bottlers treated lawmakers to sea bass and champagne at Lutece and the Four Seasons.
The payoff arrived last week: tax cuts worth $26 million a year to the soda industry by 1997, mostly to bottlers, and $16 million a year to the beer industry, mostly to wholesalers. 
 At bottling plants, supervisors gave workers pens and paper at the beginning of their shifts and prodded them to write to their legislators. Beer and soda industry trade groups delivered hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to state officials and spent thousands more on retainers for Albany's best-connected lobbyists.
One beverage industry official estimated that the soda industry spent about $2 million in its four-year lobbying campaign for the tax cuts, and that the beer companies probably spent less. "That's a pretty good return on investment," he said.
The story of this year's cuts in New York's beer and soda taxes, passed by the Legislature on June 2 as part of a larger package of tax cuts, provides an object lesson in the way Albany works. Like most seats of government, it is a city where money, influence and intense lobbying are often the driving forces behind legislation, even when a case might stand on its own.
The beer and soda tax cuts make for a particularly compelling study because even the most ardent supporters of lower taxes, including the Business Council of New York State and the Pataki administration, did not identify those taxes as top targets for reduction. And the leading advocate for business tax cuts, Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader and a Rensselaer County Republican, acknowledges that there is no assurance that the tax reductions will produce either large numbers of jobs or lower prices for consumers.
But the tax cuts were enacted anyway, because of a confluence of tenacious lobbying, widespread sympathy for the beer and soda industries and an ideal political climate.
In a budget fight that had largely devolved into a partisan battle between Gov. George E. Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Mr. Bruno chose to assert his political relevance by insisting on cuts in business taxes. And with relatively little money available, the leaders concluded that it would be best to seek relief in specific industries, rather than to make a broad-based tax cut that might be too small to be felt.
Soft drink bottlers and beer wholesalers say that lower taxes will create jobs. Several soda bottlers have already announced plans for expansion or canceled plans to move out of state. "I can promise you that we would have gone to Connecticut," said Tim Tenney, president of Pepsi-Cola of the Hudson Valley, who recently announced that he would add 60 jobs at his plant in Newburgh, N.Y.
But critics of the cuts call them a giveaway to industries that have made large campaign contributions to Mr. Pataki and to legislative re-election committees. "I call it Slurp, or Special Lobbyist Unexpected Reward Package," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat. "And that's also the most prominent sound heard at Republican fund-raisers as benefactors meet legislators."
Four years ago, the leaders of New York's beer and soda industries decided that they would spare no expense to fight new taxes that were eating into their profits. They began to wage a war on several fronts to defeat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whom they considered a longtime enemy of their interests, and to strengthen support in the Legislature.
In last year's campaign, the New York State Soft Drink Association contributed $145,000 to state candidates, a large amount even by the standards of New York political action committees. Financial disclosure records show that the donations included $38,250 to Mr. Pataki; $33,000 to the Senate Republican campaign committee, which is controlled now by Mr. Bruno, and $12,000 to the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee, which is controlled by Mr. Silver. Another $65,000 has gone out the door this year, said James Featherstonhaugh, an Albany lobbyist hired by Pepsi.
The New York State Beer Wholesalers Association gave $127,000 last year, including $40,000 to the Senate Republicans, $30,000 to the Assembly Democrats and $7,100 to Mr. Pataki. The contributions from both trade groups do not reflect other large donations from individuals and businesses, officials associated with the groups said.
Even more was spent on lobbyists. Mr. Featherstonhaugh will be paid $60,000 this year by Pepsi, and Robert J. Malito was retained for $108,000 by Coca-Cola, according to state lobbying commission records. Michael E. Vacek, the president of the beer wholesalers group, will receive $50,000. Anheuser-Busch retained the firm of Kopley & Ryan for $110,000, and Miller Brewing hired Richard L. Smith for $65,000.
Peter G. Wilcox, the manager of government affairs for Pepsi, which is based in Somers, N.Y., took Mr. Bruno and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, to dinner at Lutece with other party officials and a number of bottlers. The tab, according to lobbying records, was $1,397. He took Democratic legislators to the Four Seasons, where the bill ran to $2,354.
When it looked like the tax cut might be in trouble, Mr. Wilcox sent lawmakers letters that began "Please don't throw in the towel," and enclosed Pepsi towels. To firm up support in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, Don Thomas, a black executive with Pepsi in New York City, was recruited to lobby minority legislators.
"Every moment you get, you pitch your angle," said one soda industry official, who requested anonymity. "Every chance you get to get inside their agenda, you do it."
The five tax cuts ultimately selected by the leaders are expected to save the industry about $50 million this year and about $160 million next year when fully implemented. The leaders agreed to cut the 2-cent tax on nonrefillable soda containers in half and to cut the 21-cent excise tax on beer to 16 cents. They also cut the estate tax, parimutuel taxes and the petroleum business tax on aviation fuel, diesel motor fuel and heating oil for nonprofit groups.
When Mr. Pataki originally proposed his budget in February, he did not include business tax cuts, focusing instead on reducing income taxes. But in meeting after meeting with Mr. Pataki and Mr. Silver, Mr. Bruno made it clear that he would not agree to a budget without them.
"My attitude was that a business tax cut package had to be part of the budget if we were going to close," Mr. Bruno said.
The speaker's top priority was restoring spending for the social and educational programs that Mr. Pataki had proposed to slash. But it eventually became apparent to Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, that Mr. Bruno's price for agreeing to Democratic spending restorations would be a modest package of business tax cuts.
"He needed something to show that he had some part of the budget process," Mr. Silver said. But the state's large budget gap and the expense of Mr. Pataki's three-year package of income tax cuts insured that there would be relatively little for business tax cuts.
The Business Council of New York State, an influential voice on tax issues, pushed for a reduction in the gross receipts tax, a tax on utility revenues that is passed along to consumers in the form of higher rates. The leaders decided, however, that a meaningful cut there would be unaffordable.
Instead they chose to focus on the estate tax, which all sides believed was unreasonably burdensome, and on business taxes imposed on specific industries. The obvious goal was to choose tax cuts that would spur development. Mr. Pataki, for instance, favored cutting a tax on large real-estate sales.
But Mr. Silver opposed the real-estate measure, and Mr. Bruno made it clear that he wanted money set aside to lower the beverage taxes. "He just thought they were bad taxes," said one Pataki aide.
During the 1990 legislative session, Governor Cuomo and the Legislature created the 2-cent tax on non-refillable soda containers to pay debt service on a $1.95 billion environmental bond act that would appear on the ballot later that year. They also raised the tax on beer to 21 cents per gallon from 10 cents to pay off the environmental bonds.
That November, voters rejected the bond act. But with the state treasury choked by recession, the tax increases remained. They had strong support from environmental lobbyists, who argued that the revenue should be used for the kinds of projects the bond act would have financed. Even Mr. Pataki said during last year's campaign that some of the revenue should be dedicated to an environmental fund.
But beer and soda industry officials said the tax increases forced them to close bottling plants, lay off workers and shelve plans for expansion. Stiff competition, they said, kept them from passing the increases on to their consumers. Instead, retailers illegally bought cheaper beverages from wholesalers in neighboring states and avoided paying the New York taxes.
"The industry's view was that it was going to destroy the industry in New York," said Mr. Featherstonhaugh. "And they made a decision that this tax was so bad that they had to make an unusual and extraordinary effort to get relief."
 
 
 
How to Win a Tax Cut
The state budget approved last week included tax cuts ultimately worth $26 million for soda bottlers and $16 million for beer wholesalers. A page from the playbook of the four-year multi-front lobbying campaign shows how those industries helped make it happen.
 
1.) HIRE WELL-CONNECTED LOBBYISTS. The New York State Soft Drink Association, the Coca-Cola Company and the Pepsi-Cola Company hired James Featherstonhaugh and Robert J. Malito, two of Albany's most prominent lobbyists, for retainers totaling $168,000. The beer industry also hired a high-powered team of lobbyists, and Peter J. Wilcox, the government affairs manager for Pepsi, also played a vital role.
 
2.) MAKE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. The Soft Drink Association's political action committee contributed $145,319 to legislative and gubernatorial candidates, including $38,250 to Gov. George E. Pataki and $33,000 to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee. The New York State Beer Wholesalers Association gave $127,430 last year, including $40,000 to the Senate Republicans.
 
3.) WINE AND DINE LEGISLATORS. Pepsi lobbyists treated Senate majority leader Joseph L. Bruno, state Republican chairman William D. Powers, and other party leaders to a $1,397 dinner at Lutece. Democratic legislators were taken to The Four Seasons, where the tab ran to $2,354.
 
4.) GRASSROOTS ACTION. Managers at Pepsi bottling plants around the state encouraged workers to write local legislators and gave them time on the job to do so. The result: 6,000 letters.

HEADLINE: Congress Preparing a Major Overhaul of Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
While lobbyists and lawmakers fight over Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, Congress is planning even bigger changes and deeper cuts in projected spending for Medicaid, which finances care for low-income people.
Medicaid started as a source of health care for welfare recipients, and many people still think of it that way. But two-thirds of the Medicaid money is spent on people who are elderly or disabled. 
 "Most people don't realize that Medicaid pays for the care of two out of every three nursing home residents, most of whom are poor, frail women who need round-the-clock nursing care," said Paul R. Willging, executive vice president of the American Health Care Association, a trade group for 11,000 nursing homes.
Poor people do not have much of a lobby on Capitol Hill. But hospitals and nursing homes are sounding alarms about the cutbacks in Medicaid recently endorsed by the House and the Senate as part of their plans to balance the Federal budget in seven years.
Federal Medicaid spending quadrupled in the past decade and doubled in the past five years, reaching $82 billion in 1994. With no change in current law, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the program will grow an average 10 percent in each of the next seven years.
The House and the Senate have both voted to cut that growth to 5 percent a year, but they have not specified how to do it. Republican leaders have also proposed to place a limit on Medicaid spending, effectively ending its status as a benefit guaranteed to all who meet eligibility criteria, and to turn the money over to states through block grants. States already have substantial discretion in setting eligibility criteria and defining the scope of benefits. As a result, the maximum income for families seeking Medicaid coverage varies from state to state.
Republican governors say they can accept such cuts if they get new authority to design and run health programs for poor people, free of the Federal laws and regulations that now govern minute details of Medicaid.
But Bruce C. Vladeck, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicaid and Medicare, said the fiscal blueprints approved by Congress would require "Draconian cuts in Medicaid." And he said it was "impossible to make cuts of that magnitude without hurting some beneficiaries."
Soaring Medicaid costs reflect inflation in the health care industry and increases in the number of recipients. In the past decade, Congress has repeatedly expanded eligibility, offering Medicaid to millions of pregnant women and children. In addition, Medicaid has picked up low-income workers who lost health insurance provided by their employers.
"The increases in Medicaid have hidden or masked the decline in employer-sponsored coverage over the last five years," said John F. Holahan, director of the health policy center at the Urban Institute, a research center here. "If Medicaid contracts as well, the number of uninsured may go up."
Barbara D. Matula, who has been Medicaid director of North Carolina since 1979, said that to cope with the proposed limits on Medicaid spending, states would have to tighten eligibility and freeze or reduce enrollment.
Medicaid serves nearly 37 million people, about half of them children. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment will grow 3.5 percent a year, to 43.7 million in 2000. Fast-growing states like Florida, Texas and Arizona expect sharper increases.
Medicaid is now an open-ended entitlement, available to anyone who meets the eligibility criteria. This guarantee, which dates to creation of the program in 1965, is likely to be changed this year. Republican leaders of Congress want to use the block grants to give each state a fixed sum of Federal money, which the state could use in any way it wanted to provide medical care to low-income people. Under such an arrangement, there is no guarantee that people now entitled to Medicaid would receive it in the future.
Sara Rosenbaum, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for Health Policy Research, said that while millions of people would still receive health care under a block grant, they would no longer have a legally enforceable right to such care. That right is the essence of health insurance, she said.
Regardless of whether Congress converts Medicaid to a block grant, it is likely to impose annual limits on Medicaid spending. Under one alternative, Medicaid would remain an entitlement, but if spending threatened to exceed the limit, states would have to raise taxes, reduce benefits, cut payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes, restrict eligibility or find other ways to control costs.
Mr. Vladeck, the Federal official who supervises Medicaid and Medicare, noted that Medicaid already pays hospitals and doctors much less than Medicare or private insurers pay.
As part of any legislation to revamp Medicaid, Congress may give states new freedom to reduce payments to health care providers. Under laws passed in 1980 and 1981, Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes must be "reasonable and adequate" to meet the costs of "efficiently and economically operated facilities." Scores of hospitals and nursing homes have forced states to increase their payments by suing them for violation of this standard, known as the Boren amendment, after former Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma.
That helps explain why the American Hospital Association has run newspaper advertisements predicting that cuts in Medicaid will not only harm Medicaid recipients, but also damage the overall health care system.
Mr. Willging said the proposed limits on Medicaid spending took no account of increases in the number of elderly people who would need long-term care. "The over-85 population is the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population," he said, "and one out of every four people in that age group lives in a nursing home."
While Medicare is financed entirely by the Federal Government, the cost of Medicaid is shared by Washington and the states. The Federal Government pays a larger share of Medicaid costs in states with low per capita income: 79 percent in Mississippi and 74 percent in Arkansas, for example. But it pays 50 percent in higher-income states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California.
A block grant would accentuate the large variations that already exist in Medicaid spending from state to state because, under most proposals, the Federal Government would distribute the money based on historical patterns.
Tabulations of Federal data by the Urban Institute show that for each low-income person, Federal Medicaid spending in 1993 averaged $2,400 in New York and $2,000 in Connecticut, but only $700 in Florida and Utah.
Mr. Holahan, the health economist at the Urban Institute, said the variations "reflect differences in the generosity of coverage and the level of benefits" set by states, as well as differences in their ability and willingness to pay for Medicaid.
"Such differences may be acceptable when they result from state decision-making," he said. "But it may be more difficult to justify them when they result from Congressional decisions."
Under the House and Senate budget plans, Medicaid and Medicare would continue to grow, but the cuts in projected spending are proportionally much larger for Medicaid. The House budget resolution, for example, would cut projected Medicaid spending by nearly 20 percent over seven years, as against a cut of 15 percent for Medicare. The Senate would cut projected Medicaid outlays by 18 percent, as against 14 percent for Medicare.
Negotiators from the House and the Senate are trying to work out their differences, but the magnitude of future cuts is clear. They will fall somewhere between those endorsed by the House and the Senate.
Gov. John Engler of Michigan said his fellow Republican governors wanted "a Medicaid block grant with no strings attached." Specifically, he said, they want to be freed of any requirement to match Federal spending with state money.
"Any financing mechanism that continues a Federal matching formula is not acceptable," Mr. Engler told Congress this week.
The governors say they can provide medical care for more people at lower cost through greater use of health maintenance organizations, which offer comprehensive care for a fixed monthly payment. Some also want to redesign the Medicaid benefit package. Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, chairman of the Medicaid task force of the Republican Governors Association, said, "The Federal Government has dictated benefits that are far more generous than those normally provided to working men and women through private insurance programs."
Lawmakers often overlook the links between Medicaid and Medicare. Proposals to increase premiums, deductibles and other costs for elderly Medicare beneficiaries would increase Medicaid costs because Medicaid pays such charges for Medicare recipients with incomes below the official poverty level of $9,655 for a couple.
"When I hear that Medicare premiums and deductibles are going up," Ms. Matula said, "I know that some of those costs will be passed on directly to state Medicaid programs."

HEADLINE: Has the F.C.C. Become Obsolete?;
Technology Moves Fast; Determining the Public Interest Takes Time

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
David Margolese is a bit player on the information highway, barely a footnote in the $700 billion communications industry. But his experience over the last five years provides a textbook example of why the Federal Communications Commission is under attack as never before.
Mr. Margolese, head of a tiny company called CD-Radio Inc., has gambled $15 million since 1990 to develop a satellite service that beams 30 channels of music to radios nationwide. He thinks it would a fill a big gap, reaching rural hamlets and lonely stretches of interstate highway that ordinary radio stations do not reach. 
 There is a problem, though: the F.C.C. will not let him do it. Traditional radio broadcasters have adamantly fought satellite radio, fearing it as a competitor. Agency officials are torn. Having repeatedly inched forward and back, the agency plans to inch forward again as early as Monday by proposing rules about what kind of service a satellite radio company will be allowed to provide.
Mr. Margolese is fuming. "All we want to do is give people a choice that they don't have now," he said. "That's all we want to do -- give consumers a chance to choose whether our idea is a better idea."
Anti-government fever is a given in Newt Gingrich's Washington, and agencies ranging from the Food and Drug Administration to the Commerce Department are under sustained attack. But bureaucrat for bureaucrat, few agencies wield as much influence over industry and consumers as the F.C.C. Created during the Depression, when AM radio was king and government regulation was considered essential by many people, the F.C.C. was chartered as the guardian of the public airwaves, charged with insuring that they were used wisely.
"Do you or do you not want a consumer protection function in this arena?" asked Reed E. Hundt, the commission's chairman. "If you don't, where else would literally tens of thousands of complaints go?"
Today, the agency has an immense impact on almost every communications medium. It has opened the airwaves to cellular phones and direct-broadcast satellites. It parcels out billions of dollars worth of broadcast licenses, defining the terms of competition for television, radio, satellites and phone service.
But the world into which it was born has gone the way of Norman Rockwell, and critics abound. Conservatives argue that the commission does more harm than good, hindering competition and delaying valuable new services. Consumer advocates say it is often a captive of the industries it regulates. Little mentioned in all this is that the F.C.C.'s most-criticized restrictions have been initiated at the behest of business groups.
Mr. Gingrich has said he would like to abolish it entirely. Republicans on the House Commerce Committee, vowingto cut back its authority, held a series of closed-door meetings with industry executives and agency officials last week to explore ideas intended to curb the agency's powers.
Examples of gridlock are abundant. Nearly three years ago, the F.C.C. moved to promote competition in cable television by adopting rules to let telephone companies offer a rival service called video dial tone. But telephone companies saw their applications to offer the service languish as agency officials insisted on changes in many plans. Today, only a handful of tiny experiments exist, and many telephone companies have decided to ask cities for traditional cable TV franchises.
If the agency and its video dial tone rules had never existed, economists say, telephone companies might have offered cable service two decades ago and perhaps have prevented cable television monopolies in local markets.
In the meantime, the F.C.C.'s efforts to regulate cable prices have been plagued by policy shifts and the complexity of its pricing rules. The first set of such rules, intended to carry out a law passed in 1992, inadvertently sent rates up rather than down for many customers.
A second effort early in 1994 pushed cable rates down 17 percent. But after incurring a storm of criticism from the industry and from conservatives in Congress, the agency has in recent months adopted still another series of rules that give breaks to small cable systems and to companies that add programming.
Today, some critics of the cable industry say the price regulations are more trouble than they are worth. "The system is a brain-dead patient on life support," said Barry Orton, a professor of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin and a consultant to many small towns that want to start regulating cable prices. "The smaller towns and cities that I work with say that they've had it. It's too complicated, and it's too full of holes."
But for all the complaints by businesses and their Congressional champions, it is business groups that typically have sought to have the agency umpire their disputes. Some of the most onerous and ridiculed F.C.C. rules are those resulting from intense industry lobbying.
For instance, Hollywood studios fought ferociously three years ago to keep television networks out of their business, until a Federal court overturned the F.C.C.'s rules. Local phone companies lobby fiercely to preserve universal service and to delay rules exposing them to new competition. Cable companies have filed more than 20,000 pages of briefs to block phone companies from providing TV programming.
But defenders of the commission, who argue that it is the crucial guardian of the public interest, note that it has consistently tried to promote market competition and move away from traditional regulation. And even the staunchest conservatives have praised one of the commission's initiatives -- the auctioning of thousands of new licenses for wireless telephone and data services, a revolutionary departure that raised more than $9 billion in the last year and is expected to increase competition sharply in the cellular telephone market.
"Everybody agrees that you want competition," said Mr. Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman, who was appointed by President Clinton. "But you have to have rules of fair competition if you want to have competitors to enter the market." He conceded that the agency had in the past been guilty of micromanagement, but passionately defended its charter to protect the public interest.
A schoolmate and soulmate of Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Hundt promotes a vision of linking all schools to advanced computer networks, and he has proposed rules to expand educational television programs for children. He also vigorously defends the commission's duty to protect consumers from overpricing and to open traditional monopolies in telephone and cable television.
Republican lawmakers agree on that point. They are seeking to pass a sweeping bill deregulating the telecommunications industry, in part by knocking down barriers that prevent cable television and phone companies from attacking each other's markets. The same bill asks the F.C.C. to start dozens of new proceedings, some to find ways of insuring affordable prices for rural areas and for the poor.
In addition to the flak it takes from Capitol Hill, the agency has its own civil strife. It never seemed more at war with itself than in its attempt to let telephone companies offer video dial tone services. The goal of the rules, adopted in 1992, was to break the monopolies enjoyed by most cable companies.
Yet the phone companies became bogged down, and F.C.C. officials complained that the companies were reserving too many channels for themselves and leaving too few for independent programmers. They argued about how the phone companies were allocating for construction costs and sought volumes of technical information.
"It makes no sense," said Peter W. Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "After 15 years of cable monopolies, almost anything would be an improvement. Even if the phone company keeps most of the channels for itself, you would at least have two competitors instead of only one."
F.C.C. officials say they are not entirely to blame for the delays, noting that many phone companies had voluntarily withdrawn applications, citing technological uncertainties.
"At a minimum, there has got to be dramatic reform," said Representative Jack Fields of Texas, chairman of the House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee.
Business interests may turn out to be the agency's white knight. With competition heating up among industries, cable, phone and even satellite companies will all be looking to the agency for help in attacking each other's market while defending their own turf. No industry group has echoed the calls by conservative researchers to abolish the F.C.C.
Some consumer advocates add that the agency has often provided crucial support for competition. Though it stalled MCI's effort to enter long-distance service in the 1970's, the F.C.C. later adopted a wide variety of rules that helped it compete with AT&T.
"What many critics fail to see are the tremendous benefits," said Gene Kimmelman, a lobbyist for Consumers Union. "It's unlikely that MCI and Sprint would have been able to make it without regulatory protections designed to move the long-distance industry from monopoly to competition."

Chart: "Technology Moves Fast; Determining the Public Interest Takes Times"
 Established by the Communications Act of 1934, the F.C.C. is an independent agency that regulates the United States' communications industry. New technologies have brought new duties:
 
TELEVISION: Its Mass Media Bureau issues broadcast licenses and enforces rules on obscene programming, commercials aimed at children and political ads.
 
RADIO: The same bureau grants licenses that specify each station's channel and operating power, to insure that broadcasts are received without interference.
 
WIRELESS: The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau regulates services like cellular telephones and paging systems. It conducts auctions of the electromagnetic spectrum, among other responsibilities.
 
TELEPHONE: The Common Carrier Bureau regulates the prices and the structure of interstate telephone business.
 
SATELLITE The International Bureau develops rules concerning rates, standards and development of satellite and Earth station facilities.
 
CABLE: The Cable Services Bureau carries out the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 by regulating cable companies' prices and business practice.

HEADLINE: Kodak's Crusade to Open Japan Market

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER

 BODY:
George M. C. Fisher, the chairman of the Eastman Kodak Company, is not the first American executive to argue that Japan tilts its competitive playing field. He may not even be the most vociferous. But he may be one of the most persistent. A decade after he challenged Japan's control of its market in pagers and cellular telephones while chairman of Motorola Inc., he is at it again.
Last year he won a product-dumping action against Fuji Photo Film that has all but driven Fuji's color print paper out of the United States market. More recently, he filed a complaint with American trade officials accusing the Japanese Government of conspiring with Fuji to protect 70 percent of the consumer photo film and paper market in Japan from competition. 
 As a result, Kodak asserts, Fuji has amassed a $10 billion war chest that it uses to subsidize efforts to bolster exports. It says this "profit sanctuary" gives Fuji an unfair advantage under international trading rules because it allows the company to undersell Kodak in other markets.
Kodak seeks an investigation by the United States trade representative's office under a section of the 1974 trade law that empowers the Government to investigate assertions of unfair practices, negotiate with other governments if trade barriers are uncovered and take retaliatory action if such talks fail. The trade office has until July 2 to decide whether to take Kodak's case.
Mr. Fisher's fight involves a far smaller slice of bilateral trade than the continuing fight between Japan and the United States over automobiles -- the profits involved are measured in hundreds of millions of dollars, rather than billions, annually. Negotiations in the automotive dispute are scheduled to resume today in Geneva.
Mr. Fisher's line of attack on the photo market is similar to the tactics he used at Motorola in the 1980's. For that issue, he first argued that Japanese companies were dumping pagers and cellular telephones at artificially low prices. Later he persuaded Japanese Government ministers to allocate radio frequencies so that Motorola's cellular telephone system could operate between Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan.
For Kodak, the market of the future, in both Japan and the United States, is digital imagery -- electronic photographs that can be stored on compact and floppy disks and manipulated and transmitted with a few keystrokes. As the company makes this historic change from its 100-year-old roots in chemical imaging, Mr. Fisher has formed alliances with companies like the Microsoft Corporation, Sun Microsystem Inc. and I.B.M.
But chemical film and other photographic products still pay the bills. Mr. Fisher said that because Kodak is held to less than 10 percent of the consumer-products market in Japan, compared with more than 40 percent in Europe, it is being deprived of resources that it needs to develop those future products.
Representatives of Fuji in the United States have denied that the parent company has engaged in restraint of trade. But they said it might be some time before they could present a detailed response. And Japanese trade officials note that Kodak dominates the United States market as completely as Fuji dominates Japan's.
According to statistics compiled in Japan, Kodak has a 10 percent share of the market there, while Fuji dominates with a 70 percent share. In the United States, the ratio reverses: Kodak holds a 71 percent share, while Fuji holds just 12 percent.
In a recent interview at the company's headquarters here, Mr. Fisher said he was "shocked" to find, after he became Kodak's chief executive in December 1993, that the company's market share in Japan, by its own estimates, was in the 6 to 7 percent range. It has 40 to 50 percent in other developed markets.
Mr. Fisher hired a law firm, Dewey Ballantine, to assemble a team of lawyers, economists and trade specialists to investigate Japan's consumer photo products market.
The result is a 250-page report that seeks to show that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry worked with Fuji and four photo products wholesalers to block imports in the early 1970's, when international pressure was forcing Japan to lower its formal tariffs.
Quoting records of Japanese trade associations and photo-industry trade publications, the report argues that the Japanese ministry developed a strategy of excluding Kodak that was later preserved by lax antitrust enforcement by the Japan Fair Trade Commission.
In general, the argument is that Fuji controlled major wholesalers who punished smaller wholesalers or retailers by withholding products from them if they stocked products by Kodak or other Fuji competitors.
"There is a fear that Kodak will control the Japanese market when the country undergoes 100 percent capital liberalization," the report quotes a publication titled Nihon Shashin Kogyo Tsushin, which Kodak officials described as a trade journal for small photo retailers. "MITI thus plans to prepare with the members of this industry a system which can counteract Kodak's global strategy." Capital liberalization is a term for the lowering of tariffs and investment barriers.
Another reference quotes a trade ministry official as saying there are "good managed prices and bad managed prices." Referring to Fuji and Konica, another Japanese maker of film, the official is quoted as saying "managed prices by the two film manufacturers are unavoidable."
Thomas Shay, vice president of communications for Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., said that the context in which the statements were made was not clear. He said Fuji officials in Japan were investigating the published citations in the report, some of which are more than 25 years old.
Ira Wolf, a former United States trade official who is now Kodak's director of Japan relations, said it was not remarkable that such statements could be found on public records. "They are closed to the outside, but they are quite open to each other," he said.
For all his pugnaciousness, Mr. Fisher said that imposing sanctions on Fuji products in this country would "represent a failure on all our parts." Nor is he pressing for numerical goals on trade, which have been a sticking point in the auto negotiations.
If the distribution system in Japan is opened up, Mr. Fisher said, he anticipated that Kodak's share would increase "significantly."

HEADLINE: Administration Balks At New Job Standards On Repetitive Strain

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from Congress and business groups, the Clinton Administration has decided not to issue regulations to protect workers from repetitive strain injuries, Government officials say.
Hundreds of thousands of American workers, from meat packers to computer programmers, are afflicted with repetitive strain injuries each year. The fast-growing problem worried Government officials as far back as 1990, when the Bush Administration told the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, known as OSHA, to begin to develop a so-called ergonomic standard to protect workers. 
 While the risk is greater in factories, repetitive strain injuries have become a big source of injuries in offices. As the nation shifts increasingly to a service economy, roughly 40 million people -- more than 40 percent of the work force -- operate at computer keyboards.
As part of their campaign to curb Federal regulations, the Republicans who took control of Congress in November took aim at the push by OSHA for ergonomic rules. Ergonomics is a discipline that tries to design jobs and tools to fit the physical and psychological limits of people.
Led by Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, the Congressional conservatives attacked the ergonomic initiative of OSHA as precisely the kind of Government regulation that should be stopped -- costly and time-consuming for business, based on good intentions, but mushy science.
Indeed, the science behind ergonomics does not supply neat cause-and-effect answers. Suggested risk factors extend beyond the job to include stress at home, exercise routines and vitamin deficiencies.
In their campaign to stop the ergonomic rules, the Republicans were backed by business groups like the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Association of Manufacturers, which formed a Coalition on Ergonomics to organize the opposition.
OSHA is an executive agency, so it can issue regulations without Congressional approval. Still, Congress can apply plenty of pressure. Mr. DeLay, for example, added $3.5 million -- the estimated cost of the OSHA ergonomics program -- to the agency's budget cuts.
But more important, it seems, is the Clinton Administration's reading of the anti-regulatory mood in Washington. Faced with elections next year, the Administration will not spend scarce political capital on the OSHA rules, especially if business groups are firmly opposed.
In a statement to be released today, Joseph A. Dear, the Assistant Secretary of Labor who heads OSHA, noted that 700,000 Americans suffered from work-related muscular-skeletal disorders and discussed the fate of the ergonomic standard proposed by the agency.
"In the face of Congressional intervention in OSHA standard setting," Mr. Dear said, "it is not now possible to publish a standard which has the breadth necessary to attack this problem."
Last week, Barbara Silverstein, the special assistant for the OSHA ergonomic program, left the agency. Ms. Silverstein, an ergonomics expert on leave from the Washington state Department of Labor, joined OSHA in November 1993 to work on the Federal standard.
"Because of the political pressure from Congress, OSHA cannot publish an ergonomic standard -- it's not going to happen," she said last week. "As long as that's the case, there's nothing for me to do here. It's very frustrating."
Ms. Silverstein said she was leaving for a vacation, after which she would return to work as a senior official in the Washington labor department and as an adjunct professor at the University of Washington.
A replacement for Ms. Silverstein will be named, said Cheryl Byrne, an OSHA spokeswoman, and the agency's ergonomics team will not be dismantled. The effort to issue ergonomic rules will continue despite the current setbacks, she said.
In recent months, OSHA has scaled back its ergonomic standards to try to make them acceptable to business. The latest proposal emphasizes education and prevention for companies more than punishment for offenders.
"In the end," said Neal Taslitz, executive director of the Repetitive Strain Injury Foundation, a nonprofit organization, "the OSHA proposal was mostly a program of required education to try to prevent this epidemic."

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article in Business Day on Monday about the Clinton Administration's decision not to issue regulations to protect workers from repetitive strain injury described the Administration's position incompletely in some editions. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said that its ergonomics team would not be dismantled, despite setbacks, which the article described. The agency also said its effort to issue ergonomic rules would continue despite the setbacks.

HEADLINE: A Year Later: The Simpson Case Has Permeated the Nation's Psyche

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 9

 BODY:
A year has now passed since Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were killed, an occasion to be marked on Monday by public candlelight vigils and more court testimony.
But with the first anniversary of the Simpson case comes a growing sense that the trial has become an exercise in futility, a dry run for a second run-through that could be just as inconclusive. To many lawyers and lay people alike, the proceedings in Judge Lance A. Ito's courtroom seem endless, exasperating and ultimately meaningless. 
 But if Mr. Simpson's trial cannot yield a verdict, the all-pervasive case and its myriad subplots have permeated the nation's consciousness as no other trial in recent times.
Some of the consequences are sobering. Judging from the vastly different views about Mr. Simpson's guilt among blacks and whites, many people have reluctantly concluded that the United States is really two nations divided by biases that warp perception.
"The divisions are so deep and so seemingly irreconcilable," said Robert Post, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "It's one thing to differ about policy questions. But facts are supposed to be things upon which we agree."
Equally sobering are the conclusions that many people have drawn about the legal system, which, Judge Ito himself has observed, is as much on trial here as Mr. Simpson is. While the case has taught Americans much about courts, it has also convinced many of them that the courts do not work.
"If the Simpson case is a trial of the American justice system, we have flunked the test in front of tens of millions of television viewers throughout the world," Arthur L. Liman, the New York lawyer, told graduates of Quinnipiac College Law School in Hamden, Conn., last month.
To many of those viewers, justice now seems too slow, too expensive and too tilted toward defendants, even if the defendant before them is charismatic and well heeled. The case seems clogged with undisciplined, long-winded lawyers playing to the television camera above the jury box. And presiding over everything, in the view of many, is a too tolerant judge too reluctant to assert control, then too arbitrary when he finally does.
The public's disillusionment has only grown as several dismissed jurors have emerged from sequestration to reveal that what many regard as the defense's far-fetched conspiracy theories have impressed them as much if not more than the prosecution's overwhelming scientific evidence, which most legal commentators believe would have convicted anyone but Mr. Simpson long ago. That, in turn, has led to warnings that the jury system must be changed and counter-warnings of the consequences if it is.
Others repercussions from the case are more positive. One is that extensive and graphic testimony about how Mr. Simpson beat his wife has made people more likely to report and acknowledge domestic violence.
According to the Cambridge Human Resources Group in Chicago, the Simpson case has so far cost American employers $27.5 billion in productivity lost around water coolers and Xerox machines. But its economic impact, while profound, has been uneven.
Sales of Ford Broncos -- white and otherwise -- are up; soap opera ratings have nose dived. The case has helped Jay Leno, who decided early on that jokes flowing from the murder of two people were not taboo, to close in on David Letterman, who shied away from such material.
The case has hurt the waitresses at Nate 'n Al's, the venerable Beverly Hills delicatessen; too many tippers are eating their lunches at home. Sales of quickie books on the case are up; authors of non-Simpson books have suffered as books by principals in the case and hangers-on have sucked up all the attention.
"How many authors have you seen on Larry King in the last year?" asked Michael Viner of Dove Books, publishers of Faye Resnick's best-selling recollections of the Simpsons and, soon, of the diary of a former Simpson juror, Michael Knox.
Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal speculated that the sorry spectacle of justice a la Simpson had led to a decline in law school applications. Meanwhile, those already enrolled are studying the case to learn either how the legal system really operates or how television, fame and money can mutate it beyond recognition.
The Simpson case may even have political implications, said William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization. For President Clinton, the trial has been a distraction from Whitewater and the Republican revival; not long ago, a poll showed that Judge Ito was more widely recognized than Newt Gingrich.
On the other hand, he said, anything that divides whites and blacks tears apart the Democratic Party's traditional coalition, and anything that sours Americans on government hurts those serving in it.
"The trial measurably increases the amount of cynicism in the electorate and that can't help incumbents," Mr. Schneider said. "And, of course, the big incumbent is Bill Clinton. I think there is a marginal impact, but elections in this country are won and lost on the margins."
The passing of 12 months is largely undetectable where Mrs. Simpson lived and died. In this city of superficial seasons, it is perpetually springtime at 875 South Bundy Drive, where endless rounds of tourists are treated to flowers perpetually in bloom. At the site of two murders, the annual cycle of life and death seems curiously suspended.
Legal scholars argue that the Simpson case is not representative of anything. They fear, nonetheless, that the public will view it as prototypical and, frustrated by the impasse in the offing, will demand changes, like dropping the requirement for unanimous verdicts, or changing the laws of evidence. They also worry that the public will view defense lawyers even more warily.
Even within the defense bar, there is a feeling that Mr. Simpson's lawyers, desperate to create confusion and doubt, are jeopardizing the rights of less fortunate criminal defendants everywhere. "What little credibility you might have as a defense lawyer has been eroded by the image of the lawyers in this case," said Barry Tarlow, a criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles. "The jury will believe that you have unlimited funds and manpower and that you are too slick by half."
Gerald Chaleff, a defense lawyer in Santa Monica, said: "I think we're going to look back on this case and say this was the beginning of the end of a lot of these rights we've had historically."
The first casualty of the case could be the courtroom camera. A number of commentators -- along with one of the prosecutors, Christopher A. Darden -- have stated the belief that television has both lengthened the trial and twisted the conduct of trial participants, including jurors. They fault Judge Ito for allowing it in the first place and predict he and other judges will ban it in the future. This week, in fact, two Los Angeles County supervisors will propose that cameras be barred from any second Simpson trial.
On the other hand, the appetite of television viewers for trial coverage has proved substantial. When such soap-opera staples as Procter & Gamble and Clorox shift some of their advertising dollars to Court TV, a cultural sea change is clearly under way. Millions who once watched "As the World Turns" or "Guiding Light" now tune in to the Simpson trial instead. Lynn Leahey, editor of Soap Opera Digest in New York, said those viewers may never come back.
"When you have a choice between a traditional soap opera and a really juicy real-life soap opera, people are going to tune into that," she said. For those who create soap operas from whole cloth, she said, the Simpson case "has been a major wake-up call."
In many law schools, the Simpson case has become a staple of the curriculum, a rich, real-life alternative to dry textbooks. "Not to use it would be educational malpractice," said Ron Carlson, who teaches criminal procedure at the University of Georgia Law School.
But the attention on campuses stems partly from how atypical the case is. Nancy J. King, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, said that in many respects, the Simpson case furnished a "warped vision of normal attorney conduct."
"Students don't understand that attorneys don't normally blab to the press," she said. "We just have to tell them that attorneys get through most trials without whining or calling each other names."
Janet Nudelman, a program specialist with the Family Violence Prevention Fund in San Francisco, said that the trial has greatly heightened public awareness of domestic violence.
But Judith Butler, who teaches a course on gender and race at the University of California at Berkeley, said that the heightened awareness of the problem has had a cost: perpetuating the stereotype of black men as abusers. Should Mr. Simpson walk, she said, women's groups will be bitterly upset; should he be convicted, black groups will be angry.
"I think the trial brings up the prospect for deep disillusionment for two disenfranchised groups," she said.

HEADLINE: Colombia Vows a Crackdown on Cartels

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, June 12

 BODY:
Buoyed by the capture of the principal leader of the Cali cocaine cartel, the Colombian Government plans an aggressive new campaign against drug trafficking organizations, senior Government officials here said.
"I don't want people to think we are on a holiday, that drug trafficking has ended" with the apprehension of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, President Ernesto Samper Pizano said in an interview over the weekend. The arrest of Mr. Rodriguez "is going to demoralize the other members of the cartel and facilitate their capture," Mr. Samper added. But he said the Government recognized that it needed to move aggressively to take advantage of that disarray. 
 From the American point of view, however, the capture of Mr. Rodriguez is "only the first step on a very long staircase," said the American Ambassador here, Myles R. R. Frechette. And the Clinton Administration has indicated that it still harbors doubts about Mr. Samper's seriousness and resolve. The Colombian Government has "broken through a psychological barrier," Mr. Frechette said, but the United States is still expecting other punishing blows against the cartel to follow.
As Washington sees it, and has bluntly told Mr. Samper, he is "tainted" by a tape recording in which leaders of the Cali cartel discussed a $3.75 million donation to his election campaign last year.
In addition to pressure from the Americans, Mr. Semper also seems to be responding to rising pressure domestically. In the past, many Colombian officials and citizens spoke of cocaine as a problem mainly for the United States.
But in the 10 months since Mr. Samper took office, Colombians have increasingly made it clear that they are disgusted with the violence, corruption and economic distortions associated with the dominant role of the drug cartels in national life here.
Colombian officials have pledged not to slacken their efforts. The next phase will focus on the activities of Mr. Rodriguez's brother Miguel, who has now inherited the command of the Cali cartel, and his chief lieutenants. This group of six or seven men is believed still to be in Cali, "cowering and hiding," as Mr. Frechette put it, and debating what they should do next.
"We have discovered that there are some differences among cartel members," Mr. Samper said. "Whereas some favor a hard line against the Government, others want to surrender," which automatically entitles them to more lenient treatment in the courts under Colombian law.
The jolt to the Cali cartel, which is believed responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine entering the United States, has created a vacuum that other trafficking groups will inevitably try to fill, Colombian officials acknowledge. "Many drug trafficking organizations are sprouting up on the Atlantic coast," Mr. Samper said Saturday, and for that reason, "next week we are planning operations in other cities."
The capture of Gilberto Rodriguez came after weeks of operations in Cali by a joint military and police task force of some 6,000 men that involved searches and roadblocks, raids on properties owned by cartel members and the seizure of their cellular telephones, computers and other high-tech equipment. Defense Minister Fernando Botero Zea said the same formula would be applied in the effort to arrest the remaining leaders of the Cali cartel, or at least to force their surrender.
The Government's strategy, Mr. Botero said, has been to "go after the four legs of the table in order to topple the table." That means, he said, that the financial, security, communications and administrative apparatus of the cartel had to be weakened before an effort could be made to go after the leaders, who would otherwise be simply "too powerful and too strong."
At the same time, the Colombian Government has, with American help, eradicated more than 25,000 acres of coca, marijuana and poppy fields since Mr. Samper took office. This represents about 15 percent of the total acreage planted in drugs, according to United States and Colombian officials.
In addition, the Colombian Air Force, which has been hesitant to act in the past, recently destroyed several large cartel-owned TC-47 transport planes and put its own personnel in charge of the control tower at the airport on San Andres Island, a Caribbean outpost that one American official in Washington had said was "a floating trafficker refueling point."
Mr. Botero said he was confident that "by the end of the year the Cali cartel will be effectively nonfunctioning and nonexistent." But to achieve that goal, Mr. Frechette said, Colombia needs to do "more of everything."
Mr. Botero described the broader effort to prevent drug trafficking as a "tender shoots strategy" that is intended to prevent any nascent trafficking group from putting down roots that would allow it to become as powerful as the Medellin or Cali cartels. But Colombian and foreign officials alike warned against expecting a quick collapse of cocaine and heroin trafficking apparatus here.
"Even if you get all these guys" at the top of the Cali cartel, Mr. Frechette said, "there are ambitious lieutenants just waiting to fill their spots."
Mr. Botero said the intensified pressure on the Cali cartel had led to a cash flow squeeze that had forced the group to start selling luxurious homes, farmland and cars "at bargain basement prices." In addition, said a foreign official here, "the price of coca paste is down in Cali because of pressure back in the countryside," where raw coca is processed.
Colombian officials said they hoped to increase the financial strain on the Cali cartel through a new law to curb money laundering and corruption that Mr. Samper signed early this month.
Helped by records seized in the raids in Cali on the mansions of leaders of the drug organizations, the Colombian Government has already publicly identified some of the front companies the Cali cartel leaders have used to launder their drug profits, estimated at as much as $8 billion. But a foreign economic analyst here said much remained to be done, noting that a chain of drug stores controlled by the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers "is not hurting."
The effort is likely to be aided by the extensive records seized Friday in the house where Mr. Rodriguez was captured, hiding in a closet. Officials said the documents included records of bribes paid to politicians and police officers, who can be dismissed automatically on suspicion of corruption under another new law, as well as information on Mr. Rodriguez's investments and bank accounts here and abroad.
Mr. Botero said that the turning point in the hunt for Gilberto Rodriguez was a telephone tip received on June 5 that he would move into a particular house in Cali before the end of the week. That alert, he said, came as a result of a television and radio advertising campaign offering $1.8 million for information leading to the capture of cartel leaders.
Mr. Samper said Colombian officials hoped to "obtain the help of Gilberto Rodriguez to initiate the process of dismantling the cartel." But thus far, Mr. Rodriguez has refused to cooperate, Colombia's chief prosecutor, Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento, said in an interview Sunday.
Mr. Valdivieso said that sentencing procedures in Colombia allow only limited opportunities for plea bargaining if Mr. Rodriguez cooperates. He said that Mr. Rodriguez will be charged with aggravated drug trafficking, conspiracy and perhaps illegal enrichment, but that he faces a maximum term of only 24 years, with time off for good behavior.

HEADLINE: Chief of Washington Police Resigns Amid Budget Turmoil

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The District of Columbia, engulfed in a severe financial crisis, suffered another setback today as Police Chief Fred Thomas announced that he was resigning after two and a half years for family and other personal reasons.
Chief Thomas, 51, who was appointed by the city's former Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, declined to elaborate on his reasons for leaving. But in explaining that he looked forward to his annual pension benefits of more than $50,000 and the chance to seek other opportunities in law enforcement, he made it clear that money was at least part of the reason. 
 As Chief of a department in which officers have lost as much as 18 percent of their annual pay this year because of the city's budget problems, Chief Thomas saw his annual salary reduced to $86,100 from $90,605 after he took a cut for the final six months of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. He was facing an additional 2 percent cut next year.
President Clinton recently appointed a five-member financial control board to take charge of city finances until the budget has been balanced for at least four years. The city faces a projected budget deficit of $700 million for the current fiscal year.
"The chiefs of most major departments far exceed $100,000," Mr. Thomas said after he appeared at a news conference with Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr..
Mr. Thomas was partly right, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which surveys annual salaries of police chiefs every three years. For 1993, its latest poll, police chiefs in at least 17 cities, including Los Angeles ($168,000), New York ($109,000) and smaller cities like Paterson, N.J. ($100,000), made $100,000 a year or more.
Mr. Thomas's resignation, which takes effect next month, comes as crime rates in the District have begun rising after an overall decline for more than a year. Some police officers and lawyers in the United States Attorney's office in Washington have blamed part of the rise on the city's budget problems, which have led to 669 officers' leaving the department in the 18 months through last April, with only 312 replacements being hired.
While Mr. Thomas disputed the notion that the exodus had adversely affected the department, which he repeatedly called the best in the country, he acknowledged that cutbacks in salaries, overtime and other benefits had left many officers demoralized.
"This is a sound department," he said. "But it needs help. It needs money to operate. Officers here are the best in the nation, but they're not paid like the best in the nation."
Chief Thomas served on the police force for 20 years through 1985, when he retired as Deputy Police Chief. For the next seven years, he was executive vice president for the Metropolitan Police Boys' and Girls' Club.
In remarks praising Mr. Thomas, Mr. Barry stressed that the chief's resignation was voluntary and was not induced by pressure from him or anyone else in his administration, noting that he and Mr. Thomas "had no philosophical differences." Both heartily concurred with the need to restructure the police force with a new emphasis on community policing.
The Mayor's appreciation was voiced in a letter accepting the resignation and thanking the chief for "outstanding contributions in areas of public safety." The Mayor himself distributed copies of the letter, which was undated, to reporters as the news conference ended.
Eric Holder, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, said he was "extremely saddened" by Mr. Thomas's resignation, pointing to the strong relationships Mr. Thomas helped develop between his officers and Federal law-enforcement agencies. In large measure, Mr. Holder said, that cooperation "previously had not existed."
Officers serving under Mr. Thomas were more likely to have a mixed reaction. J.C. Stamps, the chief labor negotiator for the police union, said those officers frustrated by the cutbacks would not necessarily be sorry to see Mr. Thomas leave. Others, he said, understood that he was making the best of a difficult situation.
Mr. Barry said that in finding a successor, he would first consider candidates from the police force, then from the region and finally from elsewhere. "Nationally," he said, "is the last place we'll look."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From the Decision on Justifying Affirmative Action Programs

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court decision today in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, holding that affirmative action programs must be subject to the most searching constitutional scrutiny. The vote was 5 to 4. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the majority opinion, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined. Justices Scalia and Thomas wrote concurring opinions as well. Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. All except Justice Breyer filed dissenting opinions.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Justice O'Connor
 Petitioner Adarand Constructors Inc. claims that the Federal Government's practice of giving general contractors on Government projects a financial incentive to hire subcontractors controlled by "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals," and in particular, the Government's use of race-based presumptions in identifying such individuals, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected Adarand's claim. We conclude, however, that courts should analyze cases of this kind under a different standard of review than the one the Court of Appeals applied. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand the case for further proceedings. . . . 
 The contract giving rise to the dispute in this case came about as a result of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, a D.O.T. appropriations measure. Section 106(c)(1) of Sturaa provides that "not less than 10 percent" of the appropriated funds "shall be expended with small-business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals." STURAA adopts the Small Business Act's definition of "socially and economically disadvantaged individual," including the applicable race-based presumptions, and adds that "women shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this subsection." STURAA also requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish "minimum uniform criteria for state governments to use in certifying whether a concern qualifies for purposes of this subsection." The Secretary has done so in 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D (1994). Those regulations say that the certifying authority should presume both social and economic disadvantage (i.e., eligibility to participate) if the applicant belongs to certain racial groups, or is a woman. . . .
Adarand's claim arises under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that "No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law." Although this Court has always understood that clause to provide some measure of protection against arbitrary treatment by the Federal Government, it is not as explicit a guarantee of equal treatment as the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that "No state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws" (emphasis added). Our cases have accorded varying degrees of significance to the difference in the language of those two clauses. We think it necessary to revisit the issue here. . . .
The Court's failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke v. Regents of the University of California 1978, Fullilove v. Klutznick 1980, and Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education 1986 left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action. . . .
The Court resolved the issue, at least in part, in 1989. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co. concerned a city's determination that 30 percent of its contracting work should go to minority-owned businesses. A majority of the Court in Croson held that "the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification" and that the single standard of review for racial classifications should be "strict scrutiny." . . .
With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action by state and local governments. But Croson of course had no occasion to declare what standard of review the Fifth Amendment requires for such action taken by the Federal Government. Croson observed simply that the Court's "treatment of an exercise of Congressional power in Fullilove cannot be dispositive here," because Croson's facts did not implicate Congress's broad power under s5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .
Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the Court's cases through Croson had established three general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications. First, skepticism: ' "[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,' " Wygant, (plurality opinion of Powell, J.); Fullilove, (opinion of Burger, C. J.) . . .
Second, consistency: "the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification," Croson, (plurality opinion); i.e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized. And third, congruence: "[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment." Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny. . . .
A year later, however, the Court took a surprising turn. Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. F.C.C. involved a Fifth Amendment challenge to two race-based policies of the Federal Communications Commission. In Metro Broadcasting, the Court repudiated the long-held notion that "it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government" than it does on a state to afford equal protection of the laws. It did so by holding that "benign" Federal racial classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny, even though Croson had recently concluded that such classifications enacted by a state must satisfy strict scrutiny. "[B]enign" Federal racial classifications, the Court said, "even if those measures are not 'remedial' in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination, are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives." . . .
By adopting intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for Congressionally mandated "benign" racial classifications, Metro Broadcasting departed from prior cases in two significant respects. First, it turned its back on Croson's explanation of why strict scrutiny of all governmental racial classifications is essential:
"Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are 'benign' or 'remedial' and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to 'smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means chosen 'fit' this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype." (plurality opinion of O'CONNOR, J.).
We adhere to that view today, despite the surface appeal of holding "benign" racial classifications to a lower standard, because "it may not always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign." Bakke, (opinion of Powell, J.). "[M]ore than good motives should be required when government seeks to allocate its resources by way of an explicit racial classification system." Days, Fullilove, 96 Yale L. J. 453, 485 (1987).
Second, Metro Broadcasting squarely rejected one of the three propositions established by the Court's earlier equal protection cases, namely, congruence between the standards applicable to Federal and state racial classifications, and in so doing also undermined the other two -- skepticism of all racial classifications, and consistency of treatment irrespective of the race of the burdened or benefited group. Under Metro Broadcasting, certain racial classifications ("benign" ones enacted by the Federal Government) should be treated less skeptically than others; and the race of the benefited group is critical to the determination of which standard of review to apply. Metro Broadcasting was thus a significant departure from much of what had come before it.
The three propositions undermined by Metro Broadcasting all derive from the basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution protect persons, not groups. It follows from that principle that all governmental action based on race a group classification long recognized as "in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited" should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to insure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. These ideas have long been central to this Court's understanding of equal protection, and holding "benign" state and Federal racial classifications to different standards does not square with them. "[A] free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality" should tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons. Accordingly, we hold today that all racial classifications, imposed by whatever Federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. In other words, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests. To the extent that Metro Broadcasting is inconsistent with that holding, it is overruled. . . .
By requiring strict scrutiny of racial classifications, we require courts to make sure that a governmental classification based on race, which "so seldom provide[s] a relevant basis for disparate treatment" Fullilove (STEVENS, J., dissenting), is legitimate, before permitting unequal treatment based on race to proceed. . . .
The principle of consistency simply means that whenever the Government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. It says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny. The principle of consistency explains the circumstances in which the injury requiring strict scrutiny occurs. The application of strict scrutiny, in turn, determines whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the infliction of that injury.
Consistency does recognize that any individual suffers an injury when he or she is disadvantaged by the Government because of his or her race, whatever that race may be.
JUSTICE STEVENS also claims that we have ignored any difference between Federal and state legislatures. But requiring that Congress, like the states, enact racial classifications only when doing so is necessary to further a "compelling interest" does not contravene any principle of appropriate respect for a co-equal branch of the Government. It is true that various members of this Court have taken different views of the authority s5 of the Fourteenth Amendment confers upon Congress to deal with the problem of racial discrimination, and the extent to which courts should defer to Congress's exercise of that authority. We need not, and do not, address these differences today. . . .
We think that requiring strict scrutiny is the best way to ensure that courts will consistently give racial classifications that kind of detailed examination, both as to ends and as to means. . . .
Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." Fullilove (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. . . .
When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the "narrow tailoring" test this Court has set out in previous cases.
Because our decision today alters the playing field in some important respects, we think it best to remand the case to the lower courts for further consideration in light of the principles we have announced. . . .
The question whether any of the ways in which the Government uses subcontractor compensation clauses can survive strict scrutiny, and any relevance distinctions such as these may have to that question, should be addressed in the first instance by the lower courts.
 
BY JUSTICE SCALIA,
Concurring
 I join the opinion of the Court, except Part III-C, and except insofar as it may be inconsistent with the following: In my view, government can never have a "compelling interest" in discriminating on the basis of race in order to "make up" for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction. Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be made whole, but under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or a debtor race. . . . To pursue the concept of racial entitlement even for the most admirable and benign of purposes is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American.
 
BY JUSTICE THOMAS,
Concurring
 I agree with the majority's conclusion that strict scrutiny applies to all government classifications based on race. I write separately, however, to express my disagreement with the premise underlying JUSTICE STEVENS's and JUSTICE GINSBURG's dissents: that there is a racial paternalism exception to the principle of equal protection. I believe that there is a "moral [and] constitutional equivalence" between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect and protect us as equal before the law.
That these programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the Government may not make distinctions on the basis of race. As far as the Constitution is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government's racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged. There can be no doubt that the paternalism that appears to lie at the heart of this program is at war with the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution. . . .
So-called "benign" discrimination teaches many that because of chronic and apparently immutable handicaps, minorities cannot compete with them without their patronizing indulgence. Inevitably, such programs engender attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provoke resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the Government's use of race. These programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are "entitled" to preferences.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Stevens,
With whom Justice Ginsburg joins
 Instead of deciding this case in accordance with controlling precedent, the Court today delivers a disconcerting lecture about the evils of governmental racial classifications. For its text the Court has selected three propositions, represented by the bywords "skepticism," "consistency" and "congruence." . . .
The Court's concept of skepticism is, at least in principle, a good statement of law and of common sense. Undoubtedly, a court should be wary of a governmental decision that relies upon a racial classification. "Because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic," a reviewing court must satisfy itself that the reasons for any such classification are "clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate." Fullilove v. Klutznick (1980). This principle is explicit in Chief Justice Burger's opinion, in Justice Powell's concurrence and in my dissent in Fullilove. I welcome its renewed endorsement by the Court today. But, as the opinions in Fullilove demonstrate, substantial agreement on the standard to be applied in deciding difficult cases does not necessarily lead to agreement on how those cases actually should or will be resolved. In my judgment, because uniform standards are often anything but uniform, we should evaluate the Court's comments on "consistency," "congruence" and stare decisis with the same type of skepticism that the Court advocates for the underlying issue.
The Court's concept of "consistency" assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the majority to impose a special burden on the members of a minority race and a decision by the majority to provide a benefit to certain members of that minority notwithstanding its incidental burden on some members of the majority. In my opinion that assumption is untenable. There is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination. Invidious discrimination is an engine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance or maintain the power of the majority. Remedial race-based preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a desire to foster equality in society. No sensible conception of the Government's constitutional obligation to "govern impartially" should ignore this distinction. To illustrate the point, consider our cases addressing the Federal Government's discrimination against Japanese-Americans during World War II, Hirabayashi v. United States and Korematsu v. United States. The discrimination at issue in those cases was invidious because the Government imposed special burdens, a curfew and exclusion from certain areas on the West Coast, on the members of a minority class defined by racial and ethnic characteristics. Members of the same racially defined class exhibited exceptional heroism in the service of our country during that war. Now suppose Congress decided to reward that service with a Federal program that gave all Japanese-American veterans an extraordinary preference in Government employment. If Congress had done so, the same racial characteristics that motivated the discriminatory burdens in Hirabayashi and Korematsu would have defined the preferred class of veterans. Nevertheless, "consistency" surely would not require us to describe the incidental burden on everyone else in the country as "odious" or "invidious" as those terms were used in those cases. We should reject a concept of "consistency" that would view the special preferences that the National Government has provided to Native Americans since 1834 as comparable to the official discrimination against African-Americans that was prevalent for much of our history.
The consistency that the Court espouses would disregard the difference between a "No Trespassing" sign and a welcome mat. . . . It would equate a law that made black citizens ineligible for military service with a program aimed at recruiting black soldiers. An attempt by the majority to exclude members of a minority race from a regulated market is fundamentally different from a subsidy that enables a relatively small group of newcomers to enter that market. An interest in "consistency" does not justify treating differences as though they were similarities.
The Court's explanation for treating dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable is a supposed inability to differentiate between "invidious" and "benign" discrimination. But the term "affirmative action" is common and well understood. Its presence in everyday parlance shows that people understand the difference between good intentions and bad. As with any legal concept, some cases may be difficult to classify, (footnote 4) but our equal protection jurisprudence has identified a critical difference between state action that imposes burdens on a disfavored few and state action that benefits the few "in spite of" its adverse effects on the many. . . .
As a matter of constitutional and democratic principle, a decision by representatives of the majority to discriminate against the members of a minority race is fundamentally different from those same representatives' decision to impose incidental costs on the majority of their constituents in order to provide a benefit to a disadvantaged minority. In his concurrence, JUSTICE THOMAS argues that the most significant cost associated with an affirmative action program is its adverse stigmatic effect on its intended beneficiaries. Although I agree that this cost may be more significant than many people realize, I do not think it applies to the facts of this case. First, this is not an argument that petitioner Adarand, a white-owned business, has standing to advance. No beneficiaries of the specific program under attack today have challenged its constitutionality, perhaps because they do not find the preferences stigmatizing, or perhaps because their ability to opt out of the program provides them all the relief they would need. Second, even if the petitioner in this case were a minority-owned business challenging the stigmatizing effect of this program, I would not find JUSTICE THOMAS's extreme proposition that there is a moral and constitutional equivalence between an attempt to subjugate and an attempt to redress the effects of a caste system at all persuasive. It is one thing to question the wisdom of affirmative action programs: there are many responsible arguments against them, including the one based upon stigma, that Congress might find persuasive when it decides whether to enact or retain race-based preferences. It is another thing altogether to equate the many well-meaning and intelligent lawmakers and their constituents, whether members of majority or minority races, who have supported affirmative action over the years to segregationists and bigots.
 
BY JUSTICE GINSBURG,
Dissenting
 The divisions in this difficult case should not obscure the Court's recognition of the persistence of racial inequality and a majority's acknowledgment of Congress's authority to act affirmatively, not only to end discrimination, but also to counteract discrimination's lingering effects. Those effects, reflective of a system of racial caste only recently ended, are evident in our work places, markets and neighborhoods. Job applicants with identical resumes, qualifications and interview styles still experience different receptions, depending on their race. White and African-American consumers still encounter different deals. People of color looking for housing still face discriminatory treatment by landlords, real estate agents and mortgage lenders. Minority entrepreneurs sometimes fail to gain contracts though they are the low bidders, and they are sometimes refused work even after winning contracts. Bias both conscious and unconscious, reflecting traditional and unexamined habits of thought, keeps up barriers that must come down if equal opportunity and nondiscrimination are ever genuinely to become this country's law and practice. Given this history and its practical consequences, Congress surely can conclude that a carefully designed affirmative action program may help to realize, finally, the "equal protection of the laws" the Fourteenth Amendment has promised since 1868.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION;
JUSTICES, 5 TO 4, CAST DOUBTS ON U.S. PROGRAMS THAT GIVE PREFERENCES BASED ON RACE

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
In a decision likely to fuel rather than resolve the debate over affirmative action, the Supreme Court today cast doubt on the constitutionality of Federal programs that award benefits on the basis of race.
Federal programs that classify people by race, even for an ostensibly benign purpose such as expanding opportunities for members of minorities, are presumably unconstitutional, the Court said in a 5-to-4 opinion. Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said such programs must be subject to the most searching judicial inquiry and can survive only if they are "narrowly tailored" to accomplish a "compelling governmental interest." 
 This formidable standard is one that the Court has applied to state affirmative action programs since 1989, when it invalidated a public works program in Richmond in which 30 percent of all contracts had to be set aside for companies owned by members of minorities. The decision today marked an important doctrinal shift for the Court, which until now had given the Federal Government significantly more leeway for its affirmative action efforts. The constitutional guarantee of equal protection should mean the same at all levels of government, Justice O'Connor said.
While the standard the Court adopted today has historically been very difficult to meet, the Court stopped short of declaring unconstitutional either the particular Federal construction program before it today or Federal affirmative action in general.
The Court's ruling was greeted with enthusiasm by some conservatives, who saw it as the beginning of the end of the era of affirmative action. Supporters of affirmative action, however, while acknowledging the decision as a setback, declined to see it as a disaster. [Article, page D25.]
Justice O'Connor's opinion included an important qualification, leaving the door open to the defense of such programs in future cases. "We wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is 'strict in theory, but fatal in fact,' " Justice O'Connor said, quoting from an opinion of the late Justice Thurgood Marshall. She continued: "The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minorities in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it."
Two members of the majority, Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, would have gone considerably further and ruled that affirmative action can never be justified. "Under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or a debtor race," Justice Scalia said.
Justice Thomas said: "In my mind, government-sponsored racial discrimination based on benign prejudice is just as noxious as discrimination inspired by malicious prejudice. In each instance, it is racial discrimination, plain and simple."
In declining to adopt those categorical views, the majority opinion, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also joined, left numerous issues to be resolved in future cases. These include the fate of the preference program at issue today, which provides a financial bonus to contractors on Federal highway programs who subcontract part of the work to businesses owned by "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals." The presumption under the law is that blacks and members of other minorities meet that definition, although the presumption may be rebutted in individual cases and white contractors may seek to qualify as "disadvantaged."
The case today was brought by a white contractor who lost a job to a Hispanic-owned company that had submitted a higher bid for a subcontract to build guardrails on a Federal highway in Colorado. Both the Federal District Court in Denver and the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, also in Denver, evaluated the program under the relaxed standard the Supreme Court had applied in earlier decisions and upheld it. The lower courts must now re-evaluate the program under the exacting standard the Court set today.
The decision today overturned the most recent of the Supreme Court's Federal affirmative action precedents, a 1990 decision called Metro Broadcasting v. F.C.C. that had upheld a Federal affirmative action program designed to increase the number of broadcast licenses awarded to members of minorities. Today's ruling also cast grave doubt on the continued validity of a 1980 decision, Fullilove v. Klutznick, that had sustained a Federal public works program that set aside 10 pecent of the value of contracts for businesses owned by blacks and other minorities.
Despite the qualifications and unanswered questions in the majority opinion, Justice O'Connor's tone was forceful. The two-tiered approach that subjected Federal affirmative action programs to more relaxed judicial review than those of the states was inconsistent with the "basic principle" that the Constitution's guarantees of equal protection "protect persons, not groups," Justice O'Connor said.
"All governmental action based on race," no matter by what level of government or for what purpose, must be subject to the most searching judicial scrutiny, she said, adding: "Whenever the government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection."
The decision, Adarand Constructors v. Pena, No. 93-1841, is certain to encourage legal challenges to a range of Federal affirmative action programs. At the same time, the issue is being vigorously debated in Congress and in the White House, with the Clinton Administration now in the midst of a sweeping review of Federal racial preference programs. By refusing to foreclose affirmative action as a constitutional option, the Court has done little to relieve President Clinton, as well as other elected officials now confronting the issue, of the need to make and defend their own policy choices.
Affirmative action is also the subject of vigorous debate in the states. Last month, Gov. Pete Wilson of California ordered an end to all state affirmative action programs not required by law or by a court decree. Next year, Californians will vote on a ballot initiative to end affirmative action in state hiring and higher education.
Justice O'Connor's opinion did not precisely define the essential terms, "narrowly tailored" and "compelling interest," by which courts are to judge whether a challenged affirmative action survives the required "strict scrutiny." The opinion referred only to definitions that "this Court has set out in previous cases."
The terms are familiar in the jargon-filled discourse of equal protection, however. In earlier cases, the Court has insisted on evidence rather than generalized assertions about the history of racial discrimination to be overcome. The Court has also asked whether equivalently helpful results could have been achieved through alternative programs that did not classify people by race, and has sought evidence that the program will not last indefinitely.
There were three dissenting opinions today, filed by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who also dissented, joined Justices Souter's and Ginsburg's opinions.
The position of Justice Stevens was perhaps the most interesting on the Court, because he was a dissenter from the 1980 decision that upheld the Federal public works set-aside program. Justice O'Connor, who was not on the Court in 1980, quoted at length in her majority opinion today from Justice Stevens's dissent, in which he said that the racial classifications the Court upheld in the Fullilove case "can only exacerbate rather than reduce racial prejudice" and "will delay the time when race will become a truly irrelevant, or at least insignificant, factor."
It is a measure of the Court's shift to the right in the intervening 15 years, and of the 75-year-old Justice's consequent journey from the Court's center to its liberal wing, that found Justice Stevens in dissent today, calling for adherence to precedent. If the rigidly race-conscious program the Court upheld in 1980 was constitutional, he said, "it must follow as night follows the day" that the more flexible program at issue today was constitutional as well.
Justice Stevens also voted with the majority in the 1989 decision, City of Richmond v. Croson, that held that state and local affirmative action programs must be subject to strict judicial scrutiny. Today, he said there were important reasons for Federal programs to receive more deference from the Court. "Federal affirmative-action programs represent the will of our entire Nation's elected representatives," he said, "whereas a state or local program may have an impact on nonresident entities who played no part in the decision to enact it."
Justice Stevens said that the majority today had overlooked the difference between invidious discrimination and efforts to "foster equality in society" through race-based preferences. "There is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination," he said.
Justice Stevens said the Court's search for "consistency" on racial classifications "would treat a Dixiecrat Senator's decision to vote against Thurgood Marshall's confirmation in order to keep African Americans off the Supreme Court on a par with President Johnson's evaluation of his nominee's race as a positive factor."
Justice Souter, in his dissenting opinion, suggested that at the end of the day, Federal affirmative action programs might be upheld even under the majority's analysis. "Of course there will be some interpretive forks in the road before the significance of strict scrutiny for congressional remedial statutes becomes entirely clear," he said.

HEADLINE: Administration Moves to Blame Fed Rate Rises For Slowdown

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Faced with a significant slowing of the economy as the season of Presidential politics heats up, Administration officials say the White House is gradually zeroing in on a well-known culprit: the Federal Reserve and its interest rate increases over the last 16 months.
The evolution of the Administration's stance -- which comes despite the strong objections of the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin -- began earlier this month, officials said today. It was given voice on Sunday by the White House chief of staff, Leon Panetta, who said the Administration would welcome a move by the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates. 
 Traditionally, the quasi-independent Federal Reserve has not taken kindly to pressure from any White House to act on interest rates. And, with rare exceptions, it has not taken such pressure very seriously, either. But if the central bank does not lower rates soon, what the White House hopes to do is deflect blame should the economy slip into a recession this year or next, as a few economists now predict.
The Administration also hopes to influence Federal Reserve policy indirectly, through business leaders and others who agree with its desire for lower short-term interest rates. "Although the Administration can't influence the Fed directly," a senior Administration official said, "it can change the climate of opinion by pointing out what many economists and business leaders already know, and thereby legitimize those voices or give greater weight to those voices."
Mr. Rubin insisted in an interview today that the Administration still had a policy of refraining from comments on the central bank. But that policy is clearly fraying, as some Administration officials have begun to comment more negatively about the Federal Reserve and as the tone of internal meetings moves toward more recriminations aimed at the central bank.
The goal of the finger-pointing is only partly to persuade the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, Administration officials said. The purpose is also to sway working-class voters by convincing them that the White House is not to blame for their problems.
Indeed, until recent evidence mounted that the slowdown earlier this year might turn into something much worse, the Administration welcomed the Federal Reserve efforts to prevent the economy from overheating as offering the best chance to extend the expansion through next year's election.
But today, said the Administration official, who insisted on anonymity, the White House is especially concerned that "any economic slowdown is going to hit with particular force the working-class swing voters in the close-in suburbs." These are the auto workers and other Democrats who abandoned the Democratic Party to vote for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and for George Bush in 1988, but returned to the party in 1992 to elect Bill Clinton.
The shift in Administration sentiment began during interagency discussions on June 2, the day the Labor Department announced that the American economy had shed 101,000 jobs in May. The news shocked Administration officials not just as a sign of a steepening economic downturn but also as a potential political disaster, since President Clinton has presented the creation of jobs as one of the biggest successes of his Presidency.
Indeed, when the May unemployment figures were released, the Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, gave several interviews in which he pointed to interest rates as a problem. "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see there is a relationship between interest rates and where jobs were lost," Mr. Reich said. Asked whether he was referring to short-term rates, he said he was.
The new willingness to criticize the Fed represents at least a crack in the facade of an Administration that, until now, has been remarkably unified in its approach to economic policy. Mr. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Wall Street investment house, has long felt that Administration efforts to influence the Federal Reserve are doomed to fail, and may even provoke the Fed to raise rates to prove its independence. Moreover, Administration comments carry the risk of alarming financial markets, where long-term interest rates may rise if investors conclude that the Administration and the Fed are at odds over monetary policy, adding to uncertainty about the outlook for inflation.
The re-election prospects of Presidents are closely linked to the economy's health. And efforts by past Presidents to blame the Fed for economic troubles have rarely convinced many voters, as President Bush found when he tried this strategy unsuccessfully in 1992.
Mr. Rubin denied in a telephone interview today that the Administration had changed tack. "We do not comment with respect to the Federal Reserve Board, and we believe strongly that any comments with respect to the Federal Reserve Board may be counterproductive," he said. "The independence of the Federal Reserve is very important to the credibility of our markets and how those markets are viewed around the world."
George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to President Clinton, said in an interview this evening that "we have no strategy to pressure the Fed."
But several other senior Administration officials have recently commented anyway on the Federal Reserve and the short-term interest rates that it controls. When asked on Sunday whether the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to forestall a recession, Mr. Panetta responded, "Well, it would be nice to get whatever kind of cooperation we can get to get this economy going."
The comment was particularly noticeable because Mr. Panetta is a former member of the House of Representatives, and House Democrats have led complaints that the Clinton Administration is not doing enough to challenge the Federal Reserve's policies.
The pressure for a more confrontational role toward the Federal Reserve has come primarily from political operatives at the White House. Mr. Rubin was able to enforce a ban on Administration comments about the Federal Reserve when he was the chairman of the White House's National Economic Council.
Mr. Rubin's replacement at the council, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, is perceived by some colleagues as more willing to permit criticism of the Federal Reserve. But Ms. Tyson denied in an interview this afternoon that she was prepared to make or authorize any criticism of the Federal Reserve.
Still, starting with the release of the poor job figures earlier this month, the first signs of mild criticism have emerged. From inside the White House, the President's Council of Economic Advisers issued a statement attributing the slowdown in part to "the rise in interest rates in 1994, which affected the interest-sensitive sectors such as durable goods and housing."

Airbus Gets $1.2 Billion in Aircraft Orders

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 12

 BODY:
Airbus Industrie, operating in what its managing director called "a fiercer, cutthroat competitive environment" with the Boeing Company, announced aircraft orders at the Paris Air Show today, one day after the American company had made its own announcement.
Airbus, the European consortium, announced an order confirmation and the exercise of an option that together call for the delivery of 30 A-319's valued at $1.17 billion. Boeing announced orders of $550 million on Sunday. 
 The battle between Boeing and Airbus is growing ever more heated. Boeing, the world's largest airplane maker, already holds 60 percent of the global market to Airbus's 30 percent. But Airbus vows it will win half of the new orders placed by 2000.
Airbus said it had won orders for 20 A-319's from Lufthansa of Germany and for 10 A-319's from Air Canada. The Air Canada order was a conversion of 10 options.
The A-319, which is not yet in service, is a smaller version of Airbus's A-320, which seats 150 passengers. The A-319 carries 125 passengers.
On Sunday, Boeing announced orders for the new generation of its 737. The company is expected to announce further orders at the show. Analysts expect Boeing to supply 40 737's to the International Finance Leasing Corporation.
A Boeing official in Seattle said it was close to signing orders with Taiwan's two largest airlines, China Airlines Ltd. and EVA Airways, for up to 12 of its new 777 jets. The order would be valued at as much as $1.75 billion, the official said.
In another transaction involving Boeing, United Parcel Service Inc. said it ordered five additional Boeing 757-200 aircraft for $300 million.
Also at the show, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz A.G., said it would provide the main propulsion systems for Arianespace Inc.'s Ariane 5 satellite-launching system, an order worth $150 million. And British Aerospace P.L.C. and Saab-Scania A.B. said they were joining forces to make and market Saab's JAS 39 Gripen light combat aircraft.

Northrop Gets Orders
 LOS ANGELES, June 12 (AP) -- France has agreed to buy two Northrop Grumman E-2C Hawkeye aircraft in a deal valued at $562 million, the company said toay.
The planes will be used aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, which is under construction.
The purchase by the French Defense Ministry will keep Hawkeye production at a steady pace through the decade, said Northrop Grumman, which is based here.
France is expected to eventually buy a total of four Hawkeyes for the aircraft carrier.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Japan's banks need shoring up if its stock market is to revive.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
IT used to look like Japan had most of the money in the world and was doing a good job of gathering up the rest. Now its financial markets are shaking because of fears the financial fabric of the country is unraveling.
Worries about the Japanese banking system -- still heavily burdened with bad loans that were made to real estate speculators during the boom years -- have helped produce the latest plunge in Japanese stocks. Share prices are nearing, or in some cases have already fallen below, the levels reached in 1992, when it appeared that the market had reached bottom after a sharp fall. 
 Moreover, the selling is coming in part from Japanese insurance companies, which need income to support the guaranteed returns they promised to policyholders and have decided that they are unwilling to wait for capital gains on stocks. The average Japanese stock pays less than 1 percent in annual dividends. Last week brought word that the insurers sold more stocks in the first five months of this year than in all of 1994.
That the worries are coming years after the Japanese stock market bubble burst is a testament to the belief that the Japanese Government would somehow stem the pain in the Japanese banking system. Those problems, however, have festered, and the apparent lack of a Government solution has been one cause of the latest decline. The Government released a plan last week that was meant to help the banks, but it was widely dismissed as being ineffective.
The Nikkei index of 225 stocks, the best-known indicator of major Japanese companies, has fallen 7 percent in the last five trading sessions and is down 25 percent since the end of 1994. At yesterday's close of 14,813.46, it is only 3.5 percent above the low of 14,309.41 reached in 1992. If it were to break through that level, it would be trading at its lowest levels since early 1986.
The Topix second section index, the leading index of smaller Japanese companies, fell just 6 percent over the five sessions, but it is down 32 percent for the year and has fallen through its 1992 low. At yesterday's close of 1,457.44, it was at its lowest level since Dec. 28, 1983.
For American holders of Japanese stocks, of course, some of the pain has been eliminated by the soaring yen. Measured in dollars, the Nikkei is down only 11 percent since the end of last year, and it remains well above its 1992 levels.
The short-term question confronting Tokyo is whether the Government will risk public anger and bail out banks that are in deep trouble but -- thanks to their failure to write down bad loans made during the years of Japan's bubble -- have not reflected that reality on their financial statements. Some argue that the Government is trying to prepare the public for that, but investors do not seem impressed by such gradualism.
At the same time, Japanese investors are worried about the ability of the country's industry to make money with the yen as high as it is against the dollar. "There is simply no ability in the export sector to generate earnings," said Steven Nagourney, global strategist at Lehman Brothers. "What we have been going through is a realization that there is no excess earnings power in Japan," in large part because of the currency factor.
Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Capital Investments International, a New York advisory firm, argues that the stock market is also reflecting the impending decline of the country's huge trade surplus. Much of it, he says, is now coming from the export of capital equipment to allow production to be shifted to other countries with lower costs. And, he adds, there are signs that imports are finally starting to penetrate the country as protectionist walls fall in some areas.
During the boom years, the stock market benefited from the interlocking relationships among companies, banks and insurance companies, all of which tended to own stock in one another. That helped to establish and protect various corporate relationships, including the close ties between auto parts suppliers and auto companies that have lately enraged the United States.
But it also meant that the real equity -- shares held by outsiders -- was relatively low in corporate Japan. Even when prices rose to unbelievable heights, Japanese companies were relatively restrained in selling new equity issues.
In the post-1992 revival, the Government intervened to effectively block most issuance of new shares, trying to avoid raising the supply of stock when demand was limited. It also forced large investments in Japanese stocks by public pension funds. Those investments now look like losers.
Bank stocks in recent days have fallen less than the market as a whole, and the Topix bank stock index is still above the lows it reached in March. But that could change. Although the situation varies from bank to bank, it is a widely quoted rule of thumb in Tokyo that a fall of the Nikkei 225 below 14,000 would leave many banks with inadequate capital as the value of their shareholdings declined. It will be interesting to see if the Government is able to come up with more vigorous action if that happens.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Big Economic Meeting, but Not Often a Success

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
When they gather in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Thursday, the leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies hope to lay the foundation for a "currency early warning system" intended to protect the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin America from the kind of catastrophe Mexico suffered when its peso collapsed in December.
But in doing so, the Group of Seven may only be adding to the list of not-very-successful efforts it has made in the last 20 years of these annual economic summit meetings. 
 Those efforts range from asking the International Monetary Fund to exercise close surveillance over the newly created floating exchange rate system at the Rambouillet meeting in 1975, to the more intense economic policy coordination that the Seven -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada -- agreed to at the insistence of James A. Baker 3d, then-Treasury Secretary, during the Tokyo summit in 1986.
Despite these agreements the dollar had become so overvalued by 1985 that the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Japan agreed to knock it down under their Plaza accord, and found that by 1987 it was so weak they needed to prop it up again with the Louvre agreement.
Today the dollar is again close to lows against the German mark and the yen, while the United States remains in deep deficit on its external payments and Japan continues to pile up enormous surpluses.
"I'm pretty skeptical about procedural fixes that purport to solve problems once and for all," said Robert D. Putnam, professor of government at Harvard and the co-author with Sir Nicholas Bayne, a British diplomat, of "Hanging Together," a history of the summit meetings. "But if the Seven don't talk it's a more dangerous world."
The new financial machinery that the seven nations are expected to endorse at Halifax also represents a first attempt to make good on their pledge last year to review all international organizations, both economic and political, to insure they are properly equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.
To this end, they are effectively redesigning the I.M.F. to make it better able to preserve monetary stability in today's new world of global capital markets where vast sums of money shift between currencies at the touch of a computer key.
As Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told the Institute for Strategic and International Studies in Washington last week: "Our institutions must be as modern as the marketplace. With Mexico we have seen how poor policies and markets that lack depth in very short order can destroy a nation's finances and threaten the spread of financial instability."
So under the Group of Seven's plan, the fund will monitor the performance of all important currencies more closely; speak out forcefully both in public and private when it spots a misalignment in the making and alert financial markets if any country tries to disguise the true state of its economy by withholding critical information -- as Mexico hid its reserve losses last year.
Then, to enable the I.M.F. to lend heavily to countries suffering sudden capital outflows in return for their taking steps to rebuild investor confidence, the Group of Seven wants to double the $28 billion emergency standby credit line that the I.M.F. already has with its 12 richest members, known as the General Agreement to Borrow. It would press Austria, Spain, Australia and some Asian nations to pledge funds as well.
But recent events have also shown how difficult it may be to achieve some of the goals that the seven nations have set for themselves.
In a preview of the Halifax summit meeting published by Dalhousie University in Canada, Professor Putnam and Sir Nicholas warned that the cold war's demise was making agreement harder to reach at these meetings. They cited the Group of Seven's failure to meet its 1990 deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round of free-trade negotiations.
"While the cold war continued, Western governments felt bound to unite against the Soviet Union and did not allow economic disputes to damage their solidarity," they wrote. "That constraint is now removed."
Moreover, the seven nations will arrive in Halifax deeply divided over the weak dollar, and with Washington and Tokyo squaring off for a trade war over autos.
It is also unclear how effective the I.M.F. will be at spotting and curing currency crises before they get out of hand, just as it is also unclear whether governments will take the I.M.F.'s advice when it comes.
In April, the I.M.F. managing director, Michel Camdessus, called publicly on the Federal Reserve to defend the dollar by raising American interest rates. But the Fed took no notice. The American economy's subsequent weakening raised questions about the wisdom of Mr. Camdessus's advice.
Even if the seven countries can agree among themselves at Halifax, they must still win the rest of the world's consent before their new early warning system becomes a reality.

Budget Brawlers Bloody, but Smiling

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 12

 BODY:
The ruling triumvirate of state government emerged from four months of budget talks last week pecked, scabbed and bone-tired, but all three were still smiling.
Each of them claimed a measure of victory, but nobody really wins or loses by the calculus of New York budget-making. After all, Republicans control the governorship and the Senate, while Democrats dominate the Assembly, creating an exquisite balance of power in which each side has a veto over the final product. 
 This also means that no one gets everything he wants. So, victory often depends on how well each side -- Gov. George E. Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno -- can sell their victories and diminish their defeats to various constituent groups.
Yet, above all that, the budget does establish an order, both political and substantive, that can affect each leader's power and the primacy of their agendas. Here, then, is a thumbnail analysis -- distilled from interviews with lawmakers, government staff, political analysts and others -- of how Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno fared.
One theme threaded through the interviews: a major dynamic this year was that all three men were new to leadership, as were most of their staffs. This led to blunders, misunderstandings and delays as each side tried to stake its turf and feel out the others in the first real test of the new Republican administration.
"Pataki had a good agenda," said Fran Werner, the Queens Republican leader who is a former lobbyist in Albany. "He tried very hard. But we didn't get to the bottom line. It was amateur night in Albany."
"Everybody was running amok," she added. "I'm being too frank, but I'm a little ticked off at the whole thing."
 
The Governor
 Mr. Pataki can unquestionably claim -- with the simplicity that marked his campaign -- that he delivered on his three main promises: less spending, lowered taxes and reduced welfare, as well as a major change in the criminal justice system. Even candid Democrats concede that Mr. Pataki came out of the budget melee on top -- if only because his accomplishments are more easily explained and because the public focuses on Governors more than Assembly speakers or majority leaders.
"We won," Mr. Pataki said in a statewide radio address on Friday. "Together, we made history. We moved New York in a new direction."
But the welfare cuts were watered down, the tax cuts not as broad as he wanted. Spending was only a hair lower than last year and the process was, as even he acknowledges, "horrible" -- secretive and gimmick-ridden as ever. This suggests a leader less ideologically inclined and more practical-minded than his campaign might have indicated.
"We didn't get sweeping, fundamental change but we did get change," said Michael Long, the chairman of the Conservative Party and a strong Pataki ally. "We got the beginning."
Despite the shortcomings, many said that Mr. Pataki's most concrete achievement was changing the terms of the debate: for example, that it was not whether taxes should be cut, but by how much. "The Governor redefined the discussion right out of the box," said Andrew W. Goodell, a Republican who is the Chautauqua County Executive. "And that's an incredible accomplishment."
But it did come at a cost: Though he had pledged to work with individual lawmakers, he ended up running threatening advertisements in Democrats' districts and trying to withold their pay -- moves that may insure a hostile reaction to whatever he proposes. He has also had to combat the perception that he is not a forceful leader. "He's going to have to learn the fine art of terrorizing people," one ally said.
And as polls have shown, it is still far from clear that the public likes the redirection of Mr. Pataki's budget. The final word may depend on whether local property taxes rise, the state budget remains balanced and whether Wall Street upgrades the state's low bond ratings.
 
The Speaker
 Mr. Silver became Speaker only last year, yet was the veteran of the three leaders. But from the start, he had the toughest job in Albany: to uphold the Democratic vision after voters soundly rejected it in the fall. And though he seems the most bruised, he can point to several victories.
First, he held together the 94 fractious and ideologically diverse members who comprise the Assembly's majority -- despite predictions that he could not hammer out an agreement to satisfy both liberal members from New York City and conservative upstaters, whose voters are sympathetic to Mr. Pataki's aims.
"There is no doubt there was some creative tension," said Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman, Democrat of Syracuse. But, he added, "I said from the beginning of the session that our conference would remain rock-solid behind Shelly Silver."
Second, even though Mr. Silver conceded the philosophical ground in almost every instance, he often dominated the details. There was welfare reform, but Mr. Silver weakened it considerably, killing off benefit cuts and time limits. There was a tax cut, but he managed to shift it toward people earning less than $50,000 a year. He is now banking that voters will reject the budget and has already begun to disassociate himself from it.
"The budget passed earlier this week kicks off the Republican tax-shift era," Mr. Silver said in his response to Mr. Pataki's radio address. "Mark my words: local taxes will rise because of Republican economics."
But even several Democrats believe that Mr. Silver made several tactical errors. Some say he insured several more hard years of defending social programs because he conceded to Mr. Pataki the scope of his multiyear tax cut -- meaning that each year will require more programmatic cuts. Some also said that his focus on upstate concerns, in the name of holding his conference together, may cost him support in his political base, New York City, which is almost certainly the biggest loser in this year's budget debate.
 
The Majority Leader
 The price that the Republicans in the Senate have paid for having a Republican Governor is a degree of irrelevance. The real battles now are fought between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Silver, while Mr. Bruno sits largely on the side, a loyal supporter of Mr. Pataki, his old colleague. But this has its advantages. Mr. Bruno, irrepressibly outspoken, won a pot of goodies this year and, with a few exceptions, has few wounds to show for it.
Though several Senators distrusted him after he staged the coup in November that brought him to power, he has apparently united his conference, at least to the degree that he prevented Senators from attacking Mr. Pataki on budget cuts that they did not like. Senators, who like predictability and comfort, say Mr. Bruno listens and has a good sense for making government more like business. Sessions start on time and no longer run overnight.
In the budget, he won the package of tax cuts, and they have earned him friends in the business community (more specifically, a parimutuel tax deal good for Saratoga, part of his district, north of Albany). He won a number of other important projects for his district including $5 million in reconstruction to the Albany County Airport and a new medical facility in Troy.
He was also unabashed about restoring so-called "member's items" -- the pork-barrel spending on local projects that individual lawmakers dispense in their districts.
His biggest defeats this year have been of his own making: Mr. Bruno was accused of making statements that disparaged homosexuals and welfare recipients. And his loyalty to Mr. Pataki's budget cuts -- and the layoffs they entailed -- has cost him some support among labor, an important constituency because so many state workers live in his district.
"I think unfortunately, the Joe Bruno that C.S.E.A. has known for a lot of years suddenly disappeared this year," said Danny Donohue, president of the largest state workers union, the Civil Service Employees Association. "The sad part is, we like Joe Bruno."

HEADLINE: Chip Index Is Highest in Almost 10 Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., June 12

 BODY:
The Semiconductor Industry Association's book-to-bill ratio for May rose to its highest level in nearly a decade, indicating demand for computer chips remained strong going into the traditionally slow summer season.
The higher-than-expected ratio of 1.22 in May, up from a revised 1.17 in April, was buoyed by a record $4.3 billion in new orders from the North American market, the association said. 
 Some analysts warned that the closely watched numbers could be inflated because computer makers are ordering more chips than they need so they can amass the inventory they will need to meet demand in the fourth quarter.
The association's ratio measures the health of the semiconductor industry in North America by comparing the number of chip orders with the number of chips shipped each month.
A ratio of 1.22 means that for every $100 in orders shipped by chip makers, manufacturers received $122 in new orders. The ratio is computed using a three-month moving average and is seasonally adjusted.
Bookings for May rose 5.7 percent to $4.30 billion, from $4.07 billion in April. May orders were 54 percent higher than the $2.8 billion reported in May 1994.
Billings for the month rose 2 percent to $3.54 billion, from $3.47 billion in April. May shipments were 38 percent higher than the $2.57 billion of May 1994.

HEADLINE: Chicago's Boss Daley Inherited High-Rises

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Legacy of Boss Daley" (editorial, June 7) asserts that former Mayor Richard J. Daley's "most troubling legacy to Chicago" was the "mammoth housing projects like the Robert Taylor Homes and Stateway Gardens," which "went up along a lengthy stretch of South State Street, as Chicago began to put together the largest contiguous ghettos in the United States." 
 When Richard J. Daley became Mayor in 1955, he inherited a housing authority that had a new love affair with elevator buildings for families with children. And the Federal Government was ready to supply the money to build them. To quote Elizabeth Wood, the authority's executive director, the "vertical neighborhoods" surrounded by green space would "compete with the suburbs for social desirability, especially for families with children."
By 1955, the authority had built a third of the city's 185 family high-rises and had on the drawing boards 38 more, including Stateway Gardens' eight elevator buildings and the first 15 high-rises in Cabrini-Green Homes. By then, construction of the infamous State Street corridor was under way. The racial segregation so evident today was already entrenched in 1955.

No Progress in Special Talks With Japan

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 12

 BODY:
Trade lawyers from Japan and the United States, after explaining to each other today why they thought the other side was violating international trade rules in their bitter auto dispute, said they were going home to "ponder."
"Both sides will reflect further," said Andrew Stoler, the No. 2 official in the United States trade representative's Geneva office, as he emerged from more than seven hours of talks at World Trade Organization headquarters overlooking Lake Geneva. 
 "Mental exercise," was how one Japanese trade official described it. Then, searching for some benefit from discussions that left both sides frustrated, he added: "I think they understand our legal reasoning better. And we understand theirs better, as well."
But it was clear that neither side had come to these specially arranged talks intending to give an inch in their growing trade war, in which the United States has threatened to impose punitive tariffs worth almost $6 billion on Japanese luxury cars in retaliation for Japanese practices that Washington says hinder the sale of American cars and parts in Japan.
Today's talks amounted to little more than a midlevel discussion of the legal justifications for the two economic rivals' separate actions.
Japan contends that the Clinton Administration's threat of sanctions is a violation of World Trade Organization rules, and it is suing Washington to nullify the action.
The United States argues that Japan's import curbs are unreasonable, and justify unilateral action.
Thus, it appears that each side will test the other's skills at brinksmanship as a June 28 deadline approaches. On that date, the United States says it will impose 100 percent tariffs on 13 luxury Japanese cars, retroactive to May 20.
Japanese officials repeated today that they would not agree to talks on substantive issues until Washington removed both the threat of sanctions and its demand that Japan set numerical targets for imports of American cars and parts.
Kazuo Asakai, deputy director general of the economic affairs bureau of the Foreign Ministry, said the American threat of sanctions "was already seriously affecting exports of products to the United States."
President Clinton is to meet on Thursday with the Japanese Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, before the broader sessions of top leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Little U.S. Optimism
 WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) -- The White House said today that the outlook was grim for settling the trade dispute with Japan and that it was unlikely that President Clinton and Prime Minister Murayama would patch things up when they met later this week.
"We don't expect any resolution of our trade and economic issues as a result of the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President," the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said at a news briefing.
And Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said in a radio interview today that while the United States did not want a trade war with Japan, it was "very, very important" that Tokyo open its markets to more imports.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise In Reaction To Comments By Greenspan

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose moderately yesterday in quiet trading ahead of economic reports due this week.
After opening on a positive note from overseas trading, the market gained on the weekend remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who was in Basel, Switzerland, for a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements on Sunday. He reiterated that the risks of a "modest recession" had increased and that inflation data would be important in the forthcoming meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. 
 The market took one of its biggest slides in nine months on Friday, as a bevy of rumors lowered expectations of an early easing by the Fed. Dealers said some investors holding longer maturities used upticks in the market, notably those occasioned by Mr. Greenspan's comments, as an opportunity to sell some of their holdings and move to shorter maturities, thus stalling the initial moves up.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston in New York, said, "It was a quiet day," with some market participants selling and moving to the sidelines, reluctant to take a position before this week's economic reports.
He predicted that the Fed would not ease short-term rates at the July 5 and 6 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Instead, Mr. Alexy suggested, the central bank could lower rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, at its Aug. 22 meeting.
Among the data due out this week that the Fed will consider in making its decision are the May consumer price index, industrial production, May retail sales and the Atlanta Federal Reserve survey of regional business activity. The big story is likely to be retail sales, which might indicate whether the slowdown in production is signaling a recession or an attempt to lessen the inventory load that built up because of last year's brisk 4.1 percent growth rate.
Joel Marver, senior fixed income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said: "Monday's action was consolidative in comparison with the huge losses suffered on Friday. But it is a common pattern in the Treasury market to see prices effectively head sideways after a large-range session."
Elsewhere, the Treasury's auction yesterday of new three- and six-month bills drew decent investor demand, according to analysts. Rates were higher with the three-month maturity up 9 basis points to 5.57 percent from the previous auction, while the six-month bills rose 21 basis points to 5.56 percent.
The 30-year benchmark issue was up 8/32 to a price of 11127/32 for a yield of 6.70 percent, down from 6.72 percent on Friday. Bill rates were down an average of 5 basis points in secondary trading.
Most of the early weakness was attributed to a CNW Report, a weekly auto survey, that showed car sales rose 5.1 percent in May on a year-over-year basis. It gave the impression that there might be a bit of a rebound under way, and that, too, could keep the prospect of an easing on hold.
In the corporate market, issuance is expected to be heavy this week, with supply concentrated in 10-year maturities as companies take advantage of the low rate environment. The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to sell $1 billion of notes on Tuesday and a $500 million offering from Time Warner is also expected. Traders believe the high- quality T.V.A. offering will go smoothly and that Time Warner's longer- maturity debt offering may not travel as smooth a road.
Prices of tax-exempt municipal bonds fell for a fourth consecutive day on expectations that many of the bonds that make up this week's $3.5 billion of new issues will offer higher yields.
The average yield to maturity for the Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues, if the issuer elects to call the debt now, was up 7 basis points to 6.11 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

Dollar Declines Over Concerns About the Tokyo Stock Market

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the yen and most other leading currencies yesterday as concerns mounted that a slide in the Tokyo stock market would prompt Japanese investors to sell overseas assets to cover losses at home.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell yesterday to its lowest close in nearly three years, fueling speculation that Japanese investors would bring capital home from abroad. That could hurt the dollar if Japanese investors sell American assets and convert the dollar proceeds into yen. 
 "I think there's a lot of repatriation going on," said Varick Martin, manager of foreign exchange at Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in New York. "Money has to come home to support their own market. The tendency at the moment is for a stronger yen and weaker dollar."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 84.04 yen from 84.29 yen on Friday. The dollar slipped to 1.4033 German marks from 1.4053 marks.
But the decline in the dollar was stemmed yesterday by speculation that central banks could act to support the dollar before leaders of the seven leading industrial powers meet this week in Halifax, Nova Scotia, traders said.
The Group of Seven meeting begins Thursday. At their last meeting in April, leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan pledged to support the dollar.
On May 31, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks began a surprise bout of concerted dollar-buying that bolstered the currency.
"People feel the G-7 will solidify what they did in April, which could mean more concerted intervention if they deem it necessary," said Jim Raphael, a currency trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City. "People are nervous to be short of dollars."
Currency dealers are also uncertain about the direction of interest rates in the United States. Many dealers had expected the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates, but comments by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, on Wednesday indicated that the central bank would stay put on rates. Lower rates tend to hurt the dollar by making deposits denominated in it less attractive.
Still, traders said they would watch a number of United States economic reports due out this week for clues to the dollar's direction.
"There's enough news on the horizon this week that the market is anesthetized, unsure which direction to take the dollar in case a headline flashes," said Steve Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York.

Misadventures in Hot Dog Trade

BYLINE: SUSAN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
The hot dog cart, parked outside state offices, did a booming business. The reason, the authorities say, is that it was at the heart of a scheme that illegally distributed $40 million in unemployment benefits over 25 years. Several people have already pleaded guilty in the case, including four former workers in the State Department of Labor who were sentenced yesterday to prison terms of 8 to 21 months.

U.S. ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK ENGELHARD ACQUISITION

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Engelhard Corporation, of Iselin, N.J., should not be allowed to acquire its largest competitor in the gel clay business, the Floridin Company of West Virginia, the Justice Department said yesterday in a lawsuit filed in Macon, Ga., to block the merger. "Engelhard and Floridin are each other's most significant competitor today," said Anne K. Bingaman, the Assistant Attorney General who oversees the antitrust division. "The consolidation will lead to higher prices for gel clay, affecting a wide range of products in important segments of the U.S. economy." The acquisition would give Engelhard, the largest company in the industry, about 83 percent of the gel clay business, according to the complaint brought by the antitrust division.

At the Open, Canvas Comes With a Cash Lining

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, L.I., June 12

 BODY:
They are green and white settlements upon a dogleg -- tented Levittowns for a week. They are the corporate hospitality tents of the United States Open Championship, spacious, chandeliered, air-conditioned, catered, Astroturfed encampments upon the course of the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club.
There are three encampments here, each with a name like a Florida retirement community, each surrounded by picket fences and identified with shingles outside. All that's missing are mailboxes with decoy ducks atop them. 
 A 40-foot-by-60-foot tent in Centennial Village with views of the eighth and ninth holes costs $125,000 (lesser vistas don't cost less). A 40-by-40 tent in Shinnecock Village overlooking the first fairway before it doglegs right goes for $110,000. For the economy-minded, one of 40 tables in the 60-by-125 Champions' Pavilion, which provides a commanding view of the practice driving range, can be yours for $25,000.
Outside each village stands a topiary sculpture of a golfer ready to whack a ball, as if Edward Scissorhands had suddenly become enamored of Big Bertha. During a storm Sunday night, the bushy golfer outside Shinnecock Village fell flat on his face. He was upright yesterday. "He looks like a gorilla," joked Mimi Griffin, the Open's marketing director.
A veranda is outside each tent, with deck chairs and tables, with protective umbrellas and a potted plant. United States Open wine, from a local winery, is served, as is food from an outside caterer, which pays the United States Golf Association a fee.
The tents combine to make a lovely profit center for the U.S.G.A., which runs the Open; they are as expensive as a seasonlong luxury suite at many arenas and stadiums. The 21 buyers of Centennial and Shinnecock tents and the 40 denizens of the Champions' Pavilion pay a total of $3.46 million to eat, watch TV and entertain clients and themselves at a remove from Norman, Faldo, Azinger, Price and the gnats who call the course home.
"Maybe it costs the U.S.G.A. $15,000 to set up a tent," said Frank Hannigan, the former executive director of the U.S.G.A. "It's enormously profitable.
"I never minded ripping off AT&T," he added, referring to one of the companies that purchased a tent.
The tents are a small, but significant part of the U.S.G.A.'s revenues. In 1994, the organization had revenues of $48.7 million. About half was derived from its championships and television rights. Net surplus was $1.8 million. This year, NBC's rights fee for its first United States Open is about $14 million, up from the $11 million that ABC paid through last year.
The U.S.G.A. does not let outsiders lacking the proper passes enter its villages. It's like trying to crash the exclusive Bohemian Club unless you're Ronald Reagan, George Shultz or Michael Eisner.
"So this is just for v.i.p.'s right, not us?" asked one woman, relegated to a gallery pass yesterday.
"Corporate hospitality, that's right," said one volunteer.
"What are the tents like on the inside?" a reporter asked the volunteer.
"I wouldn't know," she said. "I'm not allowed in."
The U.S.G.A. does not make the names of its tent-buyers public. There are no programs listing which company is situated where. If someone comes to Shinnecock Village asking for a corporation located across the way at Centennial, a volunteer will not volunteer if the company is actually there.
Why the secrecy?
"Companies ask us not to release their names," Griffin said. "If we did, they'd get hundreds of requests from people asking for tickets. And in the age of downsizing, they don't want to broadcast how much money they're spending."
But by yesterday, the companies' names were plainly apparent. Among the $125,000 tent-buyers were AT&T, Metropolitan Life, Unisys, Nynex, Arthur Andersen, Chemical Bank, and Chase Manhattan.
Among those springing for $110,000 tents were Lehman Brothers, Sports Illustrated, NatWest Bank, I.B.M. (if you can pay $3.5 billion to acquire Lotus Development, you can get a tent), American Express and American Airlines. Several corporations are sharing tents, including The New York Times, Newsday, American Airlines and Hertz.
Shinnecock is not as propitiously located for the sale of tents, which are actually steel-reinforced structures upon which heavy tenting is draped. The club is 90 miles east of New York City, with limited hotel rooms nearby, and that has meant a scaled-back tent setup, said Griffin. The 1993 Open, held at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J., had 46 tents selling at $125,000.
Next year's Open, to be held at Oakland Hills Country Club, in Birmingham, Mich., will feature 26 to 30 tents, and all are sold out. Tent sales there were bad at 1991's Senior Open, a reflection of huge losses in the automobile industry. Now, the tents are a leading indicator of the Big Three's health.
Griffin said Shinnecock had room for five more tents if New York's brokerage business were performing better financially.
Still, the tents are a permanent part of the U.S.G.A.'s business plan. At the 1986 Open, the Shinnecock course had only eight tents, Hannigan said. Now, tent sales have grown several times, and the U.S.G.A. has complete control over the golf course that hosts the Open; the U.S.G.A. runs everything on the course during the Open, and pays the club a rental fee.
"In '86, we paid Shinnecock $40,000 or $50,000," Hannigan said. "I'd be surprised if it wasn't double that now."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
PRESIDENT OFFERS PLAN TO BALANCE FEDERAL BUDGET

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
After weeks of debate about how to confront the Republican-controlled Congress, President Clinton tonight sketched his own plan for balancing the Federal budget -- but over 10 years not 7. He would do so by slowing the growth of Medicare spending far less than the Republicans want and making up the difference with reductions in corporate subsidies and other domestic spending.
In a brief televised address from the Oval Office, Mr. Clinton committed himself to balancing the budget by 2005 -- three years after the Republicans propose to -- with spending cuts of $1.1 trillion. Those would be stretched out to be less severe than Republican alternatives, and accompanied by the President's previously proposed tax breaks, much smaller than the Republicans have proposed and narrowly focused on the middle class. 
 "It took decades to run up this deficit," Mr. Clinton said. "It's going to take a decade to wipe it out. Now, mind you, we could do it in seven years, as Congressional leaders propose. But the pain we'd inflict on our elderly, our students, and our economy just isn't worth it."
"It won't be easy," Mr. Clinton said. "But elected leaders of both parties agree with me that we must do this, and we will."
In making his counterproposals, Mr. Clinton bucked the advice of almost all his top White House advisers, and infuriated Congressional Democrats, who argued that his criticisms of the Republicans' proposed cuts as a sop to the rich were just beginning to take hold. The House Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said the President had turned Medicare into a political football, adding: "The real losers will be the elderly and the families that support them."
Republicans praised the President for joining their camp, but said he was still too timid. The Senate Majority Leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, who gave the official Republican response, said Mr. Clinton offered "recycled reasons why big government cannot become smaller, why programs cannot be cut and why agencies cannot be eliminated."
Mr. Clinton proposes to save $124 billion in Medicare costs over the next seven years, about half what the Republicans want. He would do so -- as he did in his failed health proposal last year -- in the name of expanding coverage and overhauling insurance laws. He would also save $25 billion by abolishing some unspecified tax subsidies for corporations, and would cut scores of discretionary domestic programs.
For the first time tonight, as he sought to regain ground lost to the Republicans in Congress, Mr. Clinton unequivocally embraced the goal of balancing the budget by a fixed date, a question he has always finessed and explicitly abandoned just four months ago when he presented a budget that produced rising deficits into the future. Aides said he was trying to shift the debate from whether the budget could be balanced to how it should be. As a result, they said, he hoped to avoid a string of vetoes of spending bills later this summer, while persuading the public that he would stick up for his priorities.
Mr. Clinton sketched five broad principles tonight: Protect education; control health care costs but preserve services for the elderly; cut taxes for the middle class, not the wealthy; cut welfare but protect children; and "don't put the brakes on so fast that we risk our economic prosperity."
He added: "This can be a turning point for us. For 12 years our Government -- Congress and the White House -- ducked the deficit and pretended we could get something for nothing. In my first two years as President, we turned this around and cut the deficit by one third. Now let's eliminate it. It's time to clean up this mess."
The President issued that call only after weeks of intense internal debate in the White House, and just four months after offering a budget that left the hard choices to the Republicans and then trying to blame them for the inevitable cuts in popular programs. He spoke after a final, frantic day of preparations, in which he rewrote his own words up to the last minute, while senior budget aides and political advisers scrambled to outline complex proposals -- including a revived and scaled-back overhaul of the health care system -- in the opaque language of press releases.
The White House Chief of Staff, Leon E. Panetta, described Mr. Clinton's olive branch as "an act of optimism, an act of cooperation and leadership," an alternative to the orthodoxies of either party.
But many senior Democrats were unsparing in their criticism.
"I think most of us learned some time ago that if you don't like the President's position on a particular issue, you simply need to wait a few weeks," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee. "If you can follow this White House on the budget, you are a whole lot smarter than I am."
But in recent weeks, aides said, Mr. Clinton has become increasingly convinced that he will not be seen as leading if he defines his Presidency simply by saying no to the Republican advance, and that he is determined to be on what he calls "the solution side" of the daunting problems of the day, from welfare, to education to health care.
His proposal tonight, sketchy and broad as it was, was littered with small gestures of good faith. He proposed to trim $25 billion in corporate tax subsidies because that is the amount proposed by Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.
Mr. Clinton would continue his promised expansion of the earned income tax credit that gives tax breaks to the working poor, in the face of Republican proposals to curtail it by about $21 billion. But the White House said he would save $3 billion by cracking down on fraud by illegal aliens who are not authorized to work in this country.
The President squarely acknowledged the need to slow the growth in spending on Medicare and Medicaid that is driving up the Federal deficit, but held to his longstanding pledge to do so only as part of broader efforts to expand health coverage. And he held to his proposal for a new $500-per-child tax credit for middle class families and new tax deductions for education -- first announced last December -- in the face of far bolder, broader Republican plans.
Before the President spoke, Mr. Panetta said Mr. Clinton had no intention of agreeing to the size of the spending and tax cuts the Republicans want.
"The President is basically saying let's recognize this. Let's work together and resolve it now."
Mr. Panetta, and almost all other senior White House advisers, were reluctant converts to the President's latest gambit, arguing that the White House should wait until later in the summer to duel it out with the Republicans on specifics. But Mr. Clinton, encouraged by his Connecticut-based pollster and informal adviser, Dick Morris, a confidant from his days as Governor of Arkansas, persisted in pressing for a "counterbudget" now.
For weeks, budget advisers had drafted detailed options, and Mr. Clinton reviewed them over the last 10 days. Aides said the President's resolve to speak out was only strengthened by the positive public reviews of his cordial encounter with Speaker Newt Gingrich in New Hampshire on Sunday, and that he made the final decision to seek television time for a speech this morning, dispatching Vice President Al Gore to lobby the networks. The rest of the day was one long repeat of a ritual that has become fixed in this Administration: fevered rewriting almost to the moment of delivery.
The exercise left some of the President's top advisers -- who just weeks ago had gone to great lengths to stress the dangers of trying to balance the budget too quickly -- scrambling to explain Mr. Clinton's new proposal. Their basic argument was that by stretching the balancing act over 10 years instead of 7, and persisting with tax cuts only about a third the size of the Republicans' proposals, Mr. Clinton would lessen the pain while preserving his own top spending priorities.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economic policy adviser, said that in balancing the budget, "even the most carefully designed path will always carry some contractionary risk," to the overall economy. But she added, "One way to reduce the risk is to extend the period for achieving balance" and emphasized, "We got a date, or a path, out of our policy analysis; we did not allow an arbitrary date to drive our policy."
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, acknowledged that there had been "a significant debate and a significant choice for the President on whether to intervene in this process now." But he said the concern was if the President failed to speak out now, Republican appropriators would produce "bills that he would of necessity have to veto over and over again," or would make good on Republican threats to enmesh measures Mr. Clinton opposes in vital legislation to assure the orderly functioning of Government -- like that to increase the statutory ceiling on the Federal debt.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, was considerably more sanguine.
"Oh, I don't think there's any urgency at all," he said. "The President has been involved in a lengthy process of focusing on the tradeoffs with respect to all the factors that will determine what kind of an economy we're going to have in the years ahead -- jobs increases, increasing standards of living. And this is the fruit of an enormous amount of work about what we need to do for our economy."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up 0.3%; Retail Sales Barely Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that consumers raised their spending by just two-tenths of 1 percent in May, to a level of retail sales that remained below that of March, a sign that the economy could be about to stall.
In a separate report, the Labor Department calculated that consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the month, meaning that retail sales, which account for about one-third of economic activity, actually eased slightly after allowing for inflation. 
 "Consumers remain in hibernation," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, citing the two reports as "further evidence of a slow-growth, low-inflation environment."
The bond and stock markets greeted the latest figures with enthusiasm in the apparent belief that the economy is weak enough to prompt an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve but not so weak as to seriously undermine corporate profits.
Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, called last month's retail sales "pretty disappointing" and said the odds had improved to virtually 50-50 that the Federal Reserve would cut short-term interest rates at the next scheduled meeting of its top policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, on July 5 and July 6.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, raised the possibility last Wednesday at a bankers' convention in Seattle that the economy would slip into a brief recession, while at the same time asserting that the chances of a long or severe recession had diminished.
Those remarks were widely interpreted as a sign of the Fed's hesitance to cut rates on the grounds that it could stimulate the economy just as it emerged from a transitory downturn.
But over the weekend Mr. Greenspan expressed a bit more concern about the economy's rapid deceleration, warning more emphatically of near-term risks while asserting again bright longer-term prospects. Many analysts interpreted these comments, made at a gathering of international bankers in Switzerland, as an indication that Mr. Greenspan's reluctance to cut rates was weakening.
Today's results added to the pressure for a cut, analysts said. Some noted that the overnight interest rate controlled by the central bank is, at 6 percent, exceptionally high when adjusted for current inflation.
Though the retail sales report was a rough estimate based on a small number of respondents, analysts said it had become clear that consumers were retrenching. Unlike last month, when there was a large upward sales revision for March, revisions today to earlier months were negligible.
The automotive sector did not rebound from April's decline as well as expected, rising five-tenths of 1 percent following a 1.4 percent April drop that initially had been put at 2 percent. Excluding automotive sales, consumers spent just one-tenth of 1 percent more in May than in April and the same amount in April as in March.
Among nondurables, items not expected to last at least three years, clothing stores posted a 1.5 percent gain while department stores and others selling general merchandise raised sales three-tenths of 1 percent in May. But the other categories suffered declines.
Total sales were $192.90 billion, after adjustment for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences but not for price changes, compared with $192.49 billion for April.
As for the inflation report, the results were somewhat more benign than expected because the "core" Consumer Price Index -- excluding the erratic food and energy components -- rose just two-tenths of 1 percent, half the April increase and the smallest rise so far this year.
"No components of the C.P.I. are currently showing any significant inflationary pressures," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research group. "If anything, with the economy clearly weakening, the pressures on prices seems to be downward."
The index for food, which jumped sharply in April, edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent last month as the fruit and vegetable component contributed heavily to the moderation.
Apparel fell for the second straight month and transportation rose by less than in April as a 2.1 percent surge in the price of gasoline was partly offset by declines of 1.3 percent for automobile finance charges and seven-tenths of 1 percent for used cars.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Starting Point for Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
What President Clinton said tonight about the budget is not nearly so important as the fact that he said something at all.
The proposals he made for lowering spending, reducing taxes and balancing the budget over 10 years will not be approved by this Republican Congress. But they will be the starting point for the negotiations between the White House and Congress later this year that will ultimately determine how far the Republicans will get in their drive to revamp the Federal Government. 
 The President's coming forward now could be disadvantageous to him in two respects. It means that he is opening his budget negotiations with Congress by conceding that cuts can be made in popular Democratic programs like Medicare, rather than taking a hard line at the outset and working toward a compromise. And it leaves Mr. Clinton exposed in some politically sensitive areas going into the 1996 Presidential election campaign.
But Bill Clinton is a President who is deeply interested in government policy, particularly economic policy. His staff assistants and many of his friends in Congress said they could not imagine him getting involved in a policy fight with the Republican Congress without having laid down a marker of his own.
Until now, the President had given the Republicans center stage on the budget and tried to gain political advantage by taking occasional pot shots at them for protecting the privileged at the expense of the needy.
Mr. Clinton's proposals tonight for limiting spending on Medicare and Medicaid, for giving a tax cut to the middle class and for restraining the earned-income tax credit for the working poor are much more modest than those proposed by the Republicans. But he has severely limited the extent to which he can attack the Republicans' principles on these matters.
This was especially galling to some Democrats in Congress who believed that they had been scoring politically by opposing Republican proposals to limit spending on Medicare for the elderly, and education and nutrition programs for children. When the news that the President would present his own balanced-budget plan was announced at a lunch meeting of Democratic senators today, the response, according to someone who was there, was a collective groan.
A Democratic Congressman who spoke on condition that he not be identified said that the minority leaders in Congress, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, went to the White House last week to try to talk the President out of doing what he did tonight, but their appeal fell flat.
Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said Mr. Clinton was "playing right into the hands of the Republicans."
Even so, some Democrats conceded that he had to take a stand or risk irrelevancy. "You can't beat something with nothing," said Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
Republicans had been baiting Mr. Clinton for weeks with the charge that he was failing to lead. Tonight they seemed delighted with the political cover that his proposals provided them, but they continued to take jabs at him. "It's just a nondocument by a nonplayer," said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming.
The dilemma Mr. Clinton faces, and one the Congressional Republicans are just beginning to realize, is this: For all the talk about cutting waste and fraud, the fact is that the only way to reduce the Federal budget is to cut spending for popular programs, raise taxes or both.
Polls show that the public favors a balanced budget, but only in the abstract. Cutting the budget with specific spending and tax measures has never been politically popular. Witness what happened to President George Bush after he signed a tax increase in 1990, and to the Democrats in Congress after they voted for the Clinton deficit-reduction plan in 1993.
Since the outset of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton has held that the economic security of the nation demands a reduction in the Federal deficit. Oddly, he has received almost no political credit for the strength of the nation's economy after the enactment of his 1993 deficit-reduction plan, which received no Republican votes.
The debate so far this year has been between two factions of the Republican Party. The House and the Senate have both approved budget resolutions that are supposed to balance the budget by the year 2002, and the plans are now before a conference committee to resolve the differences.
The House measure would allow $350 billion in tax cuts starting next year. The tax cuts in the Senate plan would mostly not appear until after the turn of the century, if at all. These resolutions are guidelines for Congress, and the President has no say about them.
But no one doubts that the House and Senate will strike a compromise, probably within the next week or two. Then will come the heavy duty -- the adoption of legislation that puts the tax and spending programs into effect.
This is when Mr. Clinton will move into a pivotal position. Each of the tax and spending measures will be subject to his veto. Since the Republicans probably do not have enough votes to override his vetoes, they will have to negotiate with him.
So the President's eventual entry into the fray was inevitable. The question tonight was, why now?
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, offered an explanation, but it was not particularly convincing.
First, he said, Mr. Clinton hoped to influence the Congressional conference now under way on the budget resolutions. Second, he was afraid that if he and Congress could not reach an agreement by Oct. 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year, the Government would be forced to shut down. And third, Mr. Clinton wanted to show the leaders of the leading allied countries at their meeting in Nova Scotia this weekend that the United States was operating with fiscal responsibility.
The truth is, the President's people are frozen out of the conference on the budget resolution, just as Mr. Bush's advisers were when the Democrats controlled Congress. And Congressional leaders will not be prepared for months to begin negotiations leading up to the October deadline. As for the leaders of the other industrial nations, most of their budget deficits now are more serious than the one in the United States.
What complicates Mr. Clinton's position on the budget is that it has changed so often.
In the early Democratic primaries in 1992, Mr. Clinton sugarcoated his own proposals and denounced the bitter fiscal medicine offered by his main opponent, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. Then, in the general election campaign, Mr. Clinton vigorously advocated a tax cut for the middle class.
But in the first two years of his Presidency he abandoned the tax cut and made deficit reduction his highest priority. Then, after the Democratic defeat in the 1994 Congressional elections, Mr. Clinton quickly offered a new, specific tax reduction but put forth a budget with deficits of around $200 billion a year stretching into the next century.
Now, he is talking once more about deficit reduction.
"I think most of us learned some time ago," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, "that if you don't like the President's position on a particular issue, you simply need to wait a few weeks."

HEADLINE: Jobless Legions Rattle Europe's Welfare States

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 13

 BODY:
Though the headlines would suggest that European leaders are obsessed with the quagmire in Bosnia, the most intractable problem facing most of the 15 countries of the European Union is jobs.
With unemployment rates above 12 percent in France and Italy, 23 percent in Spain and about 9 percent in Germany for May, joblessness is at the highest levels since recovery from World War II, and politicians all over the Continent are under pressure to get it down. 
 France's new President, Jacques Chirac, won election last month with a promise of "fundamental change" after the 14-year presidency of Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist. Italy's populist Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, pledged before he was forced out of office in December to put the country back to work by sweeping away layers of bureaucracy and corruption by organized crime. The popularity of Spain's Socialist Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, is at the lowest point of his 12 years in power.
The prospect of chronic joblessness at politically dangerous levels is bringing Europe's leaders face to face with some deeply entrenched assumptions about salaries, benefits and tax policy.
Most European leaders agree that one important reason their economies are unable to create jobs -- indeed, have eliminated hundreds of thousands of them -- is the staggeringly high cost of providing tens of millions of Europeans with higher hourly wages, longer vacations and more comprehensive health and welfare benefits than most Americans have.
But voters do not want to lose these benefits, so European leaders are only slowly beginning to chip away at the edges of the welfare state, and trying to leave the foundations intact.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has had three consecutive years of union wage settlements below the rate of inflation, leaving millions of German workers in the unheard-of predicament of having less money in their paychecks than they had the year before.
Now, in France, Mr. Chirac is trying to shift some of the burdens of paying for health and social security benefits away from company payrolls and onto the general tax rolls.
Some people are skeptical that his plan will work. "There are so many rigidities in our economy," said Edmond Berbon, a retired businessman in Rheims who says government regulations and long-ingrained public attitudes make it difficult for local enterprises to create jobs.
"It is an aberration nowadays to pay people a 13th or even a 14th-month salary every year, but we do, and they want to hang onto these things," he said. "What we need is to change the way the French think, but that will take a generation."
Mr. Chirac plans legislation to cut back the Government-imposed payroll taxes, which now amount to an additional 55 to 65 percent of each employee's gross salary and are paid by the employer. These charges push the cost to employers of workers getting even the $7-an-hour minimum wage to about $1,800 a month, so many companies now think twice before taking on new workers. Employees have additional deductions, but pay less into the system than the companies they work for.
Mr. Chirac's plan would altogether eliminate charges companies have to pay on salaries of unskilled low-wage workers, and it would provide a $400-a-month subsidy for each young trainee or long-term unemployed person hired by small and medium-sized companies.
The total cost of the program, which employers' groups say could create 300,000 jobs in three years, is estimated at $15 billion a year, money the Government will probably have to raise general taxes to come up with. That would run the risk of thwarting economic growth instead of stimulating it. The Government has also announced plans to raise the minimum wage by about 4 percent this summer.
Most European countries are unwilling to follow the lead of the United States, which has created millions of jobs by allowing companies the freedom to hire part-time employees without traditional full benefits.
So France's plans to bring down its 12.2 percent unemployment rate -- more than double that in the United States, and higher than in Japan, Germany, Canada, Britain or Italy -- will be closely scrutinized when leaders of the seven countries meet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, this week.
European Union leaders will meet again in Cannes, France, on June 26 and 27 to discuss a European-wide government-financed construction project to stimulate job creation, a plan to create a link of high-speed rail lines across Europe in the next century. But nothing like the big government-sponsored work programs that Franklin D. Roosevelt created to reduce unemployment in the United States in the 1930's seems to be on the horizon.
In all, 3.3 million French workers are registered as unemployed, with as many as 2.2 million more driven off the labor rolls as big companies reduced payrolls in the quest for higher productivity and efficiency.
Mr. Chirac has asked government officials at all levels, as well as companies, to come up with fresh ideas for creating new jobs.
Rhone-Poulenc, the pharmaceutical and chemical giant based in Lyons, has cut back its employees based in France from 40,000 to 35,000 in recent years.
But Xavier Patrouillard, an official of the company, says it and other big companies in southeastern France have created a program to hire out experts in various fields to help smaller companies find niches in communities where the big ones have been closing plants.
"We decided that we couldn't prosper in a social desert," said Mr. Patrouillard, who oversees Rhone-Poulenc's contributions. "We can't just stay inside our factory walls nowadays. We have an obligation to help every company that can employ people to keep on doing so."
Mr. Patrouillard estimated that the initiative had created as many as 10,000 jobs in the region around Lyons over 17 years.
But a single French company, the automaker Renault, has eliminated 70,000 jobs around the country in the last 10 years. And, Mr. Patrouillard said, smaller European companies are now under just as much pressure as big ones are to keep costs down to stay competitive against East Asian and Eastern European economies where wages are a fraction of what they are here.
"For years, we thought there was nothing you could do about rising unemployment," said Jean-Herve Lorenzi, an economist in Paris who advised French Socialist Governments of the late 1980's and early 1990's.
Now, he says, part of the answer is to encourage the creation of part-time jobs, something most European governments and labor unions have taken a dim view of up to now.
"It's better to have work that isn't paid well, or is only temporary, than to have no work at all," Mr. Lorenzi said.
At their last gathering, in the German industrial town of Essen six months ago, European leaders agreed that welfare benefits should be scaled down if they were so high that they discouraged recipients from looking for new jobs.
In France, unemployment benefits start at 57 percent of a person's last gross paycheck, and are reduced automatically by 15 percent every four months. Eventually, they cease altogether and welfare kicks in, but many jobless people are reluctant to claim it.
Bruno Pinto, a 37-year-old French father of three in Rheims, last worked in 1991. "If my wife didn't work, I'd be out on the street now," he said. "You get so discouraged and demoralized that you lose your ability to work together with other people, to prepare and make reports, even to get up in the morning. Eventually, you become unemployable."
And even in Europe, some fall through gaps in the social safety net and drift into demoralization and homelessness.
"Many of these people need more than just job training -- they need to be taught the personal and interactive skills they never had or have forgotten because they've been cut off from others for so long," said Claude Potier, director of an association in the Lyons suburb of Vaulx-en-Velin that trains homeless people for jobs in the restaurant trade.

HEADLINE: Energy Department Research Is Defended by Outside Panel

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
With Congressional committees considering deep cuts in the Energy Department's research budget and some lawmakers suggesting that the whole agency be dismantled, the department today issued a report by outside experts who strongly defended its research programs.
The report's authors called the proposed budget cuts short-sighted, and said that a continuing program of broad energy research financed largely by the Federal Government was "essential to our nation's future well-being." 
 At the same time, the panel acknowledged that efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit would probably force reductions in the program, and it called for the agency to explore new ways to draw money from the private sector, perhaps by collecting royalties from companies that use new technologies developed through its research.
The report recommended that the agency try to reduce its program of civilian energy research by a relatively modest 15 percent without cutting the flow of money to scientists and engineers, a feat it suggested could be accomplished by managing the programs more efficiently and spending less money at the department's headquarters.
The energy experts, drawn from industry and academia, warned that cuts like those being considered in Congress would devastate a research program that already has shrunk to barely a quarter of its size in the 1970's, when skyrocketing world energy prices and oil shortages gave birth to the department and its extensive research programs.
At stake is $2.5 billion in research into projects including ones involving building insulation, manufacturing technology and transportation, as well as solar, wind, nuclear, coal, oil, gas and hydroelectric energy. The department also sponsors basic research into chemistry, physics, mathematics and the like. Of the research money, which accounts for about a third of the department's current budget, about a third goes into work in Government laboratories, a third to projects conducted by business and a third to studies by universities.
Last week, the House Science Committee's subcommittee on energy approved legislation that would cap the Energy Department's total research budget at about $4 billion in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. The proposed reductions included a cut of more than a billion dollars, to $1.4 billion, in the money for civilian energy research. (The department also finances military research, mostly involving nuclear weapons.)
Meanwhile, a task force of freshman Republicans in the House has announced a plan to eliminate the department altogether over the next three years, shifting many of its functions to other agencies and eliminating much of the Federal financing for civilian energy research.
The Energy Department has been marshaling its forces to oppose these plans, offering its own plan for streamlining the department and emphasizing the benefits from its program of basic research, the kind of risky, exotic research that even the biggest energy conglomerates do not often finance independently.
The report issued today was requested by Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary last September, before it became clear how drastically the Congress, now in Republican control, might cut the department's budget.
"I think this report should be required reading for a number of people who have taken a hatchet to this budget," Mrs. O'Leary said today.
The panel was headed by Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, author of "The Prize," a history of the oil industry.
He and other panel members defended the research programs against the view that they were unwarranted subsidies for corporations. Rather, they said, the programs offered important environmental and economic benefits for the nation as a whole.
"This isn't corporate welfare," said Mason Willrich, a former chief executive of P.G.&E. Enterprises, a subsidiary of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. "It is a partnership between Government and industry."
But the panel conceded that some large demonstration projects that dominated the research program in its early days, like the effort to make synthetic fuels from coal and oil shale, were misguided.
On the other hand, it said, many new technologies developed with Federal support, ranging from energy-efficient windows to extremely durable drilling bits for oil and gas wells, have produced billions of dollars in gains for energy producers and consumers alike.

HEADLINE: Adolph Lowe, 102, Economist Who Fled Hitler

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Adolph Lowe, an adviser to the Weimar Government in Germany in the 1920's and a professor of political economy at the New School for Social Research for nearly four decades, died in Wolfenbuttel, Germany, on June 3. He was 102.
One of a remarkable generation of Jewish intellectuals who immigrated to the United States in the 1930's and early 1940's, Professor Lowe was the last surviving member of the University in Exile, created in 1933 by the founders of the New School and the New York State Legislature expressly to snatch scholars like Professor Lowe from the jaws of fascism. 
 Professor Lowe was born in Stuttgart, a sleepy little city in southern Germany, in 1893. The son of a traveling salesman, he started out studying law, but the economic and political upheavals around the time of World War I turned him to economics and socialism. After that war Professor Lowe, armed with a doctorate, became an adviser to the ill-fated Weimar Government in the ministries of demobilization, labor and economics.
By the spring of 1933, when Hitler issued his first blacklist of "dangerous intellectuals," including Professor Lowe, the philosopher Paul Tillich and the sociologist Karl Mannheim, Professor Lowe had become a highly visible professor of economics at the University of Frankfurt with a large student following. His popularity was as much personal as political.
Diminutive and dynamic, Professor Lowe was an entertaining lecturer and avid amateur musician who frequently invited his students home for parties. His daughter Rachel Aubrey, a psychotherapist who lives in Manhattan, recalled that Professor Lowe regularly insisted that students who were having trouble finishing their dissertations live with his family until the task could be completed under his watchful eye.
Fleeing Frankfurt in the middle of the night just before the Nazis stripped Jews of their passports, the Lowe family went to Geneva and then England, where Professor Lowe spent the next half decade at the London School of Economics and the University of Manchester. In 1941, in the middle of the blitzkrieg, Professor Lowe finally accepted an invitation from Alvin Johnson, president of the New School, to come to New York.
Professor Lowe spent the rest of his career at the New School, where his broad, interdisciplinary approach to economics influenced several generations of students. "Lowe brought with him a tradition that saw no boundaries between economics, sociology and political science," said the economist Robert Heilbroner, the author of "The Worldly Philosophers." "Lowe was very impatient with artificial boundaries."
Initially an enthusiastic disciple of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist and patron saint of government management of the economy, Professor Lowe later became one of Keynesianism's early critics. He argued that the effort to turn economics into a predictive science was futile and that the evolution of a highly organized society could not be mapped out with mathematical models, large or small. In that insight, he anticipated the position that most economists had embraced by the mid-1980's.
Professor Lowe retired from the New School in 1978. After his wife, Beatrice, died in 1982, he moved back to Germany to live with a daughter, Hanna Lustig, who had settled in Wolfenbuttel with her family. Professor Lowe's retirement turned into something of a reconciliation with his past, Mrs. Aubrey said: he collected a clutch of honors from various German universities, continued to write and made many new contacts among young German liberals, including journalists, entertaining a steady stream of visitors until he was nearly 100.
In addition to his two daughters, Professor Lowe is survived by five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY'S BUDGET: THE IMPACT;
Budget's Pleasant Surprise: A Tax Cut

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
New Yorkers who own co-ops and condominiums will find a pleasant surprise in the budget agreement reached last night at City Hall: they will get a tax cut. So will business owners who pay a tax on their rent.
But residents who rely on the city for a variety of services and income supplements will have to make do with far less, to pay for those tax cuts and to fill a $3.1 billion gap in the budget. From hospitals to classrooms to welfare payments, the new budget, which still faces a full City Council vote, will force New Yorkers to change their expectations of what their city government will do for them. 
 Though Council leaders, in their final negotiations with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, were able to restore about $80 million to a group of programs that are among the city's most popular, that amount pales in comparison to the nearly $1.5 billion in spending cuts from last year's operating budget. The expected cuts were already enormous even before the state budget was approved last week, and their magnitude only grew when the state provided $670 million less than the city had asked for.
The biggest bright spot to emerge from the final negotiations involves capital spending for the school system. Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines had all but pleaded with City Hall to come up with money to repair school buildings with leaky roofs and to help expand schools suffering from severe overcrowding. Under yesterday's agreement, as part of the planned $2.3 billion sale of the city's water system to a public agency, the city will spend $200 million of the proceeds on school rehabilitation and construction, which Mr. Cortines said was his highest priority.
At the same time, though, the budget will cut $750 million from the Board of Education's projected general budget. Though the Mayor and Council leaders defend the cut as one the school system can absorb, the board will probably have to drop some counseling and after-school programs, and offer early retirement to thousands of teachers and administrators.
The budget will cut $400 million from Medicaid and welfare spending, mostly by reducing fees to hospitals. The Mayor's original budget in April estimated that $46 million could be saved by an intensive screening process to weed out fraudulent welfare claims. Late last week, the Mayor proposed saving another $100 million by even greater fraud detection methods, not yet specified. The money would be saved in the welfare programs for parents and able-bodied childless adults, as well as the Medicaid program.
Advocates for the poor had already questioned whether the original $46 million estimate was realistic, and said the new savings estimates, accepted with little argument by the Council's leadership, were unlikely to be achieved.
Council leaders, for their part, said there was little they could do to restore cuts in a year the budget gap loomed so large.
"It is unreasonable to expect that the City Council, the Mayor or anybody had an ability to substantially restore all of the monies that had to be cut without raising taxes," said Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the Council Finance Committee. "And raising taxes is inconsistent with the philosophy of the Mayor and the Council at a time when city is in a major recession."
A few of the Council's restorations were substantial. The Mayor had proposed cutting $20 million from recreational and educational programs for youth, and the Council put back $15 million of that. The Mayor had proposed cutting $18 million from the cultural affairs budget, reducing spending on major museums by 10 percent and on smaller institutions by 80 percent. The Council put back $13.3 million of that.
The Council was also able to restore $4 million of a proposed $4.8 million cut to private organizations that help the mentally ill.
But in most cases, the restorations were far more modest. The city will be cutting $75 million from the budget of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which administers the public hospital system that serves many poor and working-class New Yorkers. The council was able to restore only $1 million of that.
The Council was unable to alter the elimination of free subway and bus passes for schoolchildren, which will save $128 million. Nor could the council members block the elimination of monthly discount fares for private express buses.
Other last-minute cuts agreed to by the council and the Mayor include the following:
*Lowering the estimated number of people who will need residential drug treatment under the city and state's Home Relief welfare program, saving $2.5 million. This estimate was revised because the city is assuming that fewer people will qualify for the welfare program under newly tightened eligibility requirements.
*Hiring the police academy class of 1996 at one second before midnight on June 30, 1996, the last day of the fiscal year, effectively delaying the deployment of 1,700 new officers on the street by about a year. This maneuver saves $15.2 million in pension costs because under pension rules, the cadets are not considered to be hired until fiscal year 1997. But they would still qualify as 1996 hires under the Safe Streets Law, which would have to be amended to allow the procedure.
*Delaying a quarter of the repairs to recently noticed bridge problems, saving $1.2 million.
The agreement also anticipates reducing overtime by $3 million each for firefighters and corrections officers.

HEADLINE: Closed Talks Held on Saving Watersheds

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Over the objections of environmentalists, Gov. George E. Pataki's office has been mediating confidential talks between officials from New York City and a galaxy of small communities near the city's upstate reservoirs on keeping the watersheds clean without stifling local economic growth.
The goal, according to a statement issued by the Governor's office after the latest meeting, on Monday, is "a global settlement of all watershed issues" by mid-August. The city is under a mandate from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to protect the watersheds or face the need to build a multibillion-dollar filtration system. 
 Several participants said the meetings had for the first time created a quiet, politics-free zone in which the city and the dozens of village, town and county governments in the 2,000-square-mile region can discuss issues.
"The idea was to create a civil forum," said an official from the Governor's office who insisted on anonymity. "At first, this was Beirut. These are people who three months ago were at each others' throats. If we'd continued down that path I think New York would have ended up in violation of the E.P.A. mandates, and the watershed communities would've gotten nothing for all their troubles except a pile of legal bills."
But some people who have been excluded see the process as skewed toward the interests of Mr. Pataki's upstate constituency.
"There are no private citizens, no representatives of environmental or civic groups and, as far as I know, no Democrats," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has worked on watershed issues.
The chairman of the City Council Environmental Protection Committee, Stanley E. Michels, Democrat of Manhattan, said: "The City Council has played a leading role on the watershed issue for years. We have a lot to contribute to this process. We wrote a letter to the Governor asking to participate, but we've been turned down. It's very disturbing that on an issue that is so critical to the health and safety of the people of this city we don't know what is going on."
Several participants said the meetings began last month, shortly after the Federal Environmental Protection Agency had granted the city a six-month extension to draft long-term plans to protect the watersheds.
Late last year, in an effort to avoid the need for filtration, city officials presented a package of proposed regulations and actions to protect the watersheds, including buying 80,000 acres to form a buffer against development and spending more than $100 million to upgrade sewage plants that discharge waste water in the watersheds.
The proposal was delayed, because critical elements, including the land acquisitions, would have to be approved by state health and environmental agencies. And upstate communities remained suspicious.
The official from the Governor's office said the intent was to disentangle what had become an impossible nest of lawsuits. "There were already at least 10 suits," he said. "Everybody was suing everybody. That's not a way to resolve a problem."
In part, he said, the extension from the Environmental Protection Administration was a response to the Governor's plan to develop a schedule for resolving the disputes.
The goal of the meetings is to resolve the legal issues by the middle of August, said Michael Finnegan, the Governor's counsel and former law partner. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Finnegan said that a resolution of the legal issues would pave the way for a final plan to be presented to the E.P.A. by the agency's deadline of Sept. 15.
Mr. Finnegan said advocacy groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, had been briefed about the meetings. But, he added, it is important to keep the meetings confidential, so an open atmosphere can be maintained for resolving the longstanding disputes.
"We are doing our best to keep all the balls in the air and everybody talking," Mr. Finnegan said. "We want to keep everyone focused on what we all have an interest in, protecting the environment and water quality in a rational way that also protects the interests of the landowners in the watershed communities."
The schedule will "kick into high gear next week," Mr. Finnegan said, with two meetings planned each week for the next month or so.
He said that politicians including upstate mayors and New York City Council members had wanted to participate, but that attendance would for now be limited to lawyers and appointed officials with expertise about watershed issues.
Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., which has had representatives at many sessions, said, "We don't consider the meetings to be closed, in that we understand that the environmental groups are being kept informed of the progress of all the meetings."
The confidentiality, she added, "has allowed an open exchange of views in a nonconfrontational manner."
"We think," Ms. Mears said, "the meetings seem to be yielding some progress."

Weak Economic Data Send Treasury Prices Soaring

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday as retail sales fell short of expectations and the Consumer Price Index showed only a slight rise, adding fresh evidence of an economic slowdown and subdued inflation.
The gains caused interest rates to drop back to week-ago levels as a general optimism among traders about the prospects that the Federal Reserve would ease interest rates added to gains in bond prices throughout the day. 
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 27/32 points to a price of 1144/32 , for a yield of 6.54 percent, down from 6.70 percent on Monday. CS First Boston said the decline in the yield was the biggest drop since July 29, 1994.
Donald Fine, chief market strategist at Chase Securities, said the bond market's surge was certainly tied to the release of a Labor Department report showing an unthreatening three-tenths of 1 percent increase in the May Consumer Price Index and a Commerce Department report that retail sales rose by only two-tenths of 1 percent in May.
"Consumer spending is still sluggish," Mr. Fine said, "and while this is simply further confirmation of weak second-quarter growth, there was at the same time scant evidence in the report of any near-term improvement."
He said this would be a cause for concern at the Fed, but still expected the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to hold off any rate cut at its July 5-6 meeting. Mr. Fine said the Fed would probably wait until Aug. 22 before initiating a rate cut, to examine more data before reaching firm conclusions on the economy's course in the second half of the year.
He continued that while the bond market was back nearly to levels of a week ago, its tone was much more optimistic. "The surge after the payroll number last week was a euphoric event," he said, "but nevertheless doubts about weakness began creeping in. The numbers today removed those doubts. But these numbers are in no way indicative of a recession. Slow economic growth, yes, but declining economic growth, no."
In separate reports on regional activity, the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond lent further weight to indications of a cooling of economic activity. The Atlanta Fed said its index of regional manufacturing was little changed at minus 21.5 in May, compared with minus 22.1 in April. The Richmond Fed said manufacturers reported lower inflation as business sagged.
Traders said this data erased a lot of doubt in investors' minds about whether the economy was weakening, and again confirmed that inflation was under control.
Good levels of overseas interest and statements by some Fed officials also lent support to bond prices. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Cathy E. Minehan, a voting member of the Open Market Committee, told Dow Jones that she still believed the economy was on a path for a soft landing this year and did not expect a recession in 1995. Growth should be about 2.5 percent by year-end, she said, helped by lower rates, income and export growth, and low unemployment.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said yesterday's retail sales report validated forecasts of a second-quarter gross domestic product report showing no growth. "Without an increase in demand from the consumer, inventory levels will become more of a problem," Mr. Alexy said. "This will lead to additional cuts in orders, production and jobs."
In the corporate bond market yesterday, the Tennessee Valley Authority doubled the size of its global offering to $2 billion amid strong investor demand even as corporations pumped out new bond issues.
When the 10-year noncallable bonds are priced today, it will be the largest global bond sale by a Government agency or Government-sponsored agency, said David Smith, T.V.A.'s chief financial officer.
The issue is expected to be priced to yield 30 to 33 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note with a 6.50 percent coupon due in 2005. By late yesterday, the 10-year Treasury was priced to yield 6.11 percent.
Traders said Chase Manhattan was also active yesterday, pricing for sale $1.365 billion in floating-rate, asset-backed securities. The asset-backed deal was the bank's largest.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally on Expectations of Interest Rate Cut by the Fed

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
A crop of conflicting economic data hit the financial markets yesterday, but stocks and especially bonds rallied, as traders interpreted the reports to mean the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates, perhaps as early as next month.
The stock market has now recovered nearly all of last week's losses. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.05 points yesterday, to 4,484.51, not far from the 4,485.20 record set on June 6. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.17 points, to a record 536.05, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 6.25 points to 894.23, also a record. 
 The real challenge, analysts said, would be the rest of the week when the release of more economic data, like industrial production, and the "triple witching" quarterly expiration of stock options on Friday are sure to add to trading volatility.
The bond market rallied even more than stocks yesterday, helping to fuel the stock rally as corporate borrowing costs fell lower. Bond prices rose sharply and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond tumbled to 6.54 percent from 6.70 percent.
But the reports that prompted the stock and bond rallies were far from unambiguous. As many Wall Street economists expected, the Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in May, indicating that inflation was tame. Moreover, retail sales increased just two-tenths of 1 percent in May, even weaker than expected. Both reports supported the argument that the Fed may cut interest rates later this year to spur a flagging economy.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, though, said its May national production index, a measure of manufacturing activity, rose for the first time since January. And on Monday, the Semiconductor Industry Association said its book-to-bill ratio, a measure of demand, hit a level not seen in nearly a decade. Both reports, by signaling growth, undermined the argument for an imminent rate cut by the Fed.
Whatever the case, some analysts said that bond traders appeared to be betting on too large a Fed cut. All Treasury bills with a maturity of 12 months or less are trading for less than the 6 percent Federal funds rates -- as little as 5.55 percent for 12-month bills. That implies a rate cut by the Fed of half a percentage point or more.
"If the Fed eases as much as the bond market is betting, the dollar would go to hell in a handbasket," said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist for C. H. Dean & Associates, which manages $4 billion in stocks and bonds. "Traders would flee and you'd see the dollar at 55 yen." The yen closed yesterday in New York at 84.60 yen, up from 84.04 yen.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.62 points, to 288.18, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining issues 1,611 to 753. Big Board volume totaled 340.2 million shares, slightly more than this year's daily average of 332 million shares. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.09 points, to 491.41.
Among advancing stocks, shares of First Financial Management, a credit-card processor, rose 7 1/4, to 84, after First Data announced a $6.6 billion acquisition bid for the company. First Data's shares fell 1/4, to 56 5/8.
Shares of ITT jumped 5 5/8, to 114 7/8, after the conglomerate announced a plan to split itself into three publicly traded companies.
Among declining stocks, shares of Turbochef, an oven manufacturer, fell 3 3/4, to 12 3/4. Fruit of the Loom dropped 3 1/2, to 23 5/8, after the company's management said second-quarter earnings would not meet Wall Street estimates.
The most active stock, at 6.7 million shares, was Intel, which fell 9/16 , to 111, after rising for much of the year.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A sunny forecast for ad spending grows even brighter.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
SLOWDOWN, schmodown. The leading forecaster of advertising spending has again revised upward his already optimistic projections for this year and issued an initial assessment for 1996 that is equally rosy.
"Despite a lot of negative rhetoric" about the potential for a weakening national economy, "the media marketplace is still very firm and expanding," said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson USA in New York. 
 "The biggest advertisers are spending aggressively," he added. "Demand is very strong."
Mr. Coen spoke yesterday at a seminar sponsored by McCann and its parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies, at the University Club in Manhattan. This was the 22d annual midyear forecast for ad spending by Mr. Coen, who has been tracking marketing and media trends for 47 years and offers his predictions in June and December.
A year ago, Mr. Coen estimated that ad spending in the United States in 1995 would total $157.7 billion. In December, he revised that estimate to $159 billion. Now, he said in his presentation, the total is likely to reach $161.9 billion. That would be 7.9 percent higher than his final figure for 1994, which was $150 billion.
The increase for 1995 is "really outstanding," Mr. Coen said, "particularly on top of the strong gain we had in 1994." Spending last year grew 8.7 percent from $138.1 billion in 1993.
Ad spending is often considered an indictor of economic health because marketers will raise or lower the amounts of money they budget to pitch products depending on their gauging of consumer moods.
"The outlook for national advertising is much stronger than I thought," Mr. Coen said. "I'm now getting reports saying I was a little too conservative" in December.
Mr. Coen was once almost always bullish on ad spending, often issuing estimates higher than the data later proved. But he has tempered that ebullience since the recession in 1990.
"This year, I think he's right," said James D. Dougherty, who follows the agency industry for Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. "He's got the numbers."
Last year and this year are "the best two-year period in the U.S. advertising business in 10 years," added Mr. Dougherty, who attended the presentation. "And this recovery is in place well into 1996."
Indeed, Mr. Coen, in his first pass at predicting 1996, estimated ad spending at $175 billion, up 8 percent from his new estimate for this year. It should be "a pretty good year," he said, because of increased demand from Presidential election advertising and the heightened interest in the Summer Olympics because they are being held in this country for the first time since 1984.
Mr. Coen said he had raised his forecast for 1995 largely because of data for the first quarter indicating that the full year would be better than he anticipated. For instance, in the largest consumer product categories, many advertisers increased spending "on top of unbelievably strong gains in the first quarter of 1994," he said, citing spending by food advertisers in magazines, up 40 percent, and spending by automobile advertisers in spot, or nonnetwork, television, up 23 percent.
And in smaller product categories, there were also strong gains. Spending on cigarettes, for example, was up 32 percent in magazines, while spending on computers was up 778 percent in spot television.
National ad spending in the United States will end the year at $94.62 billion, he added, a gain of 8.4 percent, well above the 6.8 percent increase he estimated in December. In the first quarter, in nine categories of national media, five enjoyed double-digit percentage gains, including cable television, up 16.5 percent, and spot radio, up 23 percent.
Local ad spending in the United States will be $67.24 billion for the year, Mr. Coen said, up 7.2 percent. That compares with the 7.1 percent increase he estimated in December. Mr. Coen described himself as "a little bit more cautious about newspaper assumptions" than about other local media because gains during the first quarter in retail newspaper advertising were smaller than he had estimated.
For 1995 ad spending overseas, Mr. Coen forecast a total of $193.4 billion, up 8.4 percent from his final figure of $178.4 billion in 1994. Here, too, Mr. Coen has raised his predictions; a year ago, he projected an overseas total of $181.9 billion for 1995, which he raised to $186.7 billion in December.
Mr. Coen cited strong growth in large ad markets like Britain, France and Germany; double-digit percentage gains in emerging ad markets like China, and satisfactory growth in sluggish ad markets like Canada and Japan.
All that would result in total worldwide ad spending for 1995 of $355.3 billion, up 8.2 percent from $328.4 billion in 1994.
For 1996, Mr. Coen's initial estimate of overseas ad spending is $210 billion. Adding his estimate of $175 billion for ad spending in the United States would produce a 1996 worldwide total of $385 billion, up 8 percent from the 1995 estimate of $355.3 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Reports of Clinton Budget Plan Encourage Buying of Dollars

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday, rebounding from early losses and helped by expectations that President Clinton would provide details on a plan to balance the Federal budget in 10 years.
Currency traders said they were encouraged in anticipation of the President's speech last night, after the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said Mr. Clinton would offer "specifics on how to achieve the goal" of a balanced budget, including ways to limit health care spending. 
 Amy Smith, senior currency-market strategist at the consulting firm IDEA, said "the dollar got its biggest boost when Clinton announced he's going to come out with his own balanced budget." That shows "he's getting on board and not being an obstructionist," she said.
Reducing and eventually eliminating the budget deficit would help the dollar by presumably bolstering bond prices as the Treasury reduced the amount of debt required to cover Federal expenditures.
"The dollar is very sensitive to the future economic plan of the United States Government," said David De Rosa of the Swiss Bank Corporation. "Anything that looks like fiscal responsibility tends to give support to the dollar."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4088 German marks from 1.4033 marks on Monday. It traded at 84.60 yen, up from 84.04.
The dollar's value was also buoyed by a continuing notion that the Federal Reserve and other central banks might try another round of dollar-buying before leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations meet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, starting tomorrow.
When the Group of Seven met in April, finance ministers and central bankers from the seven nations -- the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany, France, Canada and Italy -- pledged to work together to bolster the sagging dollar. On May 31, the Fed and other central banks demonstrated that commitment with a concerted bout of dollar buying that increased the American currency's exchange value.
Earlier yesterday, the dollar slumped in Asia and Europe amid renewed speculation that the Fed might soon cut interest rates, a move that tends to make dollar-denominated assets less attractive. The speculation apparently came in response to remarks Sunday by the White House chief of staff, Leon Panetta, who urged the Fed to cut rates to promote growth.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Didn't Win the Cold War by Itself

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Who's an Isolationist?" (Op-Ed, June 6): I agree with Senator Bob Dole that President Clinton's claims that Congress is undermining his authority in foreign policy are unfair. However, many of Senator Dole's other remarks are inaccurate and misleading. 
 First of all, Senator Dole and other Republicans should give up the absurd idea that they single-handedly won the cold war in spite of Democratic opposition. The Soviet Union collapsed because of inherent weaknesses in the Communist system. Gigantic defense budgets did nothing to the Soviet Union that they did not do to the United States; the difference was that our economy was strong enough to absorb the costs and the Soviet Union's economy was not.
And Republicans should certainly not brag of unnecessary nuclear arms buildup or support of human rights abusers like the so-called freedom fighters of Nicaragua.
Senator Dole also supports the myth that the President has gutted defense spending. He accuses the Administration of "slashing" the defense budget over the past five years.
Actually, Mr. Clinton's budgets have averaged approximately $25 billion less than those at the end of the cold war. These savings are just a fraction of the huge increases that were said to be necessary to fight Communism. The United States defense budget remains more than five times higher than its nearest competitor's. It is clear that the military is in no danger.
Republicans should stop distorting these facts, and should also stop attacking the foreign aid system. While all should fight abuses in the system, it should not be destroyed.
If used correctly, foreign aid can help us to prevent and respond to catastrophes, creating a more stable world. Our leaders should remember that this is vital to every nation's interest. Despite its power, the United States is no exception.

HEADLINE: 101,000 Layoffs Are More Than 'Sobering'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Payrolls Trimmed by 101,000 in May" (front page, June 3) is loaded with employer-biased language that obscures the real impact of the widespread layoffs it reports. 
 The article's first sentence says it all: "In the most sobering evidence so far of the economy's abrupt slowdown, employers lopped 101,000 workers from payrolls in May, the biggest monthly decline since the end of the last recession."
"Sobering" is an interesting word choice here, accurate no doubt for employers faced with the burden of signing pink slips, but perhaps wide of the mark for the 101,000 workers who suddenly found themselves unemployed. "Devastating" might more accurately describe their impression of the "evidence," while "alarming" might better serve for the millions of other workers who find that their jobs are increasingly at risk.
"Lopping" a payroll is not akin to pruning a tree, nor is "trimming" a payroll akin to dieting away flab. Your readers well understand that such terms are euphemisms for that singular, personal and brutal form of economic slowdown known as layoffs.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET;
Clinton's Statement on Plan to Balance Federal Budget by 2005

 BODY:
Following is President Clinton's statement last night on balancing the Federal budget, as recorded by The New York Times:
Good evening. Tonight I present to the American people a plan for a balanced Federal budget. My plan cuts spending by $1.1 trillion. It does not raise taxes. It won't be easy but elected leaders of both parties agree with me that we must do this and we will. 
 We're at the edge of a new century, living in a period of rapid and profound change, and we must do everything in our power to help our people build good and decent lives for themselves and their children.
These days working people can't keep up no matter how hard they work one, two, even three jobs. Without the education to get good jobs, they can't make it in today's America. I don't want my daughter's generation to be the first generation of Americans to do worse than their parents.
Now balancing our budget can help to change that, if we do it in a way that reflects our values and what we care about the most: our children, our families and what we leave the generations to come. That's why my budget has five fundamental priorities.
First, because our most important mission is to help people make the most of their own lives, don't cut education.
Second, balance the budget by controlling health care costs, strengthening Medicare and saving Medicaid, not by slashing health services for the elderly.
Third, cut taxes for the middle class and not the wealthy. We shouldn't cut education or Medicare just to make room for a tax cut for people who don't really need it.
Fourth, cut welfare but save enough to protect children and move able-bodied people from welfare to work.
Fifth, don't put the brakes on so fast that we risk our economic prosperity.
This can be a turning point for us. For 12 years our Government -- Congress and the White House -- ducked the deficit and pretended we could get something for nothing. In my first two years as President, we turned this around and cut the deficit by one-third. Now let's eliminate it. It's time to clean up this mess. Here's how:
First, I propose to cut spending in discretionary areas other than defense by an average of 20 percent, except education. I want to increase education not cut it. We'll continue to cut waste. Under Vice President Gore's leadership we're already cutting hundreds of programs and thousands of regulations and 270,000 Federal positions. We'll still be able to protect the environment and invest in technology and medical research for things like breast cancer and AIDS, but make no mistake: in other areas there will be big cuts, and they'll hurt.
Second, we should limit tax cuts to middle-income people, not upper-income people, and target the tax cuts to help Americans pay for college like we did with the G.I. Bill after World War II. Let's help a whole new generation of Americans go to college -- that's the way to make more Americans upper-income people in the future.
Third, don't cut Medicare services to the elderly. Instead of cutting benefits, maintain them by lowering costs, crack down on fraud and abuse, provide more home care, incentives for managed care, respite benefits for families of Alzheimer's patients and free mammograms.
 
Insurance Ideas
 For all Americans I propose the freedom to take your insurance with you when you change jobs, to keep it longer after you lose a job, insurance coverage even if there are pre-existing conditions in your family and lower-cost insurance for groups of self-employed and small-business people. If we don't have tax cuts for upper-income people, as Congressional leaders have proposed, we won't need to make harsh cuts in health care or in education.
Finally, balance the budget in 10 years. It took decades to run up this deficit; it's going to take a decade to wipe it out.
Now mind you, we could do it in seven years, as Congressional leaders propose, but the pain we'd inflict on our elderly, our students and our economy just isn't worth it. My plan will cut the deficit year after year. It will balance the budget without hurting our future.
This budget proposal is very different from the two passed by the House and the Senate, and there are fundamental differences between Democrats and Republicans about how to balance the budget. But this debate must go beyond partisanship, it must be about what's good for America and which approach is more likely to bring prosperity and security to our people over the long run. We ought to approach it in the same spirit of openness and civility which we felt when the Speaker and I talked in New Hampshire last Sunday.
There are those who have suggested that it might actually benefit one side or the other politically if we had gridlock and ended this fiscal year without a budget. But that would bad for our country and we have to do everything we can to avoid it. If we'll just do what's best for our children, our future and our nation and forget about who gets the political advantage we won't go wrong.
Good night; let's get to work.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. and Japan Told to Solve Trade Dispute

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
When the World Trade Organization opened its doors in Geneva early this year, it was billed as the powerful new global referee that would rule on trade disputes that once bogged down in the old international trade bureaucracy. But the new head of the organization made it clear today that he would prefer not to have the battle between Washington and Tokyo over auto trade become the first test of his group's legal powers.
Urging the United States and Japan to settle their trade dispute quickly, Renato Ruggiero, the organization's Director General, issued a bluntly worded warning during an hourlong interview with reporters here. He called the argument over access to Japan's automobile and auto parts market "a delicate matter with nationalist implications" in each country. 
 Mr. Ruggiero, for all his tough talk, seemed eager to avoid being forced to issue a ruling in the claims and counterclaims of what has become one of the most contentious trade disputes in recent years. "There are legal considerations and then there are political considerations," said Mr. Ruggiero, a longtime European diplomat and former trade minister of Italy. "I much prefer to have this resolved in discussions than to reach a legalistic ruling."
[Mr. Ruggiero's comments came a day before Japan's chief trade official, Ryutaro Hashimoto, announced in Tokyo early Wednesday that Japan and the United States would resume their stalled talks on automotive trade on June 22 and 23 in Geneva. The talks would follow quickly on the heels of this week's summit meeting of the seven big industrialized democracies and would be less than a week before 100 percent punitive tariffs are scheduled to go into effect on $5.9 billion of Japanese luxury cars. Washington's insistence that Japanese car makers agree to purchase more American parts has been a stumbling block, but Japan will go to the talks in Geneva with a "completely open mind," Mr. Hashimoto said.]
Mr. Ruggiero's comments also raised a fundamental question about the future of the new trade organization: should it be more akin to a Supreme Court of economic conflict between nations -- issuing rulings and creating precedents -- or should it act as a political tool to help bring countries to the negotiating table?
Clearly, American officials who were involved in writing the rules for the new organization to replace the more loosely structured General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, envisioned a court-like institution whose rulings would be binding on more than 120 nations. But Mr. Ruggiero's view is more typical of the old school of trade politics, under which a pragmatic settlement is far more satisfactory that a precedent-setting ruling.
Just why is Mr. Ruggiero so interested in keeping the United States-Japan dispute from reaching a panel of W.T.O. judges? The reason, say many American and Asian officials, is that he fears that the argument between the two countries could smother the fledgling organization in its infancy. "He's afraid the W.T.O. will be trampled," said one American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Worse yet, he's afraid that Japan or the U.S. could ignore the rulings, even though everyone has indicated they will abide by them."
So far both Japan and the United States have refused to budge on the major issues.
Mr. Ruggiero was also implicitly critical of the United States for insisting on more concessions from other nations before signing on to a worldwide agreement on trade in financial services. That is an industry the United States dominates, and remains one of the sectors where it enjoys a surplus with its major trading partners. Asian countries have been reluctant to agree to allow American companies to claim a larger share of their domestic securities and insurance industries.
The issue was so controversial that it was split off in December 1993 from the rest of the GATT accord. The deadline for a separate agreement on financial services expires on June 30, and the Administration has said that it will revoke preferential trade status for many countries in that sector if it is not satisfied with the results by that date.
Mr. Ruggiero met today with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin but was unable to persuade him to sign the financial services accord quickly and seek more access to foreign markets in the next round of negotiations, scheduled for four years from now. Rebuffed by the Administration, Mr. Ruggiero promised to try to persuade Asian countries to improve their offering of market openings, in hopes of winning over American support for the accord.
More broadly, Mr. Ruggiero expressed fears that the United States was "no longer confident" about its leadership on international economic issues or about relying on multilateral institutions, including the World Trade Organization, to solve its problems with trading partners. He made no specific reference to the American decision to seek unilateral sanctions against Japan while also pursuing a complaint against the country within the W.T.O., but that seemed to be what was on his mind.
Washington is also concerned that the W.T.O. might rule in Tokyo's favor, siding with its claim that the United States is proposing to raise car tariffs that it had agreed to limit as part of the global trade pact.
"I see the U.S. almost defending itself from the system you have created," he said. "Now there is a feeling that these institutions take something out of your influence and power."

HEADLINE: Tackling New York City's Deficit

 BODY:
This has been a year of budget combat at all levels of government, so it is startling to see Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the City Council actually reaching agreement on New York City's fiscal crisis. The accord that was negotiated by these two longtime antagonists looks as if it will blunt the most severe cuts in municipal services that the Mayor warned might be necessary. But it also appears to resort to some traditional budget gimmicks while overlooking alternative savings that should have been considered.
Mr. Giuliani deserves credit for recognizing the need for bold steps to close the city's $3 billion deficit. But the solutions he offered originally involved an unnecessarily harsh dose of cutbacks in services, especially for the poor, disabled and young. The Council has wisely resisted many of the cuts as dangerous and likely to lead to increased expenses down the road. 
 To his credit, the Mayor appears now to have accepted the Council's appeal to look again at the revenue side of the ledger. Mr. Giuliani has unfortunately rejected a sound proposal from the Council Speaker, Peter Vallone, for tax increases for some single-family homes, now taxed relatively lightly. But the accord with the Council does scale back Mr. Giuliani's proposed tax cuts for the next year.
Unfortunately, neither the City Council nor the Mayor could summon the will to demand more cuts in the police and fire departments, which have been largely spared since Mr. Giuliani took office. With the work force shrinking in so many other areas, the Mayor should have been willing to seek an amendment in state law to permit economies through use of civilians in desk jobs while retaining patrol force on the streets at its current level.
In like fashion, the Fire Department and other agencies could also demand changes in work rules, staffing requirements, overtime agreements and other practices to enable a reduced work force to deliver the same services and safety to the public.
The agreement between the Mayor and the Council is a disappointment in terms of achieving greater productivity in the work force. Mr. Giuliani has been too timid, at least in public, about demanding that the city's employees show greater flexibility and even sacrifice in the face of cuts that would damage the city where they work and, for the most part, live. As we have said before, hundreds of millions of dollars could be realized by limiting the open-ended health benefits for municipal employees. Negotiations with the municipal labor leaders need to be stepped up now that the Council and the Mayor have settled some of their own spending issues.
It is disturbing that the Council and the Mayor will rely on perhaps $500 million in gimmicks to balance the budget, including one-time-only revenues, sales of assets and newly optimistic budget assumptions. These are a potential recipe for trouble down the road, especially if the new budget projections do not pan out. Once again, Mayor Giuliani and the City Council have engaged in the kind of budget practice that has enabled generations of political leaders to postpone tough budget decisions while widening the deficits in each succeeding year.
The only justification for using one-shot revenues is to avoid the extreme hardship of absorbing the needed budget cuts in a single year. The one-shots buy time for a more orderly scaling down in the size of government. We welcome the objective of finding alternatives to painful budget cuts, but the city's fiscal monitors should scrutinize the latest budget accord to make sure that any use of such gimmicks is accompanied by a serious commitment and financial plan showing how the city will reduce the size and cost of government over time. Only with such a sustained approach and demand for sacrifice by everyone can the city hope to climb out of its chronic deficits in the next few years.

Perot Is Here to Stay

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Ross Perot, Yet Again" (editorial, June 6) states that the United We Stand America conference is not about issues but about Mr. Perot. It also suggests that political leaders are somehow catering to him by consenting to address thousands of United We Stand America members at the Dallas convention center. It is a super-cynical editorial that lowers the stature of your newspaper. 
 Mr. Perot and United We Stand are nothing but vitally interested in the issues that affect our country. Mr. Perot became a national figure in the last Presidential election with the same issues that he and United We Stand have continued to fight for to this day.
They are the same issues that a majority of the nation is intensely interested in -- a balanced budget, debt reduction, term limits, lobbyist reform, campaign finance reform and economic policies that lead to more jobs for our citizens. More than anyone else, he brought the absolute need for debt reduction to the attention of the electorate.
Your editorial does not focus on the fact that Mr. Perot has invited all members of United We Stand and also John and Jane Q. Public to this three-day conference on "Preparing Our Country for the 21st Century."
As one who will attend, I regard it as a "renaissance weekend" for the common people, with prominent speakers at interesting seminars and the opportunity to hear directly from the nation's political leaders. If there is any catering by the Presidential candidates, it is because they will have the attention of thousands of independent voters who keep up with everything that Congress is doing and who will be a sure bet to cast their ballots in the next election.
Despite the attempts of political attack dogs and the media to trash Ross Perot, he is still a significant national figure and will continue to be one. It is to be hoped that you can accept that fact, get over it and quit trying to suggest that he and United We Stand shouldn't have the same privilege of being addressed by political leaders at a national conference too.

HEADLINE: Illegal Migrants' Road West Crosses Old East Bloc

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: ZAKOPANE, Poland

 BODY:
On a recent Saturday morning, some three score residents of this picturesque mountain community assembled at the ski jump for a trip to the United States, first by bus to Germany, then on Lufthansa across the Atlantic.
They included a grandmother and her 3-year-old grandchild, a mother and her three children, several unemployed women in their 20's, and a few men in their 70's. Each had paid at least $6,000. 
 They had paid the money as sponsors of a local sports club and were accompanying the national weight-lifting team to a competition in Chicago -- or so their documents said.
But the only thing these people were sponsoring was their own entry into the United States. No sports team was going to Chicago or anywhere else.
It was all organized by the chairman of the club, who had been successful in the past in getting Poles without valid visas into the United States, said two people who signed up for the most recent attempt. This time, though, an alert immigration officer at the airport in Frankfurt, Germany, suspected that the American visas were forgeries, which they turned out to be, Polish and American law enforcement officials said. The immigrants were sent home.
This is not an isolated case by any means. It is, rather, part of a growing phenomenon -- trafficking in illegal immigrants from and through Eastern and Central Europe.
Immigrants from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and from Africa and the Middle East are being smuggled to the West, moved along routes that have developed since Communism fell and with it, the rigid border controls. They are being moved in many ways, among them freight-hauling trucks, the ceilings of trains and ship containers.
What worries law enforcement officials most is that international criminal syndicates are increasingly getting involved in illegal immigration. "There are tangible indicators that the smugglers of stolen automobiles and illicit narcotics have decided to diversify their portfolio to include alien smuggling," Thomas Tass, a Canadian immigration official, wrote in a paper he delivered recently to a conference in Budapest.
"These organizations should not be underestimated in their ability to move thousands of people illegally from one country to another while earning huge profits with minimum risk," said Mr. Tass, who is based in Warsaw and is considered the leading regional authority on this issue.
Smuggling people fits well into an organized crime conglomerate. A desperate alien who cannot afford the fee may be allowed to go in exchange for carrying drugs, and the immigrant will be expected to work for the gang in the United States or Europe as a prostitute or a drug dealer to pay back the money, law enforcement officials said.
As for profits, the organizer of the weight lifters' tour, 35-year-old Stefan Koziol, took in nearly $400,000, said two women in the group, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Koziol is now in jail on charges of fraud. He has not been charged with smuggling people, which is not a crime in Poland and only a minor offense in most European countries. Polish authorities declined to allow him to be interviewed, but he has told Polish newspapers that he is innocent. The club "sponsors" have not been charged.
The International Center for Migration Policy Development, a nonprofit intergovernmental organization in Vienna, has calculated that illegal immigration syndicates in Europe raked in between $100 million and $1.1 billion in 1993.
The wide range in the estimate is a reflection of how little is known about the problem, the gravity of which is only beginning to register. Interpol, the international police organization, has no coordinated campaigns in this area, immigration officials and diplomats said. The funds the European Union has made available for economic restructuring in Eastern and Central Europe can be used to combat drug trafficking, but not trafficking in illegal immigrants, said Tamas Kiss, who works for the Migration Policy Center.
Not surprisingly, the traffickers have been successful in staying ahead of the ill-trained local police, who are inexperienced in dealing with this problem.
"It is like drugs -- there are routes," said Col. Attila Krisan, spokesman for Hungary's Border Guards, which seized nearly 15,000 illegal immigrants last year, from scores of countries, who were trying to move through Hungary.
Common European entry points for refugees from Asia, from the Middle East and from Africa are Romania and Bulgaria, which have more lenient visa requirements and weaker law enforcement than other countries in the region.
Earlier this year, somewhere in Romania, 60 Bangladeshis were loaded into the back of a long canvas-covered truck, which was hauling tomato paste to Germany. The truck successfully crossed into Hungary and in several hours reached Slovakia. There, customs officials lifted the cover and were shocked to find people. The men were heading for the West to find jobs and had paid between $2,500 and $4,000 apiece to a trafficker.
Bulgaria has become a popular entry point because Balkan Airlines has extensive routes to the third world and relatively low fares, said a report last year by the International Organization for Migration, an independent research organization based in Geneva.
In Bulgaria, trafficking gangs charge up to $4,000 per person to move the immigrants westward, often along routes used by drug traffickers. "Operating these organized channels is a profitable occupation and is often part of a larger 'Mafia-style' operation," the report says.
For illegal Asian immigrants, the Chinese restaurants that have sprung up in Eastern European capitals provide a cover. They provide the immigrants with work permits, which get them into the country. After working for a while, they move on, to Germany, and in many cases to the United States, law enforcement officials said.
"The raison d'etre for these businesses goes beyond providing alternative menus" for local residents, Mr. Tass, the Canadian immigration official, noted wryly at the conference in Budapest.
He told of one Chinese restaurant in Prague that employed more than 800 people. "Even more remarkable was the fact that the restaurant had only eight tables," Mr. Tass said. He told of another "very elegant and modern Chinese five-star restaurant smack in the middle of an industrial blue-collar working-class area," and without any parking.
Another growing gateway to the West is through the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Immigrants who move through these countries, including large numbers from the impoverished former Soviet republics of Central Asia, then travel by sea to Scandinavia.
Many of the immigrants reach the Baltic countries via Moscow.
Last year, 64 Kurds and Pakistanis, including 26 children, were discovered in a sealed container on a car ferry from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm.
Last December, a Latvian ship with more than 100 Iraqis, Afghans and Palestinians, who had paid $5,000 a piece, ran aground off the coast of Estonia.
In late May, the Polish police detained 49 Asians, including 10 children, who had made it to the Baltic lands, then crossed from Lithuania into Poland, where their luck ran out.
Moscow has become a major transit center for migrants from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and former Soviet Republics in Central Asia. By train, bus or plane, they move west to Poland and the Czech Republic, and then on to the West.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: SEEKING COMMON GROUND;
Clinton Team And G.O.P. Debate Deficit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
A day after President Clinton issued his own plan to balance the Federal budget, his emissaries met Republican leaders on Capitol Hill today to explore the prospects for a compromise plan to erase the deficit.
To the astonishment of some and the sputtering frustration of many Democrats in Congress, the two sides ended the session with an arm's-length embrace and agreed to continue talking. Still, it was not clear where those talks might lead. 
 The Republicans, in the thick of final preparations for their own budget, said they would immediately study details of Mr. Clinton's plan and consider incorporating its most attractive features into their blueprint -- that is, if they found any.
"We're going to take a look and see how real it is," the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, said. For now, he added, "the only thing that looks attractive to me is that he said he wants to balance the Federal budget."
Speaker Newt Gingrich went further, saying some parts of Mr. Clinton's proposal were "eminently worth looking at."
For his part, the President said that talking compromise might not be good politics, but that he had to put the national interest above political gain. Given Mr. Clinton's good faith, said the President's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, "there would surely be some give-and-take in the discussion" to come.
The hourlong meeting, in the office of the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, brought Mr. Dole, Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Kasich and Senator Pete V. Domenici, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, face-to-face with Leon E. Panetta, the President's chief of staff, and Alice M. Rivlin, his budget director.
Mr. Kasich said Mr. Panetta had assured Republicans that the President's budget-balancing plan, which would cut $1.1 trillion from projected Federal spending and $111 billion from Federal taxes over the next 10 years, was serious and real.
Republicans are combining the House and Senate's budget proposals into a single Congressional plan this week. Both Republican plans would eliminate the deficit in seven years, rather than 10, and envision tax cuts totaling as much as $353 billion over that span.
Both the White House and Democrats in Congress had maintained for months that setting a fixed date to erase the deficit was arbitrary and potentially damaging to the economy, and that balancing the budget was impossible without a complete overhaul of health care.
Most Republicans praised Mr. Clinton today for setting aside those positions. Mr. Gingrich praised the President's "statesmanship" in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce of the United States; Mr. Dole said Mr. Clinton was acting responsibly.
But many in Mr. Clinton's own party were stunned and outraged by a reversal that recently seemed inconceivable, and that they viewed as robbing them of their most potent political weapon on Capitol Hill.
In a private meeting of the House's Democrats this morning, one Democrat in attendance said, White House officials sat silently as the legislators repeatedly accused the President of abandoning and double-crossing them. The Democrats accused Mr. Clinton of casting his party's fortunes to the winds, in a nationally broadcast speech on the budget, for the sake of his own political survival. "The message a lot of members got was, 'You're on your own,' " a Democratic legislator said after the session. "The word 'betrayal' came up three times, from three different members."
Another Democrat, a veteran on the party's left flank, likened the post-speech situation of the House's Democrats to that of Capt. Scott F. O'Grady, the American airman who spent six days last week surrounded by the enemy in Bosnia, eating bugs and grass to survive. "The difference between House Democrats and Captain O'Grady," he said, "is that Captain O'Grady had allies."
One legislator, who refused to be named, said he had never seen the House's Democrats so angry at Mr. Clinton. Several others said the President's move may backfire by prompting a challenge in next year's Presidential primaries from the party's left flank.
There was some acknowledgment, now that Democrats had digested their anger overnight, that Mr. Clinton's action might actually prove good for the country, if it led to a serious bipartisan effort to rein in Federal overspending.
But that was overwhelmed by the belief among members and some strategists that the Democrats had only two effective weapons against the Republican ascendancy -- the arguments that their policies would wreak havoc on the elderly and the less privileged -- and that Mr. Clinton had now given both away.
"By reacting to everything the Republicans do, it's a sure way to fail," said Representative Donald M. Payne of New Jersey, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. "There are many people who are wondering, do we have a partnership going here or is the White House just moving out on its own course?"
Mr. Panetta and Ms. Rivlin met with some House and Senate Democratic leaders to brief them on the session with the Republicans. Later the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, issued a statement maintaining that Mr. Clinton's plan "shows again that there is a better way to balance the budget than crippling Medicare and Medicaid," among other programs targeted by Republicans.
But, in fact, Democrats appeared to recoil most at Mr. Clinton's own proposal to reduce the growth of the Medicare program, a pillar of Democratic policy rooted in the party's 1960's heyday. It is now among the largest and fastest-growing programs in Government -- and one of the most popular among voters.
Republicans had proposed to cut the growth of Medicare spending by as much as $288 billion through the year 2002. With the encouragement of the White House, Democrats had hammered away at that in the spring during budget debates in Congress, casting Republicans as heartless enemies of the old and poor.
And they had enjoyed some political success. But in his own proposal, Mr. Clinton calls for a $124 billion reduction in projected Medicare spending by 2010, and some Democrats said today that the President had all but wrecked their strategy.
"All of us have invested a lot of energy in the last two months criticizing the Medicare cuts," said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a Brooklyn Democrat, "and you know, here he comes now, and basically picked Medicare as the starting point for balancing the budget."
But a handful of other Democrats defended Mr. Clinton, saying he had done what he thought was right, even if they disagreed with his actions.
"On principle and substance, the President was right," said Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat. "The long-range politics are smart, but there are risks short-term with his Democratic base."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, was known to strongly disagree with Mr. Clinton's decision. But he told reporters today that Mr. Clinton was "coming forward and leading on a very tough set of issues.
"He is the President of the United States," Mr. Gephardt said. "He is trying to come up with solutions to this deficit problem."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE RATIONALES;
Good Economics Joins With Very Good Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
When Republicans made their promise of a balanced budget a keystone of the 1994 election campaign, no one was surprised. The party had long paid lip service to the goal, although not a single balanced budget was produced in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan or Bush years.
But now even the Democrats have jumped aboard. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, returned from a retreat with his troops a few weeks ago and proclaimed, "All of us believe our budgets must be brought into balance." 
 On Tuesday night, President Clinton joined the cause. The question, he said in his brief television address, is not whether to balance the budget, but when and how. This, after having submitted a budget just four months ago that allowed annual deficits of about $200 billion past the turn of the century.
So what's going on? The Federal budget has been in the red every year but one (1969) since the Eisenhower Administration. Why all of a sudden should a balanced budget be like the Holy Grail? What's so great about balancing the budget anyway?
The answer, of course, lies heavily in politics. Public opinion polls show that in the abstract, 80 percent of Americans favor balancing the budget. The number falls precipitously if people are asked whether they would still feel that way if it meant cuts in Social Security or Medicare, or tax increases. Still, when 80 percent of the public believes something, politicians pay attention.
But politics aside, strong economic arguments can be made for moving the country toward a balanced budget. Some economists on the left and the right have no problem with running large deficits. But the broad mainstream of economists holds that consistently large budget deficits -- the amount by which the Government spends more money each year than it receives in revenue -- endanger the country's economic future and cheat future generations of taxpayers.
Hardly any economists hold that revenues should exactly match expenditures every year. Ideally, most say, the budget would be in surplus in good times and run modest deficits when the economy was in recession.
The deficit this year is about $170 billion, and many economists believe that merely cutting that figure in half and keeping it there might be sufficient for the country's economic health. As the economy grew over the years, the deficit would shrink as a proportion of the economy.
But setting the more vivid goal of a balanced budget may be essential to bringing the annual deficit to a manageable level.
"If John Kennedy had stood up and said, 'I want to shoot a man in a rocket thousands of miles into space and bring him back again,' it wouldn't have caught the imagination of the American people like promising to send a man to the moon," said Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Some economists believe that balancing the budget is a moral issue. James M. Buchanan of George Mason University, winner of the 1987 Nobel Prize in economics, told Congress a few years ago that the country had "lost the moral sense of fiscal responsibility."
William A. Niskanen, who was the top economic adviser in President Ronald Reagan's first term, agrees with that view. "If we were involved in a war or a major capital building program, I would have no problem with borrowing," he said. "But that's not the case. We're just shifting the burden of our consumption to the next generation."
Others look at the deficit strictly in practical terms. Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration, compares large deficits to termites eating at the foundation of a building. They may cause no worry this year or next, but, if nothing is done, eventually the building will fall down.
The problem is that the more the Government borrows to meet its debts, the less is available for productive investment, public and private. Money the Government spends on interest payments cannot be spent for education or medical care or research that would make the country a better place for future generations. Money the public invests in Government bonds is not put into private capital markets, where it could be used to buy computers or build factories.
The main reason to lower the deficit, said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of President Clinton's National Economic Council, "is to increase national savings; that, in turn, increases national investment in physical, human and technological capital; that, in turn, increases productivity growth and growth in incomes for all Americans."
But it is one thing to say that balancing the budget, or at least lowering the deficit significantly, is a wise course. It is quite a different matter to specify exactly how it should be done.
This is where the economists break ranks. Some would accomplish the task entirely by reducing Government spending. Others put much more emphasis on raising taxes.
In the current political climate, neither Social Security payments nor military expenditures can be cut, and taxes cannot be raised. That puts almost all the pressure of deficit reduction on a rather small slice of the Government's pie composed largely of Medicare, Medicaid and other social welfare programs.
Maybe enough money can be saved in these programs over the next 7 to 10 years to balance the budget. But as sure as they are that this would improve the economy, not all economists are certain it would be worth the price.

HEADLINE: Halifax Journal;
On a Paved Parking Lot, They Put Up a Paradise

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, June 14

 BODY:
First they paved the gravel parking lot, down along the Halifax waterfront. But the result was judged insufficiently pleasing for the important visitors scheduled to gather in the squat, green-tinted glass building overlooking it.
So last weekend workers hastily covered the lot with sod, potted trees, flowering shrubs and pansies, geraniums and chrysanthemums in blue, red and yellow -- the colors of the official logo for the annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven major industrial nations, which begins here on Thursday. 
 "It all comes away when the leaders leave," said Tom Gribbin, the landscape architect with Parks Canada who designed this pleasing if transient little summit park. "Still, I've had my moment of temporary gratification."
Along the waterfront and elsewhere in downtown Halifax, a frenzy of planting, painting, repaving, pothole filling and prettifying construction work has local commentators making comparisons with the "Potemkin villages" put up by the favorite field marshal of Catherine the Great to impress her.
"Potemkin couldn't teach Halifax a thing about putting on the dog," noted Jim Meek, columnist for The Halifax Chronicle-Herald.
It would take a far greater effort to counter the overall down-at-the-heels look of this gritty, red-brick, often fog-bound port city, depressed in recent years by military cutbacks and the depletion of Atlantic fish stocks. The unemployment rate, above 9 percent, is nearly twice that of the United States.
But not all the improvements are fake or temporary. Helped by provincial and federal treasuries, the city has pumped some $6 million into permanent waterfront recreation areas and seawalls, fresh streets and sidewalks, and new sidings and canopies for some of the more weatherworn buildings.
Doug Grant, 70, a former coal miner who bought the Midtown Tavern and Grill in 1949, lucked out, he says, with an outer wall, burgundy and green, for his landmark establishment on Grafton Street.
When construction crews tore up the road, he explained with a satisfied grin, they also had to install a new sidewalk. But in doing that they damaged his old siding, entitling him to a new one.
If the summit meeting proves to be a news dud, it will at least be what Janice Manders, executive director of the Downtown Halifax Business Commission, describes as "the catalyst for civic revitalization."
While giving a boost to Halifax, Prime Minister Jean Chretien, this year's host, has tried to tone down the extravagance of past summit meetings to make this one more businesslike and less ceremonial. He calls it a Chevrolet as opposed to a Cadillac summit. Yet some Canadian officials fret that all the penny-pinching will relegate it in history books as the "Chevette summit."
In keeping with fiscal prudence, the two negotiating tables, both cherry wood, one that seats at least 9 and the other at least 30, have been borrowed from Italy and recycled from last year's meeting in Naples.
Canada also asked each country to keep its delegations to a minimum. Only 1,500 officials are expected, about half the number at Naples. The press, 2,000 strong, will be only one-third the Naples contingent.
The talks are being held on vacant floors of that squat green glass building, recently renamed Summit Place but more familiarly known to Haligonians as the Green Toad. Normally it is used by Kodak Canada as an office building.
Also to check costs, which are running less than the $25 million Canada spent on its last go-around, in 1988 in Toronto, the Government has allowed private companies to "sponsor" the meeting by providing food and services in return for advertising before a global audience. About 100 companies, from Jost Vineyards offering a selection of Nova Scotia wines to McCain Foods distributing snack foods in news center, have signed up.
Tourism boosters are elated at the chance to promote the rich culture of Canada's sparsely settled Celtic heartland. Only a million people live in Nova Scotia, of whom about a third are in the Halifax area.
At least 2,000 policemen -- the precise number is a guarded secret -- are also on hand to provide security.
A 250-acre area near the waterfront, the "red zone," including the six hotels housing the leaders, is cordoned off by six-foot steel-and-concrete barricades and mesh fences. Only those with highest security clearance get inside.
To add even more security, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have spent the last two days welding manhole covers, carting away mailboxes and vending machines and assigning snipers to rooftops.
A no-flight zone is being maintained around the harbor. Ten percent of the harbor is closed to vessels, enforced by a flotilla of police boats and navy minesweepers. Helicopters and planes scan the city virtually round the clock.
At their Halifax headquarters, the Mounties have a high-tech command center using newly installed security cameras to monitor everything that happens in each of the buildings where summit activities take place -- and to lock a building electronically should a security breach occur.
In addition, frogmen have had to secure the harbor's spewing sewer pipes against any terrorists. Halifax still dumps unprocessed sludge into its harbor on the theory that tides take it out to sea. One of the outfall pipes is only a few yards away from where Mr. Chretien is to welcome his guests as they are ferried across the harbor after landing at the Shearwater Canadian Forces base about six and half miles away.
Diving in the harbor, and especially entering those sewer pipes, acknowledged Inspector Terry Elliott, the Mounties' deputy commander of summit security, "is not an enviable job."

HEADLINE: U.S. Blacks Battle Nigeria Over Rights Issue

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
In past years, the Government of Nigeria and many prominent African-American leaders were more likely to be on the same side of international issues: debt-relief for sub-Saharan countries, ending white minority rule in southern Africa, ousting the military dictatorship in Haiti.
But these days, the two are engaged in a war of words and symbolic protests in an increasingly bitter dispute over human rights in Nigeria. 
 The latest manifestation of this is the reported pressure exerted by Nigerian diplomats on the United Nations Children's Fund not to hold a ceremony in the chamber of the General Assembly honoring Randall Robinson of TransAfrica Forum.
Responding to protests from supporters of Nigeria -- whose human rights record Mr. Robinson has been critical of -- Unicef officials said they decided to move it from the General Assembly to another location, thus downgrading its importance.
Shedding what has been their normal reluctance to rebuke a black African country for the treatment of its citizens, an increasing number of prominent African-Americans are calling for the same type of pressures -- diplomatic isolation and economic sanctions -- to be used against the military Government of Gen. Sani Abacha that were applied against South Africa.
"Nigeria is saddled with a military dictatorship that has looted its treasury and victimized its people," said Mr. Robinson, executive of TransAfrica Forum, a research organization concentrating on issues involving Africa and the Caribbean.
Last month the board of the cash-starved National Association for the Advancement of Colored People voted not to accept $20,000 that was pledged to it by Zubair Mahmud Kazaure, Nigeria's Ambassador to the United States, to protest the country's human rights record.
In March, a group of prominent blacks, including Bryant Gumbel of the NBC News program "Today"; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; the actor Danny Glover, and A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., a retired judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, called on the Administration to ban the import of Nigerian oil.
In April, Mr. Robinson and 10 other prominent blacks were arrested outside the Nigerian Embassy as part of a protest against General Abacha.
The Nigerians have responded by pressing charges against the demonstrators. The Nigerians have also attacked Mr. Robinson in Government-controlled newspapers and, critics of the Government say, have organized pickets of Mr. Robinson's office and placed full-page advertisements denouncing his campaign as merely a ploy to gain financing.
"I personally have a lot of respect for Mr. Randall Robinson because of the role he played on South Africa," Mr. Kazaure said today in an interview. "But what he is doing about Nigeria is not the right way to go about it."
Mr. Kazaure denied that the Nigerian Government had pressed the United Nations officials to move the Robinson luncheon or orchestrated any protests.
The protests by African-American officials over Nigeria stands in marked contrast to their relative silence in past years to crimes by African leaders like Idi Amin of Uganda or Jean-Bedel Bokassa of the Central African Republic.
"We wanted this spiritual embrace with Africa and sometimes didn't make the distinctions between the government of a country and its people," said Mr. Robinson, explaining the reluctance of black leaders to criticize black governments.
"We should have been critical of Uganda early on. But I don't think we were armed sufficiently in the upper reaches of our community with the right information."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Use of Taxpayer Money For Newsletter Is Ruled Illegal

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 14

 BODY:
Taxpayer money was used illegally by the Cuomo administration for a 1992 state newsletter that was "an unequivocal promotion of a partisan political position," New York State's top court ruled today.
The newsletter attacked Republican welfare reform proposals nationally and in New York as that year's Presidential election campaign was just getting into full swing. 
 In a 6-to-1 decision, the State Court of Appeals overturned two lower state court rulings. The top court sent the case back to the trial court for trial.
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declined to comment, saying he had no recollection of the newsletter, hadn't known about the lawsuit and had yet to read the ruling.
Mr. Cuomo's bid for a fourth term as governor was thwarted last year by George E. Pataki, who claimed during the campaign that his Democratic opponent had used state resources for political purposes.
"Praise God!" said Robert Schulz, a citizen activist from near Glens Falls who had brought the suit against the former governor.
"This is a victory for citizen vigilance," said the retired engineer, a nonlawyer who represents himself in court and has repeatedly sued the state over its fiscal practices.
The lawsuit asks the courts to order Mr. Cuomo and his former Economic Development Commissioner, Vincent Tese, to pay the state $1,500 each to offset the newsletter costs.
Mr. Schulz said about 50,000 copies of the newsletter were mailed out by the state's Office of Economic Development.

HEADLINE: U.S. Banks' Holdings of Derivatives Rose in First Quarter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The derivatives holdings of American banks soared in the first quarter of the year, while the industry continued to profit from the potentially volatile contracts and manage the risks effectively, Federal bank regulators said today.
But the regulators pointed to some problems at smaller banks that bought structured notes, a type of derivative that pays interest according to often complicated schedules. A dozen small banks across the country have realized and unrealized losses on structured notes equal to at least a quarter of their capital, said Douglas E. Harris, the senior deputy comptroller for capital markets. 
 Mr. Harris said Federal examiners would keep a close eye on the finances of those institutions, which he declined to identify at a news conference today. He said it was possible that future moves in interest rates might erase some of the unrealized losses, but said that was unlikely.
Derivatives are contracts based on or derived from other assets like bonds, stocks, oil or foreign currencies; their prices vary with the underlying assets but tend to be far more volatile.
The criticism of derivatives was strong last year, as rising interest rates and reported misconduct by banks produced heavy losses at industrial companies, local governments and mutual funds. But the criticism has died down this year, as long-term interest rates have dropped and a new Republican majority in Congress has shown less interest in the issue.
At the end of the first quarter of 1995 the underlying assets of bank-held derivatives climbed to $18 trillion from $15.8 trillion at the end of last year, the biggest increase ever in a single quarter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said today. But the expansion appears to have come in relatively low-risk derivatives, and not in high-risk, exotic bets on the direction of the bond market or other markets, said Ricki Helfer, chairwoman of the agency.
The figures on the underlying assets of derivatives tend to overstate the actual risk to banks, which tend to hold offsetting bets on the same markets. The agency determined that for those derivatives held for trading purposes and priced at the end of the first quarter, banks had accumulated gains of $289.48 billion and losses of $285.03 billion, for a net gain of $4.44 billion.
In a separate study, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found that the potential exposure to losses had risen for the nine main banks dealing in derivatives. Those banks had an average exposure equal to 312 percent of their capital, up from 269 percent at the end of last year.
Mr. Harris, the senior deputy comptroller for capital markets, said the higher ratio was not a cause for concern. It partly reflects growing bank profits on derivatives. And many banks have much higher exposures to loan losses, because banks lend much more money than their capital, Mr. Harris noted.
For example, the 25 banks with the largest credit exposures to commercial and industrial loans have an average exposure equal to 862 percent of their capital. The entire banking industry has an exposure to these loans equal to 163 percent of capital.
Mark C. Brickell, a managing director at J. P. Morgan, the parent holding company of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, said the big expansion in derivatives activity was not a cause for alarm. "These contracts were developed to meet the needs of our traditional clients as they manage interest rate and currency exposures that are part of their basic business," he said.
Mr. Harris agreed in general, but expressed concern about one peculiar feature of today's study. Nine big commercial banks now account for 93 percent of all off-balance-sheet derivatives contracts. But structured notes, which appear on balance sheets and have produced some of the heaviest losses, tended to be concentrated among very small banks that were particularly ill-equipped to gauge the risk.
The dozen banks that may lose a quarter of their capital or more on those investments are all tiny, with the largest of them having only $140 million in assets, he said.
Today's study also found that derivatives contracts linked to interest rates accounted for 64.2 percent of the market, while derivatives linked to currencies accounted for another 33.8 percent. The remaining 2 percent consisted of contracts typically based on stocks or commodities.
Citing concerns about derivatives, Moody's Investors Service downgraded its rating of the debt of the Bankers Trust New York Corporation today. Bankers Trust said the downgrading was unwarranted.

For comparision, an average bank's credit exposure in a sector like home morgages, other loans or securities is 150 to 200 percent of capital, while some banks have exposures in these areas of more than 1,000 percent of capital.

HEADLINE: High Court Rules an Award On Age Prejudice Is Taxable

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that money received from a successful lawsuit or settlement under the Federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of age is taxable as income.
The 6-to-3 decision resolved, at least in the context of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, a fierce dispute among the lower Federal courts on the taxability of such awards. While the Justices did not address an equally vigorous dispute over the tax treatment of punitive damage awards in negligence cases, there was language in the majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens to support the Internal Revenue Service's view that punitive damages are taxable as income to the recipient. 
 The decision today overturned a 1994 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. That court had ruled that a $145,629 age discrimination settlement received by a United AirLines pilot should not be counted as gross income.
The award to the pilot, Erich E. Schleier, was part of a $17.2 million settlement the airline, a unit of the UAL Corporation, reached in 1986 with about 100 pilots whom United had forced to retire at age 60. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which was passed in 1967, protects employees between the ages of 40 and 70 against discrimination on the job on the basis of their age. The law permits recovery of lost wages or, in the case of willful misconduct by the employer, twice the lost wages.
The I.R.S. has been in litigation with the former United pilots around the country, with differing results, depending on the Federal appellate circuits where the pilots live. Several of the other cases are pending at the Supreme Court as well.
The principal question for the Court today was how to interpret, in light of the age discrimination law, a section of the Internal Revenue code that excludes from the code's otherwise sweeping definition of gross income any damages received "on account of personal injuries or sickness." The pilots have argued that as victims of age discrimination, they suffered personal injuries for which the compensation should be excluded as income under that section of the law.
Rejecting that argument over a vigorous dissent by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice Stevens said that the recovery of back pay under the age discrimination law was a purely economic award intended to make up for lost wages and was not linked to any personal injury the discrimination victim may have suffered.
"The amount of back wages recovered is completely independent of the existence or extent of any personal injury," Justice Stevens said. No matter how injured the employee felt, the financial recovery would be the same and thus could not be described as "on account" of the injury, he explained.
Three years ago, in a decision called United States v. Burke, the Court used similar reasoning, that award under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the general Federal law against workplace discrimination, were taxable as income. Congress has expanded the remedies available under Title VII and the I.R.S. has subsequently taken the view that some damages under the act should not be treated as income. That issue has not yet reached the Court.
In her dissenting opinion, Justice O'Connor, who also dissented in the earlier case, said that "age discrimination inflicts a personal injury." She said the injury to reputation and dignity caused by age discrimination was "no less personal and thus no less worthy of excludability" from gross income than physical injuries for which compensation is not treated as income.
The majority opinion, Commissioner v. Schleier, No. 94-500, was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred separately. Justices Clarence Thomas and David H. Souter voted in dissent with Justice O'Connor.

HEADLINE: Time Warner To Reduce Debt

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Time Warner Inc. plans to raise money for debt reduction by selling securities tied to its stake in the toy maker Hasbro Inc.
Separately, Time Warner, the big media and entertainment company, said yesterday that it was also offering $500 million of 7.75 percent notes due in 10 years, and planned to use the proceeds to replace debt on which it was paying higher rates of interest. The notes offering is to close on Monday. 
 Time Warner announced its intentions involving its 14 percent stake in Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
No date or price was announced for the sale of the securities tied to Hasbro's stock, but it was believed that Time Warner hoped to raise about $400 million for reducing its debt of $15 billion.
The company said in February that it hoped to reduce its debt by $2 billion to $3 billion by mid-1996 through the sale of noncore assets.
So far, it has raised about $1.3 billion, with agreements to sell assets like its stake in the Six Flags theme parks.

HEADLINE: U.A.W., Ranks Thinning, Elects a Fighter as President

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 14

 BODY:
The United Automobile Workers union today elected its first new president in 12 years -- Stephen P. Yokich, a charismatic leader and deft tactician with a carefully cultivated reputation as a hothead.
Leaders of union locals are hoping that Mr. Yokich, whose outbursts of temper have delighted the rank-and-file and, at times, have kept the auto makers off balance, can reverse the U.A.W.'s steep membership slide and restore its political clout. 
 "I know Yokich will fight back," said Dave Yettaw, president of Local 599 in Flint, Mich., in an interview before the election. Mr. Yettaw, a leader of a dissident movement within the union, has been one of the most tenacious critics of the departing president, Owen F. Bieber, who is retiring.
Last fall, Mr. Yokich, who since 1989 has been in charge of relations with General Motors, authorized Mr. Yettaw to strike G.M. to force it to hire more workers at a gigantic parts-making and car assembly complex in Flint. It was one of five crippling local strikes Mr. Yokich called against G.M. last year.
The U.A.W. shut down the auto maker's operations in Flint, causing plants nationwide that depended on parts manufactured there to close as well. As in the other strikes, G.M. quickly met the union's demands.
Mr. Yokich, who was elected in Anaheim, Calif., at the U.A.W.'s triennial convention, has an impeccable union pedigree. Now 59, he first picketed G.M., famously, at the age of 22 months, in a stroller pushed by his mother, a G.M. worker and, like his father, a U.A.W. member. Both of his grandfathers also belonged to the union.
And among company executives who have bargained opposite him, Mr. Yokich, a former tool-and-die maker, has earned a reputation not merely as a firebrand but also as a savvy bargainer willing to help surmount what he sees as real competitive hurdles for the Big Three auto makers.
Behind the scenes at G.M., Mr. Yokich has cooperated with the company's efforts to become more efficient. On his watch, hourly employment at G.M. fell to 247,000 at the end of April, from 345,000 in 1989, mostly because of retirements. Under the terms of the U.A.W. contract, Mr. Yokich could have forced G.M. to hire one new worker for every two that left. But he did not invoke the rule, a fact the U.A.W prefers not to discuss.
Mr. Yokich had a similar record of cooperation at the Ford Motor Company, where he helped streamline operations when he was in charge of bargaining there in the 1980's. Such assistance from the U.A.W. has been key to restoring the competitiveness of the Big Three.
Although he has long been the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Bieber, Mr. Yokich, a trim man with a toothy grin, has not spelled out his plans. But he hopes to step into a broader role.
"We're more than a collective bargaining agent in this country," Mr. Yokich said in a recent meeting with reporters here. "We're a social movement as well."
The union's biggest challenge, he said, "is in the political arena."
"We have to get John Q. to the polls," he said.
While the U.A.W. was among the group of dissidents that has endorsed John J. Sweeney to replace Lane Kirkland as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Yokich has not publicly picked a candidate.
Like Mr. Bieber, Mr. Yokich said he favored tightening links with the Canadian Auto Workers union and exploring ties to Mexican workers. "We should have a North American Metal Federation," he said.
Mr. Yokich will need all his skills to deal with the U.A.W.'s myriad woes. For example, with no resolution in sight, the union has been battling Caterpillar Inc. for years to install a pattern contract negotiated at other equipment manufacturers. Union members walked off their jobs there a year ago, and since then the company has earned record profits using replacement workers.
Mr. Yokich must also move quickly to groom his own successor because he will only have time to serve two three-year terms before reaching the union's retirement age of 65. Labor officials at the Big Three are worried that no obvious successor is in sight, which could lead to disruptive battles within the union.
Longer term, Mr. Yokich's challenges are to articulate a clear role for the U.A.W. in a global economy and to convince younger workers who do not remember the battles of the 1930's of the union's relevance. As workers hired during the 1960's retire, the auto makers are expected to replace them with about 200,000 young and better eductated men and women during the next decade.
And his most difficult challenge is to rebuild the union's membership, which has fallen almost in half since 1979, to about 800,000 from 1.5 million.
The U.A.W. has so far failed to organize most of the plants foreign auto makers have built in the United States. Indeed, before a new drive started at Honda's plants in Ohio, the union seemed to have given up on the transplants. The U.A.W. has yet to begin an aggressive drive to organize the BMW plant in Spartanburg, S.C., or the one Mercedes-Benz is building in Tuscaloosa County, Ala.
The greatest erosion in the union's membership has been among suppliers of auto parts. While more than two-thirds of hourly employees at supplier companies were U.A.W. members in the late 1970's, fewer than one quarter are now, said Harley Shaiken, a professor specializing in labor issues at the University of California at Berkeley.
Because so many suppliers pay wages and benefits well below the U.A.W. scale, parts-making operations at the Big Three have trouble competing. Particularly at G.M., this has led to a deep rift with the union over "outsourcing," or contracting with outside suppliers to supply parts once made at G.M.
To avoid giving more ground to the Big Three on the issue of outside contracts, Mr. Yokich has to organize suppliers.
But Mr. Yokich is likely to face nagging distractions closer to home. Labor Department investigators are looking into whether he steered lucrative contracts for eyecare for auto workers to a friend, in exchange for financial benefits. Mr. Yokich denied any impropriety, saying he did not award contracts.
Mr. Bieber said, "Steve is not guilty of anything, and that will be proven."
Mr. Yokich never graduated from college, but pressed his children to do so, and both became lawyers. His daughter, Tracy, is a Democratic member of the Michigan House of Representatives. His son, Stephen, is a lawyer in the U.A.W.'s legislative office in Washington.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY'S BUDGET: THE COUNCIL;
After Uproar Over Budget, Anger Fades To Handshake

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
For weeks, members of the City Council had roared about unconscionable cuts at the core of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed budget. Demonstrators had marched in fury on the sidewalks outside City Hall, and lobbyists had frantically swarmed through its corridors. The Council Speaker, fearing the worst, had even gone out on a limb and proposed a modest tax increase to head off some of the cuts.
But when the Mayor and Council leaders finally reached agreement on the budget late Tuesday in a friendly handshake beneath the City Hall dome, the scene held an air of unreality. The negotiations had been concluded so swiftly and so amicably -- Speaker Peter F. Vallone called it "the most cooperative budget negotiation we've ever had" -- that many observers wondered if this was still the same budget that cut spending more than any other since World War II. 
"What happened to all the rage?" asked Ronnie M. Eldridge, one of the few Council members who remains angry. "All of a sudden, it just seems to have dissipated."
For as long as anyone can remember, the Council has taken a subordinate role in the complex choreography of a municipal budget. Having been battered by a stagnant economy and a state government not inclined toward generosity, Council leaders argue that the city's financial situation was so withered that there was little room for them to make substantial changes in the Mayor's proposal without bringing government to a halt.
Unlike other legislative bodies, including the State Legislature, the Council is limited in its budgetary powers because the City Charter gives the Mayor sole control of estimating all city revenues, allowing him to cut his estimate and thus the entire budget if he disagrees with the Council's changes in expenses.
Though the Council could have taken a more confrontational approach to the negotiations -- delaying the agreement, distancing itself from the Mayor's enthusiasm for reductions -- that was not the chosen style of Mr. Vallone, the body's ruler. "If all you want to do is call each other names, you lose any chance you have of compromising," he said yesterday. "So we as a policy try to avoid that as much as we can."
Tuesday's cheery handshake ceremony came as a disappointment, if not quite a surprise, to opponents of Mr. Giuliani's proposals. Because of the growing political outcry over the state and city budget cuts, many had expected this to be the year in which the Council did more than simply tinker around the edges.
"The Council gave away its last opportunity to claim its Charter-given powers," said Penelope Pi-Sunyer, director of the City Project, a coalition of advocacy and labor groups. "Maybe they couldn't have gotten a different budget through, but at least they could have taken a stand on it."
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-financed watchdog group, said he had hoped the Council would at least try to challenge some of the shaky assumptions built into the Mayor's budget, like the $600 million in labor savings that remains a goal rather than a fact.
"Like a lot of people, I had hoped that the Council would give life to the concept of co-equality with the Mayor," Mr. Horton said. "But I didn't predict it. The Council turned out to be very much in the historical pattern of basic agreement with the Mayor with some incremental changes designed to protect a few public services."
Mr. Vallone and his colleagues in the Council's leadership spent the day defending themselves from just those criticisms. Not only could they not have done more to reshape the Mayor's budget because of the city's dire financial circumstances, Mr. Vallone said, but in fact the Council this year made the greatest number of changes to a mayoral budget in city history.
"There's never been a budget that I can recall where we've had this much ability to make change," the Council Speaker said in an interview in his office, outside of which lobbyists lingered in the hope of changing his mind. "Now that doesn't mean we could restore all the money the Federal Government and the state took away from us; that's silly. All we can do is, where we were able to have an impact, and we were able to fund things that the city can possibly fund, we did it."
Mr. Vallone pointed to $200 million the Council allocated for repair and reconstruction of school buildings, the largest single change he and his negotiators effected. The Council also persuaded the Mayor to restore about $80 million to a variety of programs that had been chosen for cuts, including significant restorations to youth programs, cultural institutions, child welfare and recycling programs. These were achieved by getting the Mayor to delay his planned cut in the commercial rent tax and to agree on a variety of fiscal gimmicks that he had vowed to oppose.
Several Council leaders insisted that they were amazed by Mr. Giuliani's flexibility in agreeing to even those changes.
"I've been here 18 years, and I've never seen a Mayor so agreeable," said Stanley E. Michaels, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee. "Ed Koch would never have done it. But I think he wanted to show that unlike the Governor, he could bring in a budget on time and without a fight. So he gave in a lot."
The Mayor didn't give in to Mr. Vallone's most creative idea, which was to raise taxes on single-family homes not occupied by their owners, so that suggestion was quickly dropped. Nor, in the end, did Mr. Giuliani change more than about $300 million of his budget to suit the Council, a mere 1 percent of the overall $31.1 billion total. But the Council's leadership was extraordinarily pleased with what they did achieve, and insisted the overall battle is far from over.
"Some people say we used bows and arrows this year instead of bullets," said Kevin McCabe, Mr. Vallone's chief of staff, who did much of the detailed negotiating. "But the good thing about bows and arrows is that you can go pick them up and use them again."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Is a trade war coming? In some industries, it's already here.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AS Washington and Tokyo duel over autos and the Europeans fidget on the sidelines, there is talk that this ugly tiff between political allies will mark the beginning of a real trade war. But a low-intensity global trade war has been under way for decades, with protectionists from all the economic powers using rigged national laws and sympathetic government bureaucracies to sabotage the foreign competition.
In the United States, the warriors range from flower growers to bicycle makers, and their weapon of choice is laws barring imports below "fair market value" -- a term only lawyers and lobbyists attempt to define. Two current cases, steel pipe for the oil industry and cement for road and home building, show the corrosive effects. 
 Not so long ago, these so-called anti-dumping laws were rationalized as extensions of antitrust law. If foreigners sold their goods here for less than they sold them back home, there was a presumption that they were attempting to knock out the local competition and then raise prices.
Yet such "predatory pricing" has been rare since John D. Rockefeller learned to play monopoly without a board. The standard reason for selling at more than one price is that some consumers are more cost-sensitive than others. That, after all, explains why airlines charge business travelers more than vacationers, and why hardcover books cost three times as much as the paperbacks.
But at least predatory pricing offers a veneer of plausibility to justify government intervention in foreign trade. Current American law, along with the laws of many countries that have imitated American practices, also defines dumping as selling below cost. And because "cost" includes just about anything that the protectionist-leaning bureaucracy of the Commerce Department decides, it is no surprise that Washington finds merit in more than 90 percent of the dumping complaints filed.
In the latest of many cases involving steel, American producers of pipe for the oil and gas industry petitioned for protection from foreign competitors, notably those in Argentina, Mexico and Japan. Japanese pipe exporters didn't bother to defend themselves and withdrew from the market after Commerce tentatively imposed a 44 percent tariff on pipe for lining wells.
To the relief of the State and Treasury Departments, which are eager to see free-market policies in Mexico and Argentina survive the aftershocks of the peso's devaluation, Commerce made a preliminary finding that neither was dumping steel pipe. But Mexican exporters are still holding their breath. The petitioners, it seems, argue that high interest rates in the wake of Mexico's crisis raised production costs -- and therefore the fair market value of Mexican pipe.
Even if Mexico and Argentina get away with nothing more than a stiff bill from their American lawyers, others will pay. With Japan, and most likely Italy, Austria and South Korea out of the American market, the Texas oil economy may not lose 3,000 jobs, as was predicted in a study by three economic consultants from the University of Houston. But any penalty on imports is likely to cut competition among suppliers and raise costs at a time when the domestic oil industry is hurting. "I hate to get in a situation where I'm dependent on one source for critical materials," said Michael Osborne, a senior vice president with Pennzoil.
The stakes are higher in the cement case. Cement is so costly to move by land, notes Robert Roy, the former chief economist for the cement makers' trade group, that the American market is really a half-dozen regional markets. When demand exceeds production capacity within a few hundred miles of the border, the cheapest alternative source is often imports from Canada or Mexico. Indeed, Mexico's Cemex, the largest cement company in North America, built capacity near the border in the 1980's in expectation of serving the booming markets of the Sun Belt.
But domestic cement producers along the southern tier of states won a dumping case in 1990, sticking Cemex with a 66 percent tariff that effectively drove it out of their regional market. Mexico won a ruling from the world trade body in 1992 that the tariff violated Mexico's due process. But the case drags on, now as much a tussle over jurisdiction as trade equities.
Meanwhile, Southern states are staring at rising cement prices -- as much as 20 percent in the last year. And Mexico City is steaming over the barrier that keeps one of the country's most efficient industries from exporting to its partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The good news is that low-intensity trade wars rarely escalate. The bad news is that there is a new skirmish every month or two, raising prices for American consumers and undermining America's global leadership by confirming the most cynical views of American foreign policy goals.

HEADLINE: Bureaucrat-Bashing Can Lead to Tragedy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In light of the terrorist bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building, "The Bureaucracy: What's Left to Shrink?" (Week in Review, June 11) highlights both the travesty and tragedy of bureaucracy-bashing. 
 The American public, with a good deal of help from politicians and the media, has made the Federal bureaucracy the scapegoat for many of our social, economic and personal woes. Pundits of every type have made careers by perpetuating stereotypes and falsehoods built on myths of a growing bureaucratic Leviathan that pathologically abuses its power. In its bowels reside individuals variously characterized as incompetent, inept and even evil.
The fact you highlight, that by any significant measure the size of the Federal bureaucracy is shrinking, points to the reality of a public sector work force that is dedicated and hard-working. Those of us who study and work with public administrators know that they are increasingly overburdened and underappreciated.
The tragedy is that popular myths that feed the scapegoating also feed hatreds that can lead to terrorist attacks such as occurred on April 19. Those scholars, politicians and journalists who inadvertently help sustain those myths must face their responsibilities and help put a stop to the madness.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Retreat In Quiet Day After Gains On Tuesday

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday in quiet trading, as some investors sold to consolidate the large gains they had made in Tuesday's huge market advance.
Certainty that the Fed will ease sometime soon has given way to uncertainty as to whether it will act soon enough to keep interest rates from rising, traders said. 
 Douglas Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said, "The market has already priced in a decent amount of Fed easing, so traders and investors are reluctant to push things much further before they have clear confirmation that an easing is actually in the works."
The 30-year bond fell 12/32 , to a price of 11322/32 for a yield of 6.57 percent, up from 6.54 percent in the previous session. Shorter-maturity bills were mixed, with the three-month issue unchanged at 5.43 percent and the six-month maturity up 1 basis point, to 5.38 percent.
None of the economic data released yesterday had much impact on prices. April business inventories showed a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent, and first-quarter nonfarm productivity was revised to a gain of 2.7 percent instead of the rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent previously reported.
Traders said that despite yesterday's drop, the market remained positive in tone. "There is only so far you can take the market without concrete proof the Fed is going to ease," Astrid Adolfson said.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said it was not easy for fund managers and investors when markets go from overbought to oversold and back again in a few days.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josepthal, Lyon & Ross, said the outlook at present was for "a slow growth economy, low inflation, and a low interest rate environment, which is favorable for returns on both stock and bond investments."
He added, "I still have priced in a Fed easing down the road." He put it at "25 to 50 basis points," or a quarter to a half percentage point.
Mr. Dwyer changed his asset allocations yesterday. "In January I took 15 percent out of cash and added it to bonds," he said. "And now I believe that the bulk of the appreciation in the longer maturities is behind us, and therefore, we took 15 percent out of bonds and added it to stocks because we think the lower interest rates since January will help prevent the economy from moving into a recession." His current asset allocation includes 65 percent stocks, 20 percent bonds and 15 percent cash.
"From a yield standpoint bonds are still attractive," Mr. Dwyer said, "but I believe the best total return will be in stocks. That's not to say I don't like bonds; if I didn't I wouldn't have any money in them."
Meanwhile, the corporate debt market, aided by the low interest rate environment, has become crowded with borrowers. The Tennessee Valley Authority priced a $2 billion global bond issue yesterday through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers International (Europe) and Deutsche Bank A.G. London.
Time Warner Inc. priced $500 million of 10-year noncallable notes through Morgan Stanley & Company. The issue was given a 7.75 percent coupon and priced at 99.314 to yield 7.85 percent, or about 170 basis points more than the Treasury's 10-year note. By late in the day yesterday the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 6.14 percent.
Underwriters said the issue was split rated, with Moody's Investors Service giving it a junk bond rating of Ba-1, while Standard & Poor's Corporation gave it an investment grade of BBB-.
Time Warner joined dozens of borrowers, including Viacom Inc., Rockwell International and Eli Lilly & Company, that have sold more than $50 billion of bonds since April to take advantage of a rally in Treasury bonds.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower Against the Mark As German Rates Unchanged

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark yesterday after the Bundesbank left German interest rates unchanged at its biweekly meeting on monetary policy.
Some market participants said they had expected the Bundesbank to cut rates to counter the slower economic growth in Germany. Lower interest rates often hurt a currency by making deposits in the country's banks less attractive. 
 "The Bundesbank's decision was a mild surprise, and that hurt the dollar," said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York.
Many analysts say economic growth in western Germany will slow to 2 percent or less this year from 2.4 percent last year, as the strong mark and slowing growth elsewhere in the world hurt German exports.
But in explaining the decision by the Bundesbank not to cut rates yesterday, the president of the central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, said, "We don't see any economic dip here."
As a result, the Bundesbank left its discount rate, which acts as a floor for money market rates, at 4 percent. The German central bank last cut the rate on March 30.
"There had been a little bit of pent up expectation that they could do something on rates, and there was a knee-jerk reaction after they didn't," said Jonathon Griggs, currency adviser at Barclays Bank in London.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.4003 German marks from 1.4088 marks on Tuesday. The dollar slipped to 84.39 Japanese yen from 84.60 yen.
While the enthusiasm about President Clinton's plan to balance the budget helped to lift the dollar on Tuesday, speculation that Congress would not agree to the plan weighed on the dollar yesterday, traders and analysts said.
"The overall market reaction was unfavorable" to Clinton's plan, said John Rothfield, international economist at Nationsbanc-CRT in Chicago. With the Clinton proposal at odds with those advanced by the Republicans in Congress, "it looks like we'll get gridlock," he added.
The prospects for a balanced budget would help the dollar by instilling confidence in American assets. Mr. Rothfield said the dollar could fall to 1.35 marks and 80 yen by the end of this month if Mr. Clinton and Congress did not agree on a deficit plan.

HEADLINE: New Data Offer More Signals of Slowdown in Economy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Businesses stockpiled more goods in the spring as consumer spending slowed, new Government figures showed today.
Analysts said the numbers were just the latest signs pointing to production cutbacks and weak growth. 
 The Commerce Department said that inventories rose in April for the 13th straight month, climbing eight-tenths of a percent, led by a buildup in interest-sensitive durable goods.
Meanwhile, sales fell four-tenths of a percent in April. That came after a tenth of a percent decline in March and marked the first time in more than four years that sales have slipped for two consecutive months.
The inventory-to-sales ratio rose to 1.41, the highest it has been since July 1994 when it was at the same level. The last time it was higher was November 1993 when the ratio was 1.42. The latest figure means it would take 1.41 months to exhaust stockpiles at the April sales rate.
Strength in spending has kept inventories at relatively low levels in relation to sales, even as stocks accumulated rapidly.
In an encouraging development on the inflation front, the Labor Department reported that the productivity of American workers increased 2.7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 1995.
The department also said that unit labor costs -- typically two-thirds of the cost of a product -- rose 1.6 percent or less than half as much as a month-old estimate of 3.4 percent.
Analysts said the reports bolstered the case for slow growth and low inflation.
"An inventory correction will probably stretch over several quarters, rather than being concentrated into a single period," said Bruce Steinberg, an Merrill Lynch economist.
Some commentators predict the economy will be flat or even contract in the second quarter. But many expect a rebound in the second half of the year, even if the Federal Reserve leaves short-term interest rates unchanged.
"We are making progress in eliminating unwanted inventories," said Astrid Adolfson of MCM MoneyWatch, a New York financial advisory firm. "It's still plausible to have a soft landing, even if the second quarter is negative."
The latest inventory gain, roughly in line with analysts' expectations, was led by a 1 percent increase in durable goods, particularly autos. Durable goods inventories have surged 10.8 percent since April 1994.
Inventories of nondurable goods like food and fuel rose five-tenths of a percent and were 6.6 percent higher than a year ago.
The Commerce Department said inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $949.9 billion in April, up from $942.7 billion. Inventories in April were 9.1 percent higher than a year earlier. Sales in April were at a seasonally adjusted $672.2 billion, down from $674.8 billion.
Retail inventories rose to $298.9 billion in April, up nine-tenths of a percent. Stockpiles at the wholesale level were up to $246.4 billion, a 1.2 percent increase. Manufacturers' inventories rose sixth-tenths of a percent, to $404.6 billion.
Business sales in April at the retail level fell three-tenths of a percent, to $192.5 billion. At the wholesale level, they rose five-tenths of a percent, to $184.1 billion. Factory sales fell nine-tenths of a percent, to $295.6 billion.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Prices of Corn Futures Climb On Forecasts of Dry Weather

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Corn prices surged yesterday after forecasts for hot, dry weather in Midwest growing regions increased the chances of a crop damage and further reduced yields.
Wheat and soybeans prices were also sharply higher. On other commodity markets, copper prices and crude and gasoline futures prices advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 1.09 points, to 233.77. 
 Meteorologists are calling for temperatures in the mid- to upper-90s through next week in the Midwest with little chance of rain. Prolonged heat could destroy tender crops budding up to a month late because of spring flooding in the Midwest.
Traders bet that with yields already reduced by the planting delays, the American harvest this fall will be more than 20 percent below last year's and will not be able to meet growing overseas demand.
"We're on the fine edge here of tremendous world demand and the world's largest producer is watching supplies be steadily eroded," said Gerald Zusel, vice president for grains at E. D. & F. Man International Futures Inc.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn for July delivery rose 5 cents, to $2.7625 a bushel, the highest for the contract closest to delivery since June 17, 1994, when it closed at $2.8325. July wheat rose 7.75 cents, to $3.8675 a bushel; July soybeans rose 5.75 cents, to $5.855 a bushel.
The weather could once more force the Agriculture Department to reduce its estimates of the corn crop harvest, now predicted to come in at 7.9 billion bushels.
"The government tends to be conservative on those crop reports, and they were assuming normal weather for the rest of the summer," Mr. Zusel said.
Copper prices rose after the Commodity Exchange of New York reported yet another drop in its stocks.
The exchange's stocks have fallen to their lowest level in more than five years, and stocks on the London Metal Exchange also have fallen recently. That has spurred fears of short-term supply tightness despite evidence that the economy is slowing, said Stephen Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter, Discover & Company in Chicago.
The June copper contract rose 1.95 cents, to $1.353 a pound.
Gasoline prices advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange on news that five refineries in Corpus Christi, Tex., were under environmental restrictions to comply with air-quality targets. July unleaded gasoline rose 1.07 cents, to 62 cents a gallon, the highest price for the contract since May 25. The July crude contract rose 14 cents, to $19.05 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Flea Market in Zoning Peril

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
THE Annex Antiques Fair and Flea Market is a shopping sideshow that has blossomed every Saturday and Sunday for 27 years on empty parking lots in the West 20's like a ragtag village of Brigadoon. But it may be dismantled in its present form under a proposal to rezone a stretch of the Avenue of the Americas.
The proposal calls for changing the designation of the blocks flanking the avenue from West 24th to West 31st Streets from manufacturing to commercial-residential. This would permit the construction of stores and apartments on the empty lots. Twenty percent of the apartments would be reserved for low or moderate-income tenants. 
 "Nothing is forever," said William Bernstein, a spokesman for the Department of City Planning, which put a preliminary stamp of approval on the plan on April 24 before sending it to Community Boards 4 and 5 for review. "Restaurants close, businesses close. There's nothing to guarantee that the flea market will continue to exist."
Board 4 approved the plan by 31 to 3, while Board 5 endorsed it by 36 to 0. But one caveat was that future development consider preservation of the Annex and the nearby Flower District.
More than 300 vendors take over a handful of lots between 24th and 27th Streets, said Alan Boss, who manages the flea market. An additional 125 vendors set up shop inside a parking garage on West 25th Street. Mr. Boss estimates that the vendors take in more than $500,000 each weekend.
Though the its bargain prices may be more fable than fact these days, the market still provides what Christopher Gable, a Pennsylvania perfumer who is searching for the perfect Humber touring bicycle, calls "one of New York City's rites of passage."
"It's as much a social event as a shopping experience," he added. The Annex has become an essential hunting ground for shoppers from around the world who hope to spot the perfect bibelot or catch sight of celebrities like Marisa Tomei, Barbra Streisand, the dandified photographers McDermott and McGough, and Philip Van Renssalaer, the dashing writer and cafe-society fixture.
Under discussion is the possibility of moving the flea market to an unused pier in the West 20's. "But that's the least attractive option," said Jack Goldstein, a chairman of Community Board 5, "because part of the attractiveness of the flea market is its centrality. It's not segregated from the fabric of the city."
The neighborhood was a manufacturing center from the late 19th-century through the 1940's. The factories have long since moved on, leaving behind a motley assortment of semivacant loft buildings, warehouses and parking lots.
Rezoning the area has been considered for more than a decade. But an application presented to the Planning Department was recently certified, which brings the notion one step closer to fruition. The application was presented by Leonard Adell, a developer and local property owner. If approved, Mr. Bernstein said, it would provide property owners, including those holding title to the flea-market lots, with an incentive to build potentially profitable apartments and stores. "Whether or not they would choose to take advantage of them would be their decision," he added.
Mr. Adell's secretary said he was out of town until next week and unavailable for comment.
Jane R. Crotty, the executive director of the 23d Street Association, a civic group, said it approved of the rezoning plan, which now enters a seven-month review before moving to the City Council for final approval. But given the labyrinthine procedures governing rezoning and development, no one familiar with the proposal expects the flea market to be disrupted until 2004.
"There is a great need for homes here, and providing commercial space will enhance the development of the area, which is not a bad thing," said Ms. Crotty, who enthusiastically noted that new book stores, home-design centers and clothing shops had revitalized the avenue below 23d Street.
"In all likelihood, a developer will develop the flea-market site," Mr. Boss said. But the market is expected to survive in one form or another.
"It's a powerful tourist attraction," Mr. Goldstein said. "The novelty of the experience has imprinted itself on people's imaginations." He added that the market has brought the neighborhood "a certain cachet" not unlike the Bermondsey flea market in London and the Marche aux Puces in Paris.
Mr. Goldstein's words will come as a relief to many flea-market habitues.
"I certainly hope it doesn't disappear," said Cynthia Byrnes, an advertising executive who lives in Westport, Conn., and often rises at dawn to drive to the flea market. "What would I do with my weekends if it went away?"
Virginia Pao, an executive at a crystal company, depends on the market for fine costume jewelry made in the 1950's. "It would devastate my wardrobe if the flea market closed," she said. "You go there, rummage around, come up with something great and then take it to breakfast or brunch for show-and-tell. That's the ritual."

HEADLINE: SENIOR CLASS;
On Town Councils, Voices of Experience

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. STOCK 

 BODY:
WE were just about to put a no-parking zone near the school," said John F. Petitt, the Mayor of Westhampton Beach, L.I. "Then Mark Raynor spoke up." Mr. Raynor, a member of the Village Board of Trustees, pointed out that parents who picked up children would have to park on a heavily traveled street nearby. "So we put off the vote," Mayor Petitt continued. "The thing is, he has kids at that school and he knows. The rest of us are a little past that."
Mr. Raynor is 40. The Mayor and the three other trustees range from 67 to 76. In that regard, Westhampton Beach, an oceanside town of 1,500 full-time residents, is riding a wave. All across the nation, particularly in small and medium-size towns, more and more older people are being elected to town councils. 
 The gradual aging of the councils is cited by students of town government and in surveys by organizations like the National League of Cities, which found that between 1979 and 1989, the percentage of council members age 60 or older had grown from 14 to 24. Among the 8,700 council members in the league's current data base who provided birth dates, 29 percent were 60 or older.
There are many reasons for the trend, experts say, including the growing demands on council members' time, something most retired people have in abundance, and it is expected to continue. Town government may never be the same.
"Some older people run for the Council because they don't want the city to do anything," said Elizabeth D. Rhea, the Mayor of Rock Hill, S.C., since 1986, who is 65 herself and clearly a doer. During her tenure, she has brought in new businesses to replace departed textile mills, and the unemployment rate in the town of 45,000 has gone from 17 percent to 3 percent.
"On my last Council," she said, "four of the seven of us were retired, and two of them were elected on a single issue -- they were opposed to our building a sports complex. Well, we had a lot of split votes, but we built it, and those two had a real education. By the time they left the Council, they'd decided the complex was a good idea."
One decided advantage older people offer councils, said James H. Svara, 52, a political scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, is their greater life experience. "It gives them a longer-term perspective," he said. "When you combine that with the fact that they're healthier and more energetic than they used to be, their greater presence on councils is just logical."
Last year, Lyle Sumek of Longwood, Fla., was a consultant to 35 town councils, many of which required his services because their members were having trouble working together. One problem: age discrepancies.
"Some of the differences are minor," he said. "A lot of the 40-year-olds come to meetings in shorts and a polo shirt. They want to be comfortable. The elderly come dressed in a professional manner -- they're more concerned with the council's public image. That can create some stress."
But other differences go to the heart of council business. "Older members have a trust of authority," said Mr. Sumek, who is 50, "so they want thorough research and recommendations from their staff. Younger folks have a greater distrust of government. They want options, not recommendations, and they want to go out and check the potholes, not listen to a report about them. And where older people are comfortable with compromise, the younger ones say: 'Why do we have to compromise? We can push it through.' "
One recent Friday, in a meeting room of the firehouse-cum-village-hall in Westhampton Beach, Arma Andon, a 76-year-old trustee, held a training session for a dozen Department of Public Works employees. "Let's say you're doing repairs on Dune Road and a tank truck turns over," he said. "What's the procedure?"
"Run?" a young worker asked.
Mr. Andon was the Mayor of Westhampton Beach for eight years before stepping down last year and running for trustee. "On my first board, I was the only one 65 or over," he said. "Gradually, the number's been growing."
Trustees are rarely idle. Rosaria Del Bene, 75, goes on running Ria's Beauty Shop as she has for 57 years; she was the moving force behind the local senior center. Ora Belle (Ridgie) Barnett, 67, has a company that sells business forms; she has presided over the planting and computerized listing of hundreds of trees in the village.
And Mr. Raynor, the 40-year-old trustee, is a patrolman with the Southampton, L.I., Police Department. Both he and the other trustees say there is no generational friction on the board, but he does see himself as different: "I'm out there every day, so I can see how problems come about and how to fix them. I'm inclined to take a harder look at things than a retired person."
Mr. Svara, the political scientist, sees the trend toward elderly council members as a reflection of the changed nature of the council.
"When you withdraw Federal assistance from housing rehabilitation and neighborhood improvement and other programs," he says, "it means the councils have to find ways to come up with funds themselves. At the same time, national groups are bringing pressure on the local level over the environment, gun control and other issues. Suddenly, councils have to deal with demonstrations and with more meetings. How can younger people balance that with the demands of their families and their jobs?"
Yet another reason is offered by Michelle Frisby of the International City/County Management Association: no civics classes. "We used to teach kids how their local government worked and teach them about civic responsibility," she said. "Like most baby boomers, I never had that in all 12 years of public school." Mayor Rhea of Rock Hill adds: "Younger people are like a sort of silent majority, standing on the sidelines, not wanting to get involved. It's frightening."
So older people are filling the gap. Mayor Petitt, 73, of Westhampton Beach ran for office, he said, "because I'm not a golfer or fisherman and not one to sit around and do nothing -- and because I wanted to give something back."

HEADLINE: Tansi, Congolese Novelist, Is Dead at 48

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Marcel Sony Labou Tansi, a novelist considered by many to be Central Africa's greatest writer, died yesterday in Foufoundou, a remote village in the Congo countryside where he had gone for treatment of AIDS. He was 48.
The cause of death was complications from AIDS, including pneumonia, The Associated Press reported, quoting Eugene Banguissa, the former Mayor of Brazzaville, the capital. Mr. Tansi's wife, Pierrette, a nurse, had died four days earlier, also from AIDS complications, The A.P. added. 
 Mr. Tansi's novels, written in French, were known for their biting satirical treatments of colonialist Africa and the dictators who arrived after independence.
Critics have said that his books are difficult to read because they employ complicated puns, symbolism and imagery to reinforce his primary message -- that Africa's colonial masters exploited not just the continent's economic resources but also its spirit. But the novels had a great impact in French-speaking Africa.
Mr. Tansi's best-known novels are "Life and a Half" (1979), "The Shameful State" (1981) and "The People Before" (1983). "The Seven Solitudes of Lorsa Lopez" is to be published in September.
"The Antipeople," published in 1988, received positive reviews in the United States. It is a bleak account of a former soccer idol whose life is ruined by a young girl who commits suicide after he refuses to sleep with her. Mr. Tansi used the plot to reveal some of the darker elements of life in Zaire and neighboring Angola.
Mr. Tansi was a member of the opposition party and who won a seat in the National Assembly in 1993. But he refused to attend any legislative sessions out of defiance of the Government.
He and his wife returned to Congo in April from Paris, where they had been seeking treatment for AIDS. They moved to Foufoundou, which can be reached only by a long hike through a forest, and tried herbal medicine and ritual ceremonies that mixed African traditional healing and Christian evangelism in an attempt to heal themselves.
Mrs. Tansi continued to deteriorate after they arrived in Foufoundou, but in the weeks before his death, Mr. Tansi had seemed more robust.
While in Paris, Mr. Tansi finished a new work, "The Beginnings of Pain," which he said his publishers had initially refused to put out because of what they said was an excessively harsh tone toward France, which was once Congo's colonial ruler. He said a new nonfiction work, "La Cosa Nostra," would argue for a Marshall Plan for Africa.
"Africa is the only continent left that has not found its way," Mr. Tansi said in a recent interview. "We have this incredible wealth, of resources and of spirit, but outsiders like France are just robbing us while blessing our dictators."

HEADLINE: Cyprus Shores Wash Dirty Money

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: LIMASSOL, Cyprus

 BODY:
The offshore banking system on this Mediterranean island is being used to violate United Nations sanctions imposed on the rump Yugoslavia and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars made illicitly in Russia, say Western diplomats, bankers and even some of those involved in the business.
About three dozen of the 500 Serbian companies set up in Cyprus are believed to have links to the Government in Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro. 
 The companies are buying oil and other goods and then shipping them to Serbia through neighboring countries in trade worth about $10 million a week, the diplomats and bankers say.
Money is also pouring into Cyprus from Russian racketeers, sometimes in suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars. The money is usually deposited in accounts here and then transferred to accounts in Switzerland, Germany and Britain to mask its origin.
"The Serbian businessmen are intent on doing business either with Serbia or as middlemen for Russian companies trying to enter the European market," a Western diplomat said. "The Russians are often involved in shadier deals."
Russian arms dealers, for instance, use Cypriot investment laws, which allow transactions to be kept secret, to sell weapons and other military equipment to Iraq, in violation of United Nations sanctions. They launder the profits through the companies they have set up in Cyprus, said bankers who spoke on the condition that they not be identified.
The Greek Cypriots who dominate the internationally recognized Government of the island, which is divided with Turkish Cypriots, are seen as friendly to the Serbs and the Russians because of their shared Eastern Orthodox religion.
"Cypriots have welcomed Yugoslav people as offshore entrepreneurs while other countries have not," said the head of a major European bank in Nicosia, the capital. "Serbian businessmen have a terrible problem getting visas to other countries, but not to Cyprus."
American officials say senior Cypriot politicians and executives have even used their businesses as fronts for Serbian companies seeking to break the sanctions on Yugoslavia.
One of those Cypriot politicians, they say, is Tassos Papadopoulos, chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, whose law firm was named recently by the United States Treasury as a front for Serbian businesses.
American officials also contend that senior Serbian officials have set up companies here on behalf of the Belgrade Government. The Serbs include Borka Vucic, managing director of the Cyprus Offshore Banking Unit for the Government-owned Udruzena Beogradska Banka, and Edo Alibegovic, a former official at the state-owned Yugo-Metal who now runs Metham (Overseas) Ltd. in Cyprus.
Cypriot officials bristle at the suggestion that they have lost control of the activities of the approximately 19,000 companies registered here, 18,000 of which are little more than brass plates on a door.
When the sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia in 1992 because of its support of the ethnic Serbs fighting the Bosnian Government, the Cypriot authorities curtailed the activities of the three Serbian banks here and froze some $300 million in Serbian assets.
"These Serbian offshore enterprises are closely monitored," said Andreas Philippou, the chief senior manager of the Central Bank of Cyprus. "They are allowed to carry on activities not related to Yugoslavia. They have funds belonging to parties and persons not subject to the sanction."
The Central Bank also recently ordered a freeze on new Russian-owned bank branches. Cash deposits and transfers of more than $10,000 have to be reported, although several bankers said the requirement is largely ignored.
Cypriot officials also point out that the sanctions permit Serbs who do not have contact with the Belgrade Government or its enterprises to do business with other countries, including those from which the goods are known to be shipped illegally to Serbia.
Western diplomats said many of the Serbian companies, often subsidiaries of large Government corporations, were run by close associates of the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic. But they said the network of Serbian companies violating the embargo was worldwide, and they could not estimate what percentage of the illegal trade was handled through Cyprus.
Russian and Serbian business executives are reluctant to talk about their activities. Most immediately cut off the questioning.
"We don't want to publicize that we are here," said one of the managers of East Point Holdings Ltd. "We don't want to talk." The company, in Nicosia, is listed by the United States Treasury as one involved in breaking the embargo on Yugoslavia.
The few company officials listed as acting on behalf of the Serbs who would comment reacted angrily to the charges.
"This is a stupid, irresponsible act by the American Government, thought up by some 15th-rate Washington bureaucrat trying to make a name for himself," said Mr. Papadopoulos, whose law firm is alleged to be violating the embargo. "I don't care about these accusations. I don't have anything to explain."
Ivan Mrkic, the charge d'affaires at the Yugoslav Embassy, said about 5,000 Serbs live in Cyprus.
"Most of them are in the offshore industry," he said as he escorted the Mayor of Belgrade on a visit. "They are doing very well. We are thinking of setting up our own offshore industry in Montenegro once the sanctions are lifted."
Many of the Russians and Serbs who have moved their families to Cyprus have bought up numerous villas around Limassol, a major port, as well as luxury cars. They often pay in cash, Cypriot real estate agents say.
"We just built 73 villas in our new Santa Barbara village," said a developer, Demetrakis M. Zavos. "Most of the houses were bought by Russian and Serbian businessmen. These offshore companies give us a lot of clients."
Russian businessmen can often be found in the cabarets that line the coastal strip, many of which feature Russian dancers. Menus are often in Russian, and Cypriot newspapers now have Russian-language sections. A weekly Russian-language newspaper and a Serbo-Croatian newspaper are published on the island.
About 2,000 Russian-owned companies operate in Cyprus. Some of the Russian business executives here are legitimate, fleeing the plunging ruble, rising crime and the faltering Russian banking system.
But Western diplomats say they believe that others are part of Russia's mafia -- including managers of state-run businesses who sell oil and minerals under the table or officials who divert state funds to their foreign bank accounts.
The Serbs seem to keep a lower profile. The companies identified as having direct links to the Yugoslav Government buy trucks, machinery, consumer goods and oil through front operations. The goods are shipped to countries that border Serbia, and are then transported into Serbia.
Several Serbian companies listed as suspect by the United States Treasury have branches in Cyprus, including Yugo-Arab, a firm that diplomats here say has bought arms for the Yugoslav Army.
Cypriot bankers estimate that $50 million in Serbian funds was brought here in the months before Yugoslavia split up in 1991. Beogradska Banka, which set up operations in Cyprus in 1988, is the offshore branch of Beobanka, Serbia's biggest bank. Two smaller Serbian banks, Karic Bank and Beogradska Kreditna Banka, set up offshore branches here three years ago.
Many Serbian business executives and bankers here worked in state-owned enterprises or for the Belgrade Government, but then set up offshore companies after the embargo. Cypriot officials said several hundred million dollars was transferred out of Cyprus to banks in Europe after Cyprus agreed to try to enforce the United Nations sanctions.
"We do several million dollars' worth of business" in violation of the sanctions, said a Cypriot employee of a Serbian company in Limassol, who spoke on condition that neither she nor the company be identified.
"We buy many items, such as pharmaceutical products from Germany and Switzerland, and use a bill of lading for another country near Serbia, usually Greece. It is very efficient, very easy and we don't worry about anyone interfering in our business."

HEADLINE: Administration Proposes Federal Regulation of Health Insurance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today proposed Federal regulation of private health insurance to make coverage more available and affordable.
But it refused to give any details about the other, more contentious half of the health care policy that President Clinton outlined on Tuesday. Under that policy, the Government would sharply restrict Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes. 
 The proposals are all part of Mr. Clinton's new plan to balance the Federal budget in 10 years. "The key to long-term deficit reduction is controlling health care costs through health care reform," he said, and he described his proposals as "a serious step" toward that goal.
Since the demise last year of his ambitious plan to redesign the nation's health care system, Mr. Clinton has suggested that more modest, incremental changes would be feasible. But until this week, he had not advanced any proposals of his own.
Health insurance is now regulated mainly by the states. But Federal regulation appears likely because Republicans and Democrats in Congress support the idea, much of the health insurance industry accepts it and the Clinton Administration wants it. Administration officials said they could agree with Congress on the shape of legislation, though the details may prove tricky because insurance regulation is technical and complicated.
Under the President's new proposals, insurers could not deny coverage to people with medical problems, and they would have to renew policies regardless of the subscriber's medical condition. Insurers would have to offer coverage to small employers and their workers, and the Federal Government would limit insurers' ability to vary or increase premiums because of the subscribers' claims history.
Mr. Clinton also proposes Federal subsidies to make insurance more affordable for people who lose their jobs. Under current law, employers must offer coverage to employees for at least 18 months after they lose jobs. But the employers are not required to pay premiums for these workers, and the premiums are often more than the jobless workers can afford.
The Health Insurance Association of America, which mobilized opposition to Mr. Clinton's health plan last year with a series of television advertisements, welcomed Mr. Clinton's new proposals, which are much more modest.
Bill Gradison, president of the association, said: "Overall, I have a very positive reaction to what the President proposed. It greatly increases the chances of needed health reform legislation becoming law this year. Many of the President's proposals mirror proposals in our own legislative agenda."
Mr. Clinton left many unanswered questions about his proposals for Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, and Medicaid, the program for the poor. His proposed cuts in projected Medicare spending -- totaling $124 billion, or 6.6 percent, over seven years -- are about half as deep as those endorsed by Republicans in Congress.
But the impact on doctors, hospitals and nursing homes might be almost as severe. Most of Mr. Clinton's cuts fall on such providers. He would not increase premiums, deductibles or other charges for beneficiaries. Indeed, he said his plan would impose "no new cost increases on Medicare beneficiaries."
Dr. James S. Todd, president of the American Medical Association, criticized that aspect of Mr. Clinton's plan, saying it did not call for "shared sacrifice."
At a White House briefing today, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, was asked to specify how the Administration would limit the growth of Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. "I can't do that because we are not going into detail on specific cuts," she said.
Dr. Shalala said Administration officials could lay out details later, in negotiations with Congress. Whether Mr. Clinton will submit a detailed legislative proposal -- a standard test of serious political intent in Washington -- is unclear.
Richard J. Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association, said: "We are terribly disappointed with the President's proposals. He had an opportunity to push for major restructuring of the Medicare program, but he didn't do it. His proposals are not part of overall health care reform, but are used mainly to reduce the deficit."
Mr. Davidson said that 1,500 hospitals derived at least 75 percent of their revenue from Medicare and Medicaid, and he predicted that "some of those hospitals will bleed to death" under the plans advanced by the President and Congress.
Mr. Clinton's proposal for Medicaid is a turning point in the 30-year history of the program. He would impose limits on the annual growth in per capita Medicaid costs.
Governors have long sought some type of ceiling on Medicaid spending; costs have quadrupled in the last decade and are now growing by 10 percent a year.
Mr. Clinton's proposal is much different from the lump-sum payments, or block grants, favored by Republican leaders in Congress. A block grant gives each state a fixed amount of money, with no allowance for population growth. Mr. Clinton's proposal to limit the per capita growth of Medicaid would, by definition, allow for population growth. It would probably save less money than a block grant but would be easier to carry out and less disruptive, state officials said.
In his effort to improve access to private health insurance, Mr. Clinton proposed increasing the Federal income tax deduction for the insurance costs of self-employed people and their dependents. Congress recently increased the allowance so self-employed people can deduct 30 percent of such costs, up from 25 percent. Mr. Clinton would allow self-employed people to deduct 50 percent of health insurance costs.
In addition, Mr. Clinton would allow small businesses to obtain insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The program offers scores of private health plans to active and retired Federal workers and their dependents. Mr. Clinton said that proposal would increase the purchasing power of small businesses. But he said the premiums of such businesses would be calculated separately, so they would not affect the premiums of Federal employees.
Dr. Shalala said that the architects of the President's original health plan, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira C. Magaziner, helped prepare the new proposals. But other Administration officials said that Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the National Economic Council, had the primary responsibility this year.

HEADLINE: Rendezvous in Halifax

 BODY:
Every year the leaders of the seven major industrial countries gather for a summit meeting, whether needed or not, and issue a communique long on vague promises and short on concrete commitments. This year's meeting, which begins today in Halifax, Nova Scotia, may prove a modest exception. A draft of the final statement includes some proposals that deserve support.
The first would enhance the role of the International Monetary Fund in monitoring and responding to economic problems that develop in member countries. The need for more engagement was shown when the fund, along with the United States, bailed out Mexico and prevented financial turbulence from spreading through Latin America. 
 The seven leaders are likely to urge the fund to develop standards for monitoring financial data from member nations that would provide early warning signs of trouble. Monitoring itself is a useful, though limited, step. It would be even better for nations to publish the data, which the leaders will urge, and for the fund to make public its analysis. That way private investors could, by withdrawing funds, discipline countries that pursue imprudent policies. So far the fund's members have rejected public scrutiny. The leaders will also propose giving the monetary fund more money to aid countries under financial siege, a need highlighted by the drain on the fund's reserves from the Mexican bailout.
Beyond these measures, the draft obliquely calls for studying a reform proposed by Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard. He wants the fund to act more like a bankruptcy judge and less like a lender using taxpayer money. The idea is to give the fund the authority to hold foreign creditors at bay, while issuing guarantees that make it possible for private lenders to provide money to a bankrupt government while it puts economic reforms in place. The idea is attractive, but needs study before it can be translated into a workable plan.
Another useful step the leaders might take is to provide Ukraine additional money to support the impressive market reforms it initiated last year. The leaders pledged $4 billion to Ukraine last year if it adopted fund-approved reforms. Ukraine obliged by freeing prices, bringing down its deficit and lowering inflation. But its Government needs more help to boost the economy.
The final communique, as always, will call on governments to coordinate economic policies. The promise will be abandoned the minute domestic politics dictate otherwise. The leaders will probably duck a proposal to use gold held by the fund to relieve the debt of desperately poor countries. There will also likely be inconclusive talk about Bosnia, and meetings with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who wants to join the industrial nations' club. To avoid unpleasantness, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan plan to touch only glancingly on Washington's plan to impose trade sanctions on Japan at the end of the month.
Still, these meetings rarely do much harm, and this year the leaders seem headed toward doing some good.

The Longest Year

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
It's hard to believe that this weekend marks the first anniversary of the wild Bronco chase. Doesn't it feel as if we ran to our sets for our first breathless glimpse of A. C. Cowlings at least three years ago?
Time doesn't fly when you're not having fun. Though conventional wisdom now says that the O. J. Simpson case has no redeeming social or intellectual value as a landmark in jurisprudence or anything else, it has nonetheless hijacked our culture. You don't have to follow the trial to be affected by it. You can't escape no matter how hard you try. 
 O. J. permeates the airwaves, journalism, most overheard conversations. O. J. is now the nation's weather, and it's raining all the time.
Taken in sum, the moral lessons to be drawn from O. J. might make for an Antichrist's "Book of Virtues." The defendant has demonstrated that with enough money you can probably buy your way out of any trouble. Lance Ito has proved that even 15 minutes of fame won't satisfy some Americans; the judge won't be happy until his aggregate TV time eclipses Ed Sullivan's. The jury has shown that, given enough rope, ordinary people selected by lot from all walks of life will hang themselves by lapsing into an orgy of greed, racial acrimony and overall pettiness. After which, they run out and hire agents.
But if O. J.'s legacy has been the fomenting of race and class conflict and the undermining of whatever faith Americans still had in the legal system and the press, there is still a bright side. Many people, and not just the lawyers, have gotten very rich. As The Wall Street Journal reported in March, the O. J. industry has long since passed the gross national product of Grenada -- even though the prosecution, whose bill to Los Angeles taxpayers now totals some $5.8 million, has yet to rest its case.
O. J. has been a boon to publishers, with at least 15 books already out or on their way, not counting F. Lee Bailey's fortuitous reissue of his 1972 "The Defense Never Rests." Five have been best sellers, with the latest, the Kato Kaelin reminiscence that Mr. Kaelin himself disowned, already boasting 800,000 copies in print at $20 a pop -- $16 million in potential sales for one title alone. The tomes by O. J.'s mom and Johnnie Cochran's former wife are still to come.
CNN, charging up to $24,000 per half-minute of commercial time, could make more than $45 million on the trial, according to one industry estimate. Rupert Murdoch's Fox was first to cash in with a TV movie, while an officially authorized Simpson statuette has passed $5 million in sales at $3,395 apiece. Trial transcripts can be ordered through an 800 number at $9 per day; Mr. Cowlings's 900 number for recorded apercus charges nearly $3 per minute. "I Killed Nicole" T-shirts ($12.75), pins and bumper stickers are now a thriving industry in L.A. "The Dancing Itos," regulars on Jay Leno, are a hot show-biz act, as are the chattering legal eagles who fill the chairs opposite Ted Koppel and Larry King. An Internet site, the Canonical List of O. J. Simpson Jokes, lists 17 orange juice puns and 13 gags featuring Hertz.
Who is to blame for this circus in which the murder victims have increasingly become forgotten players? Cynical observers might point the finger at a public so ravenous for celebrities that even Faye Resnick will do -- and so infatuated with violence that witnesses' descriptions of off-camera autopsy photos take on their own pornographic allure. Psychiatrists, meanwhile, might theorize that Americans are so eager to avoid confronting their real problems that they would rather fixate on a distant soap opera in which they have no direct stake.
But polls have revealed that 90 percent of the country says it's sick of O. J., so surely that absolves each of us of any responsibility for this ugly national appetite for tawdriness and gore.
Note instead that many of the unsavory O. J. products, from Mr. Simpson's own best-selling apologia, "I Want to Tell You," to the recent cable broadcast of Mr. Kaelin's soft-core porn film "Sand, Surf and Sex," have been forced on an unwitting audience by a single media empire -- just like the violent movies and gangsta rap that destroy our cities. As we reach this first anniversary of our O. J. culture, we can rest assured that it in no way reflects poorly on our national character. It's all Time Warner's fault.

Senate Approves Bill To Regulate the Internet
The Senate voted 84 to 16 for a bill that would impose a maximum fine of $100,000 and prison terms of as much as two years on individuals who transmit sexually explicit material over computer networks.
Advocates of regulation easily overwhelmed objections from a handful of lawmakers who said the measure would violate constitutional rights to free speech and threaten the growth of computer networks. [Page A1.]
 
Hoping to head off legislation that would censor material on the Internet, three software companies proposed a rating system and an electronic filter that could block access to sexually explicit content. [D6.] 

Bidders Seen for Hills Store
Venture Stores and Apollo Advisers, headed by the former co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert, Leon Black, are said to be potential bidders for control of the Hills Store Company. [D11.]
 
Reports Point to Slowdown
In another sign of weak economic growth but low inflation, inventories rose in April for the 13th straight month, climbing eight-tenths of a percent, and sales fell four-tenths of a percent. The Federal Government also reported that worker productivity increased 2.7 percent in the first quarter. [D24.]
 
Sprint Mulls Cellular Sale
Sprint said its directors were considering options for the company's cellular unit, including a spinoff or a sale. [D5.]
 
Test Results Hurt Cor Shares
Shares in Cor Therapeutics fell $8.50, to $10.25, after the company's flagship heart attack drug, Integrelin, delivered disappointing results in late-stage clinical trials. [D4.]
 
Duff & Phelps in Deal
Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance and Duff & Phelps are merging their investment management businesses. [D5.]
 
Clinton's New Health Plan
The Clinton Administration, as part of its plan to balance the budget, proposed regulating private health insurance to make coverage more available and affordable. [A22.]
 
Bank Derivative Holdings Up
American banks' holdings of derivatives soared to $18 trillion, from $15.8 billion, in the first quarter, but the surge appeared to have come in relatively low-risk investments. [D4.]
 
Age-Bias Awards Taxable
The Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that money received from a lawsuit or settlement under the Federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of age is taxable as income. [D2.]
 
Lotus Notes Is No Groupwise
Lotus Notes may be getting all the attention because of I.B.M.'s takeover of Lotus, but Novell's Groupwise dominates the world of network computing. [D4.]
 
Different Game for Olajuwon
Hakeem Olajuwon is one of the top stars in the N.B.A., but his endorsement portfolio isn't as impressive as his scoring. Why? Executives say his name is hard to pronounce, he doesn't play in a major market and that he doesn't "register with youth." Yet his endorsement portfolio is not bare; last year, endorsements yielded $2 million in off-the-court income. Advertising. [D11.]
 
U.A.W. Elects President
The United Automobile Workers elected Stephen P. Yokich as its new president. [A14.]
 A chart with the Business Digest misstated economists' expectations for a Federal Reserve report on industrial production in May. They expected a decline (not an increase) of four-tenths of 1 percent. Yesterday the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell two-tenths of 1 percent for the month. Details appear today on page D1.

A Glum Unity: The Group of 7 Sees Downhill

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Lurking just off the horizon at the economic summit meeting that opens in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Thursday is the kind of potential crisis that the Group of Seven was created two decades ago to keep from getting out of hand. Some of the world's biggest economies, in an oddly synchronized fashion, may be headed downhill together.
Japan is caught in a vicious deflationary spiral, its economy shrinking and its banks threatened by losses so enormous that they could shake markets around the world. The United States is struggling to keep a soft landing from becoming a hard one, and Canada is being sucked down in its wake. 
 The Clinton Administration has counted on exports to help keep the economy afloat, but with Canada, Mexico and Japan -- its biggest trading partners -- all reeling, who is about to go on a buying spree?
In the old days, this would have been the moment to announce a grand coordinated effort by the world's seven big industrial democracies. Officials would have deftly laid out a series of precisely timed economic initiatives.
But no one talks seriously about coordination any more. Even the American Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, concedes that "in the old sense of the word -- an agreement for specific action at a specific time -- coordination may be dead."
Mr. Rubin sees plenty of other justifications for the annual gathering of thousands of communique-scribbling bureaucrats, headline-seeking politicians and news-starved reporters, all engaged in a mad competition for a very limited number of hotel rooms and restaurant tables. But many others, particularly those who wonder whether economics still has much to do with the economic summit meeting, are asking the simple question: Why bother?
The end of the cold war has made it seem far less urgent for the Western political allies to put up a common economic front, which was the subtext of the first decade and a half of summit meetings. But that is only one of the reasons, said Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, that "it is getting harder and harder to make these summits work."
As Mexico learned the hard way, private markets these days can swamp decisions made by governments that now control far fewer levers to move the world's economy than they once did. And when the moment came earlier this year to save Mexico from collapse, it took unilateral action by the United States -- and then grudging acquiescence from the other allies -- to bring about what, Administration officials, with some presumption, hailed as a "coordinated response."
Then there is the question of whether the right countries are even at the table. Where will the bigger decisions be made in the world economy of 2010, in Rome or Beijing?
"You sometimes get this sinking feeling," one of the sherpas, or bureaucrats, who do the advance work for the summit meeting said a few weeks ago, "that we're talking to the wrong people, often about the wrong subjects."
That helps explain the proliferation of competing meetings, led by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the still new annual gathering of Pacific leaders, which at least has the benefit of more equatorial settings.
Most experts agree that there is merit in getting leaders of the Western world together, even if only to talk about the crisis du jour. In the early 1990's the subject was how to save the Russians from economic ruin, while at the same time separating the former Soviet republics from their nuclear weapons. This year it will be Bosnia.
There are annual chestnuts: For years Americans have wanted to turn the meeting into a forum for beating up on Japan over its closed markets. Everyone else has wanted to use it to lean on the United States to cut its budget deficits and entice Americans to save more money. There will probably be a good deal of both this year around the fringes of the meetings, as Washington and Tokyo maneuver for advantage in their dispute over luxury car imports into the United States and access to the market for autos and parts in Japan.
But by any measure, the meeting has wandered a long way from the goals set out by the two former finance ministers who got the Group of Seven started in the midst of the energy crisis in 1975: President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of Germany. The idea was to create an informal, private place for the world's leaders to handle common problems of inflation and economic growth, figuring that together they could do a lot more than they could individually.
For the first decade it worked reasonably well, with joint plans to stimulate economies and curb the use of oil. In 1985, at a separate meeting led by finance ministers and central bankers, the five big industrial powerhouses worked together to rein in the dollar, which at the time was viewed as tremendously overvalued. A decade later, with the dollar regularly hitting record lows, that looks like a problem the Group of Seven solved beyond its wildest imaginings.
But as Mr. Rubin noted in a lengthy conversation in his office this morning, "coordination proved to be like many other things in economics: something that sounds nice and simple and is anything but simple. It ran into the complexities of economic life."
Now, Mr. Rubin sees a new form of coordination, one that is more about long-term strategy than short-term action. It "is much better fitted to the realities of the world," he says. General goals are in; 15-point action plans are out.
"This has its own utility," he said, arguing that a general agreement on exchange rates reached by the finance ministers earlier this year paved the way for an unusually well-coordinated surprise intervention in the currency markets a couple of weeks ago, bolstering the dollar.
Mr. Rubin's big initiative this year is one that is not expected to bear fruit for some time: A revamping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to prepare for the next Mexico-style crisis.
"The United States cannot be the world's lender of last resort," Mr. Rubin has said time and again in recent weeks.
His plan is to force countries that have artfully covered up their financial books for years to disclose a range of information about their borrowings and their reserves. That, in theory, will permit the markets to enforce fiscal responsibility by refusing to lend to governments that go on spending and borrowing binges.
The crux of the American plan is to create a fund within the I.M.F. to bail out countries on the brink of bankruptcy, preventing what Mr. Rubin calls a "contagion effect" on markets around the world. But even that plan, analysts say, bespeaks the obstacles to coordination.
The draft communique says nothing about how to pay for this special fund, and the European partners have shouted down an American proposal that the I.M.F. sell some portion of its $40 billion in gold reserves to create a fund for the purpose.
Mr. Rubin acknowledges that going to the Republican-controlled Congress for an additional contribution would be "a difficult proposition" that will require "an education process on Capitol Hill."
The Group of Seven already see this as an example of the limits on Mr. Clinton's power in economic matters. That explains why Mr. Rubin and others are suddenly talking about dunning the emerging economies of Asia for the extra money.
That is hardly the only issue on which Mr. Clinton will face difficulty getting cooperation. No one, for example, is counting on Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama -- whom Mr. Clinton meets separately on Thursday -- to stay in power long enough to engineer a bailout of the Japanese banking system and stimulate its stagnant economy. Nor does he have the power to settle the automobile dispute, the other time bomb for the markets.
That leaves the United States and its big partners to do what they have learned to do so well at economic summit meetings. Count on Mr. Clinton and his best friends in the world for the next three days to schmooze, jawbone and then step in front of the television cameras to argue that the events of Halifax have made the world a better place -- even if a few months later no one can remember exactly how.
 
Where to Go

 However ineffectual it may sometimes seem, don't say that the Group of Seven does not keep up with the times.
This year, its summit meeting enters cyberspace -- both with an official World Wide Web site on the Internet sponsored by the Canadian Government and with two unofficial Web pages, one set up by Dalhousie University in Halifax, the summit site, and the other created by teachers and students of Cornwallis Junior High School there.

Chart/Photos: "Less Glitz, More Talk"
 In playing host to the economic summit meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies, Canada wants to limit the scripting and showmanship and give the leaders more time to discuss issues freely. At the top of the agenda are proposals to overhaul the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, two global economic institutions established at the end of World War II, so they are better equipped to deal with any future Mexico-style currency crisis. Also to be discussed are the war in Bosnia, nuclear proliferation and the world economy. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will also meet with the leaders in Halifax, where he is expected to be questioned about the fighting in Chechnya. Chart shows the key goals of each participant. (pg.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Budget Doesn't Matter

BYLINE: By James C. Miller 3d 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton's weak effort to get back in the budget ballgame does not alter one big political fact. Whatever he has to say about the budget is of little consequence. Its fate lies with the Republican Congress. Not only will Congress draft a budget that reflects its own philosophy, it wields enormous leverage over the President and will likely get its way in the end.
Unless Congress approves appropriations, most discretionary programs will halt on Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year starts. Only those Government functions essential to health and safety will be up and running. It will be too distasteful for President Clinton to see welfare, road-building, small-business loans, environmental regulations and other programs grind to a tire-smoking halt. 
 What's potentially more troubling for the President is that in November the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling will be reached, and by law cannot be exceeded. Unless Congress acts in a timely fashion, he will have to cut back all discretionary programs and possibly entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, because the Government would have to spend incoming revenues to roll over debt as bonds and notes come due.
The House and Senate have both passed resolutions calling for balanced budgets in the year 2002, and they intend to do this without raising taxes. But the House version is preferable for three important reasons.
First, the House budget, true to the Contract With America, offers a tax cut. The Senate version contemplates action on taxes -- maybe and, if so, in the sweet by and by. The House would accelerate economic growth through an expanded individual retirement account, changes in business depreciation rules and, most important, by reducing the tax rate on capital gains. The Senate offers nothing along these lines.
The House plan would remedy the tax code's discrimination against families. The House wants a $500 nonrefundable tax credit for each dependent, and eliminates the so-called marriage penalty, under which a couple living together pay less in taxes than if they were married.
Second, the House would make up for part of the cut in tax revenues by spending a little less -- $11.9 trillion -- than the Senate's $12 trillion on Federal programs over seven years. The Congressional budget committees have forecast that annual Federal spending and tax revenues at the end of the seven years would be nearly $70 billion less under the House plan than under the Senate's version.
Finally, the House budget is more likely to restrain spending because the House is more willing to pare down the Federal establishment. It would close down three Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education and Energy -- altogether. The Senate would eliminate only Commerce. The House would terminate hundreds of unnecessary agencies (like the National Endowment for the Arts) and programs (like clean-coal technology). The Senate would reduce the financing of many but leave them intact.
In proposing to balance the budget over 10 years, President Clinton cautioned against reducing the deficit too fast so as not to hurt the economy. This echoes a recent warning by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's chief economic adviser, that rapid reduction of the deficit would drive the economy into a tailspin.
How soon we forget. In the 1987 fiscal year, total Federal spending, adjusted for inflation, fell for the first time in nearly two decades, and the deficit plummeted from $221 billion to $150 billion.
There are no grounds to imagine that the national recession in 1990 had anything to do with the rapid reduction of the deficit in 1987. But there are firm grounds to believe that today's economy will grow stronger under the rigorous Republican approach to deficit reduction.

HEADLINE: Making It Easier to Uncover Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 15

 BODY:
The International Atomic Energy Agency adopted tougher safeguards today that are intended to help its inspectors ferret out clandestine nuclear arms programs.
At the agency's headquarters in Vienna, its board of governors approved an initial set of measures that will allow its inspectors in countries suspected of developing nuclear weapons to gain broader access to suspected nuclear sites, to mount inspections with little or no notice and to sample soil, vegetation, water and air for traces of radioactivity. 
 In early May, countries meeting at the United Nations extended indefinitely the treaty to limit the spread of nuclear arms. The atomic energy agency has the task of monitoring national energy programs to insure that no nuclear materials are siphoned off for use in developing weapons. But disclosures in recent years that Iraq and North Korea -- despite being signers of the treaty -- had been able to pursue clandestine weapons programs had led to calls for a strengthening of inspections.
The broader inspection powers passed today will cover only nuclear sites that were already accessible to the agency. David Kyd, the agency spokesman, said by telephone from Vienna that the agency would press for a "more ambitious racheting up" of the safeguards, to extend them into research facilities and areas where inspectors do not yet have access. It also wants fuller disclosure of nuclear activities from member states.
The Director General of the atomic energy agency, Hans Blix, plans to seek this expanded authority when the board of governors meets in December. The board includes representatives of 35 of the 122 countries belonging to the agency.
The expanded measures approved today are expected to cost $1 million a year beyond the annual safeguards budget of $70 million.
The agency's total annual budget is $211 million, plus $50 million more in voluntary contributions for programs making nuclear technology for peaceful purposes available to member states. Dr. Blix told the board that the increase could be offset by other cost-cutting within three years.
Several critics have said the new measures are still insufficient. Not only is the agency underfinanced, they say, but it also spends too much time and money monitoring unthreatening nations in Western Europe or North America at the expense of suspected violators like Iran and North Korea.
"What's needed is a candid acknowledgment by the agency of what it can do and what it cannot do effectively," said Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington.
But another analyst, Leonard S. Spector, said he thought the agency's new safeguards would "contribute enormously" to discouraging potential violators. "It's going to enable us to keep some of these countries on the defensive," said Mr. Spector, who directs the nuclear nonproliferation project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
In an interview in Vienna last month Dr. Blix spoke of limits to what his agency can achieve, however many safeguards it devises. Because it is virtually impossible to confirm that a nuclear weapons program does not exist, he said, "in no country do we give a clean bill of health." "We say we have seen no evidence of diversion or misuse," he added.
The agency's mandate does not allow it access to known military nuclear programs. It can only try to insure that nuclear material for peaceful uses is not diverted for weapons. If its inspectors find something suspicious, they can only raise the alarm, leaving it to the Security Council to take action against the violator.
"We happen to live in a world of sovereign states," said Dr. Blix. "We cannot parachute in or shoot our way in, absolutely not."
The agency, authorized at the time only to monitor declared nuclear facilities, was caught off guard when Iraq's secret nuclear weapons program was disclosed after its defeat in the Persian Gulf War in 1991. After the war, agency inspectors descended on Iraq to find and demolish buildings and machinery. In 1992, the agency determined that North Korea was not providing a full accounting of its stocks of plutonium, a possible bomb ingredient, triggering intense diplomatic efforts and a recent agreement under which North Korea has foresworn nuclear weapons. Iran, which is buying Russian nuclear equipment over United States objections, has become the latest candidate for closer scrutiny. So far, Dr. Blix said in the interview, "we are not encountering any lack of cooperation from the Iranians" in getting access to their installations.
While the agency's watchdog responsibilities have increased, its regular budget has been frozen for the last decade, excepting for inflation, by a blanket policy of zero real growth in United Nations spending.
Its technical cooperation programs, which provide the carrot for nonnuclear countries to join, are financed in large part by the United States, which now pays nearly 40 percent of the agency's total expenses, compared with a normal assessment of 25 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Takes A Softer Tone In Auto Battle

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, June 15

 BODY:
Japan's Prime Minister struck an unexpectedly compromising tone today in talks with President Clinton about American demands to widen access to the Japanese automotive market. But the Administration's top economic officials reacted warily, saying they would not know until negotiations began next week in Geneva whether a last-minute deal might be possible.
In an hourlong meeting here, before the summit talks began among top leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama repeatedly told Mr. Clinton that he hoped to resolve the issue in the next two weeks, according to American and Japanese officials who sat in on the meeting. 
 But the Japanese trade officials who descended on this seaside city offered no specifics. And they appeared somewhat taken aback at Mr. Clinton's clear warning shot, delivered at a news conference this afternoon with Mr. Murayama. "I will not agree to extend the deadline," Mr. Clinton said, on stiff tariffs on luxury cars scheduled to go into effect on June 28 if the conflict is not resolved.
Mr. Murayama's tone was far different from the tough public Japanese stance thus far in the confrontation over autos. Still, American officials, including some of Mr. Clinton's closest economic advisers, cautioned that there might be less to the shift than appeared.
The Japanese Prime Minister's hold on power is tenuous at best -- experts say he could be forced to resign after parliamentary elections in mid-July -- and so far he has been only a bit player in a trade dispute that all sides agree has far broader implications than a disagreement over auto parts.
The real decision-maker in Tokyo thus far has been Ryutaro Hashimoto, Minister of International Trade and Industry, who sat silently at Mr. Murayama's side today as the Prime Minister met with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Hashimoto engaged in a few jocular exchanges with his American counterpart, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, before the talks began. But he gave no indication whether he was ready to back away from his statement two weeks ago that he had already made "the maximum possible concession" to Washington.
Tokyo's new tone may come from increasing nervousness in among Japanese business executives that Japan's markets are not prepared to withstand a possible shock from the imposition of sanctions at a time when the nation's hard-pressed banks are calling for Government bailouts and the economy has plunged into deflation.
But Mr. Murayama, a genial and grandfatherly figure, may also be playing out a familiar script in trade negotiations, seeking to show the Japanese public that the Government has gone the last mile to compromise with an American Administration that has been widely portrayed in Japan as bullying and unreasonable.
"Maybe it's real, maybe it's not," an American official said today. "We won't know until next Thursday," when trade negotiators from both sides are scheduled to meet in Geneva.
In his one flash of pique today, Mr. Murayama, 71, denounced the American threat to place 100 percent tariffs on $5.9 billion in Japanese luxury car imports, including the Lexus models made by Toyota, the Infiniti line from Nissan and other popular models. At the news conference Mr. Murayama said he had asked Mr. Clinton for "expeditious removal of the unilateral measures since they violate the rules and the spirit of the World Trade Organization," the new international governing body of trade.
But for much of the day, the aging Socialist, who until three years ago was not well known, even in the Japanese Parliament where he has served for seven terms, talked only of compromise. "What is important is that we do not engage in talks with both of our fists raised," he said, "but rather talk to each other in good faith and try to resolve the problem through talks."
"Where we can yield," Mr. Murayama said, "we should yield to each other, so that we should find out the ways that will lead us at the end of the day to a solution."
The chief point of contention between the two countries remains the American demand that Japan agree to some kind of "targets" or "goals" for the purchase of more American-made car parts by Japanese manufacturers. A similar agreement was struck with President Bush in 1991, but Japanese officials say that was a mistake, and that any such accord constitutes managed trade. American officials respond that Japan has managed its trade for years -- especially with Europe -- and that anything short of a concrete agreement would not solve the problem.
The question now is whether Washington and Tokyo can find a way to stitch together an accord that to the Americans looks like an ironclad commitment but that can be dressed up as something less than that by the Japanese.

HEADLINE: Republican Squabble Delays Welfare Debate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Deep ideological disagreements among Senate Republicans have forced them to delay floor debate on a welfare bill so party leaders can seek a compromise.
The disagreements involve a wide range of issues: formulas for distributing Federal money, work requirements for welfare recipients, proposals to discourage unmarried women from having babies, and the balance of power between the Federal Government and the states. 
 The disagreements are "pretty profound," said Robert Rector, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who has worked closely with Republicans on the welfare bill.
While the disputes do not jeopardize passage of a bill, they have left its shape in doubt. The disagreements have split the Senate Republican caucus into several camps, prompted nasty exchanges between Republican senators, provoked threats of a filibuster and frayed relations between Republican governors and senators.
Democrats, usually split by their own intramural fights, say they are delighted by the spectacle of Republicans squabbling among themselves. The squabbles have touched off a frantic effort by the White House and Senate Democrats to win Republican support for Democratic amendments to the bill.
"We certainly hope we can work together across party lines on this," said Bruce Reed, a White House aide, who drafted the 1991 campaign speech in which Mr. Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it."
On May 26, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill that, like a companion measure passed by the House, would freeze Federal welfare spending for five years, cancel the Federal guarantee of a subsistence income for poor children and give each state a lump sum of money to spend on the poor, with no allowance for inflation or population growth.
Some conservative Republican senators like Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina want to use the bill to try to change the behavior of welfare recipients and reduce out-of-wedlock births. "The bill doesn't do anything to reduce illegitimacy," Mr. Faircloth said in an interview today. "I absolutely intend to filibuster it."
Senator Faircloth said the bill should contain provisions like those in the House bill to reward states that reduce out-of-wedlock births and to cut off payments to unmarried teen-age mothers. He and some other conservatives also seek stricter work requirements.
But moderate Republicans say the Federal Government has no business dictating the behavior of welfare recipients and should not impose its policy preferences on states. The Senate bill, like the House measure, would eliminate Federal requirements for states to spend their own money as a condition of getting Federal welfare grants. Democrats want to require states to maintain current spending.
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, a Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, is working with Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat, on an amendment to encourage such "maintenance of effort" by the states. Aides to Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, said he would be a co-sponsor of the amendment, which is opposed by many Republican governors.
Under the proposal, a state could reduce its welfare spending below the 1994 level, but if it did so, it would lose some of its Federal money.
A summary of the proposal prepared by aides to the three Senators says it would "give states a financial stake in welfare reform, making them more accountable to both state and Federal taxpayers." States now contribute 43 percent of the money spent on the main welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children; the states' share amounts to $10 billion of $23 billion this year.
Republican governors say they should not be required to keep spending at that level if they can reduce poverty and put welfare recipients to work with innovative programs.
Under the bill, each state would get the same amount of Federal money it received for cash assistance to poor people in 1994. Republican senators from the South and the West, led by Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, are demanding a different formula that would distribute Federal money according to the number of poor children in each state. Fourteen states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, would lose money under the proposal.
Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, denounced the proposal. "This is not welfare reform," he said. "It's a redistribution of dollars. It shifts money to Texas and Florida. It penalizes states like New York that have met their moral obligation to take care of impoverished children."
The "formula fight" is distressing to some party members. "Republicans should not be fighting with one another over how to divide up the spoils of the welfare state," said a Republican Senate aide.
The campaign for block grants is led by Republican governors. Gov. John Engler of Michigan, one of the chief proponents, attended a Republican caucus on Wednesday and urged senators to create a block grant with no strings attached.
Senator Faircloth objected to Mr. Engler's presence. "I find it most unusual for a Governor to lecture us at a meeting called for senators to talk among themselves," he said.

HEADLINE: Reliving Volunteer Work in the South

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., June 10

 BODY:
In the spring of 1964, Robert Ostrow was the epitome of an establishment lawyer. Living in Scarsdale, N.Y., practicing tax law, never having had a black classmate in 15 years of graduate school, Mr. Ostrow could not have lived a life more removed from the turbulent civil rights struggle being waged in the Deep South.
"I was not involved in any social movement," Mr. Ostrow said in a recent interview. "I didn't know there were problems. I was completely isolated." 
 Then one day he gazed at the scarred face of a friend who had been beaten by a group of whites while providing legal help for civil rights workers in St. Augustine, Fla.
"When he came home, he was bloody and scabbed around his face," Mr. Ostrow said. "I just became outraged that lawyers who went to help young people register people to vote were at risk."
Mr. Ostrow contacted the Lawyers' Constitutional Defense Committee, a group that sent volunteer lawyers south from 1964 to 1971 to provide legal work for civil rights protesters whom Southern white lawyers routinely refused to defend. Initially, he worked in Mississippi, then later provided legal aid to the the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Selma, Ala.
Mr. Ostrow was not alone in his desire to serve. About 250 lawyers volunteered for the defense committee's program in the 1960's. And about 75 of them gathered here recently for a reunion, 31 years after the group began its work.
At first, they said, the jobs were mostly technical -- appearing at bail hearings or trying to transfer routine criminal suits against civil rights workers from hostile state courts to the more sympathetic Federal courts.
"I probably did work that was more intellectually challenging later on," said John L. Saltonstall Jr., who took three weeks off from his corporate practice in Boston in 1964 to represent a group of black civil rights workers who were being sued for libel in northern Mississippi. "But I probably never did any work that was more exciting."
These volunteers were sent to the toughest part of the South -- Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana -- where resistance to black progress was most entrenched. And, though there were no instances of lawyers being harmed as had happened in Florida, the environment was terrifying.
Talking to a visitor over breakfast, George R. Hinckley, a lawyer from Manhattan, reached into a file folder full of memories and pulled out a note he wrote to himself in 1964 as he drove from New Orleans into Mississippi and listened to the latest news on the radio. "Goodman, Chaney, Schwerner still missing," the note said, referring to the three civil rights workers who were later found murdered near Philadelphia, Miss.
Veterans of the Lawyers' Constitutional Defense Committee said the real heroes of the civil rights movements were Southern blacks who stood up to segregation, and not the lawyers who volunteered for a typical two- or three-week assignment, then returned north.
Still, the volunteers' contributions were critical, especially in the early days when lawyers were desperately needed to represent civil rights workers who were being locked up on any charge the authorities could fashion. Local white lawyers, fearing economic isolation, refused to represent anyone challenging segregation. And there were few black lawyers in the South. In Mississippi, for example, there were only four black lawyers in the entire state.
Later, the defense committee and other groups like the Lawyers Guild of America moved from bailing civil rights workers out of jail to gathering evidence of harassment of blacks who tried to register to vote.
For many lawyers who volunteered with the defense committee, their work was a watershed, inspiring them to forgo corporate law for careers in areas like civil rights or environmental law, or at least to devote more time to pro bono work.
"I was practicing in a large law firm and I never went back to it," said Mike Nadler who worked in New Orleans and in Mississippi in 1964 and who later ran for Congress from New York. "I don't know if it turned around my life or if it was ready to be turned around anyway. But it did."
The work also contributed to the transformation of the South. In Mississippi now, there are some 300 black lawyers and nearly 900 state, local and Federal elected officials -- the highest number of any state in the nation. One of the panels at the group's reunion was moderated by Fred L. Banks Jr. the first black to sit on the Mississippi Supreme Court, which is elected.
Mr. Ostrow, who since his time in Mississippi has helped set up the National Welfare Rights Organization, said: "We were there for a principle, but I never thought we would be able to change things. At the time I was so depressed that I wouldn't have bet a quarter that we would have prevailed. But we did."

HEADLINE: Items Dear to Council Ease Budget Approval

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
On their way to approving New York City's new $31.1 billion budget near dawn yesterday morning, the City Council sat patiently through hours of committee meetings and weighty discussions about finance, debt and bond ratings.
As the hours dragged by, many Council members grew bleary-eyed. Some nodded off. But suddenly, heads snapped up and attention sharpened decidedly when, about 1 A.M., Speaker Peter F. Vallone's staff at last distributed to each Council member a list of so-called Council initiatives, a package of pork-barrel projects, New York City style. Together they cost about $9 million. 
 Mr. Vallone allowed Council members who planned to vote in favor of the budget to apportion $80,000 apiece in any way they choose. Dissenters were allowed to dole out only $50,000, leaving the Speaker to decide how the rest would be spent.
The Council went on to approve the budget by a vote of 45 to 5, with one member absent. But the release of "member items," as they are also called, appeared to be the most spellbinding moment of the long night of budget discussion, far eclipsing any of the talks on the austere city budget, which will cut a wide array of city services.
"The fact is that the largest impact Council members have in the budget is in the small amount of money they give to community groups in their districts," noted Chris Meyer, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group who follows the Council. "It is the thing that resonates the most in their district because it is the biggest barometer in the district of the effectiveness of the member. So it means everything to them."
In some cases the amounts are small, with very few being in six figures. Among the "Council initiatives" were $9,000 for the Staten Island Ice Hockey Association, a group that provides transportation for children to skating rinks; Hellenic Public Radio, an organization that provides Greek news and other programming on radio. The Tibet Museum received $2,500; the N.A.A.C.P. was awarded $1,563 and the New York Junior Tennis League received $185,909.
Council members said each one received $80,000 for his or her district. But those who were expected to support the budget had money allotted to the organizations they requested. For those who opposed the budget, Mr. Vallone's staff controlled the disbursement of $30,000 of the allocation. That practice in itself was a new one. In previous years Mr. Vallone reduced the total allocation for dissenters to $50,000.
Some Council members, however, have received even more than the $80,000 allocation. One was Jerome X. O'Donovan, a Democrat who represents the North Shore of Staten Island. Mr. O'Donovan said that Mr. Vallone made $155,000 in member items available to him this year. He is chairman of the Council's Economic Development Committee. He said that he was merely being rewarded for being loyal to the Speaker and for being a Council leader with 12 years of seniority.
"I got that much because I'm in leadership," Mr. O'Donovan said. "Sometimes there is more money to give to people in leadership positions. That's the way it goes."
Some Council members have speculated that it was Mr. Vallone's way of assisting Mr. O'Donovan, who is considered a likely contender for the position of Staten Island Borough president if the Republican incumbent, Guy V. Molinari, is successful in unseating the current District Attorney, William L. Murphy, a Democrat, in a race in November.
The all-night session included little of the harsh criticism of the budget that had been prevalent at City Hall in the two months after the Mayor unveiled his plan. Instead, one Council member after another praised their legislature, saying that it had been the Council that had made Mr. Giuliani's budget more humane by restoring funds for youth programs, hospitals and capital projects for schools.
"We took a lemon and made it just a little bit sweeter," said Lawrence A. Warden, a Democrat who represents the Baychester section of the Bronx. "It's not perfect, but the Council has improved upon it tremendously."
After the Council passed the budget, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sat in Mr. Vallone's office with a number of mayoral aides, Council leaders and staff members. Both the Mayor and the Speaker praised the budget as a document, rejecting criticism that some of the revenue estimates were based upon unrealistic assumptions.
Feelings about "member items" among the Council members seems to be mixed. Not surprisingly, the major critics are either those who vote against the budget, or who are not considered to be in senior leadership positions.
"A lot of good government groups think it's just pork and to some extent that's true," said Charles Millard, a Republican who represents the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "The fact is that a lot of smaller groups get funded that would not otherwise make it on the radar screen."
But Mr. Millard said "the problem with the system is that, even though everybody is supposed to get a certain amount of money, the reality is that everybody gets a certain amount. But the favored few get more."


GRAPHIC: The newly adopted $31 billionbudget for New York City includes more than $8 millionin spending for what are traditionally known as "Council initiatives" or "member items." The money is spread among hundreds of arts groups, neighbohood associations, religious organizations and social service agencies that are favorites of Council members. Here are a few highlights:
 
1. The papers of former Mayor Edward I. Koch are overseen by LaGuardia Community College in Queens and have fallen into disarray. Mice have chewed away at the edges, said one Council official. The grant was secured by Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who learned, whild inquiring about the possibility of creating a City Council Archive, that the former mayor's papers were growing ever more disordered.
 
2. A group based in Astoria, Queens, that provides roughly 12 hours of news and information programming on WNYE-FM in English and Greek. That grant, too, was secured by Speaker Vallone.
 
3. A Brooklyn organization that helps rehabilitate houses and administers some yough programs. The grant was secured by Councilman Noach Dear, a Democrat of Brooklyn.
 
4. Sponsored by Republican Councilmen Vito J. Fossella Jr. and John A. Fusco. The money pays for more than 1,000 Staten Island children to travel elsewhere for practice since Staten Island has onlyone hockey rink.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Output Falls in 3d Straight Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
American industry cut production in May for the third consecutive month, the longest stretch of falling output since the final stages of the recession that ended in early 1991, the Federal Reserve said today.
At the same time, the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities -- a widely followed gauge of inflation risk with a close correlation to short-term interest rates -- retreated for the fourth consecutive month, to a pace now below that of May 1994. 
 Analysts took the figures, together with other data from the Labor Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, as further confirmation of what has become sharp deceleration of the economy from the torrid pace of late 1994.
Indeed, the ranks of those calling for the Fed to cut interest rates continued to swell.
But Alan S. Blinder, vice chairman of the Fed, dampened the expectations of a cut in rates by telling a lunch audience in Minneapolis today that despite some rocky quarters ahead for the economy, a recession was unlikely and that, moreover, the effort by the Fed to fight inflation "cannot be ended at 3 percent."
Mr. Blinder also said the Fed could tolerate higher inflation for a single year as long as it was on a downward path for the longer term. His comments helped send Treasury prices lower.
Despite today's data, many analysts agreed with Mr. Blinder that a recession remained unlikely.
"I think this shows an economy still in the midst of a temporary inventory adjustment," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. "But the forces of adjustment are both contained and now moderating."
There were signs of that moderation in the figures released today. The decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in industrial production last month was not only less than that of April and half of what was generally anticipated for May, it included sizable advances in business equipment and, a bit surprisingly in light of recent slack consumer demand, in appliances and television sets.
Still, a growing number of economists have urged the Federal Reserve, which is approaching a crucial policy meeting in early July, to cut short-term interest rates to head off a possible downturn.
"There is plenty of evidence that the economy is weak enough to need a boost from an easier Fed," Rosanne M. Cahn, chief economist for equity research at CS First Boston, said in a statement. She said the third consecutive decline in production was "a rare event for nonrecession times."
The decline in industrial output was largely a result of a drop of 3.9 percent in motor vehicles and parts, a sector particularly burdened by slumping sales and rising inventories this spring. Not counting the automotive industry, industrial production would have been unchanged from its April level, the Fed noted.
Vehicle assembly was at an annual pace of 11.4 million in May, down from 12.1 million, with automobiles down the most and the heavy and medium truck category holding steady.
The output of industrial equipment, however, turned up three-tenths of 1 percent, after two consecutive declines, and there was a rise of 2 percent for computers and other office equipment, the fourth consecutive advance at least that large.
Over all, production fell three-tenths of 1 percent at factories and 1 percent at mines, but rose six-tenths of 1 percent at utilities.
The industrial operating rate eased for a fourth consecutive month, to 83.7 percent, from 84.2 percent, leaving it 1.8 points below its recent high of December and January.
Plants turning out cars and light trucks ran at only 79.4 percent of capacity last month, far below the average of slightly less than 91 percent during the first three months of the year, when some workers at the General Motors Corporation struck briefly for being forced to work too much overtime.
In a separate report, the first-time claims for unemployment benefits edged down 5,000 last week, to 371,000, but the claims for the week of June 3 were revised up 4,000. That helped to lift the claims for the latest four weeks, to an average of 376,500, the highest level since October 1992. It was the eighth consecutive rise for the four-week moving average.
Yet another indicator today was the Philadelphia Fed's Business Outlook survey, whose index of general business conditions for the region fell to minus 24.3 in June from minus 16.4, the third consecutive decline and the first such streak since April 1991.
Nearly all its large components remained in negative territory, with significant declines in new orders, shipments and unfilled orders. The "prices paid" subcomponent also continued to fall in in June.
"These data are extremely significant as they offer one of the first indications of how the economy is faring during June -- apparently not well," analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said.

Bagpipes and Bailouts as Leaders Gather

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, June 15

 BODY:
Leaders of seven major industrial democracies sat down today to their self-appointed task of overhauling the world's financial institutions to better handle crises like the crash of the Mexican peso that shook world financial markets early this year.
To the skirl of Scottish bagpipes and the flag waving of hundreds of cheering onlookers, the leaders arrived in this center of Canada's Atlantic provinces, and after ceremonies under a sunny sky went into a working dinner to discuss financial matters. 
 Before the dinner, President Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, sought to prevent a festering trade dispute over cars and car parts from overshadowing the economic summit meeting in this port city. But it was unclear whether their trade lieutenants would be able to resolve the conflict at another round of talks scheduled June 22-23 in Geneva.
Their discussions shortly after arriving in Halifax for the annual gathering of the Group of Seven left open the possibility of a compromise to forestall trade sanctions President Clinton has ordered to go into effect on June 28.
In the background of the economic discussions is an enormous increase in international financial transactions, which has accentuated the vulnerability of markets to shocks like the one from the peso devaluation. To prevent the collapse of the Mexican economy, the United States and the International Monetary Fund pumped nearly $40 billion into support for the peso.
Over the last decade, bond issues have tripled, securities transactions have increased more than tenfold, and foreign exchange transactions have quadrupled to $1 trillion a day, according to the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based institution that tries to help countries in financial trouble.
"We cannot simply expect those famous currency speculators to shut off their computer terminals, hang up their red suspenders and get a life," said Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, the host at the three-day summit meeting. "But what we can do -- what we must do -- is take effective, concrete action to minimize the vulnerability of national economies."
Among measures the leaders will look at are ways to improve the early-warning capabilities of the I.M.F. to respond more quickly to crises and to increase its resources to permit faster such response.
A senior Canadian official said the measures would mean that "various surprises in the market will be much less likely in the future."
Another idea on the front burner, Canadian and American officials said, is the creation of a kind of international bankruptcy court in which the I.M.F. could stop debt payments by insolvent nations, organize new borrowing, and approve a plan to pay off creditors, much as courts now do under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings with private corporations.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin accompanied the President here, along with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor.
In an attempt to reassure investors that Washington supports a stronger dollar, Mr. Rubin said after a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, that he and Mr. Takemura had reaffirmed a finance ministers' assessment that exchange rates in Group of Seven countries were "out of sync with the fundamentals."
Japanese officials attribute their country's weakening economic performance this year to the persistent strength of the yen.
At the April meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington, a closing statement spoke of the need for an "orderly reversal of exchange rate movements."
The leaders of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- arrived at Shearwater, a Canadian Forces base near here. In separate entourages, they sailed across one of the world's deepest harbors into Halifax.
The Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, joins the Group of Seven leaders on Friday for political discussions that are almost certain to include conditions in Bosnia, where more than 15,000 Bosnian Government troops are massed around Sarajevo for what looks like preparation for a major offensive.
President Clinton's party took 20 minutes to cross the harbor aboard a brilliantly orange-colored 300-foot Canadian icebreaker, the Sir William Alexander.
As they neared a wharf in the restored waterfront, a bagpiper pealed out a Scottish ballad from a bluff on nearby St. George's Island. A squad of eight police boats, equipped with twin 150-horsepower engines, flanked the Presidential vessel.
Although security is tight around a downtown square kilometer known as the "red zone," where the meetings are being held, there was an air of festivity and celebration, which had all the trappings of a giant Nova Scotia kitchen party.
Two outdoor rock bands drowned out the bagpipes. Buildings flew the Canadian maple leaf, the Union Jack and the blue cross of St. Andrew, the flag of Nova Scotia.
Canadian authorities have encouraged people to come downtown.

In search of global diversity? France may offer new promise.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado 

 BODY:
INVESTORS in the United States who seek global diversity might do well to consider France, now that the uncertainty surrounding the recent Presidential election there has passed.
Unlike emerging markets like Mexico, which can carry sizable risks, an industrialized country like France offers investors the promise of a stable economy with stable growth. 
 France's economic landscape is viewed as improving despite questions about the newly elected President, Jacques Chirac, and his ambitious plans to tackle the high unemployment rate, which has been hovering around 12 percent. For instance, capital investment is expected to increase 10 percent this year, far faster than 1994's growth of 1 percent. Olivier Davanne, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, expects French inflation of about 1.7 percent this year, the lowest among Western European countries and well below the region's average projected rate of 2.9 percent.
At the same time, gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 1996, according to a report on the French economy by S. G. Warburg Securities. That should lift French corporate earnings.
Still, Americans seeking to invest in individual French companies may face some difficulty. Only eight stocks in the CAC 40 Index, the 40-stock index that is the Paris exchange's equivalent of the Dow Jones industrial average, trade here, in the form of American depository receipts.
"Some of the higher-quality stocks do not trade on U.S. exchanges -- a clear deterrent for many prospective investors who are unlikely to traverse the unfamiliar terrain of the Paris bourse," said Bruce Watts, a closed-end-fund analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company.
An easier path, Mr. Watts suggested, is the France Growth Fund, the only closed-end country fund exclusively covering French stocks. Like open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds hold a portfolio of securities, but they trade as stocks on exchanges. Their per-share net asset value represents the current value of their securities, such as stocks and bonds. When a fund's quoted stock price exceeds the net asset value, the fund trades at a premium; when it is less than the net asset value, the stock trades at a discount.
From its start in May 1990 through the first quarter of 1995, the France Growth Fund has raised its net asset value by 11.4 percent. That compares to a loss of nearly 9 percent in the same period registered by the Societe de Bourse Francais 120 Index, a broad French market index.
The France Growth Fund is selling well below its net asset value, closing yesterday at $10.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The closing price equates to a 16.7 percent discount to the net asset value of $12.30. The discount and the outlook for an improving French economy have led some observers to conclude that now is a favorable time to buy the fund.
"The France Growth Fund is an easy way to play the economic progress of the country," said Steven Vannelli, a managing director at the KJMM Investment Management Company in San Francisco. The fund gives investors a diversified selection of French companies, "all of them quality companies," he said. "The fund is fully invested and just in French stocks -- a much, much better deal than, say, a Europe fund."
Mr. Vannelli also said that "the fund is not busy turning over assets." He said the fund was not concerned about adjusting its portfolio each quarter to look as strong as possible and said that its turnover rate had ranged between 40 and 57 percent during the last three years, compared with rates of 100 to 200 percent for open-end funds. The turnover rate measures the volume of buying and selling of securities in a portfolio; high turnover increases transaction costs and can lower a fund's value.
Guy de Froment, chairman of Indosuez International Investment Services, the adviser to the France Growth Fund, expects capital goods companies, commercial banks and companies that provide services to businesses and consumers to be among the industry groups benefiting from French economic growth. The France Growth Fund's stock portfolio, which is now made up of about 70 issues, is skewed to these sectors.
Among specific stocks favored by the fund are Groupe Danone, the maker of Dannon Yogurt; Compagnie Generale des Eaux, a major waterworks and infrastructure developer, and Banque National de Paris.

Prices Decline as Traders See Less Chance of Rate Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday after comments by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan S. Blinder, that many traders saw as falling short of guaranteeing a cut in interest rates soon.
Mr. Blinder, speaking before the Minnesota Meeting, a group of business and civic leaders, said that retail prices were increasing too quickly and that the Fed must push annual inflation down to less than 3 percent. "The inflation-fighting effort of the Federal Reserve cannot be ended at 3 percent," he said. 
 Mr. Blinder said inflation would accelerate in 1995 from its 2.7 percent annual rate of 1993 and 1994. In the long run, he added, the Fed should continue to keep inflation under control but refrain from trying to stimulate the economy. He said this would be self-defeating because too high a growth rate would ignite inflation.
Mr. Blinder's comments seemed to tip the scales yesterday, after a host of economic news earlier in the day gave mixed signals on whether the economy was slowing enough to subdue inflation, analysts said.
A larger-than-expected drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve index of regional manufacturing for June caused bond prices to jump in early trading, as the index fell to -24.3 from -16.4. Economists had expected numbers ranging from -13 to -9.
The price components of the index fell in June, as employment edged up and inventories rose. The decline in the overall index marked the third consecutive monthly drop.
After the initial gain on the news, however, bond prices settled back. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 16/32 of a percentage point, to 1136/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.61 percent from 6.57 percent on Wednesday. Short-term bill rates rose by an average of 3 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Investors scrutinized Mr. Blinder's comments for hints of possible Federal Reserve action at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 5 and 6. Mr. Blinder also said that the United States was "close to functional price stability" and that timing was key in monetary policy.
Traders see Mr. Blinder as a dove on monetary policy, and if they were looking for a sign of an easing in interest rates, they came away disappointed.
Even before Mr. Blinder spoke, traders noted that the market was having a tough time holding at current price levels without proof that the Fed would be easing rates soon.
Some early weakness came after smaller-than-expected drops in May industrial production and capacity utilization, suggesting that there was still strength in the economy. Production fell 0.2 percent, less than forecasts of a 0.4 percent decline; capacity utilization slipped to 83.7 percent, but still higher than expectations of 83.5 percent.
The number of weekly jobless claims fell to 371,000 for the week that ended on June 10, slightly less than forecasts of 373,000. The total for the previous week was revised to 376,000 from 372,000.
Most market participants had no quarrel with the overall sanguine tone of the Treasury market, only with its over-eager anticipatory pricing. "It is not hard to visualize a scenario in which the Fed actually eases and the market subsequently gets crushed," one trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Gary Thayer, a senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said he thought the industrial production number was significant in that "it not only tells us where we are, but where we may be headed down the road."
"What we're seeing now is the economy in a sharp inventory correction, which appears due in a large part to cuts in auto production," he said. "We think the worst of the inventory problem is well behind us and we're telling people that the economy may get a second wind in the second half of the year."
The key for bondholders, he said, is the course of commodity prices and inflation expectations as the economy picks up.
"We still think there are inflation risks out there, so we remain a little cautious on bonds," he said. "Today we are seeing sharp increases in industrial and precious metals prices. We've even seen an uptrend in copper prices developing for over a month and it's now close to old highs, which suggest that the economy is not falling apart. There is still good demand in a tight supply situation."

HEADLINE: Plan to Build Incinerator Faces Delay

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration plans to postpone construction of the Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator for an additional three years and is reconsidering whether to build the plant at all, according to a draft of the city's new solid-waste management plan.
The incinerator, on the drawing boards for 10 years and considered a central element in New York City's plans to reduce dependence on the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, has drawn passionate opposition from Brooklyn communities and faced a series of court challenges. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was lukewarm about the plant as a mayoral candidate, has nevertheless continued to pursue plans to construct the plant. But in his new budget he postponed financing it for two years, until 1998.
And in a draft proposal of the city's new strategy for dealing with solid waste, the Sanitation Department said it wants to determine whether it still makes economic sense to build the plant now that the cost of exporting solid waste has gone down and the city has so many other pressures on its budget.
An aide to the Mayor, however, said Mr. Giuliani still wants to keep the incinerator as an option.
"He prefers not to build the incinerator," said Colleen Roche, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary. "But he is not going to close off that option, depending on the future solid-waste needs of the city."
When the city developed plans to build the incinerator in the mid-1980's, it was to be the first of several trash incinerators that would be used to burn most of the 26,000 tons of garbage the city generates each day. The incinerators would take pressure off Fresh Kills landfill, which is expected to be filled to capacity within two decades.
The city had originally intended to start construction of the $450 million Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator in 1996, with operation scheduled to begin in 1999.
But the draft of the city's new solid-waste plan says the construction will not begin until 1999, if at all, since it still faces a host of legal, regulatory and financial hurdles. During that time, the city will study the economic feasibility of the plant.
The Sanitation Department said in its draft proposal that an economic study of the plant is important, "given the changes in the city's fiscal situation" and the reduced cost of exporting solid wastes.
Opponents of the incinerator portrayed the city's decision to postpone construction of the plant as a victory.
"Every day that goes by without a shovel in the ground is a day that brings us closer to the abandonment of the plant," said Kenneth K. Fisher, the City Councilman who represents the neighborhoods around the plant, which would be built on the outskirts of Williamsburg by the East River.
Opponents have said that emissions from the plant would harm the rejuvenation of surrounding neighborhoods and that the city should be emphasizing other ways to get rid of its garbage, like recycling.
The officials said they are looking at alternatives to burning the city's garbage. The city's priorities are decreasing the amount of garbage produced by city residents, expanding the city recycling program, and sending garbage to landfills outside the city.
The plant still faces a series of regulatory hurdles, according to the State Department of Environmental Conservation. For instance, the city must still provide a study of the incinerator's impact on the public health before receiving permission to begin construction, and must study whether the site has a Revolutionary War gravesite.
Paul Gallay, regional attorney for the environmental department, said could not estimate how long either study would take.
The draft solid-waste plan also recommends re-evaluating the city's plan to reopen the southwest Brooklyn incinerator in Gravesend. The city had originally planned to begin the renovation of the incinerator in 1993, but the construction was delayed by legal and environmental questions.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Versus Yen and Mark As Meeting of Group of 7 Begins

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher against leading currencies yesterday, reflecting a widespread reluctance by traders to do any speculative selling as the summit meeting of big industrialized nations convened.
The Group of Seven nations have previously pledged their commitment to a stable dollar. That commitment was supported last month as the Federal Reserve and a dozen other central banks bought dollars in a coordinated effort that caught many currency dealers, who had sold dollars, off guard. 
 Although the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States said nothing new about the dollar yesterday as they began gathering in Halifax, Nova Scotia, there was no desire by currency dealers to test their resolve.
"People are just waiting for something to come out of the G-7 meeting," Michael R. Rosenberg, a managing director at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. "No one is going to take a bet over the weekend."
The dollar was also helped by traders who had earlier sold the dollar short, or bet the currency would fall, and were fearful they had erred. As the summit meeting began, these traders bought back dollars, creating what is known as a short-covering rally.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.4063 German marks from 1.4003 marks on Wednesday. The dollar rose to 84.52 Japanese yen from 84.39 yen. The British pound fell to $1.6007 from $1.6118.
Economic data released yesterday that suggested more weakness in the economy seemed to have little effect on the dollar.
The Federal Reserve said the nation's industrial output fell in May for a third consecutive month -- the first time that has happened since the recession of 1991. A business survey conducted by the Federal Reserve in Philadelphia, a barometer of broader trends, also showed more signs of sluggishness.
The dollar market "wasn't surprised by the U.S. economic data that were reported this morning," said Carol A. Stone, a senior economist with Nomura Securities International.
As currency trading waned in the late afternoon, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, held a news conference restating their positions on the American attempt to open Japanese markets to American auto manufacturers. But currency dealers said the dollar was not influenced significantly by their remarks.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Price Makes Sharp Gains; Copper and Soybeans Also Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gold prices jumped to an eight-week high yesterday on concern that production will fall in South Africa, just as demand is growing in China.
"Gold is in a severe supply deficit," said Leanne Baker, precious metals analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. She predicts that gold prices will rise to $500 an ounce during the current economic cycle. 
 On other markets, copper rose to a two-month high, and soybeans gained, driving the Commodity Research Bureau index up 1.98 points, to 235.75.
"South African mine production is faltering more than most market observers anticipated, and worldwide mine production seems likely to be steady at best for the next several years," Ms. Baker said. At the same time, demand from China "was twice as high" as the roughly 203 metric tons estimated by Gold Fields Mineral Services.
Gold for August delivery gained $3.30, to $393.90 an ounce, its highest since April 20. Other precious metals also rose, with July silver surging 12.8 cents, to $5.445 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, and July platinum rising $6, to $443.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Traders are concerned that there may be a prolonged strike in South Africa, the world's largest gold producer. Miners, disappointed that promises made by Nelson Mandela's Government have not been fulfilled since he took office in April 1994, are demanding wage increases as large as 20 percent, traders said.
"South Africa is going to produce less gold as time goes by at a higher price," said Leonard Kaplan, vice president and chief trader for the Imperial Bank in Los Angeles.
South Africa produced 583.9 metric tons of gold in 1994, according to Gold Fields Mineral Services, a quarter of the world's total mine production.
Copper prices rose to a two-month high as low inventories globally and in the United States showed consumption was outstripping new supply.
Copper for July delivery rose 4.10 cents, to $1.3895 a pound on the Commodity Exchange in New York, the highest price since April 11.
Soybean prices rose for a third day as hot and dry weather threatened to stunt the growth of young plants that were already suffering from delays in planting because of previous heavy rains.
Soybeans for July delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade rose 6.75 cents a bushel, to $5.9225 a bushel.
Other commodities settled as follows:
Livestock: July Live Hogs, down 1.375 cent at 45.225 cents a pound; July pork bellies, up 1.225 cents, to 39.275 cents a pound; August live cattle, down 0.9 cent, to 60.825 cents a pound; August feeder cattle, down 1.35 cents, to 64.275 cents a pound; July cocoa, up $7, at $1,293 a ton, and July orange juice, up 2.9 cents, to $1.038 a pound.

HEADLINE: The Top Pizzas In New York: Bred and Baked By Tradition

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
MANY words have been used to explain New York pizza, but one word stands out: tradition.
Respect for tradition is why New York pizzerias go to such lengths to link themselves to the great pizzerias of the past. Tradition explains why Andrew Bellucci called the pizzeria he opened in SoHo last year Lombardi's, after the restaurant opened on Spring Street in 1905 by Gennaro Lombardi, an Italian immigrant who is credited with introducing pizza to New York City. Tradition explains why Mr. Bellucci was able to get the founder's grandson and namesake, Gennaro Lombardi, to advise him in the new venture. 
 Tradition also explains why three New York pizzerias are called Patsy's: the original, which opened in East Harlem in the 1930's; seven-year-old Patsy's in Brooklyn, and a new Patsy's in Murray Hill. Both of the newer Patsy's claim a connection to the original. Not surprisingly, each disputes the other's claim.
And tradition goes a long way toward explaining the success of Nick's Pizza in Forest Hills, Queens. Although it opened just last year, its respect for the tradition of great New York pizza-making is evident in every delicious bite.
New York City's own style of pizza is so dominant that many New Yorkers may not realize that New Haven is renowned for its brittle-skinned clam pizzas, or that Chicago is the epicenter of the deep-dish pizza, a vital tradition itself. It's common to hear that New York has the best pizza in the country. Whether this is true or not, much of the pizza sold in New York is not very good. That's because most pizzas in New York either are made to be sold by the slice, meaning they are pre-cooked and reheated, which is ill treatment no matter how good the ingredients, or are made to be delivered, which allows a hot pizza to wilt in its cardboard prison.
The invasion of the designer pizza, individual-size pizzas that are often cooked in wood-burning ovens and topped with ingredients from prosciutto to artichoke hearts, has been a good thing for pizza lovers. In truth, good designer pizzas may come the closest to reproducing authentic Italian pizzas. But they are not traditional New York pies.
True New York pizzas are thin crusted, cooked quickly in a very hot oven (traditionally coal-fired) to a charred, smoky crispness, and topped with simple ingredients: tomato sauce or chopped tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and the optional sausage, peppers, mushrooms or anchovies. And true New York pizza makers, particularly those using coal ovens, are artists, shifting and moving the dough within the oven as it cooks, equalizing the effect of hot spots.
There are hundreds of pizzerias in New York City, and just as many opinions on which are the best. Here are 10 of the most noteworthy New York pizzerias, focusing on those that specialize in whole pies ($10 to $18 apiece, depending on extra ingredients) and listed in order of preference.
 
John's Pizzeria
278 Bleecker Street (between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue), Manhattan, (212) 243-1680.
The dining room of John's sprawls outward, as if it had annexed neighboring spaces by eminent domain, yet it still can't contain the crowds that are drawn here by the restaurant's reputation for legendary pizza. John's earns its reputation every day. This is classic New York pizza, with wonderful thin crust, smoky from the coal oven and just crisp enough to offer resistance to the tooth, made with fresh, creamy mozzarella, the restaurant's own tomato sauce, delicious crumbled sausage and fresh-roasted peppers. Yet what really sets John's apart is the expert economy of its pizzas: no waste and no excessive ingredients piled on for show, just flavor, texture and a regard for tradition.
With booths and tables crammed into all available space, amenities are few at John's, and service is brusque. But as at delicatessens, grumpiness can be rationalized as charm.
John's has opened two branches, at 408 East 64th Street and at 48 West 65th Street. Both make fine pizza, but the original John's is still the best.
 
Nick's Pizza
108-26 Ascan Avenue (near Austin Street), Forest Hills, Queens, (718) 263-1126.
Nick's has been open only since the spring of 1994, yet it seems imbued with age-old tradition, or rather, respect for tradition. From the swinging Sinatra music in the background to the wood floor, tin ceiling with ceiling fans, blue Formica tables, teal booths and big plate-glass windows, Nick's was built to look and feel like a traditional New York pizza parlor, with the added bonus of an up-to-date concern with the comfort of its clientele. The menu says, "No Slices!" just as John's does, yet at Nick's, it sounds pleasant rather than gruff.
Nonetheless, pizza is serious business at Nick's. It's hard to imagine a better crust: blackened and just barely crisp, glistening, golden and blistered around the edges, with a smoky flavor that seems impossible to obtain with a gas oven like Nick's. And the toppings more than stand up to the crust: terrific sausage rich with character; fresh, pure mozzarella; delicious roasted peppers and mushrooms, and each pie garnished with strips of fresh basil. Nick's menu doesn't stray far from pizza, but what little else it offers is just as good: grilled calzones, stuffed with cheese and prosciutto, with a wonderfully puffy crust; very good arugula salads and Caesar salads, and a first-class cannoli with pistachio nuts embedded in the crisp crust.
Nick's manages to pay homage to the past without being limited by it, a feat that entails its own compromises, like waiters walking around with pepper mills the size of yardsticks. Nonetheless, its achievement is showing how good and modern pizza can be in the 1990's.
 
Patsy's Pizza
19 Old Fulton Street (between Water and Front Streets), Fulton Ferry District, Brooklyn, (718) 858-4300.
Patsy's is threatening to become the Ray's of New York's pizza elite. That is, dozens of by-the-slice places are called Ray's, Famous Ray's, Original Ray's, etc., and now there are three Patsy's. Unlike the Ray's pizzerias, though, nobody disputes the origin of Patsy's. The original Patsy's opened in East Harlem in 1932. The original Patsy, Patsy Lancieri, died several years ago, and his family sold that pizzeria, which is being renovated. But now two other Patsy's claim a relationship to the original: a Patsy's that opened last year in Murray Hill, and this one, hidden in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge.
The owner of the Brooklyn Patsy's, Patsy Grimaldi, says he is the nephew of Patsy Lancieri. While other pizza makers may dispute that claim, the legacy of the original Patsy's thin-crust pizza, cooked in a coal-fired brick oven, lives on in Brooklyn. So does the Patsy's obsession with Frank Sinatra, reputed to have been a regular at the original. Photos of the early Sinatra, photos of the late Sinatra, and photos, newspaper clippings and posters of all Sinatras in between line the walls. Needless to say, there's a jukebox. Don't ask who predominates.
From any vantage point in the brightly lighted dining room, diners can see the pizza bakers in the open kitchen slapping the dough, ladling out fragrant tomato sauce, sprinkling fresh mozzarella and basil leaves, fennel-laced sausage, slivers of pepperoni and roasted peppers. They can watch as pies are shoveled into the big coal-fired brick oven and removed, still bubbling. The pies arrive quickly, the crust thin and crisp in the center, blackened and blistered around the dense and bready edges. If it's not quite so flavorful as John's or Nick's, it's wonderful in its own right.
Patsy's also serves a good traditional cannoli and a delicious cappuccino, stratified layers of steamed milk, espresso and foamed milk clearly visible in the tall glass mugs. Service is swift, friendly and efficient. But you have to like Sinatra.
 
Lombardi's
32 Spring Street (between Mulberry and Mott Streets), SoHo, (212) 941-7994.
The original Lombardi's was opened on Spring Street in 1905 by Gennaro Lombardi, who is often credited with introducing pizza to New York City.
Andrew Bellucci, the owner of this Lombardi's, had made pies at Two Boots and Three of Cups, and wanted to open his own place. He sought out Gennaro Lombardi's grandson and namesake, who still owned the building at 53 Spring Street that housed the old Lombardi's. Mr. Lombardi agreed to teach Mr. Bellucci what he knew about pizza making, to give him recipes and to act in a general supervisory role once the new venture opened.
Just down the block on Spring Street, Mr. Bellucci found an old bakery with a coal oven. The bakery had been closed for 21 years, but the oven was still there, a crucial factor because city environmental law permits existing coal ovens to be used but does not permit new ones to be installed. They were in business.
This small, handsome restaurant has a floor of tiny white tiles, red-and-white tablecloths, booths for about 45 people and a small cement garden in back. Photos of the original Lombardi's adorn the brick and stucco walls.
The Lombardi's crust is glorious: light, thin, crisp yet elastic, blackened and blistered and full of the smoky flavor that comes from the coal oven. The mozzarella is fresh and hand cut, the tomato sauce is decent, and toppings like roasted peppers and thin slices of dry Italian sausage are fine. It is worthy of the Lombardi name.

Patsy's Pizzeria
509 Third Avenue (at 34th Street), Murray Hill, (212) 689-7500.
According to Patsy's menu, Patsy Lancieri, founder of the original Patsy's in East Harlem, learned his trade in the original Lombardi's. Despite this implied link to pizza tradition, the owners of this new Patsy's, Nick Tsoulos, Nick Paschalis and Michael Zarmakoupis, are not related to the Lancieris, though they say they are "affiliated" with the East Harlem restaurant, where their pizza cook was trained. They are not connected at all to the Brooklyn Patsy's.
Nonetheless, they make terrific pizza, with a smooth crust, black around the edges though without the sustaining smokiness of a coal-cooked crust. And what Patsy's puts on top of the crust is superb: sauce made of plum tomatoes, wonderfully mellow mozzarella, excellent crumbled sweet sausage and peppers roasted on big trays in one of the twin brick ovens in back.
Despite its bow to tradition, Patsy's looks completely modern, with shiny wood and brass all over, halogen track lights, faux marble inlay tables and big pepper mills. And like all pizzerias named Patsy's, it has pictures of Frank Sinatra on the wall.

Lento's
7003 Third Avenue (at Ovington Avenue), Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, (718) 745-9197
Lento's, now in its seventh decade, is a relic from the days of restaurants and pizzas past. It's just a simple brick corner tavern with a good-time neighborhood feel to it, but at one time Lento's had an air of formality that made restaurant-going a dignified business, traces of which still linger. A sign on the wall says, "Prospective diners, please leave your name with the hostess," and the burnished wood paneling, lace tablecloth under glass, high pressed-tin ceiling and Tiffany lamps convey the buttoned-up feeling of the turn of the last century. Each of the high-backed wooden booths has a buzzer to summon a waiter, but that convenience has since been disconnected.
The pizza, too, is a throwback, with a wafer-thin, extra crisp crust that makes up with texture what it lacks in elasticity or smoky flavor. The mozzarella is mellow, the tomato sauce is slightly spicy and the sausage is chunky and flavorful, though the peppers are green, without roasted richness. Waiters dressed in black and white serve the pizza on upside-down, battered aluminum pizza trays.
Lento's has opened a branch in a handsome former firehouse in Park Slope, but so far the pizza has not matched the Bay Ridge original.

Totonno Pizzeria Napolitano
1524 Neptune Avenue (at 16th Street), Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 372-8606.
Totonno's is in the pantheon of New York pizzerias, one of the early giants of coal-oven pies. Its status became legendary, both because of the single-minded determination of its founder, Anthony (Totonno) Pero, and his son, Jerry, who focused all their attention on maintaining the handmade quality of their pies, and because of the younger Mr. Pero's habit in recent years of keeping irregular hours, opening only three days a week and staying open until the dough ran out, whenever that might be. But Jerry Pero died in 1994 at the age of 69, and though a nephew took over the business, something special has been lost in the transition.
The restaurant, in a small Italian bastion in Coney Island, still feels as if it's in a different city. With ceiling fans, the cheap plastic tables, and the breeze blowing in the front door, it's almost as if you are eating on a porch down South. But the pressed tin walls are covered with testimonials from the old glory days, and there is one section with a series of framed drawings of old-time Hollywood luminaries -- Bogart, Monroe, Groucho Marx, W. C. Fields -- that trails off as if a decorator had started with a theme but couldn't see it through.
Something in the pizza-making seems to have trailed off as well. The mozzarella is still fresh and creamy, but the crust is now thick and pillowy, soft and bready rather than coal-oven crisp. Little rounds of sausage are unremarkable, and roasted peppers, served with onions, have little flavor. Measured against the vast sea of pizzas in New York, Totonno's is still better than 90 percent of them, but measured against its past, Totonno's no longer keeps up.
 
Pintaile's Pizza
26 East 91st Street, (212) 722-1967; 1443 York Avenue (near 76th Street), (212) 717-4990.
"I don't like pizza," said Rory Wade, owner of Pintaile's Pizza, producers of one of New York's more unconventional pizzas. "I've been eating it for 35 years already, and I wanted something different."
So Mr. Wade, who also owns Canard & Company, a caterer and specialty food shop on Madison Avenue, set about looking for something different. The first thing he and his associates did was to get rid of the sauce. Instead, Pintaile's uses slices of fresh, flavorful plum tomatoes. Then they worked to create a crust imbued with the charred, slightly smoky flavor characteristic of brick-oven baking, without using coal or wood.
The result: paper-thin crusts, crisp with occasional airy blisters, with lots of fresh vegetables and cheese, but no marinara sauce, far closer to designer pizzas than to the doughy, saucy street varieties. What's more, these are light pizzas, lighter in calories and in heft, yet with real flavor.
In addition to its tiny shop down the block from the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design, a second, handsomer Pintaile's has opened on York Avenue, with brick walls, a ruddy tile floor and stained glass. And it has expanded its menu from just 6 pizzas to about 15, with untraditional varieties like spinach and feta cheese, and smoked salmon. My favorites are still the simple pizza with fresh mozzarella and thin slices of plum tomato, scented with olive oil, and the mushroom pizza, spread with slices of savory shiitake mushrooms. I also liked the salamino pizza, made with wafer-thin slices of a peppery air-dried salami that turns almost crisp when cooked.

Two Boots
37 Avenue A (between Second and Third Streets), East Village, (212) 505-2276.
With three restaurants in Manhattan and one in Park Slope, Two Boots is now an authentic mini-chain, yet there is nothing prefabricated about any of the restaurants. They each emphasize what made Two Boots successful in the first place: pizza and Cajun food in a hip atmosphere that is especially welcoming of children.
The East Village Two Boots, with its big luncheonette-style booths, strings of lights shaped like crayfish, pizzas and hot peppers, and other bright objects, is a children's paradise. The pizza itself is unusual and, though not at the top level, very pleasant. The crust is thin, and cornmeal gives it a nice texture. Toppings are decent, and it is unlikely you will find crayfish and jalapeno pizza at too many other places.
Children scream with laughter, infants howl, but parents all seem to be eating happily.
 
Arturo's Pizzeria
106 West Houston Street (at Thompson Street), Greenwich Village, (212) 677-3820.
This dark den, with live jazz most nights, a cast of regulars, an old-fashioned tin ceiling and a floor that slants in every direction, is Greenwich Village, circa 1955. Waitresses are great kidders, and the bartender is a comedian. If a woman in a black leotard began reciting beat poetry in the corner of the crowded barroom that serves as a stage, it would simply be evidence that the Village is slow to let go of its institutions.
The hold that Arturo's pizza has on its fans has more to do with sentiment than quality. The pizza, cooked in a coal oven, looks great, with a crust charred black and bubbly around the edges. But the oven imparts no real flavor to the crust, which sort of wilts in the hand. The mozzarella lacks a fresh tang, while the tomato sauce, sausages and peppers lack distinction. Bottom line: Arturo's is a fun place for a party; the pizza is passable but not distinctive.
 
Where to Find Three Nonstandards
 Here is Eric Asimov's look at three non-New York pizza traditions, and where they can be sampled in the city.

Chicago Pizza
Pizzeria Uno, 432 Columbus Avenue, at 81st Street, Manhattan, (212) 595-4700.
Pizza is taken very seriously in Chicago, where the deep-dish style was invented more than 50 years ago at the original Pizzeria Uno.
From a single restaurant, Pizzeria Uno has grown into a nationwide chain. This branch, one of five in New York, is a distant cry from the original. The original was dark and dingy, with wooden tables etched with names, like graffiti, of hundreds of patrons and with the menu limited to pizza. But the Pizzeria Uno chain is bright and lively, more like a combination East Side bar and ice cream parlor, with fruity drinks, pasta and huge whipped-cream desserts, all in an effort to please children, singles and anybody in between. No longer is the focus strictly on the deep-dish pizza, which made Chicago a pizza power to be reckoned with.
Nonetheless, Pizzeria Uno offers an acceptable version of the kind of dish that is as much pie as pizza ($10 to $15 each). The crust is high, bready and chewy, with a delectable olive oil flavor and just the slightest bit of crunch around the edges, though the middle is too wet. Cheese is nondescript, but the tomatoes are chunky and the sausage has good flavor. This is knife-and-fork pizza, served on a rack in a deep black tray to catch drippings.
There are three dining rooms to choose from here, ranging from quiet and woody to loud and raucous. To escape the assembly-line feel of the restaurant, you can buy frozen pizzas and bake them in your own kitchen. They taste just as good.

California Pizza
California Pizza Kitchen, 201 East 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 755-7773.
This is the first New York branch of a chain that serves California pizza as the world imagines it, topped with anything from Peking duck to pineapple and bacon. It may be a tonic for Californians, but those who prize New York pizza will find little here to bridge the bicoastal divide.
Even so, California Pizza Kitchen is packed nightly, with people at the bar overflowing onto the patio out front as they wait for tables with bar stools downstairs or booths upstairs. When you put your name on the waiting list here, you're issued a beeper, a detail you might forget once you slip it into your pocket. But you are reminded when it signals your table is ready with a gentle vibration. Waiters wear badges with their names and hometowns. Why not their college majors?
The dining room is airy but crowded, with many shiny surfaces, including mirrored walls. No matter how narcissistic you are, pizza -- not even these nine-inch designer pizzas ($8.50 to $11) -- is not something you want to watch yourself eating in a mirror.
The crusts are soft and billowy, bland as white bread, and though most of the toppings are quite fresh, they are simply discordant with pizza. I'm talking about roast chicken and garlic, which tastes bizarre atop mozzarella and tomato, as does shrimp in garlic. The tangy sausage pizza is not bad, though there is little sensation of tomato; but the popular vegetable pizza, laden with broccoli, eggplant and mushrooms, is simply overwhelmed by vegetables.

New Haven Pizza
Lombardi's, 32 Spring Street (between Mulberry and Mott Streets), SoHo, (212) 941-7994.
Clam pizza?
To the uninitiated, the notion seems bizarre. But clam pies bear little relation to the familiar tomato-mozzarella pizzas. As made famous at Pepe's in New Haven, the clam pie is elemental and delicious, simply whole clams with garlic, olive oil and oregano, served atop a thin, brittle crust.
In Manhattan, clam pies are a delicious specialty of Lombardi's, where the fresh-shucked clams are combined with herbs, garlic, black pepper and a hint of grated romano cheese. Take note: these pies ($16 small, $20 large) must be eaten right away while still hot, otherwise the crust begins to toughen.
While New Haven is best known for its clam pizzas, Andrew Bellucci, Lombardi's pizza maker, says that clam pies were served to family and special customers in the original Lombardi's, which opened in 1905, though they were never on the menu. As usual in the pizza business, tradition triumphs.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
'J. P. Morgan' and Some Heavy Site-Specificity

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
Undoubtedly, the New York Stock Exchange has seen money move at many speeds and in many ways. But has it ever had the chance to witness a chorus line of paper dollars pulsing carnally to a disco beat?
The seductive powers of filthy lucre have been given very literal-minded life in an anti-materialist musical spectacle that is taking place six nights a week (through July 16) on the steps of the Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall Street, a dime's throw from the Exchange. 
 The production is the work of En Garde Arts, New York's most ambitious site-specific theater company, which memorably staged, among other works, a contemporary variation on "The Brothers Karamazov" over several blocks of the meat-packing district.
For their current offering, "J. P. Morgan Saves the Nation," the troupe couldn't have found a more pointedly appropriate setting. Federal Hall is not only in full view of the Exchange, but is also directly across the street from the headquarters of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, which was founded by the work's title character.
This rather priggish allegory, about the soul-stripping rise of J. Pierpont Morgan to a pinnacle of financial dominance unparalleled in America, has the spirit of a 1960's protest against the tyranny of big business. It has gone into the temple of Mammon only to thumb its nose.
But the form of the evening definitely belongs to the less-free-spirited 1990's. The city permits to use the location are all in place. And the style is scarcely that of an anarchic sit-in. "J. P. Morgan" has an intricate, even esoteric book and lyrics by Jeffrey M. Jones that are obviously the product of many hours of library research, and a peppy score in a post-modernist medley of musical voices by Jonathan M. Larson.
The show, directed by Jean Randich with choreography by Doug Elkins, charts the life and times of Morgan with a multitude of specific historical references and a hand of iron. As Morgan (James Judy) evolves from an uncertain schoolboy with disfiguring acne to a business czar (with disfiguring acne) who literally controlled the fate of nations, he interacts with a quartet of symbolic figures who might have been conceived by a latter-day John Bunyan.
There is Uncle Sam (Stephen De- Rosa), a hucksterish opportunist in red, white and blue who is, of course, America incarnate; G. Washington (Buzz Bovshow), a patriarchal figure who doubles as Morgan's father and represents the sterner, more Puritanical tradition from which the tycoon emerged, and Liberty (Julie Fain Lawrence), an eternally wistful creature who plays all the women in Morgan's life and embodies the increasingly neglected human heart of the man who was Wall Street.
Rounding out the foursome is a character called -- I swear -- 19th-Century Market Capitalism (Robin Miles), a curvaceous, sassy dominatrix who is also identified in the program as "a Devil." You need look no further to figure out the evening's thematic drift. Ms. Miles leads a dancing ensemble of Greenback Dollars (young women dressed in second-skin dollar-printed costumes designed by Kasia Maimone) who tempt and madden a chorus of bowler-wearing All-American Businessmen.
Audience members who haven't recently read a biography of Morgan may have difficulty following much of this animated history lesson, which often seems like a revue put together by an earnest team of Marxist economics students. The show gives very particular life to Morgan's more important business deals, which reached a climax when he single-handedly steered the nation from financial collapse during the panic of 1907.
Some of these events have been divertingly staged. The battle for control of the Susquehanna Railroad is done as a period melodrama, which concludes with Morgan, in a Dudley Do-Right voice, announcing, "I alone must reorder the entire economy of the United States in the 19th century."
But how many people remember what the Susquehanna Railroad scandal was? Or names like Elgin and Stoilet or James Ramsey, which are used in the way a comedian would refer to Lorena Bobbitt or Dan Quayle? Perhaps the folks at Morgan Guaranty across the street, but this probably isn't their kind of show.
The overall portrait of a nation falling into destructive, speculative avarice is as broad and familiar as many of the text's details are obscure. There is never any question that you are being lectured. And because "J. P. Morgan," unlike other En Garde Arts productions, takes place entirely at one fixed location, it often lacks the surreal fluidity, in which the edges between real and articifial life blur, that is the greatest asset of site-specific theater.
The actors are notable for their stamina. (They all have to run up and down those daunting steps.) And they often sing quite nicely. Ms. Miles tempts and struts with an infectious, wicked glee. And Mr. Larson works adroitly in an assortment of musical pastiches, from ragtime to rap: his music-hall hymn to capitalist hunger, "Appetite Annie," winningly performed by Mr. Judy and the chorus, is charming.
Open spaces framed by monuments are obviously not the places for psychological intimacy. Everything has to be scaled up. But when a show is as didactic as "J. P. Morgan," you wind up feeling bludgeoned.
Still, this is surely your only chance to watch stockbrokers strangling each other on Wall Street to the rhythms of a rock minuet. Those who have been burned playing the market recently may find it a gratifying sight.

HEADLINE: Whether Friend or Foe, Most Think Clinton Is Playing Politics on the Budget

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
The Democratic anger and the Republican olive branch over President Clinton's conversion to the balanced-budget faith proceed from a shared disbelief.
Almost no one on Capitol Hill thinks the President is convinced of the economic or fiscal need for a balanced budget. Almost everyone thinks he suddenly produced a plan to balance the budget in 10 years because he thought it was in his own political interest. 
 Though the shock was wearing off, many still grumbled. Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado said, "I don't think he has even thought about Democrats over here. He's thinking about himself and Presidential politics."
One Democratic leader, insisting on anonymity, said Mr. Clinton "has no rudder." And Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, said he did not think Mr. Clinton held any deep beliefs.
Speaker Newt Gingrich's position was that the President's change should be welcomed as an act of bravery, considering Democratic complaints. But the depth of his hope for negotiation was shown when he offered on Wednesday, "as a sign of our commitment to working together," to let Mr. Clinton's new plan come up for a vote.
What a deal! That is a vote Mr. Gingrich knows his side can win. Republicans have won 99 percent of House roll-calls, and the vote on this one would be the most controlled of the year.
The Speaker's longtime ally, Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, chuckled at the word "conversion," and said that all Mr. Clinton was doing was maneuvering to say "I'm now a player" and claim credit next year after Republicans forced him to sign their legislation setting a seven-year path toward a balanced budget.
Mr. Gingrich, usually a man in a hurry, said this afternoon that he might not learn until Friday how Wednesday's meeting between Republican budget chairmen and Administration budget officials went. A high-ranking Republican adviser indicated that the session was an exercise in posing for the cameras and looking polite for political reasons, more than a meaningful discussion.
That view was confirmed late today when a senior Republican Senate adviser dismissed the President's plan as a "good faith effort," adding, "We still think it falls short of the goals" set by Republicans in both houses. He indicated Republicans would now go back to talking to each other.
Except for a few Democratic true believers who insisted the President has only now seen the light they saw long ago, most Democrats also saw his move as purely political. They said they expected Republicans to be pleasant for a couple of days and then discard the President's proposals. Some said Mr. Clinton would thus be freed to attack Republican cuts more effectively than if he had not shifted.
Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a balanced-budget advocate, said, "The President has been reborn." But even Mr. Breaux stressed the politics in the shift: Mr. Clinton's ability to argue that his budget plan would cause less pain than the Republican approach.
But to Mr. Breaux's left, a deep vein of doubt was exposed. The doubt was not about Mr. Clinton's sincerity -- they wrote that off -- but about his political skill.
Mrs. Schroeder said Mr. Clinton was outmatched by the Republicans. "I think they are just playing with him like a kitten with a string."
And Representative Jim McDermott of Washington said that his fellow Democrats in the House would try to ignore the President and go back to attacking Republicans over deep Medicare cuts, even though Mr. Clinton's acceptance of lesser cuts made that more difficult.
"Everybody's decided it's a two-day story and it's over," Mr. McDermott said. Speaking of the Democratic Medicare attack, he said, "We were gaining a little ground and then the coach sent in a play that wasn't in the playbook. We're going to go back to the game plan."
Several Democrats cited the findings of a poll released yesterday by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press that suggested that the public was paying close attention to Medicare while Republicans' ratings fell and Mr. Clinton's improved. They said that this showed, at the least, that Mr. Clinton's retreat was ill-timed.
Some were particularly unhappy that Mr. Clinton made his switch after appearing on television with Mr. Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia. That gave the impression, one leader said, that "it was O.K. to have a Republican Congress."
Some resigned Democrats toned down their rhetoric today. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who used the word "stupidest" in Wednesday's caucus, said today only, "The President made his decision on where he wants to go, and I disagree with him on the Medicare cuts."
But the lack of support was deafening. Even Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who usually cheers Mr. Clinton on, offered the tepid comment that "Mr. Clinton's recommendations are clearly far better than the harsh Republican proposals," which he called "extremist."
As to the President's ideas, Mr. Kennedy said, "Only time will tell if enough other reforms can be enacted to justify such cuts."
In a rare display of bipartisanship for the Appropriations Committee this year, Mr. Livingston complimented its senior Democrat, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin. "I think Dave Obey said it best," the chairman said, referring to Mr. Obey's statement on Tuesday that "I think most of us have learned some time ago that if you don't like the President's position on a particular issue, you simply need to wait a few weeks."

HEADLINE: Bridge Over a Chasm of Tension;
Pelham Calls It Escape Route; a Racist View, Mt. Vernon Says

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: PELHAM, N.Y., June 16

 BODY:
The Mayor of this Westchester village was listening to his police scanner one recent Sunday when it crackled with a bulletin. Two youths broke into a Cadillac, then eluded a patrol car the same way other thieves have: by crossing a footbridge over the Hutchinson River Parkway and disappearing into the neighboring city of Mount Vernon.
 For Mayor Joseph E. Durnin Jr., it was the last straw. Two days later, he announced at a Village Board meeting that he would ask the state to tear down the bridge, which he and other residents have long seen as a getaway route from their tidy, almost all-white village into the sprawling streets of Mount Vernon, which is predominantly black. 
 The Mayor's proposal has touched off a virtual border war between the two communities, with Mount Vernon officials denouncing the plan as racist and elitist. Mount Vernon is a city of 67,150 that cuts across the economic spectrum. Pelham is a more affluent village of 6,400.
 "It's a slap in the face to Mount Vernon," said Mayor Ronald A. Blackwood, who became the state's first black Mayor 11 years ago. For three decades, he said, Mount Vernon residents have used the bridge as a shortcut into Pelham, where they can catch a commuter train to Manhattan, shop for groceries or dine at Italian restaurants like Via Emilia.
 "It seems very obvious they want to keep Mount Vernonites out," he said. "It is naked racism, no question about it."
 Mayor Durnin of Pelham vehemently disagrees, saying his proposal has nothing to do with race and everything to do with crime. Since January, he said, four homes along Sparks Avenue, the street that leads to the footbridge, have reported break-ins, more than any other block in town.
 "The residents of the area have a fear that if they leave their houses or bikes or garages untended, they are going to be burglarized," he said. "We know some of the youths involved are from Pelham. We also know that if you can get over the footbridge, you're safe."
 Mayor Blackwood countered that tearing down the bridge would only compound the perception of Mount Vernon as a crime-ridden warren of "drug addicts and pimps." He does not deny that crime is a problem. There have been two murders in Mount Vernon this year, and robberies have increased 29 percent since 1994.
 But Mayor Blackwood said he wanted the rest of the metropolitan New York area to know that there is another side to his city, one populated by "a tremendous middle class, lawyers and doctors who are black." So he insisted that a reporter take a half-hour drive with him through Mount Vernon's most affluent neighborhoods, streets like Darwood Place and Brookfield Road, where large Tudor-style homes have ample lawns and sculptured shrubbery.
 "Take a look at these houses," he said excitedly. "You can't believe it's Mount Vernon, can you?"
 Those neighborhoods look a lot like Pelham.
 Mayor Durnin of Pelham contended that the 160-foot bridge, which has a chain-link canopy and sits on green steel beams, has outlived its original purpose. He said a state authority built the bridge in the early 1960's to allow students from Mount Vernon to walk to St. Catherine's School in Pelham. The school, he said, has since closed.
 Disputes over the bridge have flared periodically. In the late 1970's, after Pelham residents complained of a rash of burglaries, the village began locking the gates on the bridge at night. But the locks were frequently broken by vandals. In 1983, several residents reported seeing a suspect in the killing of a Pelham hardware store owner run across the bridge.
 Mayor Durnin said he had no desire to seal the border between Pelham and Mount Vernon, and noted that three other bridges connect the communities. But unlike the footbridge, those bridges accommodate automobile traffic, he said, and would not block a patrol car's pursuit of a criminal suspect. He said the village was not worried about violent crime -- the last murder here, in 1987, involved a vendetta against a Federal judge -- but was concerned about the periodic break-ins of cars and homes.
 State transportation officials, who have yet to receive a formal request from Pelham about the bridge, said they were unsure what their response would be.
 "We are researching it," said Purdy Halstead, assistant to the regional director of the Department of Transportation in Poughkeepsie. "It's not immediately evident what the procedure would be."
 Charles Millard, 67, who has lived on Sparks Avenue in Pelham for 30 years, said he thought that the bridge sometimes served as a conduit of crime from Mount Vernon.
 "It sounds racial to say this, but in a lot of our crimes here, the perpetrators have been black," said Mr. Millard, who performs in the orchestra of the Broadway show "Crazy for You."
 "On the plus side," he added, "probably three-quarters of the commuters we see walking across the bridge to use the train are black."
 Anthony Mitchell, 33, a security guard who has lived across the bridge on Beechwood Avenue for 14 years, said he was one of those commuters. With the bridge, he said, he can make it to the Metro-North station in Pelham in seven or eight minutes. Without it, he would have to walk to the Mount Vernon train station, which would take twice as long.
 "I think they want to keep the African-Americans in Pelham at a minimum," he said. "They're saying, 'You come over and patronize our shops, but at 6 o'clock, get out of town.' "

HEADLINE: From Communications Chaos, Order?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
The first tangible effect of the Senate's sweeping overhaul of telecommunications law, experts say, will be chaos: mind-numbing new marketing deals, outrageous prices, bankruptcies, hostile takeovers and schemes to make a quick killing amid the confusion.
But in the end, most experts say, the results should be lower prices all around and a headlong rush to offer advanced communication services over fiber optic networks and satellites. 
 They have some models in mind -- in particular, the breakup of the Bell System in 1984. While the breakup was at first a baffling headache for consumers, it has since become a boon. Long-distance telephone prices have plunged nearly 70 percent.
The communications bill, which the Senate passed on Thursday, has a strong chance of becoming law by the end of the year. It would again turn the telephone business upside down. But it would go much further than that, ultimately affecting virtually every form of electronic communications in the country.
Proponents say the bill would obliterate the old monopolies in local telephone service and cable television by letting the industries invade each other's markets.
"It's dynamic, it's messy and if there isn't a significant competitor in the market, the monopolist or oligopolist will charge top dollar," said W. Russell Neuman, professor of international communications at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
"People probably won't want to hear this," he said, "but it will be a lot like what happened after airline deregulation," when after many complaints, passenger volume surged.
Consumers have had virtually no voice in the battle in Congress over telecommunications changes, resulting in a bill driven almost entirely by the forces of business and technology. Its impact is almost certain to be jarring.
And while economists agree on the benefits of the bill's big picture, much of the almost frenzied wrangling of the bill's six days on the Senate floor was over details that could bring hundreds of millions of dollars in windfalls along the road to deregulation.
Cable television prices, freed from regulation, would almost certainly increase in the short term. The cost of basic local telephone service may creep up, though long-distance prices are likely to decline. Confusion will also increase, but so will the use of new services.
Television, radio and newspaper publishing may also be transformed. Both the House and Senate bills would greatly increase the number of television and radio stations a single company can own, paving the way for a large-scale consolidation of mom-and-pop stations into nationwide chains. The House bill would usher in an even more radical change, allowing a single company to own, in the same city, two television stations, multiple radio stations, the cable television system and even the local newspaper.
That has provoked a furious debate between Congressional Republicans and the Clinton Administration, which wants to take a more cautious stance.
"We don't want to turn every city in the country into Pottersville," said Greg Simon, a top aide to Vice President Al Gore, referring to the town in the Jimmy Stewart movie "It's a Wonderful Life," in which one mean-spirited tycoon dominates its entire economy.
In a grand bargain, local telephone companies would be forced to open their markets to new rivals by adopting a "check list" of measures that rivals believe would make it practical to enter the market. In exchange, the local companies would immediately be allowed to enter the cable television business and, eventually the long-distance market.
As part of the bargain, the legislation would also free cable television companies from most price regulation. Acting under a law passed in 1992, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a 17 percent rate cut on cable companies last year and subjected future rates to a series of complex formulas.
Industry experts say cable television rates are almost certain to rise, at least in the short term, if the bill becomes law. Fewer than 1 percent of all cable systems now face a significant competitor, and studies by the commission in 1993 showed that systems with exclusive franchises charged about 30 percent more, on average, than the handful that had competition.
New direct-to-home broadcast satellites, like Hughes's Communications DirecTV, now offer more than 150 channels of movies and television programming, including all major cable networks. While DirecTV has been a big success in its first year, the entire direct-to-home industry has thus far captured only about a million homes.
Bradley Stillman, legislative counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, predicted that cable television prices could increase $5 a month -- an increase of more than 50 percent over the near term.
Cable industry executives disagree with that estimate, but Wall Street analysts say that price increases of some sort are inevitable.
"Prices will go up," said Steve Schutzman, a bond analyst with Salomon Brothers who tracks the cable industry. Indeed, cable companies have several reasons to raise prices as fast as they can, he said. Many of the biggest companies, including Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc., are dealing with a mountain of debt at a time when they need to increase the capital spending to match looming competition from the telephone industry.
"The cable guys have been notoriously cash poor," he said. "Now they have to upgrade the system."
Meanwhile, competition from telephone companies is likely to take longer than many people expect -- particularly for small markets. Several of the most aggressive Baby Bells, including the Bell Atlantic Corporation and U S West, have pulled back on their plans amid uncertainties about technology.
Small cities and towns will not see competition for at least five or six years -- if ever. Bell Atlantic, as an interim step, plans to offer cable programming over a relatively inexpensive microwave technology known as wireless cable. Company officials now believe they will be serving Baltimore and Philadelphia by the end of 1996, but say they doubt the company will reach even half its customers by the end of 1997.
The GTE Corporation, which owns a number of medium and smaller telephone companies around the country, plans to introduce video services in about 66 markets with a total of seven million customers over the next eight years. Still, that would represent about only half of GTE's telephone customers.
"You need a population size -- whether in one city or two or three adjacent communities -- of about 100,000 in order to make the business plan work," said Rick Wilson, vice president of video services at GTE.
The other side of the bargain -- opening the local telephone market -- will also be a big experiment. Among other things, a local company will have to let rivals interconnect with its own network so that competing companies would be able to link calls between one another's customers. And customers would be allowed to keep their telephone numbers if they switch to a different carrier.
Will it work? Most experts think it will, over time. Cable and long-distance companies have already signaled their readiness to jump in. MCI Communications, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, has announced a $2 billion plan to build local networks in major cities. The Sprint Corporation, the third-largest long-distance carrier, has teamed up with four of the country's biggest cable television companies to offer a full range of wired and wireless services at the local level.
As for telephone prices, the bill's biggest impact would be to knock down the price for short-haul long-distance calls between nearby cities. These calls, carried primarily by local telephone companies, are generally extremely overpriced -- in part because state regulators have used those prices to subsidize low prices for basic dial tone service.
The bill would attack those high prices, which add up to a $13 billion market, though it contains protections that give local companies a partial reprieve from full competition. Under the bargain, negotiated to permit a transition to a new system of subsidies, 10 states including New York and Connecticut will be able to require so-called dialing parity -- a system under which customers will be able to use a rival to the local company just by dialing a '1." At the moment, customers must dial a five-digit code to reach a rival carrier.
 
Changes the Public Would Feel
 
The sweeping bill approved Thursday by the Senate would, if signed into law, reshare the Telecommunications landscape for year to come. Industry analysts expect the majoe impact on consumers to come in two waves: at first, mostly costs, and later, some benefits that are more conjectural. Here are the highlights.
 
THE NEAR TERM: 2 to 3 year
 
Cable TV rate would rise in many areas, as local cable monopolies take advantage of new rate freedom and accumulate cash in anticipation of battles with telephone companies.
 
Local phone rates would remain stable, although the price for basic dial-tone service may creep up in some areas.
 
Rates for some calls may drop sharply as direct competition in the market for short haul long-distance calls - those nearby towns and cities now routed to long-distance carriers.
 
Local media concentration would increase as local TV and radio stations are bough by chain owners while cable and telephone companies merge in small markets. Local programs may diminish.
 
Few monopolies would be challenged. Cable TV and telephone companies may begin to compete directly, but only in a few large cities at first
 
THE LONG TERM: 5 to 10 years
 
Cable TV rates may eventually fall in some areas as more cable monopolies face competition from phone companies and direct satellite broadcasters.
 
Local phone rates may decline in real terms as more telephone monopolies are challenged by cable TV companies. Consumers in many markets may be offered one-stop shopping for local long-distance and cable services by more than one company.
 
Some areas would never benefit because thay are too small or expensive to attract a challenger to an entrenched local cable or phone company. Rates in those areas would remain high.

Halifax Is a Relaxed Venue for Economic Summit Meeting

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, June 16

 BODY:
There's water, but Venice it's not. Nor is it Paris, Tokyo, London or any of the other world capitals that have been transformed overnight from their teeming selves into frozen security zones for past economic summit meetings.
 Instead, despite the presence of red-jacketed Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the center of this old harbor town has a cozy carnival air. When President Clinton met with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan at Dalhousie University on Thursday, residents just across the street were mowing their lawns and washing their cars. 
 Two years ago, Tokyo, a metropolitan area of 16 million people, came to a standstill as routes from the nearest airport were closed off. Last year, in Naples, the Italians converted a brawling, dirty, romantic town -- normally hung with drying clothes and alive with the clang of pots and pans -- into a serene neo-Bourbon capital by the sea. How? By removing the Neapolitans from the city center for three days.
 No such tactics are in evidence here at a meeting that by design is considerably less elaborate, and less populated, than past sessions.
 Herbert Rothen, the German summit coordinator who has helped organize every such meeting since the first one in Rambouillet, France, in 1975, said that except for Houston in 1990, he had never seen such a warm welcome. "It's not a Canadian thing," he said. "It's more related to Nova Scotia. It wouldn't be the same if it were in Montreal, Vancouver or Toronto."

 
 
A Gentlemen's Agreement
 Not that security is not an issue. Mr. Clinton's hotel, the Chateau Halifax, is sealed tighter than King Tut's Tomb to all outsiders, and the Mounties stationed at the entrances to meeting sites scrutinize the security badges of visitors as if their picture identifications might melt under their gaze.
 But perhaps the most delicate security issue of all has simply been finessed: whether the Secret Service and other visiting security officers could carry guns. It is strictly illegal for foreigners of any rank or function to bring weapons into Canada, but there is no sign that the rule has been strictly enforced this week.
"There is a gentlemen's agreement that they will not carry sidearms into Canada," said Sgt. Bill Price, a spokesman for the Mounted Police, describing a policy that amounts to "don't ask, don't tell." "We take them at their word. We do not search anyone."

 
 
Signs of the Past
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, like the wives of the other leaders, has kept her own schedule here, and on Thursday she indulged in a bit of gently needling inter-American diplomacy in a province that once sheltered British royalist refugees fleeing the American Revolution.
 Accepting an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Mount Saint Vincent University, whose enrollment is 85 percent women, the First Lady said she had been delighted to learn on her arrival in Halifax that Gen. Robert Ross, the British commander who sacked Washington in the War of 1812, is buried here.
 "If any of you have ever had the opportunity to visit what was then called the President's House, I hope you have noticed that we left one portion of the wall as you enter not painted white, but the original color of the stone, with the burn marks still showing," she said. "So we also, in a funny way, owe the White House -- because it had to be painted white -- to all of you."

 
 
Detroit's Revenge
 Call it a Japanese negotiating ploy. Call it Canadian-American symbolism. Call it Detroit's revenge. But in motorcade after motorcade here this week, the summit organizers have made it clear they think that what is good for General Motors is good enough for Tokyo, too.
 With the exception of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who has tooled around in a charcoal-gray Mercedes, and Mr. Clinton, whose own armored Cadillac was flown in, all the international leaders have been driven about in sleek, black, Canadian-supplied Cadillacs, including Mr. Murayama.
 The dispute over American access to the Japanese auto market -- and American threats to impose a punitive 100 percent tariff on Japanese luxury models by the end of the month -- hung over Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Murayama on Thursday, but officials say no slight was intended.
 In keeping with the Canadians' efforts to hold down costs, summit organizers have solicited discounts and goods and services from 112 corporate sponsors, including Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, and political sensibilities clearly did play a part.
 "It was a decision to go with North American cars," said Malcom McKechnie, the official Halifax summit office spokesman for the Canadian Government.

Two Life Insurers Considering a Merger
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance and Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance are discussing a merger that would create one of the nation's largest life insurers.
 Executives at the two companies, foreseeing significant cost savings, said they would start a six- to eight-week feasibility study to estimate the savings and decide whether to proceed with a merger. [Page 37.]
 
Plea Lifts Caremark Stock
The stock of Caremark rose $1.875, or 9 percent, to $21.875, after the company said Thursday night that it had agreed to plead guilty in the kickback inquiry involving its home health care business. The company said it would pay $161 million to Federal and state governments. That would force Caremark to take an after-tax charge of $110 million for the second quarter. [35.]
 
And Next, Dial Chaos?
The first tangible effect of the Senate's overhaul of telecommunications law, experts say, will be chaos: new marketing deals, outrageous prices, bankruptcies, hostile takeovers and schemes to make a quick killing. But in the end, the results could be lower prices and a rush to offer advanced communication services over fiber optic networks and by satellite. [1.]
 
Clinton Budget Falls Short
A study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found President Clinton's new budget plan would fall short of his goal of balancing the budget in 10 years, saying the deficit would be at $209 billion in 2005, slightly higher than it is this year. [8.]
 
European Greens Boycott Shell
European environmentalists, particularly in Germany, are boycotting Royal Dutch Shell, even attacking its gasoline stations, because of plans by the company and Exxon to sink an obsolete oil rig in the North Sea. [3.]
 
Analysts Do About-Face
Gordon Hall and James Clark, top-ranked analysts who left CS First Boston for Morgan Stanley on Tuesday, have returned to CS First Boston. [35.]
 
Argentina's Revenues Drop
A decline in tax revenues will make it difficult for Argentina to meet budgetary targets set by the International Monetary Fund as part of a financial rescue package the country received earlier this year. Tax revenues for the first six months of the year are expected to fall 6.5 percent, or $1.5 billion, below projections. [34.]
 
Greenspan to Explain Strategy
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has scheduled an address before the Economic Club of New York for Tuesday that will be his first big attempt to explain his thinking on the economy and to counter the critics who have said the Fed was wrong to raise short-term interest rates seven times in a year. [46.]
 
Implant Settlement Shortfall Seen
A $4.25 billion settlement involving breast implants is so severely underfunded that women could receive as little as 5 percent of what they were promised, a Federal court analysis has found. A partial analysis of claims filed with administrators of the settlement found that more than 70,000 women probably would be eligible to get money in the first wave of payments, far more than anyone had anticipated. [7.]
 
Olympics to Salt Lake City
Salt Lake City joined Atlanta as an Olympic city, winning host rights for the 2002 Winter Olympics with a surprisingly overwhelming first-ballot victory over its rivals: Ostersund, Sweden; Sion, Switzerland, and Quebec. Salt Lake City projected an operating budget of $798 million and said sponsorships, television rights and the sale of licensed products would help meet it. [27.]
 
Hotel Chief Builds an Empire
Harry R. Silverman is the biggest hotel magnate in the nation, but few people know his name. Maybe that's because he does not own his hotels. But Mr. Silverman, the chief of Hospitality Franchise Systems, has assembled an empire that controls about 4,200 mostly low- to mid-price hotels. [35.]

The Group of Seven Calls for Measures to Avert Currency Crises

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, June 16

 BODY:
Leaders attending the 21st seven-power economic summit meeting called today for steps to avert future currency crises like last winter's Mexican disaster, saying such action was needed to preserve world prosperity.
 In their official summit communique, the seven called on the International Monetary Fund to exercise sterner supervision over member countries' economic policies to insure that they avoid any action that could provoke speculative outflows of money. 
 They also called for countries to provide financial markets with more detailed and more timely economic information to make accurate judgments more possible.
 And they said that the I.M.F. needed a new source of emergency funds so that it could move quickly, in the event of another Mexican-style financial collapse, to shore up stricken nations, provided they agree to sounder policies.
 "The U.S. is not able to be a lender of last resort in other crises of this kind," President Clinton told a news conference today.
 But the official economic agenda was partly overshadowed by unforeseen political developments. The leaders spent much of today agonizing about the surge of fighting in Bosnia and discussing how to pay for the rapid-reaction force that Britain and France want to send to protect their peacekeeping troops. Congress has refused to contribute to the cost of the force, but President Clinton said, "I believe the U.S. should pay a portion, and I will try to persuade the Congress."
 The Bosnian crisis is expected to dominate the rest of this year's summit meeting, starting with tonight's dinner, at which President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who reached this Atlantic fishing port today, will join the other heads of state. The meeting will continue through Saturday morning.
In another thorny matter, Japanese and American officials regarded each other warily, looking for signs that either side might give way in their stalled automotive talks. The Japanese, at least, showed signs of wavering.
 "Efforts are continuing somehow to find a solution," Prime Minister Tomiichi Muryama told a news conference after today's meeting.
 After weeks of taking a hard line, a senior Japanese official conceded that "we're beginning to rethink things." The Japanese were apparently motivated in part by Mr. Clinton's warning on Thursday that he would proceed with 100 percent tariffs on luxury cars from Japan unless an accord was reached by June 28.
 "Even if we won in the World Trade Organization, we're beginning to wonder what that victory would mean," the official said, referring to Japan's suit to have the sanctions declared illegal. American officials said that such a rethinking could bode well for the negotiations that start in Geneva on Thursday.
 At the same time, there were signs that the Administration is drafting softer guidelines for a voluntary plan under which Japanese auto makers would agree to buy more American car parts, perhaps settling for nonbinding "business forecasts" of the dollar amount of parts to be bought by the car companies.
 The strengthened role that the seven want the I.M.F. to play in preserving currency stability represents a first attempt to fulfill the pledge they gave at Naples last year to review the world's international institutions to insure they can meet the next century's challenges. Most of these institutions -- the I.M.F., the World Bank and many United Nations agencies -- were created 50 years ago at the end of World War II.
 The Group of Seven leaders propose steps to streamline many of them, eliminating overlapping functions and improving efficiency.
 The issue took on greater urgency after Washington's expensive rescue of Mexico, combined with the failure of Barings, the British banking house, and growing exchange-rate tensions as the dollar sank against the German mark and Japanese yen.
 "Stability of currencies will give stability to the world's financial markets, and there will be more growth," Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada said after today's meeting.
 The outlines of the favored approach were agreed to at a Washington meeting of finance ministers in April. In today's world of floating exchange rates and large capital flows in global markets, the group's view is that monetary stability is best promoted by encouraging nations to employ sound domestic economic policies that inspire public confidence.
 To this end, the group wants the I.M.F. to create a list of "key economic and financial data" that countries should publish and identify those failing to do so in a timely fashion.
 Lawrence Summers, an Under Secretary of the Treasury, said he expected eventually that all developing countries borrowing on international markets would provide as much information as industrial countries. The idea is that errant governments would be forced to pay more for loans; that, in turn, would force a policy correction before a major crisis erupted.
 In addition, the seven want to give the I.M.F. a new emergency financing mechanism so that it can provide troubled countries faster access to credit, provided they agree to act more prudently in the future.
 The I.M.F. already has the right to raise an extra $28 billion over and above its own resources from the world's richest countries, which call themselves the Group of Ten. The seven suggested that this fund, called the General Arrangements to Borrow, should be doubled, principally by asking other relatively rich nonmember countries like Austria, Spain, Australia and the successful Asian nations to join the agreement.
 For the plan to become a reality, the seven must persuade most of the I.M.F.'s 178 member countries to support it. And some developing countries are already grumbling.
 Asian nations say that as the fastest growing economies in the world they have no need for extra discipline; Middle Eastern countries see little reason to be in the plan since they do not borrow internationally.
 Meanwhile, the Group of Seven itself is setting a poor example. In April, finance ministers of the seven called for "the orderly reversal" of the dollar's fall, but this has still not happened. At the same time, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, called for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to protect the dollar. But the Fed appeared to take no notice.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan Keeps Deficit, Study Shows

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
President Clinton's new budget plan would fall short of his stated goal of balancing the budget in 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has concluded.
A study by the nonpartisan agency completed tonight found that under the Clinton proposals, the deficit would be about $200 billion every year for the next decade and would be $209 billion in 2005, slightly higher than it is this year, Congressional staff assistants said. 
 The discrepancy results from different projections by the Clinton Administration and the budget office about the state of the economy in the next 10 years.
Republican Congressional leaders anticipated the finding. At a news conference this morning, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said of the President's plan: "It doesn't do the job he claimed it would do. It doesn't come close to balancing the budget in 10 years."
In response, Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in an interview that the Administration's forecasts were based on the best available economic information and that the plan the President announced on Tuesday night would indeed lead to a balanced budget.
Last month, the Senate and the House of Representatives approved separate budget plans that are supposed to result in a balanced budget by 2002. These plans were grounded in economic forecasts made last winter by the budget office.
The differences between the estimates of the Administration and the budget office about how well the economy will do in the next decade are tiny. For example, the Administration predicts that the economy will grow by 2.5 percent a year. The budget office puts the figure at 2.3 percent or 2.4 percent a year.
But such small differences compounded year after year result in large gaps several years down the road. As a consequence, the spending cuts needed to predict a balanced budget using Administration figures are much smaller than those needed using the Congressional numbers.
For example, by the Administration's reckoning, the deficit in 2002 without any changes in the law would be $240 billion, and the deficit in 2005 would be $266 billion. The Congressional projections put those figures at $349 billion and $472 billion.
Congress calculates that it will need about $1.5 trillion in total savings to balance the budget in seven years. The Administration estimates that it needs only $1.1 trillion to do it in 10 years. That means the Administration does not have to predict cuts as deep as Congress to reach the same end.
A senior Administration economist explained the discrepancy this way: "This is a world where you take a small difference and you work it through the pipe and everything compounds itself and you wind up with a large difference."
Ms. Rivlin said that the two sides would have to agree on a common set of projections before they could enter serious budget negotiations but that she was not now ready to abandon the ones the Administration was using.
Neither side is accusing the other of cooking the books. "The differences are well within the range of likely outcomes," said Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the budget office who was responsible for preparing the Congressional budget estimates that are now being used.
Moreover, no one can forecast the state of the economy reliably several years in advance. "No one can say with confidence how fast the economy is going to grow in 2000, much less 2005," Ms. Rivlin said.
The forecasts of both the Administration and Congress contend, incidentally, that the country can go 10 more years without a recession, a prospect that no economist would put money on.
The Office of Management and Budget is a political arm of the White House. The Congressional Budget Office, on the other hand, has the reputation of being scrupulously nonpartisan.
In the Reagan and Bush years, wildly optimistic budget forecasts were often issued to attain political goals, and the Congressional forecasts were generally more reliable. President Clinton's budget officials have tried to make realistic projections, but the fact remains that they work for politicians.
In addition to the different assumptions about the state of the economy over the years, the Clinton Administration is more optimistic than Congress about the rate at which Medicare and Medicaid costs will rise. Again, the differences are small in each year. The Administration believes the annual rate of increase in the Government's health costs will be six-tenths of 1 percent slower than Congress calculates. But over seven years, the difference in the predictions of Medicare expenditures alone is $70 billion.
Because of this, some of the material the Administration released in conjunction with the President's speech on Tuesday night was misleading.
The Administration maintained that Mr. Clinton would save $126 billion over seven years in Medicare costs, while the House plan would save $287 billion and the Senate, $256 billion. If a common set of projections had been used, the Clinton figure would surely have been higher or the Congressional ones lower, meaning a smaller difference between the Administration and Congress.
The Administration's Medicare and Medicaid estimates were not made by the Office of Management and Budget but by actuaries at the Health Care Financing Administration, who are career civil servants. These are the same actuaries Republicans keep citing to justify the cuts they want to make in the growth in Medicare spending. The actuaries reported recently that the Medicare system would run out of money by 2002 unless changes were made in the program.

HEADLINE: 2 Sides of a Puerto Rican Coin;
Corporate Tax Breaks Help and Hurt an Economy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

DATELINE: CULEBRA, P.R.

 BODY:
To hear her tell it, the story of Yolanda Rivera is a heartening tale of private enterprise helping to break the cycle of poverty and dependence. Unlike many unskilled Puerto Ricans, Ms. Rivera has a full-time job at a company that pays a living wage -- $11 an hour, including benefits. "What would I be doing without this job?" she declares. "Nothing."
 Ms. Rivera, a 31-year-old divorced mother of five, works for Baxter International Inc., which employs 5,600 Puerto Ricans in making health care products. Yet that is just the tip of the iceberg. Hundreds of other big American manufacturers, lured to Puerto Rico by a set of much-disputed corporate tax incentives, employ nearly one-fifth of all workers on the island and generate more than half of its economic output. The tax breaks, known as Section 936 for their obscure location in the Federal tax code, allow American corporations to escape Federal taxes on profits earned in Puerto Rico. 
 And that is where the troubles begin.
 Much of the hostility to Section 936 comes from Washington policy makers who are trying to expand the tax base to generate more revenue. After years of controversy and feverish lobbying, the generous tax breaks, which have been particularly lucrative for American pharmaceutical, chemical and electronics manufacturers, were pared in 1993 as part of a broader effort to reduce the Federal deficit.
 The modified Section 936, while safe from budget-cutting efforts this year, remains a prime target for future cuts. That is because it is an area where House Republicans, seeking further savings to balance the budget, might also win favor with a number of Democrats who share their desire to slash what both groups now call "corporate welfare."
 The problem for Puerto Rico is that while it has not been living all that well with Section 936, it probably would not be able to live without it.
 In luring so many factories to Puerto Rico, Section 936 has generated about 170,000 relatively well-paying manufacturing jobs. It has also kept many Puerto Ricans from moving to the mainland to compete for unskilled jobs. But by raising wage levels and expectations far above what unsubsidized companies can meet, it has also prevented Puerto Rico from attracting lower-paying jobs for other residents. The island's unemployment rate -- currently about 14 percent -- remains more than double the national average.
 This quandary is one reason that so many elected officials from Puerto Rico view Section 936 with resigned distaste. Not only has it been a symbol of Puerto Rico's second-class status in the United States, but some also see it as an obstacle to a more direct attack on poverty and underdevelopment.
 "Section 936," says Carlos Romero-Barcelo, the commonwealth's nonvoting delegate in Congress, "is Puerto Rico's greatest obstacle to sound economic development."
 That's not the way it looks to Yolanda Rivera, of course. She is one of 105 Baxter employees in Culebra, a separate island community of about 2,000 people that is 90 minutes by ferry off the eastern tip of the main island. She pieces together the plastic parts of bladder irrigation kits in one of the factory's "clean rooms." It is a tedious task, lightened by chatter along the assembly line and hearty lunches in the company-supported canteen. Her weekly pay of $275 is no fortune, but it beats the alternatives.
 The only other jobs that could sustain a middle-class life in Culebra are civil service positions provided by the government. The Baxter payroll represents one-quarter of the income of Culebra's residents, and is the economic glue that keeps the crime-free little community intact. "If Baxter left the island, our boat would sink," says Anastasio Soto, a former fisherman who has been the Mayor of Culebra for 15 years.
 But the economic stability of Culebra and dozens of other towns with subsidiaries of mainland companies does not come cheap. Big American corporations were lured to Puerto Rico by the promise of Section 936, which saved them $3.3 billion in taxes in 1993, the last year for which figures are available. What made it especially appealing to most of them was the opportunity to write off not only the actual cost of doing business in Puerto Rico but also to transfer billions of dollars of income from patents, trademarks, brand-name loyalty and other intangible assets carried on corporate balance sheets to Puerto Rico, where they would generate extra tax credits without adding much of value to the local economy.
 The biggest gainers have been a host of American pharmaceutical, chemical and electronics manufacturers. The Treasury Department estimated that the tax savings for Section 936 corporations in Puerto Rico averaged $16,835 a worker in 1987 -- essentially paying for 95 percent of their compensation.
 Some of that is changing. Under the 1993 budget accord, the maximum tax credit under the old rules was reduced from 100 percent of profits to 40 percent after 1997. But corporations were given the alternative of deducting 100 percent of just their payroll and capital costs, up to their total profit. That provision gives corporations a big incentive to create jobs and expand operations on the island.
 Supporters of the new tax provisions hope that the expected job losses in the companies that relied excessively on intangible-asset tax breaks will be offset by gains by companies like Baxter, which use a lot of labor.
 As long as the labor subsidy is generous, Baxter has no reason to abandon Puerto Rico. But if the subsidies are slashed further, said Carlos Antoni, a Baxter executive, the company might be tempted to automate much of the work at Culebra or consolidate operations in the Dominican Republic, where wages are much lower.
 Given a lack of politically realistic alternatives, tying Section 936 benefits more closely to job creation and investment was a step in the right direction, many analysts say. They would like to see even more effort to use the tax incentives to attract tangible capital. "Do we want machines or trademarks in Puerto Rico?" asked Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan, who specializes in tax policy.
 But it may not be that simple. Jose Berrocal, a former head of the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico who now works for James D. Wolfensohn Inc., a New York investment bank, said more straightforward tax incentives might do more harm than good. For one thing, he said, wage-based tax credits are already undermining Puerto Rican-owned businesses that have sprung up to serve the heavy concentration of manufacturers on the island. That is because the credits encourage big corporations to use their own employees to perform support services like maintenance, security and catering.
He also argued that subsidies might lead some American companies to close plants elsewhere in the Caribbean and to consolidate operations in Puerto Rico -- hardly Washington's intent in creating the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
 At the heart of the conundrum posed by Section 936 is the hard reality that America's responsibilities to its Caribbean commonwealth conflict with sound development policy. Because Puerto Ricans are American citizens -- and because they have the right to live anywhere in the United States -- there are both moral and practical reasons to maintain high wages and high levels of consumption on the island. Until the local economy is sufficiently productive to meet Puerto Ricans' expectations, however, efforts to sustain living standards will almost inevitably distort development.
 Puerto Rico already generates a higher percentage of its income from manufacturing than any state, a direct consequence of Section 936. By no coincidence, Puerto Rico's tourism industry lags far behind those of other Caribbean islands, partly because the wages it must pay hotel and restaurant workers are much higher than on islands with lower wage scales. And similar wage problems apply to other industries that might absorb Puerto Rico's unemployed.
 "No one is looking at investments in Puerto Rico that depend on competitive labor costs," one investment banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 In some ways, Puerto Rico's quandary resembles the situation facing eastern Germany after the fall of the Berlin wall. German unification, which increased eastern wages much more rapidly than productivity, caused unemployment to soar. But Germany, noted Jeffrey Sachs, director of Harvard University's Institute for International Development, is plowing hundreds of billions of dollars into building roads and factories and training eastern Germany's work force so that its productivity will match western levels. That may not be the most efficient solution to the problem, he said, but it should eventually do the job.
 Puerto Rico, however, cannot count on any comparable government commitment to raise its productivity. And further tinkering to get more development bang from a Section 936 buck may alienate big corporations already in Puerto Rico, leaving the island without effective champions in Washington for an alternative development strategy.
 "I'm afraid we're condemning Puerto Rico to high and chronic unemployment," Mr. Sachs concluded.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Should Focus On Poor People, Gingrich Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich says that poor people need to "learn new habits" and that women and minorities who rely on affirmative action should instead take advantage of "enormous avenues for opportunity" that ignore race and sex.
Mr. Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, said he would like affirmative action to focus on poor people, provided they were willing to work extra hard, without putting more expectations on the institutions asked to educate or hire them. 
 The Speaker said: "I am prepared to say to the poor, 'You have to learn new habits. The habits of being poor don't work.' "
Mr. Gingrich made the comments on Thursday to 10 black journalists who report on race, school busing and civil rights strategy.
The Speaker said that Republicans were interested in making preference programs work for the poor but that there was "a growing consensus against" helping people solely because of their race or sex.
He said he was skeptical of "a system that says, 'Tell me what your racial makeup is and I'll tell you whether or not you get the next slot.' "
Mr. Gingrich said the flaw with affirmative action was that it was built on lawsuits, a structure encouraged by civil rights advocates who used the courts to break down segregation during the 1960's.
Meanwhile, he said, conservatives "who knew how to create wealth" failed to get involved in the movement. That left the economic experts out of social change that became increasingly economic, Mr. Gingrich said.
"When you create that kind of backward-looking, grievance-looking system, you teach people exactly the wrong habits," he said. "They end up spending their lives waiting for the lawsuit, instead of spending their lives seeking opportunity."
But advocates for affirmative action said they were not willing to heap more expectations on the victims of discrimination while expecting less of those who perpetuate bias.
"Our contract with America is the United States Constitution," said Wade Henderson, a lobbyist for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "We expect the nation to live up to its commitment to all its citizens."

NEXT CHANCELLOR SEARCH MAY BE DIVISIVE
Mayor Giuliani insisted that he had the right of "approval" in the selection of a successor to Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, who announced his resignation on Thursday. But Carol A. Gresser, chairman of the Board of Education, dismissed that idea. The disagreement suggested that the selection process for a new chancellor may be a divisive one. [Page 1.]
 
Mrs. Gresser, the person with the most power to pick the next chancellor, did not get a telephone call yesterday from City Hall, much less from Mayor Giuliani. [24.]
 
Many teachers, parents and schoolchildren were angered and saddened over the loss of a Chancellor many considered to be their leader and ally in educational reform. [24.]
 
Mr. Cortines spoke guardedly with reporters, but to his associates, he appeared to be in high spirits. [25.]
 
Mr. Giuliani's confrontations with the Chancellor have undermined his efforts in Albany to win expanded authority over New York City's schools, Democratic legislators said. [25.]
 
SUBWAY SIGNAL SPACING CAUSES CONCERN
After the fatal crash on the Williamsburg Bridge last week, subway officials acknowledge that there may be many places where the system's signals are too close together to prevent rear-end crashes if a train operator runs a red light at top speed. [1.]
 
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
ANOTHER CHALLENGE OVER HOMELESS
The Legal Aid Society again asked a judge to compel New York City to stop housing homeless families with children in a Bronx welfare office. The group requested a civil contempt-of-court ruling against Mayor Giuliani and two city agencies. [23.]
 
LAWN RECLAIMED FROM 'POCAHONTAS'
Five days after it was transformed into a drive-in without cars for the premiere of the Walt Disney film "Pocahontas," the Great Lawn in Central Park was reopened clear of the litter and other debris that had angered some park users earlier this week. [23.]

EARLY RELEASE FOR TROOPER
After serving less than two months of a one-year sentence, a former New York State trooper convicted in an evidence-tampering scandal has been granted early release by a Delaware County panel. The decision means that the former trooper, Patrick F. O'Hara, will leave jail six months before he would normally be eligible for parole. [22.]
 
5 STUDENTS AGREE TO SKIP GRADUATION
Lawyers for the five Greenwich High School seniors suspended for slipping a message of racial hatred into the yearbook have begun negotiations with the Town Attorney to resolve the situation, but they have agreed to forgo graduation exercises Tuesday night regardless of whether they are reinstated. [22.]
 
TEACHER ACQUITTED OF MANSLAUGHTER
In Stamford, Conn., a teacher was acquitted of manslaughter in the death of her husband, a retired corporate executive whom she admitted striking with a glass candlestick. But she was put on a form of probation on an assault charge. [22.]

HEADLINE: As His Critics' Voices Rise, Greenspan Plans an Address

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
With criticism rising that the Federal Reserve has pushed the economy to the brink of recession, its chairman, Alan Greenspan, has scheduled an address in New York for Tuesday that may be his biggest effort of the year to make his thinking clear.
 The speech before the Economic Club of New York will also be his first big attempt to counter the growing chorus of Wall Street analysts and academic economists who contend that while the central bank might have been right to start raising short-term interest rates last year, it was wrong to do so seven times. 
 The plans for Mr. Greenspan's presentation come after two weeks in which he and half a dozen other Federal Reserve officials presented an often inconsistent picture of the economy.
 One of those officials, Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, said in an interview this afternoon that as he watched the flow of economic statistics from various Government agencies, "I think I'm growing slightly more pessimistic week by week."
 The American economy may stop growing and even shrink in either the second quarter or the third, but probably not in both, Mr. Blinder added. Most economists define a recession as two or more consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output, and Mr. Blinder said this was not likely.
 Mr. Blinder's comments were consistent with Mr. Greenspan's brief remarks last Sunday in Basel, Switzerland, that the United States economy might face a mild recession in the near future but not a deep or lengthy downturn. Just four days earlier, in comments in Seattle, Mr. Greenspan raised the possibility of a recession but played it down. The changing tone of the remarks created confusion about where he stood.
 Some of the regional presidents of the Federal Reserve have taken even more optimistic positions, questioning whether the economy is even slowing significantly.
 Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to give a formal speech on Tuesday for up to half an hour and then take questions for up to 45 minutes from Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist, and Martin S. Davis, the managing director of a private investment company and a former chairman of Paramount Communications.
 Mr. Davis and Mr. Kaufman said today that they did not have any strong views on whether the Fed should cut interest rates. Both men declined to say what they planned to ask, but the questions could be tough. Figures in the last month have shown shrinking employment, falling industrial production and stagnant retail sales.
 The statistics have produced calls from some Wall Street analysts for Fed officials to cut interest rates at their next policy meeting on July 5 and 6. Some economists are even saying the Fed has waited too long.
 "I don't think they're going to turn this around with a cut in July," said William Poole, a monetarist at Brown University, who added that the Fed's decision then "will determine how deep the recession is and how long."
 Mr. Greenspan has apparently consulted very little with his colleagues about what to say on Tuesday. But recent interviews with Fed officials, together with Mr. Greenspan's public remarks and Congressional testimony over the last year, suggest that he will emphasize the underlying strength of the economy while expressing growing concern over the current economic slowdown.
 The factors supporting the view that the economy will bounce back after a couple of weak quarters include a weak dollar, which may stimulate exports; lower long-term interest rates, which help the housing markets, and fairly strong personal income and corporate profits, which mean that consumers and businesses have money to spend if they have the confidence to do so.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Try Recovery But Fall Short

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower yesterday, although they recovered somewhat in the afternoon after a top Federal Reserve official suggested that the economy was weaker than previously thought.
 The comments by Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Fed, rekindled some hope that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates soon. Market prices have seesawed as investors have tried to pin down the size and timing of such a move. 
 Traders said yields rose on short and intermediate securities, which are the most sensitive to rate moves by the central bank, after the University of Michigan released its preliminary consumer sentiment index yesterday morning showing a higher-than-expected number for June. The index rose to 92.3 from 89.8 in May, traders said.
 Mr. Blinder's comments, which came in an interview with Knight-Ridder Financial News, provided fuel for the market's second consecutive day of speculation about an interest rate cut.
 He said that he was concerned about the slowing economic growth during recent months and that in the time since the Fed had last raised overnight bank loan rates in February, economic reports had painted "a very considerably weaker picture than we saw four and a half months ago." These comments yesterday did lift bonds from their lows of the day, but they were in contrast to the comments he made a day before to a Minneapolis group.
 "Ultimately, the mixed signals that we're getting from the Fed are likely to be negative for bonds because the market needs to have a clear view," said Tony Crescenzi, head of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company in New York.
 Without a rate cut anytime soon, some managers are saying, bonds are too expensive.
 The 30-year bond slipped 4/32 to a price of 1132/32 for a yield of 6.62 percent, up from 6.61 percent the previous session. Shorter-maturity bills and notes also fell in price, sending the three-month bill rate up a basis point to 5.47 percent and the yield on a 10-year note up 2 basis points to 6.19 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 Christopher A. Low, senior economist at the HSBC Group in New York, said the numbers he saw in the sentiment index suggested to him that confidence was not eroding so quickly as some of the economic statistics might indicate.
 "Bonds lost on concerns that consumer spending might pick up fast enough to allow the economy to rebound before the current slowdown turns into an outright downturn," Mr. Low said. "That would cancel out any hope of a Fed reduction in short-term interest rates."
 "Mr. Blinder's remarks today led to a nice rebound in prices," Mr. Low added "I think Mr. Blinder's comments were probably taken out of context Thursday, so he returned today to clarify his view on the economy. He seemed much more concerned about the risk of a recession and much less concerned about the risk of inflation." And the risk of recession, Mr. Low continued, would allow for the possibility of a Fed easing in short order.
 "We are faced now with a dearth of economic statistics," Mr. Low said, "which means the game of who said what last takes on more importance. There are a few numbers that will be market movers, particularly durable-goods orders next Friday, which will give the market an indication of manufacturers' willingness to bet on a rebound and at the same time give an indication of how far along they are in the inventory correction."
 Until next Friday, there will be little economic data released, Mr. Low noted.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Steady as Group of Seven Reaffirms Intention to Bolster It

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady yesterday after the seven leading industrial nations reaffirmed their pledge to work together to bolster the currency.
 In Halifax, Nova Scotia, leaders of the seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Canada and Italy -- agreed to "cooperate closely in exchange markets" to secure an "orderly reversal" of the dollar's 15 percent decline against the Japanese yen and 9.6 percent decline against the German mark so far this year. 
 The pledge echoes a statement by Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers made at the group's last meeting on April 25. For that reason, traders said yesterday's communique did little to influence sentiment toward the dollar one way or the other.
 "The market waited all day with bated breathe for something that didn't materialize," said Jim Raphael, currency trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City. "The G-7 is successful in keeping the market very off balance, which is probably exactly what they want."
 In earlier trading in New York, the dollar slipped against the mark as pessimism grew over whether the Group of Seven would produce a specific plan to bolster the dollar, currency dealers said. The dollar settled in New York at 1.4002 marks from 1.4063 marks on Thursday. The dollar rose to 84.76 Japanese yen from 84.52 yen.
 Concern that the Federal Reserve and other central banks could stage another surprise bout of dollar-buying should prevent the dollar from falling too far, dealers said.
 "I think it will be a cat-and-mouse game," said Tom Hoge, vice president of corporate trading at Bank of New York. "The market is concerned about intervention, while central banks are concerned about a failed intervention." That should keep the dollar from moving too far in either direction against major currencies in the days ahead, he said.
 With the Group of Seven meeting out of the way, traders said they would focus on the outlook for interest rates in Germany and the United States. Signs of slowing in both countries have prompted speculation that official rates could soon fall.
 "We'll be looking at the further deterioration in U.S. economic numbers to decide how soon the Fed will ease," Mr. Raphael of NatWest said. "If the Bundesbank eases first, it could be dollar positive." Higher American rates, relative to German rates, often help the dollar against the mark by making deposits in the United States more attractive.

HEADLINE: Slovak Publisher, Facing the West, Checks His Flanks

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BRATISLAVA, Slovakia

 BODY:
Immediately after the Communists fell in 1989, the publishing house created by the novelist Martin Simecka carried on smoothly enough. The goal of the house, called Archa, was to reacquaint Slovaks with the European thinkers who had been banned for 50 years. Simple, elegantly designed pocket editions on the meaning of freedom, human rights and conflict in modern societies by such writers as the philosopher Raymond Aron and the sociologist Karl Mannheim sold at the equivalent of a dollar each to an audience eager to learn about the West through means other than cable television.
But now Mr. Simecka, a gregarious 37-year-old author with prizes from the United States, says Archa is in danger from both an increasingly anti-democratic and nationalistic Slovak Government and declining idealism abroad about Eastern Europe. 
 "Sponsors from outside are losing interest," Mr. Simecka said of the modest publishing venture, squeezed into a few rooms above the side entrance of a bland Government building. "I understand when they say you've had five years to stand on your own. But we have only five million people in this country and sometimes when I'm very cynical I say I know every one of our readers personally."
But the most serious menace, he said, lies at home. "In the Government's eyes we are very unpopular," Mr. Simecka said. "One minister said Archa was a cuckoo's egg in Slovak culture, meaning we are foreign." The Government has revoked the license of a Slovak investment fund that had helped finance the publishing house, in part, it seemed to Mr. Simecka, because Archa also backed an independent daily newspaper critical of the Government.
"Now if we ask for help from business people they'll say: 'I'd like to but I don't dare,' " he said.
Small, quality publishing houses all over Eastern Europe are running into economic problems as the initial burst of money from the West and euphoria at home peter out. But the fragility of Archa, the only publisher in Slovakia to concentrate on serious nonfiction, is particularly critical as Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, a former Communist who was re-elected last year, tries to create an atmosphere of xenophobia.
Mr. Simecka is a second generation writer, the son of a well-known Slovak writer and dissident, Milan Simecka, who was imprisoned and not allowed to publish after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Because of his father's opposition to the Communists, Mr. Simecka was denied university admission. Instead of attending class, he took menial jobs: as a hospital orderly in an operating room and as a clerk in a hardware store selling enamel pans. In an autobiographical coming-of-age novel, he wrote about his adventures of maneuvering around the repressive system and his earnest desire to "be moral, to be good" amid all the sloth.
The novel, "The Year of the Frog," was both comic and wistful and appeared in Slovakia in samizdat form before the Communists collapsed. Since then, it has been translated into English and French. In 1993 it won the Pegasus Prize for Literature, awarded in the United States for a first foreign novel, and last November The Los Angeles Times Book Prize for a first published work of fiction in any language. It is to be published by Simon & Schuster in the fall.
Mr. Simecka, a tall, wiry man, is working on a second novel. He won't divulge the subject except to say it is set in contemporary Slovakia. Mr. Simecka said, "The political novel is not a good novel." But to hear him talk passionately about Slovakia, there is little doubt where the manuscript is heading.
"I think it will get worse in Slovakia; what is coming here is an authoritarian regime," he said as he paced the kitchen of the worker's cottage he and his wife, Marla, bought during the Communist days in one of the few Bratislava suburbs not bulldozed for apartment houses.
"It doesn't mean a totalitarian regime. It means what I call the post-modern dictatorship. Meciar has a talent to be a dictator. He is creating this step by step by manipulating the electronic media, the secret police, business. All the methods are old, he uses them in a different period, in new ways to manipulate society."
Mr. Simecka cited the decision by Mr. Meciar's Government to ban three popular television shows, including "An Evening With Milan Markovic," a Saturday night show of satire on the Slovak political system. At the same time, the state-run television news is a dull but laudatory recitation of the Government's doings, not dissimilar to the style of the Communist-era newscast, he said. In another sign of trying to limit dissent, journalists from the opposition newspaper Sme have been banned as interviewers on the televised weekly talk with a Government figure.
"After getting the electronic media, the next step is to get his hands on the press," Mr. Simecka asserted.
This has already started, he said, with the threat to impose a value-added tax on newspapers, most of which irritate the Meciar Government because they are sympathetic to the opposition parties. The Culture Ministry has started to deny money to theaters deemed to be against the interests of the Government.
"That we are not forbidden -- that is a big difference from the Communist times," Mr. Simecka said of writers and publishers. "Indeed, the only thing that has survived from the November 1989 revolution, the only thing with roots from then is the publishing house. Everything else has gone. The regime and the political parties are not from the revolution."
But he is pessimistic. "Before 1989," he said, "I had a desire for two things: a passport and the possibility to publish. I have these two things and in the near future I don't think they will be threatened. But in the future I don't know. It is a race against time."

HEADLINE: Security Council Approves Sending Reinforcements to Bosnia

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 16

 BODY:
In a hastily called session early this morning, the Security Council approved sending up to 12,500 more troops to aid the United Nations military force in Bosnia, but put off for now the issue of how they would be paid for.
Adopted on a 13-0 vote, with Russia and China abstaining, the resolution was needed to accommodate a new rapid-response force being assembled by Britain, France and the Netherlands to reinforce the peacekeeping troops in the field. 
 The resolution, which makes clear that the additional troops are for peacekeeping operations, passed as fighting intensified around Sarajevo, raising the possibility once more that the United Nations troops, whatever their numbers, might have to withdraw if they cannot fulfill their mandate of protecting civilians and delivering relief supplies.
President Clinton, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, for the Group of Seven meeting, said today that if United Nations troops were forced to withdraw from the Balkans he would favor lifting the weapons embargo on the Bosnia Government so that it could better arm itself. Republican leaders in Congress also favor lifting the embargo, and withdrawing the United Nations troops.
The Administration, which earlier favored lifting the embargo by agreement with other nations, stopped pushing the issue last year under pressure from the British and the French, who have the largest contingents of troops in Bosnia. But there is a shared sentiment in Congress and the Administration that the Bosnian Government has been handicapped by the ban since the Bosnian Serbs have had access to the weaponry of the Yugoslav Army.
After a dispute erupted between the Europeans and Americans here on Thursday over who would pay for the new reinforcements in Bosnia, the Security Countil resolution was amended at the last minute to put off determination of financial assessments or contributions until some unspecified future date.
"The wording of the resolution leaves all options open," said Joe Sills, spokesman for Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "This is a question of a political decision that will have to be made by the member states most closely involved."
In her speech early this morning, Madeleine K. Albright, the United States delegate, told the Council, "To put the matter simply, in a time of serious budgetary cutbacks, we are not now prepared to pay the lion's share of the cost of expanding this force."
Clinton Administration officials said today that it would conduct a fund-raising drive among the world's wealthier nations to help pay the bill for the rapid-response force for Bosnia. The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, said that the United States would contribute to the fund, but less than the 31 percent it would normally have been assessed.
The Security Council's unexpected meeting was called by the French after European and American leaders at the economic summit in Halifax agreed to the compromise, which added eight words to a three-page resolution that has been in circulation all week.
The Council had adjourned Thursday evening without agreement, expecting to return to the issue this morning. The call for a midnight session brought diplomats, interpreters and many staff members scurrying in from their homes to pass a resolution at a meeting that lasted until 3 A.M.
France and its new President, Jacques Chirac, had staked a great deal of prestige on getting the resolution passed while Mr. Chirac was in the United States. He met President Clinton on Wednesday and Mr. Boutros-Ghali on Thursday, after which he confidently predicted to reporters here that the resolution would pass the same day.
But it was Washington that caused nearly a week of delay in acting on the resolution, irritating both the French and the British. The Clinton Administration, which supported a resolution that would have automatically led to the United States being assessed nearly a third of the cost of the operation, was challenged twice by Republican leaders in Congress who opposed the financial obligation.
Congressional leaders also said that the Administration had created its own problems by failing to consult fully with lawmakers as the resolution was being drawn up in New York.
On Tuesday, the chairman of the House Committee on International Relations and two other Representatives wrote to President Clinton saying that they were "dumbfounded" to learn that the United States would pay for a rapid-response force that began as a strictly European project with limited American backing. The Administration responded by stalling further debate here.
On Thursday, a day after meeting with President Chirac, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, wrote another letter asking that the rapid-response force be paid for by voluntary contributions. Mr. Chirac had left the impression that France would be willing to have Europeans or others pay for the new force, a position contrary to that of Britain, which always wanted the costs divided by normal United Nations assessments.
Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole also said that they had been led to believe by Mr. Chirac that the force would not fall under United Nations civilian control, an assertion that ran contrary to documents circulating here since last week. It is unclear who misunderstood whom.
The effect of the Gingrich-Dole letter was to derail the Clinton Administration's support for the resolution, creating havoc in the Security Council Thursday.
By Thursday night, all the parties involved had bucked the issue up to Halifax for a decision, which was not made until late in the evening. Then the French, to make a point, brought the whole slumbering organization to life at an even later hour.

HEADLINE: A Fair Farm Bill

 BODY:
The House should get behind a bipartisan farm bill proposed this week that would bring down food costs and the deficit by wiping out Federal farm price supports. A less obvious, but important, virtue is that the bill could also save the food stamp and child nutrition programs.
The farm bill -- sponsored by Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Richard Zimmer, Republican of New Jersey -- would phase out commodity support programs. These set target prices for rice, cotton, wheat and several other crops. If market prices fall below the targets, the Government pays farmers cash to make up the difference. The bill would also eliminate subsidies to farmers who earn more than $100,000 in non-farm income. The Schumer-Zimmer bill would save about $30 billion over seven years. 
 Farm subsidies are inequitable -- transferring money from consumers, some of whom are poor, to owners of farms, many of whom are wealthy. The average net worth of the farms that collect 70 percent of the Federal payouts -- those with annual sales over $100,000 -- is nearly $1 million. About 40 percent of the subsidies go to non-farm landlords. Another flaw is that the commodity subsidies make no economic sense. American farms are the productive envy of the world and require no handout from Washington. Indeed, farm products that are not subsidized, like potatoes and tomatoes, do perfectly well.
Besides raising food prices and the deficit, farm price supports threaten the Federal food stamp and nutrition programs, like subsidized school breakfasts and lunches. Budget resolutions will require Congressional committees to make cuts of about $40 billion in food stamps, nutrition and farm programs. The committees currently plan to take only about $10 billion out of farm programs. But under the Schumer-Zimmer bill, farm programs would be cut an additional $20 billion, leaving that much more for food stamps and nutrition.
President Clinton in his latest proposed budget chose not to take on the farm lobby -- proposing a meager cut in farm programs of $4 billion over seven years. More courage is needed. At a time when the Republicans are dismantling the welfare safety net for the poor, Congress ought to do no less for farmers, phasing out their safety net. The poor deserve low-cost food more than millionaire farmers deserve Federal handouts.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Hotel Franchise Company Looks to Century 21

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Harry R. Silverman is the biggest hotel magnate in the nation, but nobody knows his name. Maybe that's because he does not actually own any hotels.
 Mr. Silverman is no Conrad Hilton or J. Willard Marriott. But in less than five years, he has quietly put together a hotel empire that exceeds anything they ever dreamed of. As chairman and chief executive of Hospitality Franchise Systems, Mr. Silverman owns the franchise operations that control 4,200 mostly low- to mid-price hotels that go under the Ramada, Howard Johnson, Super 8, Days Inn, Park Inn and Villager Lodge names. Hospitality, in return for some nice fees, provides nationwide marketing services and centralized reservations systems to the chains. 
 And, while Mr. Silverman would not mind being better known, he is not about to change a winning formula. He is taking that same idea on the road.
 Last week, Hospitality Franchise agreed to pay up to $230 million for Century 21, the nation's largest residential real estate chain, with 6,000 franchised offices. That follows closely on the heels of Mr. Silverman's decision last year to create a gambling subsidiary to provide marketing services to 10 casinos in six states.
 Strange alliances? Not as Mr. Silverman sees it. "We're not in the hotel business; our customers are," he said in a recent interview in his 41st-floor office in midtown Manhattan. "We're a service provider to franchises." And franchising, as Mr. Silverman points out, "is a cash machine, and its assets are all tax-deductible."
 Wall Street seems to agree. Since Hospitality, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., announced its plans to acquire Century 21, its stock has risen from $28.75 to $31.75 yesterday.
 Hospitality makes most of its money by collecting a set percentage of annual gross room revenues for the services it provides to hotels affiliated with its six brands. Fees from those room revenues produced $132.7 million of Hospitality Franchise's $312.5 million in total revenues last year. But the operation was so profitable that it accounted for more than 80 percent of the company's $53.5 million in earnings.
 Hospitality's success has made Mr. Silverman a very rich man. He owns about 10 percent of the company, which makes him worth roughly $180 million today. Apart from Mr. Silverman, the managers of the company own a collective 15 percent. Each of the 12 members of the senior management committee, which includes Mr. Silverman, has at least $1 million in equity.
 But can Mr. Silverman duplicate that success elsewhere? Some analysts think so.
 "He'll do something similar for the domestic residential real estate market to what he did for lodging," said Michael G. Mueller of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "It's a different business, but it has been undermanaged and Henry has been very adept at figuring out what to do to increase value. That will encourage more people to sign up with the system."
With only limited opportunities to expand the reach of his hotel empire, Mr. Silverman sees Century 21 -- whose revenues last year were just 40 percent of Hospitality Franchise's -- as opening the door to what could be a much bigger business in the future.
 "If you add up all the revenues of all the hotels in the United States, including food and beverage, it's about a $30 -billion-a-year business," he said. "Single-family residences are a trillion-dollar business. Obviously, profit opportunities are significantly larger with Century 21 than with hotels."
 To begin the transformation of Century 21, formerly owned by Metropolitan Life, into a more efficient cash machine, Mr. Silverman is talking to a publisher about putting out a series of real estate books under the Century 21 imprimatur.
 The next step would be to adapt a preferred-vendor program to the housing market. Hospitality's hotels now sign exclusive contracts with a range of suppliers from AT&T to Alamo Rent-a-Car to provide certain goods and services in return for the best possible price. The same concept, Mr. Silverman says, should work in real estate, allowing Hospitality to grab an extra piece of the action on tens of thousands of deals. Each slice might be thin, but they should add up.
 "Every housing transaction has many elements, including property and casualty insurance, mortgage insurance," he said. "You could designate an insurance company or a series of mortgage lenders, and make them your preferred vendor."
 Despite a poor track record by many other companies in combining disparate units, Mr. Silverman also believes there are economies of scale to be achieved by integrating some operations. "There are important synergies in the back office, the part of the business involved in containing costs," he said. These include marketing, risk management, training, human resources, the legal department and accounting. "We bought six companies," he said, "and our back office is essentially the same as when we started."
 Mr. Silverman has a reputation as a stern, somewhat aloof boss, who pays his top executives well, but expects them to deliver good results -- or else. "We have a policy that you're entitled to a raise each year or you're out," he said. "The theory of a marginal performer doesn't exist in our company."
 For all his interest in exploring new territories, however, Mr. Silverman still looks forward to some remaining conquests on the hotel front. "It's no secret that we are very covetous of the Hilton name," he said. "We have every hotel segment covered except the four- and five-star level, so it would be advantageous to have another arrow in our quiver."
 Hospitality has made an offer, through Goldman, Sachs, to buy Hilton Hotels, probably with a partner that would acquire the real estate ("bricks and sticks," Mr. Silverman calls it). That would leave Hospitality free to own the name alone, which it would license to Hilton hotels and casinos.
 "They're considering it," he said. But, after a pause and a fleeting smile that suggested a rare moment of uncertainty, he added: "They're undoubtedly considering other proposals as well."

HEADLINE: The Case For No Helmets

BYLINE: By Dick Teresi; Dick Teresi is editor of VQ, a magazine about Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass.

 BODY:
It's time for the nation's oldest bike festival. This weekend, 150,000 motorcycle enthusiasts have converged on Laconia, N.H., for the Laconia Motorcycle Rally. Ah, the joys of motorcycling! The throaty roar of your V-twin engine, the call of the open road, the wind in your hair . . . .
Wait. Forget about that last part. The riders en route to Laconia won't feel any wind in their hair. They'll just feel the rush of air over their plastic helmets -- at least until they cross into New Hampshire, which doesn't require riders over 18 to wear them. 
 Forty-seven states have some helmet requirements. At the rally, plenty of T-shirts will deride motorcycle helmet laws. They'll sell well. In a survey of 2,500 bikers at the 1993 rally, 98 percent of the respondents said they opposed such laws. This opposition is often dismissed by nonriders as evidence of bikers' rebelliousness. But we oppose the laws for reasons other than personal freedom. Helmets are not necessarily the life-savers some people think they are. In some cases, they may be killers.
Deep in the plush recesses of any helmet approved by the Department of Transportation is a tiny warning label: "Some reasonably foreseeable impacts may exceed this helmet's capability to protect against severe injury or death." The unspecified "reasonably foreseeable impacts" are any collisions at speeds greater than 15 miles per hour. The department tests the protection provided by helmets by dropping them on an anvil from a height of six feet. This is equivalent to an impact at 14.4 miles per hour. So if you're riding to Laconia, keep your speedometer below 15 miles per hour.
But what about all those statistics purporting to prove that helmets save lives? Some studies indicate that there are fewer motorcycle deaths per one million residents in states with helmet laws than in states where helmets are not mandatory. (The study most cited was made by the Center for Disease Control and covers 1979 to 1986.) But this is largely because there are more riders per capita in states that did not require helmets.
If you take those same statistics and count motorcycle fatality rates per 10,000 registered motorcycles rather than per general population -- a more sensible approach -- you find that nine states without helmet laws had a lower fatality rate (3.05 deaths per 10,000 motorcycles) than those that mandated helmets (3.38).
What about claims that helmet laws reduce deaths caused by head trauma? Jonathan Goldstein, a professor of economics at Bowdoin College, studied crash and injury statistics and found that while helmets might prevent head injuries at very low speeds, they can increase the possibility of neck injuries at high speeds.
This makes sense. The body, like any object under impact, breaks at its weakest point. If a biker wearing a four-pound helmet is thrown to the pavement, the head might be saved but the neck is more likely to snap.
Helmets, especially full-face models, suppress the normal sensations of wind and speed and thus can give riders a false sense of invulnerability and can lead to excessive risk-taking and dangerous riding habits.
The real problem is not uncovered heads. It's that too many bikers don't ride well and too many automobile drivers don't look out for motorcycles. To make motorcycling safer, the nation needs better driver and rider education. A 1988 study by the American Motorcyclist Association, showed that states with good motorcycle education programs and no helmet laws had an average fatality rate of 2.56 deaths per 100 motorcycle accidents while states with helmet laws but no training had a death rate of 3.09 per 100 accidents.
Is there a place for helmets? Sure. Anyone who rides in a car should wear one. Head injuries make up only 20 percent of serious injuries to motorcyclists but are far more common in car accidents. If the state legislators who have passed helmet laws are serious, they ought to prove it by always wearing one in the car. Meanwhile, let motorcyclists feel the wind in their hair.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Filipinos Splurge on Resorts to Woo Tourists

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: CEBU, the Philippines

 BODY:
After decades of a downward-spiraling economy and tumultuous politics, the Philippines has steadied itself. The economy is beginning to boom. Politics has settled down to a more genial level of boisterousness. And finally the door to tourism has been opened with enthusiasm.
Tourist arrivals in the Philippines, especially from other Asian countries and Hong Kong, have climbed rapidly in the last three years. From just over 900,000 visitors in 1990, the Philippines saw a record 1.6 million last year. High quality, Governmentapproved hotel rooms, which numbered only 9,000 in 1990, have mushroomed to 11,000. 
 Even as older, run-down Government-owned resorts are closing or are being taken over by private owners, a stream of new hotels and resorts are being built or have recently opened throughout the country. Many of these resorts boast facilities rivaling those elsewhere in Southeast Asia: impeccable, spacious cabanas huddled around glistening pools overlooking pearl-white beaches. And there are, as well, lower-key, more rustic sites scattered across the archipelago.
Some resorts occupy entire tiny islands. The Amanpulo, for one, rambles across the island of Pamalican, about 125 miles northeast of Northern Palawan. Like other Aman resorts throughout Southeast Asia, the Amanpulo is expensive; rooms start at $350 during the high, winter season. The palm-fringed shard of sand and jungle is surrounded by a huge reef for divers and snorkelers. A golf cart comes with each of the 40 air-conditioned hillside casitas, or bungalows.
The island of Palawan, which the country's tourism officials refer to as the Philippines' last frontier because of its brilliantly clear waters, untouched reefs and blindingly white beaches, has a few resorts as well. Not new, but a favorite of Asian travelers, is El Nido on Miniloc Island, one of hundreds of islands that sprinkle the western coast of Palawan. With peak season prices of $190, it is a bargain for Asia, and offers everything from diving to cave exploration.
Among the newest of the Philippine resorts is the 359-room Mactan Island Resort, run by the Shangri-La group of hotels here on Cebu Island, about an hour south of Manila by air. Cebu Island, with a proliferation of dive sites, beaches and jungle, has struggled to attract Western tourists until recently. A disheveled Government-owned resort called Argao, a frequent destination for Asian visitors, closed last year, so the recent opening of the Shangri-La resort has been a boon for the island.
Cebu, unlike smaller islands, has direct service to Hong Kong, usually the central destination for visitors to Southeast Asia from Europe and North America.
At the former American naval base at Subic Bay, a three-hour drive from Manila over sometimes hair-raising roads, or 30 minutes by helicopter, the Subic Bay Resort and Casino has just opened for business. Owned by Malaysian investors, the hotel is a former officers' barracks which has been transformed into a nautically themed luxury hotel.
The hotel offers a range of gambling, from blackjack to slot machines and poker. Rooms are aligned along corridors designed like those on a 1940's cruise ship and range in price from $128 for a double to about $220 for a two-room suite.
Around the old naval base, parts of which have been turned into light industrial parks, are swimming pools, a golf course, bowling, bungee jumping from an old Navy crane and, for the hardy, a jungle survival course taught by Negritos, the area's indigenous people, who live in the jungle.
The biggest obstacle for tourists coming to Asia for the first time is Manila's ramshackle and chaotic Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which suffers from passenger overcrowding. Entire families, neighborhoods or villages will descend on the airport to see friends off or welcome them home. With more than four million Filipinos working abroad, mini-festivals surrounding arrivals and departures are a constant occurrence. Baggage delivery is slow, and shuttling to the domestic airport is not always trouble free. The Philippine Government hopes to build a new airport, but at the moment, it is a long way off.

HEADLINE: Spring Housing-Sales Climate Is Chilly

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
SPRING is the time of year when residential real estate markets often blossom. This spring, though, the market's climate in most of the New York metropolitan region has been cool.
House closing figures -- which typically reflect contracts signed one to three months earlier -- have been below those of a year ago in most areas and sale prices have been somewhat lower for many types of houses. 
 Not even near-record-low interest rates have sparked a rise in home buying activity, though some local brokers have reported an increase in recent weeks. Because closings often take up to 90 days, though, sales figures from May and early June will not become public until late summer.
"Consumers may be a little overcautious today, considering that home prices have stabilized and where interest rates are at," said Robert Sperte, president of Century 21 of the Northeast, which is based in Manhattan. "We think it is a healthy, normal market now in most of the region, and the boom-and-bust cycle is over."
Economic uncertainty, particularly about future layoffs, continues to hold back potential home buyers in the New York metropolitan area, however. There also appears to be a lingering hesitation because of heavy losses suffered by property owners in the late 80's and early 90's.
Other factors are at play, as well, like less favorable demographics, specifically a declining pool of young first-time home buyers. And median home prices in many parts of the region, even after the drop off a few years ago, are still high compared with local median income levels.
Rents, however, are at record highs throughout the suburbs as well as in the city, prompting some tenants to put pencil to paper and consider buying a home, regardless of their qualms about potential lack of liquidity or the prospects for appreciation of residential real estate these days.
Thus, at best, the overall market in the region this spring appears flat at least compared with last year, with small pockets of strength, such as high-end properties in Manhattan's better neighborhoods and some single-family homes in affluent suburban towns, such as New Canaan and Westport, Conn., with outstanding public-school systems.
"Over the last few weeks, the upper end of the market in Manhattan has been hot as a pistol," said Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real estate firm. "It is characterized by lots of buyers with cash, a short supply of large apartments and multiple overbidding.
"More foreigners bought condominiums this spring than ever before," she added. "With rising rents and the drop in the dollar, foreign investors snapped up whatever remaining inventory was available."
Rick O'Neil, a regional director of Century 21 in Westbury L.I., added: "Queens right now is the hottest market in the five boroughs. I have a feeling it is because there are a lot of homes available for first-time buyers, and there are immigrants that either come here with money or save up enough for a down payment."
Overall, though, the decline in sales volume was almost universal in the region in March and April.
IN Westchester County, for example, where there were a record number of sales in 1994, there were 53 fewer homes sold in April than in March, when there were 288, and 106 fewer this April than in April 1994, when there were 341, according to statistics compiled by the New York State Association of Realtors. That's a drop of 18 percent over one month and 31 percent over a year earlier. In Rockland County, there were 135 April sales this year compared with 138 the month before and 160 in April 1994.
On Long Island and in Queens, the number of home sales fell to 1,176 in April from 1,338 in March, a 12 percent decrease, and from 1,349 a year earlier -- a 13 percent drop. On Staten Island, the number of homes sold in April dropped to 52 from 83 in March and from 72 in April 1994. (No reliable statistics exist for Brooklyn or the Bronx.)
In Fairfield County, Conn., the number of homes sold fell to 1,012 in April from 1,136 12 months earlier, a 10.9 percent decline, according to The Commercial Record, a weekly newspaper in Hartford that tracks real estate transactions.
The April figure was also a 13.9 percent decline from March, when 1,176 homes were sold.
"There continues to be concern about the economy -- even in Fairfield County," said Vincent Valvo, editor and publisher of The Commercial Record. "Fairfield County is doing better than the rest of the state, but it is not immune to problems. Wall Street isn't doing well right now, and there have been problems at Sikorsky, the helicopter-maker in Stratford."
In New Jersey, there are no statistics available yet for April, but the figures for the first quarter of the year showed a decline in sales for Northern New Jersey to 52,200 in the first quarter of 1995 from 63,500 in the first quarter of 1994 -- a drop of 18.1 percent.
In New York City, the trend downward in sales was not as sharp. Condominium sales, for example, steadily declined from January through April. But the 182 sold in April are still a tad more than the 177 sold in April 1994.
As for the co-op market in Manhattan, comprehensive statistics on sales really don't exist, and the broadest set of figures available, which are produced by the Real Estate Board of New York, only cover the first quarter of 1995 and only about 25 percent of the sales in the city, according to the board.
Those statistics show that there were 368 sales in the first quarter of 1995 compared with 358 in the first quarter of 1994, a slight improvement.
"SALES have definitely been on the upswing in May and June, particularly in the studio and one-bedroom category," said Deborah Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "This may be due, in part, to the extreme tightness of the rental market. With fewer units available for lease, a lot of renters are suddenly becoming buyers."
When digesting all these sales figures from various areas, it is important to keep in mind that sales for the first quarter -- and even for April -- are not truly an accurate reflection of much of the activity this spring.
This is because closings on single-family-home sales routinely take two to three months, and the process can be even longer for co-ops because of the need for board approval. So, a true statistical picture of the spring market won't be visible until late summer or even early fall.
"The decline in actual home sales across the country and the Northeast this spring is really a reflection of a drop in activity that took place in the later part of 1994 when the Fed pushed rates higher," said Mr. Sperte of Century 21 of the Northeast.
The decline over the first quarter of last year also reflects how well the market was doing a year ago, as much as a downturn in 1995. Last spring was a banner year in many places because of pent-up demand among Baby Boomers who didn't or couldn't buy during the late 80's and early 90's. Many home buyers also took the plunge last spring after the Federal Reserve starting raising interest rates, fearing that they would only go higher in the next few months or years.
"Over the last year, rates had not gone up enough to create a pent-up demand across the board, but they did slow sales of low-to-mid-priced properties," said Clark Halstead, managing partner of the Halstead Property Company, a residential real estate brokerage firm in Manhattan.
"With rents at astronomical levels for small apartments now, I think this current rate drop is going to push a lot of buyers into the market for studios, and one- and two-bedroom apartments," he added. "There is a lot of well-priced property out there, and there is a feeling that rates can't go much lower. When buyers start to think that rates have bottomed, there is almost a rush to buy. I think we are going to see that this summer."
There are pockets of strength already in Manhattan. They tend, though, to be in the town-house market, which usually starts at around $1 million, and in co-ops in the $750,000-and-up range. The number of such homes, however, is minuscule compared with the thousands of studio and one-bedroom apartments in the city.
"There is a perception that because the market is strong at the top it is strong throughout and that is not true," said Alan Rogers, managing partner with Douglas Elliman, the Manhattan real estate broker and management company. "It's a seller's market at the top and at the bottom it's a buyer's market."
Mr. Halstead added: "It's an orderly market, not frenetic like it was in the 80's. This time last year, people on Wall Street got bonus checks, and this year it's unemployment checks."
SALES prices have mirrored the flat trend in sales volume, for the most part, though measuring changes using median prices is imprecise. And it is generally considered by economists and statisticians to be of limited use in a real estate market because its results can be skewed by a lack of market activity or a pattern of dissimilar sales in different years.
The median price per room of studio and one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan, according to the Real Estate Board, fell to $50,000 from $56,000, but rose for two-bedroom units to $83,500 from $75,833.
Ellen Bitton , co-founder of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a mortgage broker, said that her firm has seen an increase in sales this spring, spurred by falling interest rates.
"Once fixed-rates dipped in May to their lowest level in the last 15 months, the sales dam seemed to burst," she said. "From February 1995 to May 1995 there was a 45 percent increase in new mortgage applications here, and I would venture to say that only about 20 to 25 percent of that was refinancing.
"We are not in the midst of a recession and the low rates today don't mean the same thing they did 18 months ago," she added. "People want to take out loans today. They are very interested in buying and getting what they see are low-rate loans. They are very interested in buying and getting low mortgage rate deals."
The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the New York metropolitan area has plunged in the last few months, dropping more than 1.5 percentage points to 7.84 as of last Wednesday from its recent high of 9.39 percent on Dec. 16, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Butler, N.J.
That means that anyone who simply waited five months to buy a home with a fixed-rate mortgage may have saved, before taxes, $110 a month on a $100,000 mortgage; the payments would have dropped to $723 from $833.
Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages also have dropped -- but not as much. The average interest rate on a one-year A.R.M. in the New York metropolitan area fell to 6.02 as of last Wednesday from its recent high of 6.54 percent on Jan. 13, according to HSH Associates. That means the average monthly payment for a new A.R.M. fell $34 on a $100,000 loan, to $601 from $635.
Mr. Sperte of Century 21 added that people shopping for houses had become increasingly sophisticated about different types of mortgages and rate structures. "They are surfing the rates and seem to be waiting for the right time to strike," he said. "This leads us to expect a slowly improving residential market for the remainder of the year."

Housing Sales Just a Bit Off Record 1994 Pace

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
LAST MONDAY Uta and Bob Hershey closed on a 60-year-old English Regency-style house in the Village of Bronxville. For more than six months, they had been looking in the suburbs closest to New York City for a house with "an excellent school system," Ms. Hershey said.
There was a sense of urgency, she added, since they wanted to be ensconced in their new surroundings by the time their son, Bo, started kindergarten in September. 
 Such reasoning makes the Hersheys the prototypical spring buyer who storms real estate offices from March to June so as to be settled in a new home by the start of summer vacations and well before the beginning of the school year.
The spring selling season has traditionally been the busiest time of year for real estate agents who count on it for the bulk of the their annual revenues. The Westchester County Board of Realtors said that first-quarter sales were 10 percent off from the first quarter of 1994, but nevertheless the second busiest first quarter ever after last year's record comparable period. The year as a whole was also a record for the county, the board added.
"Buyers are being cautious right now," said Nancy Seaman, chairwoman of Houlihan/Lawrence, the largest residential real estate company in the county. "For us, we've been a little bit off from last year, but only marginally down. And in the last month or so, things have definitely picked up."
Ms. Seaman, who noted that 1994 was her agency's best year, said that a few of her company's offices were having banner years. "Katonah is hot," she said, "so is Bronxville and Rye has really taken off."
Sometimes, real estate brokers say, it's hard to determine exactly why some communities are doing better than others. For instance, Audrey Rapaport, regional manager of south Westchester for Houlihan/ Lawrence, said that her agents had been working around the clock in the company's Rye office.
"When a house comes on the market in the Rye and Harrison area, it's immediately getting mulitiple offers," she said.
At the beginning of the year, Ms. Rapaport said, her office had the buyers but was waiting for listings.
"We've gotten more listings in the last month, and there's tremendous pent-up demand, especially in the $500,000 to $800,000 price range. We're much busier than this time last year."
APRIL and May were two of the best months ever for Coldwell Banker Schlott in White Plains, according to Joseph Monaco, the office's branch manager. "It's tied to the slide in interest rates," he said. "We've seen activity in all categories. There's been a 50 percent increase in sales volume so far this year."
Communities such as Bronxville, which is known for its school system, have been the traditional sites of a spring selling spurt. While sales this year are steady, "it's not as hectic as last year," said Vera Blendermann, the office manager for Houlihan/ Lawrence.
"We're about 10 percent off from this time last year," she said. "But we planned to be off."
The houses that are selling best now in Bronxville are in the $700,000 to $800,000 price range.
"Last year, it was the $800,000 to $900,000 range," Ms. Blendermann said. "I can't really account for the difference except that people are being extremely careful, due to job uncertainty. They're waiting for interest rates to bottom out. Historically if they go up a quarter point, there's frantic activity."
In some areas, the pace of spring sales has ranged from sporadic to desultory. "It's not last year," said Mary Grimm, partner in C.S. McClellan Real Estate, of Pelham. "We've been seeing spotty activity."
Ms. Grimm said she did not feel that spring lived up to its billing anymore. "You can't judge it like you used to," she said. "We had a wonderful January, February and March when young professionals were getting their Wall Street bonuses. And we're looking to blossom in June and July."
This year, all the brokerage offices in Pelham posted 49 sales from Jan. 1 through June 5 -- 8 more than last year, said Ms. Grimm.
Ms. Grimm said that her office had also benefited from corporate relocations. "They've really helped us to maintain good market activity throughout the year," she said.
It just so happened that Irene and Tony Hutchings closed on their 100-year-old Victorian home in Pelham during the spring season. The couple moved from Boston because of a job change and Pelham was the first place they looked. "It had the Old World charm we were looking for," Ms. Hutchings said. The quality of the school system didn't figure in, since the Hutchings have grown children.
For a while the spring season was hampered by a shortage of inventory, according to Savo Fries, president of the Westchester Multiple Listing Service. "A lot more has come on the market in the last month or so," she said. "There's plenty of inventory now. It's a very diversified market. There are houses from $150,000 to $1 million. Anything in the $300,000's is selling immediately. And the $500,000 to $600,000 houses in the right locations are also moving."
Ms. Fries said she had also noted a return of the second-home buyer in the more rural northern part of the county, people from New York City and other areas. "I guess they figured they've waited long enough and now is the time to buy," she said.
HOUSE prices have been declining, Ms. Fries added. "It couldn't be a better time to buy," she said. In the first quarter of this year, the median price including all four housing categories -- single-family houses, condominiums, co-ops and 2- to 5-family houses -- dropped 4 percent, from $239,000 in the 1994 quarter to $229,900.
Some people who, in previous years, might have looked in Northern Westchester are now zeroing in on Putnam County, according to Natalie Pugliese, owner of a real estate agency in Mahopac that bears her name. "The phones started ringing a few weeks ago as interest rates inched down," she said. "We're getting people with money who are interested in new construction. They're buyers who work on Wall Street. They come here because of the lower taxes and expenses. Distance to Manhattan is not that big an issue."
Ms. Pugliese said that her customers were "getting more conservative, especially if they work for a company."
If they have their own business, she said, they are a little more confident."
Across the river, in Rockland County, news couldn't be better, according to Paul McKearnin, manager of Weichert Realtors, in Pomona. "Our office is up 101 percent in sales from last year," he said. He attributes the increase to his office hiring 11 more sales people. "We now have 46 people," he said. "And there's been good buyer flow."
Another change from last year, Mr. McKearnin said, is a greater interest in high-end properties. "We've been selling well in the $600,000's, which is our high-end," he said. "Of course, the bulk of sales is still in the $175,000 to $230,000 category. We do 50 percent of our business with first-time buyers."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Dual Agency;
When a Brokerage Represents Both Sides in a Deal

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT has become a common sales pitch: Hire our firm to handle your building's leasing, and not only will our brokers funnel the hundreds of tenants they represent to your property, but you will save money when they do.
After all, if the tenant's representative and the leasing agent are from different firms, you would have to pay the tenant's rep a full commission, and the leasing agent a smaller one, usually called an "override." If both those people work for us, the sales pitch goes, you'll pay only one full commission, and we'll worry about how it gets split. 
 The surface logic is irrefutable, and almost irresistible. But it poses one problem: If the landlord is paying less in commission, that means the brokers are earning less. And that, in turn, gives brokers a financial incentive to avoid in-house -- known as "dual agency" -- situations.
"In an in-house deal, everyone takes a bit of a haircut," said Michael E. Gochman, a managing director at the Peter R. Friedman brokerage.
Real estate regulations require that firms inform tenants and landlords of dual-agency situations. And few landlords simply shrug off the potential problems.
"This is one of the great debates," said Kevin R. Wang, a senior vice president of the Mendik Organization, which usually handles its own leasing but recently hired Newmark to lease up its 18-story building at 330 West 34th Street, which is about 25 percent vacant. "Sure, good brokers won't steer a tenant to a building where they make more money, but there's a potential problem nonetheless. It has to do with human nature."
It is a sensitive subject among brokerage firms, particularly those with so many tenants and buildings in their stable that dual-agency situations are unavoidable. The top executives at the Edward S. Gordon Company, one of New York's largest real estate service firms and thus very likely to run into potential conflicts, will not even discuss their dual-agency policies, preferring to say through a spokesman that the firm's commission policies are confidential.
The brokers who will talk generally deny there is any problem. They insist their only concern is matching the right tenant with the right space.
"This is a professional business, and that means you represent your client's interests," said Barry Gosin, Newmark's chief executive. "Otherwise you're a used-car salesman, nothing more."
OTHERS note that even a broker who wanted to follow mercenary motives would be afraid to take the chance.
"It has nothing to do with morals or ethics, but with long-term business sense," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in the New Spectrum store-leasing firm. "What are you going to say if your tenant finds out? It was a great space for you, Joe, but I didn't show it to you because I'd get paid badly?"
And there is probably little doubt that the tenant would find out. Mr. Gochman recently put a tenant into some sublet space that brokers from his firm were handling at 666 Fifth Avenue, at 53d Street. He knew his commission would be smaller than it might have been in another building, but he saw no other choice. Mr. Gochman's firm had the exclusive right to lease the building, but the tenant could have gone with whatever broker came through with the best space.
"You can be sure that if I had not shown them this space, another broker would have," he said.
But despite the disclaimers, many real estate firms have grown uncomfortable enough with the financial disincentives inherent in dual agency deals to do something about them. Cushman & Wakefield was in the vanguard. For more than a decade, it has made up part of the tenant broker's commission shortfall in dual-agency deals, by cutting the amount the firm takes out. And unlike some other agencies, it refuses to ask landlords to help defray the expense.
"You can't tell landlords to pay a premium to deal with your people," said David M. Gialanella, a senior managing director at the firm. "But you also can't disincent the person who procures the tenants."
Other brokerages are reaching the same conclusion. Last year, when Colliers ABR rose from the ashes of a failed merger between Koeppel Tener Riguardi and Abrams Benisch Riker, the new firm set up a commission schedule to tackle the conflict head-on. Normally, the firm takes 45 percent of its brokers' commissions. In a dual-agency deal, it only takes 20 percent; the tenant representative keeps 55 percent, the leasing agent gets 25 percent.
"It makes our brokers totally neutral, and that is an excellent selling point to landlords," said Peter G. Riguardi, the firm's executive vice president.
For now, Williams Real Estate is holding the line on commission splits, instead asking landlords to kick in extra commission money in a dual-agency situation, or promising to reward brokers who take smaller commissions with a lucrative leasing agency assignment down the road. But that policy is not set in stone. "In theory, a broker will always do what's best for the client, but in the real world everyone wants to make a full commission," said Andrew H. Roos, executive vice president of Williams. "We are taking a second look at our policy because no firm wants to think that it is doing anything that can demotivate a broker in any way."
Landlords, meanwhile, are reacting with a combination of trust and practicality. The World Trade Center recently hired the Gordon company to lease some 550,000 square feet in the Twin Towers. Charles E. Maikish, the center's director, doubts there will be any conflicts -- and if there are, he says, they are Gordon's problem as much as his.
"This is a high-profile property, and Gordon wants to demonstrate it can lease it up quickly and effectively," he said. "They know that if I ever suspect a personal economic bias at play, I will consider them in violation of the agency agreement." In other words, the firm would endure a highly publicized dismissal.
Still, Mr. Maikish will pay a small override even if a tenant comes through a Gordon broker, just in case. "Both brokers do have to take a commission reduction in a dual-agency deal, but at least this way they don't take as big a hit," he said.
The dual-agency question is less pressing among retail brokers, in that retailers are less flexible about space and locations than are office tenants. "If a retailer wants to be on 57th and Fifth, you can't talk to him about 48th and Park," said Mr. Fox.
Still, New Spectrum has started distributing 10 percent of its own piece of the commission back to its brokers in dual-agency deals. Garrick-Aug, another store leasing firm, recently started allocating 10 percent of the house take to the leasing agents in dual-agency deals. "We talked about this a long time," said Faith H. Consolo, the firm's managing director. "We finally realized we had to do this so that agents would really promote their space in-house."
Actually, many brokers say that the non-monetary compensations in dual agency deals make up for slimmer commissions. They say the deals go more quickly and are less acrimonious, since neither party wants to humiliate a member of his or her own firm. They say that brokers dealing with their own colleagues are more likely to offer a true rendition of what points are negotiable, and of what rent the building will not go below -- or the tenant will not go above.
"You can go down the hall and say, 'Look, this is what I need to achieve in this deal,' and find out right away if it's doable," said Robert A. B. Baraf, a Gordon managing director who recently put Montgomery Securities into 590 Madison Avenue, at 57th Street, where the Gordon firm handles the leasing. "You don't waste anyone's time by bringing a $20 tenant to a $40 building."
BUT brokers have to walk a somewhat fine line here, too. Telling a tenant's representative that the landlord will take, say, $30 a square foot per year for a space can cut days out of a negotiation, but it certainly lessens that landlord's chances of getting $35. The converse is also true: Admitting that a tenant will go as high as $35 makes it less likely that the tenant will get the space for $30.
"You've got to put up a wall, to make sure that no information is revealed that shouldn't be revealed," said Kenneth Singleton, Cushman & Wakefield's managing counsel.
Most brokers report that, while in theory there may be a problem with breaches in the wall, in actuality both sides to a negotiation are so conversant with going market rents and concession packages that no one can be tricked into giving away the store. All that happens, they say, is that they can dispense with uncertainty.
"What brokers fear most is what they don't know," said Mr. Gochman. "Did another tenant offer a better deal, or does an existing tenant want to expand into the space? The quicker you know about that, the quicker you can look for a backup deal for your tenant. And someone who works for your firm is more likely to tell you."

Faith in Education: A Church Prep School in Newark

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
There are many images associated with this city, but "prep school" is not one of them.
If anything, the thought of education in Newark brings to mind decrepit classrooms and low test scores. The State Department of Education is so unhappy with the city's public schools that it is assuming control of them next year. But even if Newark's schools become the best in New Jersey, the Rev. William D. Watley wants to offer another option. 
 That is why Mr. Watley's congregation at St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church is raising money for a preparatory high school. Although some members of his congregation are unhappy with Newark public schools, he said, the project was not conceived out of anger.
"We simply want to provide a viable alternative for people who want something different," he said. "The idea for our school was not born out of frustration with the system."
The 3,000-member congregation has already collected about $5 million for the project, which is expected to cost about $11 million. An architectural firm in Princeton has designed a building, and Mr. Watley hopes construction will begin late this year.
He said he seized upon the idea of a prep school in the late 1980's, when he was pondering how his church could better serve Newark residents. Although the city has several other private schools, including St. Benedict's Grammar School and St. Vincent Academy, all have extensive waiting lists, he said.
The new school, called St. James Preparatory School, will be open to anyone in grades 9 through 12. It is expected to begin with 250 students and eventually expand to 500.
Mr. Watley said he had decided on a high school because several other Newark churches are planning elementary schools.
"Because of who we are and where we are, the school will probably be mostly African-American," he said. "But we want it to be an option for anyone who wants something different."
The school's board of directors, which includes congregation members and business leaders, has hired educational consultants to help set up a curriculum. It will emphasize foreign languages, international studies and technology, Mr. Watley said. The school will include a Family Development Center that will offer such things as job training and counseling to students and their families.
Tuition has been set at $5,500 for the 1996-97 school year, but Mr. Watley said scholarships would be available. The school will accept not only the brightest students, but also those who receive B's and C's.
"I believe a lot of students fall through the cracks because they're not academic superstars," Mr. Watley said. "If they have the motivation, they can still be productive members of society."
The 55,000-square-foot school will be built next to St. James Church, a 103-year-old stone building on the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Court Street. The lower half will match the exterior of the church, but the rest will be a mix of brick, glass and metal, symbolizing the school's emphasis on technology. The Hillier Group, an architectural firm in Princeton, designed the building.
"We wanted it to embody both the tradition we stand upon and the forward thinking of where we're going," Mr. Watley said. "They put our vision into the bricks and mortar."
Many businesses and foundations have contributed to the cause, but half the donations have come from individuals and families. Elderly members of the St. James congregation have offered cans full of pennies, and children have surrendered their allowances, Mr. Watley said.
Despite the city's depressed economy, he said, he is confident that the millions of dollars still needed will materialize because so many residents are devoted to the project.
"It's a matter of when we do this, not if," he said. "We have to believe our faith and hard work will be justified."

Cutting Taxes: Cost or Benefit?

BYLINE: JEAN RUTTER

 BODY:
Supporters of Governor Whitman's plan to cut the state income tax by another 15 percent say it will distribute the tax burden more fairly and stimulate the economy. Opponents say her timing is unwise, given the possibility of large cuts in Federal aid or a recession, and they claim it will lead to higher property taxes. What do you think?
 
Not Worth the Stress 
 The small amount saved for each individual is not worth the stress that will be placed on municipalities and school systems. This is not responsible government. Governor Whitman will be long gone and will have achieved her political ends before the effects of her shell game are realized.
ED FISCELLA
Blackwood
 
Passing Costs Along
I agree. Those of us who work in municipal government or closely observe the effect of state and even county handoffs like this are not fooled. Much as I appreciate some of Governor's Whitman's measures, I can't condone this "tax cut." It's not a cut. The costs are simply passed along to lower levels of government. She gets away with her shell game because so many school boards and municipal governments are separate legal entities. When schools come in with higher budgetary needs, guess who gets blamed?
KAREN LYNCH
Bloomfield
 
Unfair Impact
When taxes were cut last time, my property tax went up more than my income tax went down. Now, as a result of these tax cuts, the D.M.V. offices will be returned to the patronage mills that they were in the 80's. Our highways are darker and dirtier, essential services are being cut and burdens are being shifted. The income tax is a fair tax because it's progressive. The increased taxes and fees that the income tax cut produced have disproportionately hit people with lower incomes.
JOSH DUBNICK
Hopatcong
 
Paying for Services
Tax cuts are gimmicks to appease voters and supporters. I want services, and I know they cost money. I look to government officials to cut costs and minimize waste, not line their families' and friends' pockets with handouts, and to be honest with the public. I have yet to see it. Governor Whitman is wasting her time. She should really try and lead. She'll be able to eat after her two terms are through.
JOHN N. HAHN
Glen Rock
 
Paying for Stability
Services cannot be reduced much more without instability among the population. The money must come from somewhere. I'll pay the taxes for the well-being of the state.
MARK QUINN
Somerset
 
A Flawed Assumption
To those who insist on believing that a tax cut at the state level must cause a tax increase at the local level: That is true only if it is assumed that the level of services must remain the same. Closed equations are only as good as the assumptions upon which they are based. It is not lower taxes that really bother those who are in favor of higher taxes, it is the lower level of government spending that the lower taxes requires. EDWARD J. ZOHN

Thanks Anyway
What the income tax cut does is boost Whitman's popularity while sending more of the responsibility for services to the municipalities, meaning higher property taxes. Thanks anyway, Christie, but the extra $50 a year isn't really helping me that much.

Filling the Gap
I agree with those who have had their property taxes go up due to the cuts in funding to municipalities. She can say she cut the taxes but knows very well that the towns and cities have to make up the difference. WALTER C. SMITH

Where Is Compassion?
What about essential services to the disabled and mentally ill? Where is the compassion out there?

A Promise Kept
Finally, a Governor committed to keeping her campaign promises. If you're upset about property taxes, blame your freeholders, mayor, council and school board. Given some of the reponses here, I doubt many of you know who they are. If you knew who they were, you'd know they have been giving away the store (your property tax dollars) to law enforcement and the teachers' union.
Cut what taxes you can, Christie, and I'll take care of those who raise my property taxes. Christie for Vice President? President would be more like it.

HEADLINE: Perfect Game

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
WELL before the baseball game, the purple sky and the wind-whipped ripples on the Delaware River told of a storm coming. Some of the fans streaming into Waterfront Park to watch the Trenton Thunder play the Binghamton Mets cast anxious glances upward.
If a minor league game means less than, say, the cost of living or the fate of the blue whale, it still means a lot to those who fill the Thunder's idyllic playground, where enthusiasm for the summer game burns as fiercely as the midday sun. 
 A baseball game is fun for Glenn Carter too, but it is much more than that. It is his self-image, his dream. Never mind that at 27, he was the oldest player on the Thunder. On this Saturday night, the relief pitcher was optimistic that his 90-mile-an-hour fastball could carry him to the Boston Red Sox, the Thunder's major league parent, before his arm died.
"I'm never going to give up," he said in his Kentucky drawl. "It might come this year."
Nearly five hours later, he got a chance to show his stuff with a game on the line. Thanks to a 76-minute rain delay in the sixth inning, it was getting on toward midnight by the time the Thunder scored four runs in the eighth to go ahead, 8-7. With the Mets coming to bat in the ninth, Carter was summoned from the bullpen. As he walked to the mound in the late-night chill, the sound-effects man in the press box played "Wild Thing" -- that's Carter's nickname -- on the public-address system.
The sound effects (and accompanying images on the electronic scoreboard) are just part of what draws sellout crowds of 7,000-plus to see Class AA Eastern League baseball -- two steps below the major leagues -- at Mercer County Waterfront Park. There are also dinner prizes for some lucky seat-holders, a free wash for the dirtiest car in the parking lot, and base-running contests between innings pitting children against Boomer, the Thunder's bird-costumed mascot. Somehow, Boomer always trips over his own feet or gets distracted, because he never wins. He is so popular that there is a Boomer fan club for younger children.
If much of this sounds and looks like low-camp, cornball tinsel . . . well, it is. It provides nothing more useful than fun and laughter. And in embracing such frills, minor league clubs like the Thunder -- and the state's other pro baseball franchise, the Class A New Jersey Cardinals in Augusta, Sussex County -- are clearly on to something.
After decades of decline, minor league baseball has suddenly become a viable industry -- an economic-development tool and a source of pride for downtrodden cities like Trenton, a magnet for commerce in the hinterlands of Sussex County. Nationwide, attendance has more than doubled since 1980 -- to 33 million in 1994 -- and demand for franchises has increased 27 percent, acccording to the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, which governs the minor leagues. There is even talk that the minors, with 214 teams, may soon draw nearly as many fans as they did in their golden age -- the late 1940's -- when there were more than twice as many teams.
And just last week, organizers of a brand-new league -- the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball Clubs -- announced plans to put two of its six franchises in New Jersey: in a new stadium in Atlantic City and a renovated one in Newark. That would give the state more minor league teams than at any time in nearly a century.
Though the Atlantic League is a long way from playing its first game, local politicians are exuberant at the prospect and have promised to find ways to raise the necessary capital, at public expense if they have to. "We'll find the money," said Mayor Sharpe James of Newark.
For those who love the intimacy and hometown spirit of minor league ball, it has been a long wait. At their height, in 1949, the minor leagues drew 39 million fans to 448 ball parks. But that fan base soon withered, and as with so many other things that go wrong in baseball, it is easy in retrospect to see why. Many ball parks were allowed to grow shabby, and the prevailing philosophy among team owners seemed to be that the game was the thing, that the prospect of seeing major league players of the future ought to be enough.
It wasn't. For one thing, television allowed the fans to see the major league players of the present in the free comfort of their homes. And more and more people with leisure time and money discovered the joys of pizza parlors, shopping malls, video-rental movies and other post-World War II adornments of American life.
But in the late 1980's and early 90's -- a time when nostalgia for the small-town, Sunday-social America of "Field of Dreams" was sweeping the country -- baseball-loving entrepreneurs began moving into the minor league establishment and making some radical suggestions. The game is supposed to be fun, they said. And the setting should be made a lot more fun.
Trenton's Waterfront Park, with its diversions, sound effects and a special picnic area, is certainly a pleasant (and inexpensive) place to spend a few hours. What is truly splendid about games in the year-old ball park next to the river is that they are played with abandon by young men -- boys, really -- who may still harbor dreams of the big money in the big leagues but have not yet lost their sense of fun.
It has become almost a cliche that some major league players, taking their inflated salaries for granted and sometimes distracted by off-the-field legal problems, have lost touch with everything but their own egos and incentive clauses. It may be unfair to generalize, but cliches have some foundation in truth. There are big league players who are gracious to their adoring fans, and there are others who sulk while earning as much in a season for batting .243 as Joe DiMaggio or Ted Williams did in a career.
At Waterfront Park, there is a smiling rapport between players and autograph hunters who line the rail at the playing field's edge. And the fans have paid no more than $7 for the privilege.
UP in the press box, Bart Mix selects the computer-generated sounds, or "click effects," as he calls them. Often, he confers with Les Trinity, who sits a few feet away and operates the scoreboard.
Mix, a 35-year-old math teacher and wrestling coach at Matawan High School, and Trinity, who is 20 and graduated from Mercer County College, have a wide variety of sights and sounds with which to entertain the fans and taunt the opposition.
The noises and images, some from the barnyard and a few that sound suspiciously like belching and flatulence, occasionally walk the line between foul and fair. When the opposing team's manager and pitching coach go to the mound to confer with the pitcher, Trinity is apt to flash an image of the Three Stooges on the board. Depending on his meanness of the moment, Mix may select the Mickey Mouse Club song or the theme from "Psycho."
"When we're winning, we can do a lot more because the visitors go to the pitcher's mound a lot," Mix said.
During the rain delay, Mix played a medley of songs, including (of course) "Who'll Stop the Rain?"
Just before the game, Glenn Carter had talked of how a reliever had to stay cool and not let mistakes get him down. "Mentally, I'm perfect for the bullpen," he said.
Now, in the top of the ninth, he took his warm-up throws, and the sounds of "Wild Thing" died away.
His first pitch was not wild at all. It was right over the plate, and Binghamton's shortstop, Kevin Morgan, hit it for a clean single. Carter got the Binghamton center-fielder, Jay Payton, to pop up on the next pitch.
Carter threw nine pitches to the third man he faced, Jeff Barry, the Binghamton center fielder, walking him. Then came his worst throw of the night, not toward home plate but to first base, a pick-off attempt that sailed high, letting Morgan race to third. (Straining the boundaries of good-natured ribbing, Mix chose that moment to play "Wild Thing" again.)
Carter struck out the next batter, third baseman Chris Saunders, on six pitches, but then left fielder Jay Davis smacked a single, and Morgan scored. Though the next batter flied out to end the inning, Carter had let the Mets tie the game.
He was far more effective in the 10th, 11th and 12th (the outing was his longest of the season), finding the plate more often, throwing his fastball with the pop he had boasted of earlier and holding the Mets scoreless.
Carter left in the 13th. The Mets scored off his replacement, Scott Bakkum, and Trenton lost, 9-8.
Three fans who stayed to the end were Vanessa Falcone, Kimberly Dale and Valerie Lauer, all 10th graders at nearby Ewing Township High School. Weren't they taking this loyalty thing a bit far?
Not at all, they replied: the players are approachable, courteous "and good-looking." (Their favorite is Jeff Suppan, a tall right-handed pitcher from California who, at 20, is not much older than they are.)
Would the girls return the next day? Silly question. They have season tickets.
In the quiet locker room afterward, Glenn Carter was courteous despite his pain. "I feel bad about losing the lead," he said. "I threw the ball well, but . . ."
BASEBALL Is Life," read the T-shirt of one of the first fans into the park the next day.
If it is life, it is also redemption. In the Sunday sunshine, with the stadium sprinklers watering the grass and the river sparkling like molten silver in the background, the previous night's loss seemed a distant memory.
Stadium crews wiped off the seats, now and then stopping to chat with the players; food vendors began preparing mountains of pizza, hot dogs, cheeseburgers and (yes) peanuts and Cracker Jacks, and one could hear the sounds of chopped ice being nestled around bins of soft drinks and beer.
These happy sounds have been heard along the Delaware since the spring of 1994, when minor league baseball returned to Trenton for the first time in 44 years and to New Jersey for the first time since 1978 -- when the Oakland A's pulled their Jersey City farm team out of the dilapidated Roosevelt Stadium.
The Thunder is owned by Garden State Baseball Limited Partnership, whose principals include Samuel Plumeri. His father was a part-owner of a minor league team of yesteryear, the Trenton Giants, who had a player thought to have some big league potential. (His name was Willie Mays.)
Before 1994, the Thunder played in Ontario as the London Tigers and was affiliated with the Detroit Tigers. It was still part of the Detroit organization when the new owners brought the team to Trenton, but the franchise became affiliated with the Boston Red Sox for this season.
Despite finishing last in the Eastern League's Southern Division in 1994, the Thunder was third in overall attendance. This year, the team has been playing around .500. It leads the league in attendance, having drawn 156,591 fans to its first 29 games.
Down on the field, Glenn Carter confessed to a few aches in his 6-foot, 170 pound frame. Had he shaken off the disappointment?
"Got to," he said. "It's part of baseball." And Carter, a plain-spoken man with a crewcut, loves baseball, likes the fringe benefits ("I've had a lot of free meals in Trenton"), thinks it would help him provide a good life for himself and his girlfriend, even though he was playing at the moment for about $1,500 a month, paid only during the season.
And wasn't he going the wrong way? Last year, Carter pitched for Boston's Triple-A affiliate in Pawtucket, R.I. This year, he was a rung lower. "They're making me into a closer," he explained. "That's why I'm here."
As a starter in Pawtucket, he had an 8-7 record with a 4.79 earned run average in 1994. "But I was 8-2 at one point," he said. Then he got sick, and hits started dropping for the batters he faced.
Now, on this baseball Sunday, his optimism was flowering again. In a dugout chat with coach Rico Petrocelli (the first shortstop to hit two home runs in a World Series game, a feat he accomplished for Boston in 1967, the year Glenn Carter was born), Carter said he could go a couple innings this day if he had to.
"Sure," Petrocelli deadpanned. Then, seeing Carter rubbing a sore muscle, he said, "You should run; get that lactic acid out."
"Want to run a few laps with me?" Carter said.
"I don't have any lactic acid," Petrocelli said, aiming at a spitoon that wasn't there.
And off went Carter and his teammates in a coltish, laughing trot around the perimeter of the stadium.
The Thunder took an early lead and was ahead by 9-2 at the end of six innings, and the crowd was happy indeed.
Ron Martin, an affable Tennessean, watched with more interest than most fans. He is the father of the Thunder catcher, Jeff Martin, who was a month short of 25 and a strapping 6-4 and 220 pounds. What did he think of his son's chances of making it to The Show, -- the big leagues?
"Oh, he's a big, strong kid, and they like that. He's on the right track. With a break here and there. . ."
Of course, the catcher's father agreed, a good break for his son might mean that someone else had had a bad break. Such is life in the world of professional sports. No, the father said. It would not destroy his son if the breaks did not go his way. (But so far, they are. In a bit of a slump lately, Martin was still batting .246 last week, with 2 home runs and 20 runs batted in. And his strong frame is supported by what Tom McCarthy called "the biggest legs I've ever seen.")
The Mets narrowed the margin to 9-7 at the end of eight. The indefatigible McCarthy, who is also the the Thunder's radio announcer, reminded his audience how "last night's game got away."
On came another Trenton reliever, Joe Hudson. He yielded a hit, but he didn't let the game get away. The Thunder won, 9-7, and the fans went home to savor the rest of a sunny day.
GLENN CARTER went home too, to Kentucky the next day, after the Thunder released him. The Red Sox reached the decision after conferring with the Trenton manager, Ken Macha, and the pitching coach, Al Nipper. There was a collective feeling, McCarthy said, that Joe Hudson -- almost three years younger than Carter -- had a better future.
(The Red Sox thought so too. Hudson was called up to the big club just over a week ago, and performed creditably in his first appearance, allowing one hit and getting a strikeout in an inning and two-thirds against Oakland.)
It may be small consolation to Glenn Carter, but he took with him the Trenton record for saves by a pitcher: eight.
"He may latch on with someone else," said Tom McCarthy. "But with his age, it's going to be difficult. I think he knows that."

How to Sell Your House in a Hurry

BYLINE: By BRETT BRUNE 

 BODY:
WITH a company transfer in hand, you take the plunge and move up to a more expensive home in a new city. But while you unpack those hundreds of boxes, butterflies crowd your stomach. And they're not just anxieties about a new job in a new place. You still haven't sold your old house. And you're ready to try anything to unload it.
For you and other would-be home sellers, the July issue of Smart Money describes a do-it-yourself home auction in an article titled "Going Once . . . Going Twice . . ." It focuses on one family's intensely trying, though ultimately successful, experience. 
 After a year of getting nowhere with conventional home-selling methods, the family took the advice of William G. Effros, a computer consultant who wrote "How to Sell Your Home in Five Days." The family had one "out" -- the sale could be canceled if the price was disappointing -- but it was still a gamble.
The article makes it clear that Mr. Effros's book could have been called "How to Test the Limits of Your Primary Relationship for Five Days." Because this family succeeds, albeit after summoning Mr. Effros himself to the scene, the magazine plants an idea: Five head-spinning days of playing auctioneer may be better than months of angst trying to sell a home -- for some people.
Also in Smart Money, an update on last year's list of the best and worst discount brokers. Among the 19 brokers ranked by the magazine, Jack White came out on top. The firm was cited for relatively low commissions and a wide array of services.
In the category of broker expertise, K. Aufhauser and Lombard received top marks, and Pacific Brokerage came in last. Steven Wallace, Pacific's president, is quoted as saying that to get up to speed, new hires "just sit next to someone who has been doing it for longer." K. Aufhauser and Lombard, the magazine reports, "train even their brokers licensed by the National Association of Securities Dealers for one and a half and three months, respectively, before they are allowed to handle orders, and then insist brokers take one or two weeks of refresher courses each year."
 
LAND RUSH Office buildings. These two words can clear a room of investors nearly as quickly as yelling "derivatives" can. But after years of problems, commercial real estate is once again being promoted as an attractive investment. In its July cover story, "Timely Picks for Your Portfolio," Kiplinger's quotes a financial analyst from Prudential Securities who calls Highwoods Properties in North Carolina the firm's "single best idea."
The company owns 2 retail properties, 36 industrial properties and 64 office properties, and it recently bought several more, including Forsyth Properties, the biggest owner and developer of office and industrial properties in the Winston-Salem, High Point and Greensboro areas of the state.
The recovery in real estate, now in its early stages, is expected to last beyond 2000, Kiplinger's reports. Beware though, investing in real estate can be dangerous, as both big and small investors learned in the 1980's.
On the insurance front, Kiplinger's suggests that condominium owners; parents of teen-age drivers; people who own pools, boats and large dogs, and families who employ child-care givers and cleaning people consider buying an umbrella policy with $1 million in personal liability coverage.
Phooey, you say? Kiplinger's describes a home owner who had to pay a window washer $1.2 million after he broke his heel in a fall and another who had to pay $1.5 million after a teen-ager struck his head on the swimming pool and became a quadriplegic.
The umbrella policy, generally very inexpensive, doesn't cover all types of claims, like those arising from a position on the board of a nonprofit group, the article notes.
 
A FEE FOR ALL Floridians in particular will want to take note of "Fees from hell: How fiendish is your bank?" in the latest issue of Money. Five of the nation's 10 "most fee-frenzied banks" are in Florida, the magazine concludes in its Your Money Monitor.
In the category of obnoxious corporate behavior, Money had no trouble finding examples. The highly publicized account of a Chicago bank that charges customers for consulting a real person for a transaction is just one.
Another Chicago bank charges its clients a 1 percent commission to deposit their coins. A Colorado bank charges its customers $25 an hour for help solving problems with their accounts.
From a survey of 1,137 banks, the magazine produces a list of the "fee-fattest" banks in each state. Winners of this dubious achievement award include the First Interstate Bancorporation in Washington state, Signet Bank in Washington, D.C., State Bank & Trust in Oklahoma and First Union National in Tennessee.
Also worth reading is the magazine's cover story on getting emotions under control when it comes to money matters. While its approach is far from fresh -- eight things not to do with your money -- the article is an enjoyable overview for people learning the ropes of personal finance.
Among some of the more interesting points made by Money is that people fear a loss more than they should. Along with loss aversion, Money describes the sunk-cost fallacy, which means that once you have paid for an item or service, you can be overly reluctant to waste that service -- another tendency that can lead to poor decisions. And it offers advice. "Evaluate investments solely on their potential for future loss and future gain," it suggests. "Your best bet is to ignore all your feelings about what you paid and calculate only on the basis of current value."
 
DIE AND LET DIE For everyone who believes that life is no dress rehearsal, Worth's cover story is right on track. "Die Broke" stands out in the July/August issue for its thoughtfulness on how to coordinate the end of one's physical and fiscal lives.
It starts off by painting Americans as a pack of fanged beasts obsessed with their parents' money ever since two Cornell University economists "primed U.S. baby boomers to expect the largest collective inheritance in world history." In the end, "Die Broke" states the obvious: it may be more satisfying to give away money while you're alive than after you're gone.
After someone 60-plus deals with long-term care and buys annuities to guarantee a decent income for life, the money left over can be considered free game. Each person is allowed to give another person $10,000 a year free of gift taxes. Bigger gifts can be made without taxes if the money is applied against a $600,000 lifetime exclusion from estate and gift tax. And payments to educational institutions or medical facilities for someone else's current or future bills are also gift-tax exempt.
Worth does not spare the ink to make its case. But for details on the seven financial tools mentioned in "How to use it all up -- safely," readers will need to look elsewhere.

THE BUDGET
Clinton's Balancing Act
To balance or not to balance, that used to be the question, with Bill Clinton clearly favoring a lopsided budget over the pain of a balanced one. But the slings and arrows of outrageous Republicans proved too painful, and last week the President hummed a radically new tune. O.K., balance it, he said, but do it in 10 years, not 7. His formula: save on Medicare, but not as drastically as the Republicans want; cut taxes for the middle class, not the wealthy; cut welfare, but protect children. But the question remains: Will any of the grand formulas being tossed out in the current political frenzy actually stick for 7 or 10 long years? As one lawmaker put it: if you don't like the President's stance on a given issue, just "wait a few weeks."
 
AUTOS
Fiery Voice at the U.A.W.
When Stephen Yokich first picketed G.M., he was in a stroller. He was, after all, just 22 months old; his mother, a G.M. worker, was pushing. That was in the late 30's, a hot time for union battles. Cut to the 90's: automation, Japanese cars, an economy manically reinventing itself, fading memories of union power. United Auto Workers membership has slumped from 1.5 million in 1979 to perhaps 800,000 today. Mr. Yokich, now 59, wants to change that -- and he just might. Last week he was elected U.A.W. president, and hopes are high that he can bring vigor -- and members -- to the struggling union. He's got a fiery resume -- he was, for one, behind last fall's strike in Flint, Mich., which rippled through plants nationwide. But he's also known as a realist, one who can cooperate with management when the handwriting's on the assembly line.
 
SOFT DRINKS
A Cola With Snob Appeal
It's a time-honored marketing tactic: put some bows and ribbons on it, call it "premium" or "luxury," and double the price. Look at "gold" cards, which quack pretty much like humbler pieces of plastic. Look at Lexuses, which look a lot like Camrys with gold earrings. And now comes -- take a deep breath -- "Royal Crown Draft Premium Cola." It's "rich and smooth," the company says, "with a long-lasting head." It comes in beer-style bottles. "We're inventing a whole new category," Royal Crown's president said. And, yes, a whole new price: up to $4.99 a six-pack. Actually, given the huffing and puffing of the great "cola wars," it's a wonder no one has thought up the "premium" angle before.
 
DRUGS
The Menopause Market
Menopause has clearly arrived as a hot topic. Why? Because all those baby boomers are hitting the relevant age, of course; out of sight, out of mind. And, yes, it's a hot business topic too, as drug makers hover hungrily at the gates to this life passage. So when news came last week -- from The New England Journal of Medicine, of course -- that estrogen therapy lifts the breast-cancer risk by at least 30 percent, drug makers watched carefully. Many experts say the cancer risk is more than offset by estrogen's protection against osteoporosis and heart disease -- a view sure to be embraced by American Home Products, which last year sold nearly $1 billion worth of Premarin, the leading estrogen. It gets complicated, though, for Merck is nearing the market -- a market that will bulge in a few years -- with a drug that treats osteoporosis without hormones. For women caught in this vise, this means the added assault of marketers confusing them even more.
 
MEN AT WORK
Father? What's a Father?
At the risk of sounding like a greeting card: What is a father? (This being His Day, you were naturally wondering this, weren't you?) Don't get soppy or philosophical, though; we're talking statistics, just statistics -- offered by Catalyst, a research group aimed at helping women in business. Does Dad bring home the bacon to two children and stay-at-home, slipper-bearing Mom? A mere 3.1 percent of families fit this cuddly mold in 1993. Fully 10 percent of American husbands are "designated homemakers" (no relation, presumably, to designated hitters), up from 2 percent in 1986. And among households with working parents, those headed by single fathers are increasing fastest. Still, Child magazine, which tracked "father-friendly" companies in 1992, stopped the next year because so few qualified -- or even cared. O.K., back to the football game (or whatever season it is).
 
CYBERSPACE
Between Consenting Computers
On the Senate floor last week, Jim Exon of Nebraska waved a blue binder with a red label reading "Caution." Mr. Exon was shocked to find this "disgusting material" on the Internet, and he and most of the rest of the Senate don't want your children to see it. (Don't ask how many senators sneaked a peek.) So they did what lawmakers tend to do -- voted to impose fines and prison terms on those who distribute "filthy" material over computer networks. A worthy sentiment, surely -- and the lopsided 84-16 vote reflects a distinct fear of being seen as "pro-filth" -- but the whole free-speech issue lurks awfully close by. Cyberspace has created an odd new mix of public and private, and private communication between adults has always been sacred territory. Even Orrin Hatch, that pillar of conservatism, denounced the measure, saying, "It's a political exercise, and I'm against it."
 
THE MILITARY
Let Them Eat Missiles
Starting in the early 80's -- you remember, when we didn't worry about spending money we didn't have -- this nation spent more than $35 billion on a "Star Wars" missile defense, with little to show for it. So you'd think those Republicans hell-bent on balancing the Federal checkbook would apply their austerity here, too -- especially with the cold war over. But no -- even while slashing everywhere else, the House last week added $628 million to the anti-missile allotment. The rationale: the cold war's end means greater risks of missiles from rogue nations, and thus more need for that fabled "missile shield." If, that is, it works.
 
POSTAL SERVICE
Moving New York's Mail
Good news, New Yorkers: those 17 catalogues and 14 credit-card offers that are jammed daily into your mailbox are arriving a bit faster this year. (Oh, yes, the real mail is, too -- when you can find it amid the junk.) The Postal Service said last week that New York no longer languishes at the bottom of the nation's big-city mailbag in on-time delivery -- with 83 percent of mail arriving punctually, up from 62 percent last year. Westchester is another matter, though -- the county's mail service ranks second from the bottom nationally, with only San Juan, P.R., below it.
 
MERGERS
I.B.M.-Lotus: Teamwork?
So I.B.M. buys Lotus. What does it get for its $3.5 billion? Clearly, what it hopes to create, with Lotus's Notes software, is a team powerful enough to play in Microsoft's league. But that will be a disjointed team indeed if, as promised, Lotus remains a private enclave within Giant Blue. Louis Gerstner, I.B.M. chairman, is all for a big, solid front. But with separate sales forces and software teams, "there is simply no way," one business professor said, that I.B.M. can "make this deal pay off." So the surprising independence granted Lotus managers may soon be in name only. . . . Microsoft, meanwhile, got some good news. An antitrust deal it cut with the Justice Department had been tossed out in court, but a Federal appeals court reinstated it -- and took the judge who'd rejected it off the case.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Helping the Renaissance Ballroom Live Up to Its Name

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
On a recent gray morning at 138th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, the Renaissance Ballroom looked like a ghostly reminder of its former glittering self -- the only remaining evidence of its heyday a sagging marquee and a faded sign for the Chinese restaurant that used to be one floor up.
Just down the block, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts was halfway through a glazed doughnut in his office at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, waxing lyrical about what the ballroom will be like once the church's development corporation is through restoring it. 
 "With all of this development, there's no place for a young girl to have a sweet 16, for a young couple to get married, for old-timers to do the Lindy Hop," Mr. Butts said between bites. "A community is more than housing, it's more than business. It's culture. People have got to have a place to laugh, sing and dance."
The Abyssinian Development Corporation has already raised close to $1 million from public and private sources for the ballroom's renovation, which is expected to start by year's end and cost $9 million.
Built in 1921, the Renaissance Ballroom -- known affectionately as "the Rennie" -- was the dance hall that popularized black music and drew Lindy-lovers from all over the world. It was the stage for the big band sounds of jazz giants like Cab Calloway, Count Basie and Duke Ellington. And the home court for the all-black New York Rens basketball team (named after the ballroom) before African-Americans were allowed into the National Basketball Association. It was also where former Mayor David N. Dinkins and his wife held their wedding reception, more than 30 years ago.
The adjacent Renaissance Theater offered plays featuring Paul Robeson and movies by film makers like Oscar Micheaux.
And, of course, there was the China House above, which Mr. Butts would like to see re-emerge as a Red Lobster. "Black people love seafood," he said. "It's a great family restaurant."
After the Ensign Bank, the savings and loan association that owned the ballroom, went bankrupt, the Abyssinian group bought the 40,000-square-foot property for about $300,000 from the Federal Resolution Trust Corporation. It has been vacant since 1979.
On Friday, the Abyssinian group hosted its Harlem Renaissance Day of Commitment, a day of corporate networking and cultural events on West 138th Street that organizers expected to generate $250,000. Although money from the day's festivities were intended to support and celebrate the development corporation's work in general, organizers and participants clearly had the Rennie in mind as a goal.
"It's the symbol of what the Renaissance Ballroom stands for, as far as our community is concerned," said George Weldon, who heads the Harlem Business Alliance, runs a funeral home and has contributed toward the Rennie's renewal. "We need not only to leave our children a legacy of love, but a legacy of economic empowerment, and we can't do that if we don't own anything."

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Warrior for the Bodega Owners

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER 

 BODY:
SEATED AT A PLAIN table in a boxy, bare-walled storefront office in a nondescript section of Bellerose, Queens, Richard Lipsky is the picture of modesty. Soft-spoken and professionally self-effacing, he describes himself merely as someone "paid to make arguments," an idealist engaged in nothing more subversive than a "cheering-up process."
Shift the scene to municipal buildings and executive suites, and the picture of Mr. Lipsky cast by city planners, nutrition advocates and supermarket executives turns dour. He is an obstructionist extraordinaire, they say, a kind of Luddite hired-gun opponent of progress and big stores who stirs baseless fears among the small merchants he organizes and represents. 
 "He's a very capable and articulate lobbyist whose mission is to prevent the opening of retail stores in New York City," Joseph Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, said.
As the executive director and sole staff member of the Neighborhood Small Business Association, Mr. Lipsky fancies himself the David battling the Goliath of the supermarket chains. His role representing Hispanic owners of bodegas and small supermarkets in the recent cacophonous fight over a Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem gained him his greatest visibility yet. Even though Mr. Lipsky lost a major battle in that fight when the Manhattan Borough Board approved the project, his supporters -- whose stores are generally in the 3,000- to 6,000-square-foot range -- still credit him with being thorough in his facts and lean and mean on the attack.
Among New York lobbyists Mr. Lipsky is a small fish, not even coming close to the city's top 10 for 1993, the last year for which comparative statistics are available. Last year, he earned $96,000 from clients like the grocers, the Empire State Beer Distributors and the Uniformed Firefighters Association. Still, to his opponents, Mr. Lipsky, 48, seems ubiquitous, and indeed he can be found at the center of many fights over big supermarkets these days, all over the city -- Springfield Gardens, Astoria, the Bronx.
The Giuliani Administration finds Mr. Lipsky a particularly frustrating adversary. Mr. Giuliani -- who must still grant final approval to the East Harlem Pathmark project and could be Mr. Lipsky's last hope in that fight -- has proposed zoning changes that would make it easier for big stores to locate in New York, and Mr. Lipsky has fought them every step of the way. Since the early 1980's, when he got started, Mr. Lipsky has been involved in about eight supermarket fights, he says, winning over half -- a tally difficult to guess listening to his riled but respectful opponents.
His detractors accuse him of exaggerating the effect of big markets on small ones and, by insisting that Hispanic merchants would be harmed in a project led by blacks, of injecting race into the struggle. "He framed it, he invented it," said one city official, who insisted on anonymity. "Lipsky's signal contribution to the East Harlem Pathmark fight was to make it a racial issue."
The critics offer no solid proof for the charge, and Mr. Lipsky and his supporters deny it vigorously. For his part, Mr. Lipsky, who holds a doctorate in political science from the City University of New York, said the charges stem from being vocally "concerned that you have a successful minority business class, and people didn't give a damn about that." But he insists he is not a blind obstructionist.
"We don't want to be in opposition to everything that comes down the pike," he said. "We want a seat at the table."
With pained smiles, the lobbyist's foes acknowledge with grudging respect that, at the very least, he has succeeded in gaining one. Not surprisingly, the critics accuse him of cynicism; they say he is hindering efforts to ease the burdens of poor New Yorkers forced to pay more in cramped stores for lower-quality groceries. Mr. Lipsky will come back with emotionally compelling counterarguments about the need to nurture immigrant entrepreneurs and preserve neighborhood stores. Whatever the case, Mr. Lipsky manages to promote enough concern among the small supermarket owners that any big merchant wanting to do business in the city needs to take care.
Some of his technique was on display at the City Club in April, when Mr. Lipsky faced off against Mr. Rose and Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter. Like a hunter bragging about the big game he has bagged, Mr. Lipsky began by citing one of his trophies: a proposed Pathmark on Zerega Avenue in the Bronx he shot down in the early 1980's.
To the officials' cool recitations of the economic benefits to be derived from big stores, Mr. Lipsky countered in a relentless monotone with fearful talk of crime, traffic and transiency. But some city officials say Mr. Lipsky is needlessly stirring up such fears. "When someone proposes to open a store, he goes and organizes the local merchants and sows panic among them," one official said.
Mr. Lipsky acknowledges that most of the time he contacts merchants when a proposed store looms, rather than the other way around. "These projects are not advertised," he said. "If you're going to stop them, you need lead time."
Then comes the work of getting the merchants organized, cheering them up and informing them. He meets with his "guys," as he calls them, once a month, "when I get paid." Good organization is essential. "If I'm going to be successful, I have to get my own guys in cohesion and then look for allies in the community."
Alfredo Rodriguez, a Harlem small supermarket owner who is president of the Neighborhood Small Business Association, said Mr. Lipsky "analyzed every single store" in the area before the East Harlem Pathmark vote. But as the fight heated up, Mr. Lipsky met with his clients less and less, Mr. Rodriguez said, because the lobbyist's race became a liability. "Why are you letting this white man represent you?" Mr. Rodriguez said Pathmark supporters would ask.
Mr. Lipsky's defeat in that battle rankles him, but it hasn't shaken Mr. Rodriguez's faith. "He believes in our survival," Mr. Rodriguez said.
 
STORE WARS
A Lobbyist's Ups and Downs
 
 Richard Lipsky, the bodega owners' ally, chronicles these victories and defeats in the fight against large supermarkets:
 Early 1980's Long-planned Pathmark on Zerega Ave. in Unionport, the Bronx, is not built.
 1983 Waldbaum's withdraws plan for Bronxdale store.
 1984 Waldbaum's withdraws plan for Queens Village store.
 1994 Pathmark withdraws plans for Astoria, Queens, store.
 1988-93 Plans for Big R Warehouse market at 170th Street and Third Avenue in Morrisania, the Bronx, are delayed, but market is eventually built.
 1987-88 Pathmark Shopping Center is built in Woodhaven, Queens.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
In the Age of Megalopolis

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
THE ARCHITECT Robert A. M. Stern has written a chronicle of New York City's changing face that fills three hefty volumes, weighs more than 15 pounds and has five times as many pages as the Manhattan phone book. And he hasn't even finished with the 20th century, much less started the 19th.
"New York is not tidy and neat," says Mr. Stern, who just turned 56 and lives on the Upper East Side. 
 Nor static. The first three volumes of what he now envisions as a five-volume project graphically capture the controlled chaos that passes for planning in New York. By analyzing architecture, the art of public space and the people who use it, the books also chart what may be an inevitable, if disturbing, metamorphosis of New York's from its gilded age as the nation's dominant city to its new status as merely one component -- if, surely, the primary one -- of a still-emerging megalopolis that goes well beyond the tri-state region.
"It's the dominant place," Mr. Stern says. "It still sets the agenda, but its actual economic clout? That's the question. To answer whether it's waning, wait for my next book."
The genesis of the project was an essay Mr. Stern wrote in 1980 for the centennial of Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, where he is a professor.
"I thought, well, there's a book here," he recalled. "There had been a number of books of modest size but considerable interest to me on London in 1900. I started to write more and it just came out. But it's not as if this developed according to a divine plan. My buildings are organized in a premeditated way. My life is not."
He wrote "New York 1900: Metropolitan Architecture and Urbanism 1890-1915" with Gregory Gilmartin and John Massengale. "New York 1930: Architecture and Urbanism Between the World Wars," was written with Mr. Gilmartin and Thomas Mellins. (Both were published by Rizzoli.) The latest volume, "New York 1960: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Second World War and the Bicentennial," was written with Mr. Mellins and David Fishman and was published earlier this year by Monacelli Press.
Why 1960? That year, Mr. Stern says, signaled a turning point in the city's architectural evolution, a shift from waning Classicism hastened by a new zoning ordinance that, he wrote, "virtually legislated Modernist urbanism" with its bonuses for setbacks and plazas.
Then in 1961, Mr. Stern recalls, Jane Jacobs published her "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," a celebration of the "ballet of the street" and a manifesto against "the pseudoscience of planning" -- the impact of which will be reflected more in a future book, "New York 2000."
Indeed, Mr. Stern says, one consequence of that doctrine is the difficulty in getting anything big built, and today, "New York needs a large project."In rebuilding the West Side highway, he says, "all solutions are being trashed in the Balkanization of communities." Mr. Stern says that Ms. Jacobs and Robert Moses were both power brokers. And their struggle endures, a struggle that the authors describe as between "New York as the grandest metropolis in the world on the one hand and as the world's biggest village on the other."
In the politics of the 1960's, he says, community participation in planning "was seen as a way to break the stranglehold of a moribund city government."
"But the consequences have not been completely sanguine. In terms of architecture and urbanism, we've gone so far that it's difficult to imagine building a large-scale project. Look at Westway -- every community along the way feels that that portion of the waterfront belongs to it, instead of to all of us."
Mr. Stern's studies are more than coffee table books to be strategically placed as intellectual props or as an elevated perch for canapes. For one thing, they are sturdy enough to be a coffee table. The latest has 1,213 pages of text and pictures, 134 pages of scholarly notes and a 26-page index.
The book offers a composite history of New York's streetscape, not just in midtown and lower Manhattan, but encompassing a range of architecture, from urban renewal in Harlem to airport terminals in Queens.
"Amazingly enough, I thought there aren't that many interesting buildings," Mr. Stern said, in reflecting on the research for "New York 1960." But in surveying the city he and his collaborators found plenty of examples of notable architecture since 1945 -- some of them, unhappily, structures that replaced the very buildings that had been featured in his earlier two books.
They devoted an entire chapter in "New York 1960," to preservation, as a warning.
"We've lost an awful lot even with preservation," he says, referring to the city's landmarks law. (He would confer official landmark status on the stretch of Park Avenue that is graced by, among other buildings, Gordon Bunshaft's Lever House and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building and might even include the over-sized old Pan Am (now Met Life)Building "as a kind of wagging finger at New York: 'Let not greed take over.' ")
Mr. Stern largely made his mark as a post-Modernist residential architect and has never designed a major project in Manhattan, although his firm has a number of commercial buildings in design.
"I don't have a favorite building," he says diplomatically. His least favorites, though, are the Modernist office towers, which his book dismisses as bland and banal.
Meanwhile, Mr. Stern is engaged in assessing the 19th century and the city's development after the Civil War for "New York 1876" before going back to the future to finish "New York 2000." He usually works on the books up to five hours each weekend day, drawing on his knowledge and research by his collaborators to write a first draft, then polishing it with his co-authors.
"The nice thing about writing history," Mr. Stern says, "is you don't have to solve the problems."
 
 
 
MID-CENRURY SNAPSHOTS: Bits and Pieces From 'New York 1960'
In the 50's and 60's the city's office buildings, restaurants and neighborhoods change swiftly. Here are some examples:
 
* An office building boom is fueled in part by the need for more sophisticatedoffice space, a result of the new dependence on complex and changing electronic technology.
 
* Lever House, 53d St. and Park Ave. (1952) announces a transformation of American corporate architecture, which becomes a play of light and shadow on glass.
 
* CBS Building (1965) sets the shape and standard for building in the city with its reinforced concrete tower sheathed in black granite rising without setbacks from a plaza.
 
* By the 1950's, with the notable exception of Chock Full o' Nuts, most fast-food restaurants had beguin taking on a warmer look, using naturally finished wood and replacing bar stools with chairs.
 
* In the 50's and early 1960's, a new Upper West Side emerges -- less desirable to the upwardly mobile middle class but a viable location for the Puerto Ricans pouring into the city.

HEADLINE: The New Gulf War: Man Your Computers

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
TWO feet of rain had fallen around New Orleans at the height of last month's fierce Gulf storm, shutting down regular air service into the city, and still the oil executives kept coming. One group hired a private jet and then a helicopter. Others had to abandon their car to wade through water up to their necks, holding their briefcases high to keep them dry.
The Government was selling oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico and a little derring-do to get to the auction site was a small price to pay for a piece of the action. When the bidding was over at the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service office in the flooded suburb of Metairie, the executives had forked over $307 million for drilling rights -- nearly triple what the Government had expected. 
 The Great Oil Rush of the mid-1990's is on, and in a most unexpected setting.
As recently as three years ago, many oil executives described the Gulf of Mexico as a dead sea, a played-out place where production could only fall and drilling for new reserves would be futile. Now there is a growing conviction that the gulf holds reserves even larger than those in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the last huge domestic discovery. And no one wants to be left behind.
"There's a lot of money to be made out there," said John H. Miers, vice president of the Amoco Worldwide Exploration Business Group.
The intense bidding last month by Amoco and other industry giants like Shell, Mobil and British Petroleum shows just how much money is at stake -- and how alive the gulf has suddenly become.
Starting to dot the horizon are billion-dollar rigs that can bring oil up in waters that are thousands of feet deep. Shell is the acknowledged leader on that front. Meanwhile, exploration ships like the New Venture ply the shallower waters, searching for overlooked pockets of oil and gas in older fields and new treasures long hidden under thick layers of salt that cover some parts of the gulf's bottom. A joint venture involving Amoco, Phillips Petroleum and Anadarko Petroleum has scored big in that area.
Behind the rebirth are broad technological advances in rig construction and prospecting techniques. One day recently, for example, the New Venture was trolling for oil 50 miles off the coast of Galveston, Tex., by using a pair of on-board supercomputers to turn seismic readings into three-dimensional models of deposits buried 15,000 feet beneath the gulf's floor.
Also pushing the turnaround has been the industry's slow progress in developing the huge reserves of the politically unstable former Soviet Union -- where today's oil rush was supposed to have taken place.
Having taken another look at prospects closer to home, industry executives are now smiling. Below all the layers of salt on the gulf's continental shelf and the inky mile-deep waters further out lie fields far exceeding the 12 billion barrels at Prudhoe Bay, according to some projections. The gulf's deep-water reserves alone have been estimated as high as 15 billion barrels. Billions of barrels more are thought to be in the shallower waters.
"It will be the biggest thing since Prudhoe Bay -- there is no question about it," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
Oil production in the gulf will increase from about 900,000 barrels a day this year, or 17 percent of total domestic output, to about 1.6 million barrels a day by 2000, or about 28 percent of the country's output, according to Mr. Lichtblau's projections.
With the United States dependent on foreign sources for about half of its oil, a surge in gulf output would give the country some help against any moves by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production and raise oil prices, now hovering at around $19 a barrel.
It should also give the oil companies more time in which to nail down the kind of contractual and legal protections that they would need before investing heavily in Russia and other former Soviet republics, where proven reserves already total about 57 billion barrels.
The industry will also profit from exporting the technological tricks that it is learning to play in the gulf. They may eventually be put to use in deep-water fields in the North Sea, parts of the Pacific and off the coast of West Africa, among other places.
Another likely beneficiary is the gulf's regional economy, long heavily dependent on the energy industry, which suffered in the 1980's as domestic oil production tumbled in the face of low prices and dwindling production. The industry's domestic work force has been sliced in half -- to about 450,000, from 920,000 in 1982 -- while hundreds of small companies in the region have gone under or been forced to merge.
Now, things are going the other way, with struggling companies starting to revive and new ones sprouting up, like Petroleum Geo-Services, which operates the New Venture and 12 other high-tech ships like it.
The company was founded in 1991 by eight partners who worked out of an office in Houston that they borrowed from another company at night. P.G.S. now has a workforce of 1,100, mostly deployed in the gulf but also in the North Sea. Its revenues have surged, reaching $258 million last year. Its stock price has also soared, from $11.75 when the company went public in 1993 to the high 20's. On the Nasdaq exchange, it closed Friday at $29.375, up 25 cents.
Still, the Gulf of Mexico will never be America's answer to the Persian Gulf, around which are countries with about 663 billion barrels. The United States' dependence on imported oil is expected to continue to grow, even with the Gulf of Mexico producing more, just not as quickly. Rosy projections about the size of reserves here could fade. And further technological refinements will be needed to add to the reach of the current generation of deep-water rigs.
But none of that is taking away any of the gulf's glow in industry eyes.
"You don't have to worry that the U.S. Government will expropriate your fields or that war is going to break out," said James Stone, the oil industry analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company.
Reidar Michaelsen, chairman of Petroleum Geo-Services, added, "The companies went to Russia and little has happened. Now they're coming back to the gulf because this is the cheapest oil they can produce. It's in their backyard and they have most of the infrastructure in place."
The shallow waters of the gulf are dotted with scores of production platforms and crisscrossed with hundreds of miles of pipelines. Except for exploration and drilling costs, companies generally have to make little added investment to get more production out of equipment that has long been paid for.
"You have the platforms, you have the pipelines," said Amoco's Mr. Miers. "If you can find some oil, it's very cheap to produce it."
So, who is finding it, or is likely to?
In deep-water drilling, to some extent everybody is playing catch-up to Shell. The company operates the current deep-water record holder, the Auger platform, which is tethered to the gulf floor in water half a mile deep. The $1.2 billion rig went into production more than a year ago, and several of its wells are true gushers, yielding oil in record daily volumes for the gulf. Shell is set to launch another deep-water rig next year and is joining Exxon and Amoco to build a third, at a cost of nearly $1 billion.
Some companies are behind in building the deep-water platforms, which are floating hulls tethered by steel tendons to barn-size anchors.
Still others, like Mobil, are even further behind because their exploration sites are few in number or from the second tier, shortcomings that came about in part because until recently they did not seem to matter. But Mobil, for one, has been moving to catch up, bidding aggressively to win leases on some choice blocks at last month's Government sale.
"We didn't have as good a position in the deep water as we would have liked," said Robert White, president of Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. Inc.
Mobil has also teamed up with Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd., a smaller independent oil company that has been active in the gulf's deep water, buying a 40 percent interest in one of its prospects. The two companies will sink six exploration wells this year in fields 2,800 feet below the surface.
In shallower waters, Amoco, Phillips and Anadarko are the stars because they scored the first commercial success in finding oil under layers of salt. Such finds, called sub salt deposits, had been impenetrable to seismic surveys until ways were found to harness computers to decipher the soundings.
In fact, whether searching in older fields or in new sub salt areas, high-tech gear and knowledge are essential.
"The industry is now being driven by technology," said David Simon, the group chief executive of British Petroleum.
The new approach is a far cry from the industry's colorful past, when wildcatters would jump for joy when they hit a gusher in the field. Now the excitement often comes in offices full of computer screens and printouts where the silence is broken only by the sound of hands tapping keyboards.
Similarly, the current surge is being led by executives who are spending less time in the field and more time with laptops analyzing data.
Bennett Z. Spevack, Amoco's exploration manager for Europe and the United States, has spent the past five years with a 15-member team analyzing parts of a sub salt section of the gulf that covers about 9,000 square miles. Much of the section is 80 to 100 miles off the coast of Texas and Louisiana, where the water is only about 150 to 400 feet deep.
For years these areas remained a mystery because the sound waves sent by exploration equipment were severely distorted by the salt layers, preventing geologists from getting a clear picture of what was below.
Then along came the new technology. Now, extensive seismic surveys take individual "pictures" of small slices of terrain. These are then run through supercomputers, which use programs supplied by geologists to adjust the images to compensate for the distortion of the sound waves. Ultimately, the geologists create a three-dimensional model of the survey area that they interpret based on past experience.
"Basically, it has given us a much clearer picture of what's down there," said Mr. Spevack, looking at a survey image on a computer screen at Amoco's headquarters in Houston.
Nevertheless, he cautioned, the models are partly based on inferences made by his staff and are far from foolproof.
In spite of the uncertainty, there has already been a payoff, in the Mahogany section of the exploration area. In that section, about 80 miles off the Louisiana coast, intense surveying led a team from Amoco, Anadarko and Phillips to drill in the fall of 1993, finding a field 15,000 feet beneath the gulf floor that could have reserves of 100 million barrels or more.
A second well, sunk last fall to a depth of 19,100 feet, also hit oil and gas deposits that are being brought to the surface in commercial amounts. The three companies, as well as others in the industry, are becoming convinced that the $200 million being spent on the project can be recovered and a hefty profit can be made.
The approach being used to explore at Mahogany is far different from what was typically employed in the past, when a well was simply drilled if some formations looked promising. Costs were not as high as today because the drilling didn't have to go as deep. That approach led to thousands of dry wells in the 1980's.
"We were dreamers," Mr. Spevack recalled. "Now we're more focused and constrained by the data." With sub salt wells costing from $13 million to $15 million each, a company can't afford to come up with too many dry ones.
"This is the most significant discovery in shallow water in the gulf in the last decade," said John W. Laird, an Amoco geologist who helped put together the Mahogany find. "The risk was very high and it worked."
There have been big payoffs as well for others who have been betting on the gulf, especially those who jumped in when the odds were long.
That is the case for the partners at Petroleum Geo-Services, who have been successful in using the new technology to greatly drive down the cost of surveying.
One of them, Bjarte Bruheim, gave up a high-paying position as vice president of marine operations at Schlumberger Ltd. to join the new venture. As president and chief operating officer of P.G.S., Mr. Bruheim, who is Norwegian, got stock options in the new company. He now owns about 250,000 shares, a stake that is worth more than $7 million.
The secret to the partners' success, he said, was that they did not listen to the common wisdom that the gulf was dying. "No banks would lend us money, no one would listen to us in Houston," he recalled. "But you can still make it if you stick together and stick to your idea."

Orange County Gets A Message

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
What would you do if someone owed you a lot of money and showed no intention of paying it back? Would you lend more money?
That's what municipal bond investors did last week, as they lent $295 million to bankrupt Orange County, Calif., which shows every intention of stiffing its previous lenders. Orange County, as you no doubt recall, went broke by speculating on interest rates and is in bankruptcy court trying to weasel out of its obligations. 
 Looked at in isolation, the buyers last week got a pretty good deal. Orange County's latest bond issue was insured by MBIA, the nation's largest municipal bond insurer, and locks up some revenue streams that might otherwise have gone to pay the creditors that the county wants to avoid paying. The county paid a premium of about one-quarter percentage point over normal rates.
But the lending also sent a message to the county, that money will be available to it in the future no matter what it does about its past debts. Next week the county's voters are expected to turn down a proposal to raise sales taxes by one-half of a percent. Without that, default looms.
That message should surprise no one. To be sure, the bond industry has been talking tough, threatening not to lend any more money to Orange County, and maybe not to anyone in California, unless the state and the county live up to their responsibilities. But this market's history is one of a total inability to act tough when confronted with the most outrageous conduct. Never forget the Washington Public Power Supply System, a group of local utilities that was able to borrow again only shortly after walking away from its obligations and getting the State Supreme Court to approve the repudiation.
Still, it is breathtaking to see MBIA, a company that has the most to lose from a widespread repudiation of obligations by municipalities, stepping up to guarantee the bonds of a deadbeat that is certainly wealthy enough to pay but whose elected leaders see no reason why it should do so.
The money from this bond issue will go to pay off the local agencies, like school districts, whose money was gambled away by the county. Neil Budnick, the MBIA man on the deal, explains that without the bond issue, a lot of school districts would have defaulted, bringing "chaos that is in no one's interest." Mr. Budnick adds that MBIA got four times its usual fee for insuring the Orange County deal, and says other bond insurers were bidding for the business. Of course, Orange County has done wonders for MBIA's stock price, which has soared on the theory that more bond buyers will want insured bonds.
Joe Mysak, the editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, thinks this could lead to a historic reversal in which revenue bonds, those backed by a project like a toll bridge, yield less than comparably rated general obligation bonds. After all, those bonds have something that may be seized by angry creditors.
California tax-free muni bond mutual funds have seen some money flow out this year. But a lot is left, and it will be invested. Some funds may, for a time, refuse to buy new Orange County paper, which will have to carry a small extra yield, but then they will lag in the yield sweepstakes to those that do, and the money will go to the buyers. If Orange County finds a way to stiff holders, it will not be punished by the markets.
When it comes to forgiving, only an indulgent mother can match the muni bond market.

HEADLINE: Moving On Up;
The Greening of America's Black Middle Class

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
WHETHER or not judges and legislators limit affirmative action, its promise is being fulfilled for many blacks who have made striking gains in income and employment in the 30 years since the Government began guaranteeing equal rights to jobs and education.
 Just how much those gains can be attributed to affirmative action preferences and other Government remedies is arguable. But over those three decades, a tiny middle class typified by doctors, teachers and small entrepreneurs working often within the boundaries of the black community evolved into a larger, more diverse group that has been charted by economists, courted by politicians and validated by prime-time sitcoms on television, which belatedly discovered a vast consumer market. It also appears that the boats of the middle class rose on the high tide of the 1980's. 
 Gains have occurred in higher education, careers and income. The number of black lawyers, doctors and engineers has risen sharply; the earnings of a growing contingent of government workers, pharmacists, mathematicians, designers, engineers and others approaches or even surpasses that of comparable whites, and this group now accounts for a higher proportion of blacks in their chosen professions than their proportion in the general population.
 For young, college-educated two-earner married couples, income differentials between blacks and whites are negligible. According to an analysis of the 1990 Census for The New York Times, almost as many black workers between the ages of 25 and 44 are college graduates as are high school dropouts. Just 20 years ago, there were five times as many black high school dropouts as college graduates in the work force.
 "It's the result of breaking down barriers in education and jobs, and affirmative action could have helped overcome some of them, especially for education," said Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College who conducted the census analysis for The Times.
 Last week, the Supreme Court cast doubt on the constitutionality of Federal programs that award benefits on the basis of race. The Colorado case, Adarand Constructors v. Pena, involved a requirement that 10 percent of Federal money spent on highway projects go to businesses owned by "disadvantaged individuals." The case was returned to Federal District Court where a formidable new standard set by the Supreme Court will now be applied: whether "narrowly tailored" programs accomplish a "compelling governmental interest."
 If the judicial decision seems abstract, the gains by many blacks since the Government began aggressively enforcing civil rights laws and imposing remedies for past discrimination have been concrete.
 During the same period, however, the proportion of poorest blacks has also grown and the income of many whites, adjusted for inflation, has stalled or shrunk. And blacks, overall, still lag far behind whites in income -- earning about $63 for every $100 a white household earns -- and they lag even farther behind in accumulated wealth. Even among the younger, better-educated group, in which experience ought to be less of a variable, they work longer hours but still make less money than whites do.
 Segregated housing and other barriers to mobility persist, ranging from glass ceilings that keep blacks from top executive positions to recurring insults and assumptions based on stereotypes.
 Membership in the middle class may be as much a state of mind as of economic realities. Economists say a middle-class household can earn anywhere from $20,000 and $60,000 a year, depending on how many mouths there are to feed, local living costs and savings.
 Just a generation ago, only 1 in 17 black families even made the contemporary equivalent of $50,000 or more. By 1989, 1 in 7 did (compared to 1 in 3 white families). From 1967 to 1989, that category expanded from 266,000 black families to more than a million (doubling in the 1980's). In that group, 1 person in 3 was a college graduate, 2 in 3 were between the ages of 35 and 55 and nearly 8 in 10 were married.
 In Queens, New York City's storied middle-class borough, the income of black households actually surpassed that of whites during the 1980's. The growth came from two- and three-earner families (headed by couples) working longer hours than their white counterparts. Only 1 in 50 blacks makes more than $50,000 a year without the help of another family member.
 Queens is one of about a dozen racially integrated places with a population of 50,000 or more where the income of black households nearly equals or surpasses that of whites. Common threads bind their black populations: a majority are married, between one-third and two-thirds have completed college and women make up about half the labor force.
 The Times's census analysis found that among blacks between the ages of 25 and 44, 1 in 10 classified themselves as professionals in 1970 compared to nearly 1 in 6 by 1990. That represented an increase from about 400,000 to nearly 1.3 million. Among all young professionals, 1 in 20 was black in 1970; by 1990, 1 in 12 was.
 Would the gains among blacks have been as great if the Government had not overturned Jim Crow laws and barred discriminatory practices, beginning with the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling that segregated schools were inherently unequal, and continuing with the civil rights revolution of the 1960's? Undoubtedly not. Subsequent affirmative action and other preferential programs probably helped blacks as well. Yet those programs left legions of blacks behind and also benefited many blacks who were already upwardly mobile.
 The surge in the number of better-off blacks can also be attributed to the boom in the mid-1980's. But a report for the Population Reference Bureau, a nonpartisan research group, suggests that the market, and those who manage it, needed prodding. "Black children of the civil rights era were the first generation to benefit fully from the expansion in education and equal opportunity law," the report concludes. "Young blacks who were in school in the 1960's reached their 30's and 40's in the 1980's, the ages at which increased educational attainment begins to pay off financially."
 So far, the renewed debate over programs intended to remedy racism's ills and guarantee equal opportunity revolve mostly around who may get hurt, not helped. But ultimately, Government policy often is shaped when conscience is coupled with self-interest. For all Americans, the payoff from a growing black middle class is only beginning.

Why the Richest Nations Want to Insure the Rest

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
IF Citibank's depositors panicked and tried to withdraw all the money from their checking accounts, the Federal Reserve would be ready within hours to lend billions to cover the bank's obligations. And in the wake of the collapse of Mexico's currency, the case for creating an analogous lender of last resort to cash-poor governments has been thrust to the top of the global economic agenda.
 That explains the broad support at the economic summit this weekend for creating an emergency loan window, to be managed by the International Monetary Fund. And while the plan may raise eyebrows in a Congress skeptical of multilateral entanglements, the idea of asking other countries to bear more of the risk might be more appealing than America's bearing the risk alone. 
 Indeed, the plan to use the I.M.F. to enhance liquidity in currency crises may be the signal achievement of the summit, which is dogged by doubts that the economic powers can take any collective action. "What you're protecting is not one country but a global system that depends on the ability to move private capital rapidly," argues Georges de Menil, the editor of the Paris-based journal Economic Policy.
 A bank is a go-between that borrows in order to lend. As long as its loans and other assets exceed its liabilities to depositors, the bank is solvent. But since most deposits can be withdrawn overnight while assets typically take weeks or months to liquidate, even rock-solid banks can be caught short. Or they could were it not for the Federal Reserve, which was created in 1913 to prevent the panics that had periodically run through the banking system in the 19th century the way chicken pox runs through kindergartens.
 A lender of last resort to governments -- at least one with rules comparable to the Fed's -- could not have prevented international debt gridlock in the 1980's. Third world governments borrowed abroad heavily in the 1970's. And since they generally invested the money badly, they did not have earnings from exports to meet their loan payments. But the recent debacle in Mexico is a very different story.
 Like the debtors of the 1980's, Mexico lacked the dollars to meet its immediate obligations. But unlike the debtors of the 1980's, Mexico faced a liquidity crisis, not insolvency: the country's anticipated earnings from exports were more than sufficient to service its foreign debts. Thus by lending $50 billion with Mexico's revenues from oil exports as collateral, Washington was able to halt the panic -- and thereby prevent the panic from spreading.
 What the Clinton Administration engineered for Mexico probably could not be replicated tomorrow for, say, Brazil or Argentina. Congress never approved the Mexican bailout and would probably stop another end run around its authority. Nor, for that matter, could the White House count on being able to slip past penny-wise European governments to tap the coffers of the I.M.F. That's why the Clinton Administration leaped at the suggestion of a rescue authority within the I.M.F., where it would be partly shielded from parochial politics.
 As sketched before the meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the new fund would draw on a multi-billion-dollar line of credit from the Group of Ten -- the major industrial countries, plus Saudi Arabia -- and would streamline decision making to a matter of days. To placate Europeans worried that the insurance would make governments more careless, the rules will probably remain unwritten. "It won't guarantee access to anyone," promises a senior Clinton Administration official.

 
 
Tough Sell in Congress
 Transforming the sketch into a working lender of last resort will not be simple. For one thing, the plan must be sold to a Congress already afraid of foreign aid "handouts" and angry about bailing out Wall Street in the Mexican crisis. The White House contends that the new approach, as opposed to crisis management dependent on American leadership, will spread the financial risk among the industrial powers. And it says the I.M.F. can shield lenders from blame for demanding belt-tightening from borrowers.
 Even if the plan passes political muster, it remains to be seen whether the organization that failed to predict the collapse of the Mexican peso will be up to the task of acting with both speed and good judgment.
 Robert Lawrence, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, doubts that the I.M.F. could distinguish liquidity problems from insolvency and decide "when you should finance debt repayment and when you should force adjustment" through default. Peter Kenen, an economist at Princeton, worries that planning would inevitably fit the last crisis better than the next. "It's always the unexpected that happens," he says.
A more fundamental criticism comes from Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Institute for International Development at Harvard. He sees making the I.M.F. a lender of last resort for solvent governments as a distant second-best to making it a judge in a bankruptcy proceeding. He would give the I.M.F. the power to shield financially embarrassed governments from creditors, allowing them to raise money on private capital markets by guaranteeing priority repayment and then satisfy the debts from export earnings.

 
 
Supervised Pain
 Where a government was in fact insolvent, the I.M.F. would be in a position to force the pace of the "workout" -- and thus the pain to citizens of the economy in crisis. The bankruptcy approach would also eliminate the need for an emergency fund for liquidity. "It's a way to do the same thing with taxpayers' money," Mr. Sachs points out.
 But the bankruptcy approach did not win support in Washington or Europe, in part because it would involve a big change in the I.M.F.'s role. And no one, including Mr. Sachs, wishes to make what might be the best the enemy of the good.
 The plan on the table at Halifax, it is widely agreed, at least marginally reduces the risk of panic breeding panic in the brave new world of wide-open money markets. "In the stampede to the doors," Mr. Sachs reminds, "everyone gets hurt."

HEADLINE: The World;
The Face Of Cold, Hard Cash

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
IN an age when radio stations chronicle the moment-by-moment rise and fall of the yen, the dollar, the mark and the peso -- and when huge sums change hands without ever being touched, thanks to computers -- it is not hard to forget about cold, hard cash. No matter what happens in the currency markets, a $1 bill has one thing in common with a 100-franc note or a million-mark bill that was worth exactly one penny when it was issued 70 years ago: it is only a piece of paper.
 What paper, though. In this country, a $1 bill is 25 percent linen and 75 percent cotton, with red and blue synthetic threads woven in to thwart counterfeiters. The Bureau of Printing and Engraving says a bill can be folded and unfolded 4,000 times without tearing. 
 Unlike faceless computer transfers, cash has a human face -- mostly male, except for monarchs like Queen Elizabeth, and of course there are the geese on Canada's $20 bill and the cranes on Japan's 1,000-yen note. Most of the faces are unsmiling. Eugene Delacroix glowers from France's 100-franc note with as much intensity as Andrew Jackson on the American $20 bill.
 Overlooked in the fretting over currency values is the value of bills themselves as national symbols. The post-Soviet era has produced many more of these (as did the post-colonial period before it). Lately, however, the issue is to what extent currency should transcend national borders -- a topic broached this weekend as leaders of the seven big industrial democracies met in Halifax, Nova Scotia. If European countries switch to a single currency by the end of the century, for example, there may be new opportunities for glum-looking portraiture.
 In 1993 the actress Sylvia Bourdon organized a graphic competition for the planned European currency unit, or ecu. Ten possible designs were printed in the French television magazine Tele 7 Jours and the economic weekly Le Revenu Francais. Others suggested that one side of the new bill should continue to indicate the value in the former national currency in the country where it is used. "But could you really have a 6.297 ecu note that is also a fiver?" Andrew Marshall asked recently in The Independent.
 Maybe not. Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, has predicted, "We will still be able to pay in Deutschmarks in the year 2000."
 If so, some credit is due the Babylonians. They developed a forerunner of paper money -- clay tablets, which may be what gave rise to the cliche "hard on the pocketbook." The French produced the first large-scale issue of paper money in the 18th century, though the Chinese supposedly had foldable bills long before that. As history drove the evolution of currency, currency returned the favor by chronicling history. "Virtually every major event in history can be found represented in currency," says Allen G. Berman, co-author of the collector's guide "Warman's Coins and Currency" (who provided some of the examples at left).
 In the United States, the various denominations of bills are about a third smaller than than they were before 1929, when, by coincidence, investors' portfolios were also downsized in the Great Crash.
 Money does not last long: the Bureau of Engraving and Printing says a $1 bill lasts 18 months, a $100 bill 9 years. Americans who like to carry very big bills never got their hands on the biggest of all, a $100,000 bill. The last time any were printed was in January 1935; they never went into general circulation.
 The industrial democracies were not alone in contemplating cash last week. The Memphis International Paper Money Show drew 1,200 collectors to a convention center, where some spent new money to buy old. Kevin Foley, the secretary-treasurer of the Professional Currency Dealers Association, is the first to admit that he lives in an increasingly cashless society.
 "It's hard to pay cash for a hotel room," said Mr. Foley. "I'm paying with a credit card."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Unlike the United States, many countries celebrate cultural icons on currency. Japan's 1,000-yen note (about $11.80) depicts its most famous novelist, Soseki Natsume; The 100-franc note (about $20) celebrates both France's culture and political spirit, depicting the painter Eugene Delacroix and his 1830 painting "Liberty Leading the People;" Just about every major historical event and era is evoked in currency. This 1937 note for three chervonets (a currency preceding the modern Soviet ruble) bears Lenin's likeness and was issued during Stalin's terror; Iran's currency (shown is a 2,000-rial note, about 66 cents) reflects the revolutionary fervor encouraged by its Islamic regime, including a willingness to become a martyr in conflicts like the war with Iraq; Latin American bills often change to cope with problems like inflation. Mexico introduced notes for "new pesos" in 1993, with three fewer zeroes than the old notes. The 20-peso bill (about $3.50) shows the revolutionary hero Benito Juarez; This Chinese 1962 one-jiao note (worth little more than a penny) shows happy worker solidarity in the style of socialist realism; After breaking from Yugoslavia in 1991, Croatia issued its own dinar notes (this shows Rudjer Boskovic, an 18th-century scientist), but last year scrapped these and changed to the kuna. This disassociated the currency from Yugoslavia's, but also recalled Croatia's wartime Nazi puppet regime, the last to call its money kunas.

HEADLINE: Seeking Embrace, Yeltsin Is Rebuffed at Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, June 17

 BODY:
The leaders of the seven major industrial nations issued a double-pronged warning today to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, telling him that the "situation in Chechnya should not be resolved by military means" and indirectly condemning his Government's planned sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.
In remarks to reporters before he and President Clinton met for private talks, an obviously agitated Mr. Yeltsin pronounced Chechnya "the center of world terrorism, of bribery and corruption and mafia." 
 Raising his hands in the air, Mr. Yeltsin said Gen. Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, the rebel leader who had led the secessionist fight in Chechnya, had applied for political asylum in Turkey. But Michael D. McCurry, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, said the United States had "no evidence" to support Mr. Yeltsin's assertion, which seemed to imply that the rebel leader was abandoning his fight.
[A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman in Ankara, Omer Akbel, denied that any asylum request had been made, The Associated Press said.]
Mr. Yeltsin's statement also seemed to have little impact on the continuing standoff in Budyonnovsk, Russia, where 200 Chechen raiders seized hundreds of hostages at a hospital this week.
The outburst about Chechnya came in response to a Russian television reporter who asked Mr. Clinton whether he was changing his mind about the Chechens because of the seizure and execution of some hostages at the hospital in southern Russia. Before President Clinton could answer, Mr. Yeltsin broke in to say that he himself was a hostage to the crisis, and that "my friend Bill" supported Russian action to suppress the Chechen rebellion.
"General Dudayev has asked Turkey to provide him with political protection, and Turkey has agreed," Mr. Yeltsin said. "We don't care where he goes, as long as it is far, far away from Russia."
At times Mr. Yeltsin's speech sounded slurred, but a senior Administration official said Mr. Yeltsin was simply "in his emphatic mode, you might say," in front of the cameras.
Mr. Clinton, who sat impassively during Mr. Yeltsin's outburst, took pains to say he differed with Mr. Yeltsin's characterization of his position on the Chechnya conflict, and said all acts of terrorism had to be denounced.
Later, away from the cameras in an hourlong talk with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton said that if General Dudayev did leave the country "he hoped that that this would be an opportunity for ending the military phase of the operations in Chechnya," a senior American official said.
The Group of Seven warning to Russia came at the end of a three-day meeting that was supposed to be devoted chiefly to reforming the world's major economic institutions, in hopes of preventing the kind of financial crisis that struck Mexico late last year. But those issues were quickly overshadowed by wrangling over how to pay for a rapid-reaction force in Bosnia and by Russia's behavior.
The sharpest comments were included in the statement issued by the seven nations, and in a final pronouncement by the meeting's host, the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chretien. But a separate statement, issued in the name of all eight countries, reflected Mr. Yeltsin's presence -- and his point of view.
In the separate statement, criticism about Russian shipments of nuclear material to Iran was far more muted, and there was no mention of Chechnya. Mr. Clinton raised anew with the Mr. Yeltsin his objections to the shipment of the reactors to Iran, which the United States says will help Teheran in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, but Mr. Yeltsin repeated his view that the equipment is for civilian use.
Mr. Yeltsin scored a small victory when he persuaded the leaders here to attend a meeting next year in Russia on nuclear safety issues, presumably including Russia's own crumbling nuclear power installations. It is unclear whether that meeting would be among presidents and prime ministers, or lower-level officials.
The leaders also created a task force on transnational organized crime, declaring that it is "a growing threat to the security of our nations" and to financial markets and emerging democracies. The task force is charged with finding ways to bolster cooperation among the seven countries and with other nations and to report back with a plan at next year's meeting, in Lyons, France.
Despite the crisis in Russia, Mr. Yeltsin was so eager to take part here -- and to elevate his status to a full member of what would become a Group of Eight -- that the Canadian hosts had to give him explicit instructions not to show up until late Friday afternoon. Once he arrived, the leaders told him the group was ready to accept Russia's membership "as soon as it's practical, but no specific commitment was made along those lines," a senior Administration official said.
The Group of Seven was first intended to be a meeting of great economic powers. Although Russia's economy hardly qualifies, its political import -- and its moves to adjust to capitalist realities -- have been a dominant theme of six successive meetings.
As the leaders departed this small and somewhat remote maritime province this afternoon, the Administration's faint hopes of reaching a quick settlement with Japan next week over the automotive confrontation began to fade. A senior Japanese official from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry dismissed the chance that Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's suggestions of compromise, made on Thursday to President Clinton, would amount to much.
"There's not even a 1 percent chance of a deal," the official told reporters today.
Negotiations are to resume on Thursday in Geneva, and if they fail, a 100 percent tariff on 13 Japanese luxury car models goes into effect on June 28, a deadline Mr. Clinton said here that he would not extend.
This morning, the seven leaders and Mr. Yeltsin spent much of their time talking about Bosnia, but came up with no new proposals save for Mr. Yeltsin's offer that he was willing to use whatever influence he has left with the Serbs in Belgrade to end the conflict.
Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, insisted that all eight leaders fully supported the decision by Britain and France to send a rapid-reaction force to Bosnia to protect their peacekeeping troops and argued that it should be financed by all United Nations members, as other peacekeeping operations are.
He said that Mr. Clinton had "acknowledged the difficulties he has with the Republican leadership in Congress" in obtaining any additional funds for operations in Bosnia, but that the President "reiterated his view that the U.S. would take its share of the cost."
Striking a conciliatory tone that was missing from Friday's meetings, Mr. Major said all the leaders understood President Clinton's political troubles with Congress. "The President wishes to pay the assessed contribution," he said. "We look forward to the President's finding a way through."
The statement issued today by the seven nations and Russia acknowledged the leaders' disagreement with the Republican leadership over financing the rapid-reaction force by clearly stating that it is part of the peacekeeping force. The implication was that the force should be financed like other regular peacekeeping missions.
Mr. Major said Mr. Yeltsin had "brought no new ideas on settling the conflict there," adding that "neither Yeltsin nor anyone else has a simple solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina."
Perhaps Mr. Yeltsin's most welcome pronouncement was that Russia's economy, after years of shrinkage, had hit bottom and was starting to grow. He predicted that the economy is likely to record some modest growth this year, with its gross national product rising about 1 percent.
"The prevailing view was that there was real visible progress in Russia," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told reporters.
Mr. Rubin said that he was struck by concerns at the meeting that the United States was turning inward, and that other finance and foreign ministers here said they had detected similar trends in their countries. "It's a worry to us all," he said.

HEADLINE: 'Stalled' Cars Were to Destroy Tunnels, Tapes Indicate

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Deep in the highway tunnels beneath the Hudson, the rush of cars and trucks would slow. Bumper to bumper, lines would build, each behind a car with its hood raised in the universal sign of engine trouble. Three minutes after the drivers of the intentionally disabled vehicles slipped away in other cars, timers would detonate the powerful bombs they left behind.
"The water will be going everywhere -- everything will be broken into smithereens, everything," said one of three men who discussed the plan, Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, in a secretly recorded meeting in a Jersey City apartment two years ago. 
 "The World Trade Center, compared with this, will be like a dwarf," he exulted, recalling the February 1993 bombing that killed six people and injured more than 1,000.
Another of the men, Emad Salem, said, "It is going to be the biggest blow to the economy."
The third man, Amir Abdelgani, was worried. "Will three minutes be enough to get us out from the dangerous place?" he asked.
The conversation was presented in Federal District Court in Manhattan at the trial of Mr. Abdelgani and 10 other Islamic men charged with plotting to blow up tunnels and major buildings in New York to intimidate the United States into changing its policies in the Middle East.
The exchange was part of a string of surreptitiously taped talks whose presentation to the jury concluded last week. The prosecution could rest and the defense begin as early as this week.
Mr. Siddig Ali, in whose apartment prosecutors say the talk took place on June 19, 1993, is not on trial. He was at the defense table with the others when the trial began in January, but in February the Sudanese immigrant, whom the prosecution described as a sort of operations chief in the conspiracy, changed his plea from not guilty to guilty.
Mr. Salem, an immigrant from Egypt, is also not on trial. He turned out to be an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who had infiltrated the defendants' circle and recorded his many conversations with them. The recordings have formed some of the major evidence against the defendants, the most prominent of whom is Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the militant Muslim cleric from Egypt.
The prosecution argues that the defendants plotted to blow up the Holland and Lincoln tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, the United Nations and the Federal building in Manhattan in the months after other members of the purported conspiracy carried out the Feb. 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center. Four other men were convicted of that bombing in a previous trial.
The defense argues that the charges are trumped up and that the defendants are being persecuted because they are radical Muslims who oppose American policies they see as favoring Israel and an Egyptian government that Mr. Abdel Rahman has long sought to topple.
The defense also asserts that Mr. Salem, who is to be paid more than $1 million for his work on the case, had political and financial reasons to ensnare the defendants in a scheme for which they could be prosecuted.
In a transcript of the conversation on June 19, 1993, five days before the F.B.I. began arresting the defendants, ideas are discussed for carrying out the tunnel bombings with the bomb-laden cars.
"He will open the hood, and he turns off the car," Mr. Siddig Ali says of each car's driver, according to the English translation of the Arabic conversation read to the jury.
"The water comes fast," says Mr. Salem. "Run, guys, run."

HEADLINE: Creating Fathers Out of Men With Children

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Charles Ballard was talking to a roomful of teen-age boys at an inner-city high school in Cleveland years ago when he had a stunning revelation about their view of fatherhood.
"I asked, 'How many of you are dads?' and only three hands went up," he said. "That didn't sound right to me. So later on, I asked, 'How many of you guys have kids?' And almost every hand went up. These guys made a distinction. Fatherhood meant taking responsibility, providing security and affection, being there, which they'd never seen. Having a kid just meant they'd had sex with a girl, and she had a baby." 
 Mr. Ballard, now 59, understood that distinction: he himself had walked away from a baby he fathered as a teen-ager, but later returned to build a close relationship with his son. And since 1982, when he founded the Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Revitalization in Cleveland, he has made it his mission to help young men reconnect with their children and become real fathers.
Mr. Ballard's institute, now expanding to five other cities, is one of a mushrooming crop of programs nationwide that preach, and teach, the importance of fatherhood.
Across the country, foundations, social-service agencies, churches and policy makers are emphasizing the role fathers can play in improving their children's lives. In many cases, they are trying to coax young dads to play a role they never saw in their own childhoods.
"We are experiencing a new phenomenon, young men who are from second- or third-generation father-absent families, and have no model of fathering to follow," said Ralph R. Smith, director of planning and development at the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which supports family programs. "We are seeing more and more neighborhoods where father-absent families are the norm. There are 180 neighborhoods where at least 90 percent of the families are father-absent. Young men there, when they have babies, may not know what their role can be."
While fatherless families are concentrated in the poorest areas, the soaring divorce rates of recent decades -- and the many families in which fathers are emotionally or physically absent -- have produced a generation of young men, cutting across all social strata, for whom fatherhood is uncharted territory.
"In 1965, Lyndon Johnson said the disintegration of black families was such a crisis that we needed a new national policy, a war on poverty," said David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values, a family-research group in New York. "The rate of fatherlessness among white Americans today is almost exactly what it was among blacks 30 years ago. We don't have a subculture of fatherlessness anymore, we have a culture of fatherlessness, and it's spreading faster among whites than among blacks, among people over 30 than under."
Since the 1950's, the share of children living in mother-only families has quadrupled, from 6 percent to 24 percent of the nation's children. In 1994, about 19 million children lived in households without their father present. Some of those children do have men in their lives, often their mothers' new husband or boyfriend, or an "underground father" who brings occasional gifts, but does not provide reliable support.
Over all, children in homes without fathers are more likely to be poor, to drop out of high school and to end up in foster care or juvenile-justice programs than those living with their fathers. Girls from single-parent families have a greater risk of bearing children as unwed teen-agers. Boys with absent fathers face a higher likelihood of unemployment, incarceration and being uninvolved with their own children.
Nick Rocque, a Minneapolis youth whose father left home when he was too young to remember, was headed for trouble -- by his own account, "running on the streets, feeling like nobody cared about me" -- at 15, when he learned he was about to be a father.
His initial reaction was sheer terror. "At first I just wanted to run away from it, I was so scared," said Mr. Rocque, who is now 18. "But I decided I didn't want to be like my dad and I would do the opposite of what he'd done."
So, Mr. Rocque became an involved father, visiting his daughter, Victoria, regularly, and going to weekly support meetings at MELD for Young Dads, a local program for fathers aged 15 to 25 that he discovered at a teen-parents fair where, as one of the few fathers in a sea of teen mothers, he was spotted by Dwaine Simms, a MELD leader.
"It's a lot harder to recruit teen fathers into parenting programs than teen mothers," Mr. Simms said. "Moms come for the three hours when someone else takes care of their babies, and they can talk to their friends. But the dads usually don't have custody, and a lot of them still see fatherhood as a shaming thing and haven't even told their friends about their babies. They don't get a lot of reinforcement. We may be the only voice helping them be fathers." But for those who take the role seriously, as Mr. Rocque did, fatherhood can be transforming.
"Being around my kid made me come off the streets," he said. "It started making me go to school. I wanted to do what's right for her."
Like many unmarried fathers, Mr. Rocque has not had an easy time negotiating his role with the baby's mother. During his junior year in high school, their relationship soured, and Victoria was sent to live with her maternal grandparents in South Dakota. He did not see her for six months.
But with guidance from MELD, Mr. Rocque went to court and won visitation rights, and right now, he has Victoria for the summer.
"She's kind of addicting, when she says, 'Daddy, I love you,' and puts her arms around me," said Mr. Rocque, who is in a management-training program and is attending Minnesota Community College. "It's hard to go away from that."
Until recently, most family-support programs, early-childhood programs and research on families focused overwhelming on the mother-child relationship, often to the complete exclusion of fathers. Not one of 300 studies of Head Start mentioned fathers, Vice President Al Gore said at a meeting this week to promote fatherhood programs.
But now there is a groundswell of attention to fatherhood. "Just this week, Eleanor Holmes Norton, a liberal female, and Pete Wilson, a conservative male, both stood up and said that fatherlessness is the No. 1 problem in America," said Mr. Blankenhorn, the author of "Fatherless America." "That's new. Two or three years ago, people didn't talk like that. We've spent so much time affirming the work of single mothers that for a long time we ignored the elephant in the room, which is fatherlessness."
Those in the new fatherhood movement, however, take pains to avoid gender polarization and to honor the importance of mothers, especially single mothers.
While most fatherhood programs focus on men's emotional contributions to their children, they also remind men of their legal and moral obligation to pay child support.
But research shows that the men most likely to be absent fathers are those who do not earn much.
"Researchers have discovered an inextricable connection between work force participation and family formation," Mr. Smith of the Casey Foundation said. "The men who are at the margin of the work force are also likely to be at the margin of their families. To address the problem of absent fathers, you also need to address the job problem."
On Tuesday, Vice President Gore announced the start of Father to Father, a nongovernmental initiative to support fatherhood. As a model for private initiatives nationwide, he cited the array of services in Minnesota, including programs in most public school districts offering activities for fathers and children to share two Saturdays a month; an African-American Fathers Program for men with children under 6; a center with support groups, classes on how to be parents, anger workshops and legal clinics; a staff worker who encourages fathers' participation in Head Start, and a parent-education-and-jobs program.
Fatherhood programs take many approaches.
Mr. Ballard's highly regarded institute sends workers, sometimes by referral and sometimes by request, into the fathers' homes to help them develop goals and plans for building a relationship with babies they may not have seen for years.
"We believe that fatherhood is inside every boy at birth, but the kind of nurturing he gets from his father will determine how far it goes," he said. "If that sense of fatherhood is not acknowledged, but denied, it can create abuse, violence and rape. The first step, when we go to a man's home, is to get him to talk about his feelings about his own father, even if he never knew him. Sometimes there's a lot of rage. Sometimes they cry. But until they get through that, they're not ready to think about how they're going to be a father."
Sam Collins, one of the institute's outreach workers, works with 14 "proteges" in his neighborhood, seeing each one for several hours, two or three times a week.
"When we first meet with them, the problem isn't that they don't want to see their kids, it's usually that they have a problem with the mother, and we help them see that they need to work with her," said Mr. Collins, who has two young children and whose wife also works for the institute. "I've done social work before where the only reward was the pay check. But in this program, there's the reward of seeing real changes, men who were living with their parents and not seeing their kids, and after we work it through, they go out and get a job and their own place, start seeing their kids and become a real father."
