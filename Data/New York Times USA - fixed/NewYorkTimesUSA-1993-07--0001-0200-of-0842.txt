HEADLINE: Clinton Backs a $1 Billion Plan To Spare Trees and Aid Loggers

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Acting to resolve a battle over the fate of the ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest, President Clinton has approved a plan to reduce logging on Federal lands and provide more than $1 billion to retrain loggers and help distressed timber communities.
The policy was drawn from recommendations developed by a group of scientists and was presented to the timber industry, environmentalists and members of Congress from Washington and Oregon. It is the Clinton Administration's first important attempt to walk the fine line between economic growth and environmental protection. 
 The plan was immediately attacked from all sides. The industry said the new rules would destroy already hobbled businesses, while environmentalists complained that exceptions would allow cutting to go on unabated in vast tracts of forest.
 
Owl Habitat Protected
 The plan calls for restricting logging in national forests to 1.2 billion board feet a year, down from about 3 billion a year now and far below the peak of 5 billion reached in the mid-1980's. The forests are managed by the United States Forest Service, which has jurisdiction over 20 million acres in the Northwest.
The plan also provides perhaps $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion for economic relief and puts the areas in the forests where the northern spotted owl lives off-limits to logging.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton's compromise plan, which could require Congressional support to protect it from legal challenge, was the best way to address a problem that lends itself to no easy solutions.
"If the bar we set is to make everybody happy, we're not going to do it," one official said.
Others put a different interpretation on the reaction. "This has been put forward as take it or leave it," said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. "And both the environmental groups, and the labor and industry groups have said they'd rather leave it. Sometimes the conventional wisdom is that you upset the extremes and strike a middle you've done a good job. I don't think this is one of those instances."
Loggers said the decision would devastate rural communities that have already been depressed by reductions in logging sought by environmentalists to protect about three million acres of ancient growth. It is unclear what effect the plan would have on the retail price of lumber.
Environmentalists are equally unhappy, saying that provisions in Mr. Clinton's plan that are intended to set aside portions of the forest from cutting would actually allow it to continue because of loopholes built into the plan.
Representative Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, who is from Washington State, said the Clinton plan would represent "a dramatic and radical reduction" in timber cutting that he described as "extraordinarily rigid."
In remarks outside the White House, after a meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Foley also criticized what he described as overly broad applications of the Endangered Species Act, which he said protected too many species of wildlife at the expense of economic well-being.
"The Endangered Species Act is flawed because it does not make any distinction" between the sorts of animals that should be protected under the statute, he said.
 
'Utopian' View Assailed
 Mr. Foley added that some environmentalists held a "utopian view that we might by Federal law guarantee that no species would ever become extinct."
The Administration needs Mr. Foley's support to shepherd legislation that would protect Mr. Clinton's policy from becoming tied up lawsuits.
But some senior Administration officials, including Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, have suggested that the President could prevent legal challenges through administrative action and therefore let Mr. Foley and others duck a nasty Congressional fight over the plan.
"It certainly would have been very difficult to come up with something that everyone supported," said Cary Jones, the executive director of Douglas Timber Operators, a group based in Roseburg, Ore., that represents smaller companies in the industry. "But our industry was hopeful that the President would come up with more of a balanced solution that would have protected the timber communities."
Mr. Clinton chose from a package of proposals drawn up by officials in five agencies and the White House. He requested the options in early April, when he, Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Babbitt and several other Cabinet members traveled to Portland Ore., for a public hearing on ways to resolve the conflict.
 
Classic Trade-Off
 In the sort of classic exchange that allows troublesome legislation to win Congressional support, the economic assistance is the main sweetener for lawmakers who have predicted that up to 9,000 jobs would be lost.
Even this provision does not please some lawmakers, who are unhappy that the recommendations were formulated in private meetings by scientists. Mr. DeFazio said most of the money in the assistance package would probably be redirected from programs that already exist.
Other provisions in the plan, which were intended to mollify competing interests, have also attracted immediate criticism. Fran Hunt of the National Wildlife Federation said provisions that seem to put preserves off-limits to logging in fact allowed giant loopholes.
 
Margin of Safety at Issue
 For instance, Ms. Hunt said the proposals would allow companies to remove timber from the protected areas if the trees are no longer growing or overgrowth must be thinned. She said loggers had stretched those definitions to such a degree in the past that there was little practical difference in logging in the protected and unprotected areas.
"In reality, salvaging is frequently used to log standing green trees that are alive, that some forester walks out in the woods and decides it will be dead in three or five years," she said. "We're concerned that if the effort has been made to keep the logging levels as high as they can justify them -- that the margin of safety for catastrophic events would be diminished."
For two years, a court order barring new contracts for cutting timber in the ancient forests has depressed logging activity, keeping it well below the levels to be suggested in the Clinton plan and far below the peak harvests of the mid-1980's.
Because of the court order, environmentalists were anticipating that most timber cutting on Federal lands in the Pacific Northwest would stop by 1995, when most of the contracts let before the order would have expired or been fulfilled.

HEADLINE: Clinton Will End U.S. Opposition To Vietnam Loans, Officials Say

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is planning to drop its opposition to loans to Vietnam by international lending institutions, Administration officials said today.
The move would be a way of acknowledging Vietnam's recent cooperation in accounting for Americans still missing in Southeast Asia and to encourage it to do more, the officials added. 
 White House officials said the final details of the new policy, which are still being hammered out, would probably be announced by President Clinton on Friday.
While dropping the lending ban falls short of ending the American economic embargo against Vietnam, the step is likely to help pave the way for an opening of trade with Hanoi in the near future.
It certainly would be the biggest easing of the trade embargo imposed by the United States on Vietnam since the country was unified under Communist rule in 1975.
President Clinton will meet at the White House on Thursday with a coalition of groups involved in the efforts to account for military personnel missing in Southeast Asia to explain his thinking, hear their views and enlist their support for the proposed move. These groups have given such proposals a mixed reaction.
 
Incentives to Cooperate
 The President will argue that when obstacles to international lending to Vietnam are removed, Hanoi will have an even greater inducement to cooperate with Washington in accounting for missing personnel, with the understanding that further cooperation will probably lead to a lifting of the trade embargo.
The Administration is expected to tell Hanoi that it can move ahead now with international loans and that its cooperation will be reviewed when the Administration makes its annual reassessment of the trade embargo on Sept. 14.
"The key word is progress and not just cooperation," said a senior Administration official. "Cooperation is just merely helping us out. What the president is committed to is the fullest possible accounting. So lifting the embargo is tied to tangible results."
To underscore the point, Mr. Clinton is expected to accompany announcement of his new policy on the lending ban with a decision to send a senior official, most likely Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, to Hanoi to press for further help on accounting for the missing.
Technically, what the Clinton Administration will be doing is lifting its opposition to a French-led proposal to refinance Vietnam's $140 million debt to the International Monetary Fund -- a move that will enable Hanoi to clear its arrears, restructure its debt and attract further international financing.
Because Hanoi was in arrears on its I.M.F. debt, it was not able to secure much larger loans from the World Bank and other international lending institutions to underwrite the sort of major infrastructure projects it needs to make its economy more competitive.
Administration officials said the draft announcement, which they cautioned was subject to change between now and Friday, was the unanimous recommendation of the inter-agency task force, headed by the National Security Council, that had been charged with shaping policy on this issue. It included representatives from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Treasury, the State Department and the Pentagon.
 
A Sensitive Issue
 The emphasis that officials put on the unanimity of the recommendation underscores how politically sensitive this issue is for Mr. Clinton, who avoided the Vietnam war draft.
On this issue, Mr. Clinton finds himself caught between several pressures. From one side, business groups are eager to make certain that American companies will be able to get in on business opportunities in Vietnam.
Indeed, the changed policy on lending to Vietnam is bound to highlight the fact that American companies are still barred from trading with Hanoi and will not be able to bid on some of the huge infrastructure projects likely to be financed by international banks there in the coming years.
But from another direction, the President knows he is vulnerable to complaints from groups concerned about those still officially listed as missing in Vietnam. These groups accuse the Hanoi Government of failing to reveal everything it knows about those listed as missing.
At the same time, officials said, Mr. Clinton and his national security advisers felt that to maintain Vietnam's cooperation in the search for information on those listed as missing, they probably needed some symbolic way to acknowledge that Hanoi has been providing a fuller accounting in some missing-persons cases as well as better access by American investigators.
There are now roughly 90 so-called "discrepancy cases" in which there is information that a person listed as missing was at one time alive in captivity in Southeast Asia, but has still not been accounted for.
In the meantime, according to the Reuters news agency, one compromise idea being considered by the Administration would keep the embargo in place for now but let American companies carry out contracts financed by lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, has been meeting with veterans' groups in recent weeks to sound them out on this change of policy. Veterans' groups, together with politically powerful organizations of relatives of those listed as missing, appear to be divided about ending the official opposition to the I.M.F. loan restructuring, though clearly there are more opponents than supporters.
"We believe that if you do this, the United States would lose all leverage for negotiating with the Vietnamese," Dolores Alfond, head of the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, said in an open letter to Mr. Clinton this week.

HEADLINE: Loss at OTB Is Reported

 BODY:
The State Comptroller's office said yesterday that New York City's Offtrack Betting Corporation lost about $500,000 in the 1992-93 fiscal year. If the report by the office of Comptroller H. Carl McCall is accurate, OTB would be the first legal bookmaker in the country to lose money. But the agency insists that by delaying mandatory bonuses totaling $1.1 million to 1,698 employees it will end the year with an operating profit of about $700,000. Hazel N. Dukes, OTB's president, acknowledged in April that the corporation was in a financial crisis

HEADLINE: Three States Investigating Tale of Killing

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGDALE, L.I., June 30

 BODY:
Police investigators from three states met here today to pool their information on the murders of dozens of young women in hopes of answering this single question: Just how many did Joel Rifkin kill?
It is the question already preoccupying 50 state troopers, who are checking out Mr. Rifkin's claims that he murdered 17 prostitutes he had picked up on the streets of Manhattan over the last three years. 
 The New York State police said that as of today, they had found links between Mr. Rifkin and the murders of eight women, whose bodies were discovered as far from Manhattan as the Orange County town of Cornwall, N.Y., and as close as a creek in Brooklyn.
The New York City police, meanwhile, said that they had found links between Mr. Rifkin and the murders of at least four other women, whose bodies were found in steel drums, suitcases and steamer trunks in city waters a year ago or more.
 
Blood-Stained Wheelbarrow
 Mr. Rifkin's detailed descriptions of where and when he dumped the bodies, coupled with the discovery of some of the women's personal items in his house in East Meadow, led the police to their conclusions. Among the items removed from his house, the police said, were some of the women's driver's licenses and other forms of photo identification, as well as credit cards, library cards and jewelry. The police said they found the names of approximately 10 women on the identity cards.
Also taken from the house were women's undergarments, a chainsaw and a wheelbarrow that state officials said was stained with human blood.
As more of the information provided by Mr. Rifkin proved to be accurate, the police said, they became more sure that the 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, now being held without bail in the Nassau County Jail, is the murderer he claimed to be.
"The definition of serial killer by the F.B.I. is someone who has killed more than three people and takes a cool-off period in between each of them," Capt. Walter Heesch, who is heading the state police investigation, said at a news conference at the agency's Long Island barracks. "That's what we have here."
The authorities say Mr. Rifkin admitted the slayings during 10 hours of questioning by the state police on Monday. The interrogation took place after troopers stopped Mr. Rifkin's pickup truck on a street in Mineola before dawn that day and discovered the body of a woman in his vehicle. He has been charged with one count of second-degree murder in connection with the body in his pickup.
State police investigators from New Jersey and Connecticut joined law-enforcement officials from Long Island, New York City, Rockland, Westchester and Orange counties at a meeting at the state police barracks this afternoon to begin comparing notes and determine whether other cases might be linked to Mr. Rifkin.
"The state police are now working closely with other departments that have established a link with this case," said Major Anthony J. DiResta Jr., commander of Troop L, which is based here.
 
Inquiries About Many Cases
 Detective Lieut. John W. Gierasch, chief of the Suffolk County homicide squad, who attended the two-hour session, said it had been held "to establish some protocol for sharing information." The bodies of two women linked to the Rifkin case, including one unearthed Tuesday based on information that officials said was supplied by Mr. Rifkin, have been found in the Hamptons in eastern Suffolk County.
Other agencies arrived with open cases that have not been connected to Mr. Rifkin. Master Sgt. Scott O'Mara of the Connecticut State Police said that three of his department's detectives went to the meeting to inquire about the unsolved murders of 22 women -- 19 in the Hartford area and 3 near Waterbury. A Yonkers detective, Sgt. Frank A. LoCascio Jr., said he was looking into four unsolved homicides in his city.
Sergeant LoCascio was not sure, however, whether he would find what he was looking for. "It's all speculative at this point," he said.
Although the state police said Mr. Rifkin willingly answered their questions, they did not make a videotape or have the suspect sign a confession. That lapse was criticized today by other law-enforcement officials, who said the lack of a documented confession could make the cases more difficult to prosecute. One Long Island official, who declined to be identified, said some top police officials did not learn of the arrest of Mr. Rifkin until they heard it reported on the news.
Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, Robert Sale, said he was astonished to learn that any statements that might have been made were not recorded or transcribed. "It's just so startling to me," Mr. Sale said of the lack of videotaping, a procedure often used by police agencies in investigations. "To not take a written statement is even more astounding."
At the news conference, Captain Heesch said the state police had taken only "an oral statement" from Mr. Rifkin. "Based on the things that were available to us at the time, we didn't do it," he said, referring to the lack of a recorded statement.
Captain Heesch said that all the victims linked so far to Mr. Rifkin were believed to be 5 feet 3 inches or shorter and worked in Manhattan as prostitutes.
Today, the authorities provided the names of three of the victims: Anna Lopez, a Brooklyn woman whose body was found on May 25, 1992, near a park-and-ride area off Interstate 84 in the Putnam County town of Patterson, Yun Lee, a 31-year-old woman from lower Manhattan whose body was found in a steamer trunk in the East River off Randalls Island on Sept. 23, 1991, and Leah Evens, a 28-year-old Brooklyn woman whose body was found May 9 in a wooded area in the hamlet of Northampton on the east end of Long Island. The Suffolk police said that Ms. Evens was an unemployed mother of two and that they could not say whether Ms. Evens was a prostitute.
A woman who gave her name as Patricia A. Sullivan and identified herself as a lawyer with Barry, McTiernan & Moor walked up to reporters outside a building at 299 Pearl Street and said she was representing Hiram Lee. She would not say whether Mr. Lee, who lives in the building, was related to Yun Lee. Asked by reporters whether Yun Lee was her client's sister or daughter, she said no.
 
Bodies Found at Various Sites
 State police officials, meanwhile, said they were linking the body of a woman found on Oct. 1, 1991, off Route 32 in the Orange County town of Cornwall, to Mr. Rifkin. Major James D. O'Donnell of the state police barracks in Middletown said the body of the woman, who was white and about 5 feet tall, with long hair, was found in an area covered with grass clippings and other debris. They also linked Mr. Rifkin to the body of a woman found in a steel drum in Newtown Creek in Brooklyn on May 13, 1992. Both bodies remain unidentified.
Raymond W. Kelly, the New York City Police Commissioner, said that four other women found in the rivers around New York had been added to the city's list of suspected victims of Mr. Rifkin. In addition to the body of Ms. Lee, two were found in steel drums in Coney Island Creek in July 1992 and one was found in in pieces in plastic bags and a suitcase in the Harlem and East rivers that same month.
The Commissioner said that at the time, the police had thought the murders were drug-related.
The authorities said that though the location of the bodies encompass a wide portion of the metropolitan area, they remained uncertain where the women had been killed.
"Basically, his operation consisted of picking up the women, having sex with them, killing them and disposing of them," Captain Heesch said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lifts Ban on Sale of Nonlethal Military Equipment to Angola

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Removing the last remnants of trade restrictions on Angola, the Clinton Administration has cleared the way for sales of nonlethal military materiel to the formerly Marxist Government of Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
State Department officials described the lifting of export restrictions as part of the normalizing of economic relations with the dos Santos Government on May 19. 
 But the decision marks a turnaround in United States policy, which for years provided arms to Mr. dos Santos's enemy, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, and its leader, Jonas Savimbi, who has waged a bitter war against the Luanda Government.
 
Angolans Confident
 Representatives of the Angolan Government and Unita, as Mr. Savimbi's organization is known, both view the latest actions by Washington as a prelude to the endorsement by the United States, Russia and Portugal of the complete lifting of the arms embargo to both sides in the war. The embargo was put in place as part of peace accords negotiated in 1991, though both sides have continued to buy arms on the international black market.
"As far as we are concerned this is the arms embargo abolition," said Jardo Muekalia, Unita's representative in the United States. "Of course you can call it phased or staged, but, in the end, it is going to be lifted."
State Department officials said today that George Moose, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, would meet in Moscow next week with officials from Russia and Portugal, who, along with the United States, have been the countries most involved in seeking a solution to the Angolan civil war. Angola was once a Portuguese colony.
"I suspect they will discuss both positive measures to aid the Government and punitive measures to punish Unita," a State Department official said.
Among the Troika, as the three countries are collectively known, both the Portuguese and the Russians favor removing the arms embargo, State Department officials said. But they added that the Administration still opposed ending the ban.
Still, representatives of the Angolan Government say they hope some forceful action on their behalf and against Unita will be decided at the Moscow meeting.
"I'm quite sure that in the next Troika meeting in Moscow, the three observers will take an appropriate, a more strong decision about the situation in Angola," said Jose Patricio, Angola's Ambassador to the Organization of American States. Mr. Patricio added that at a White House reception on June 15, Vice President Gore told him the United States would not allow Unita to take power in Angola by force.
 
Focus on the Economy
 Couching the easing of restrictions on sales of military equipment in economic rather than martial terms, Administration officials say the decision brings to a virtual end all sanctions that had been placed on Angola and on businesses that do business with the Luanda Government.
The Administration has already dropped a regulation prohibiting the Defense Department from buying oil products from United States companies, including Chevron, that operate in Angola, officials said.
But allowing even the sales of uniforms or jeeps carries much more of a symbolic weight than other actions to ease trade restrictions. It is an especially important morale booster for the dos Santos Government, which has suffered a number of battlefield reverses since the latest round of peace talks broke down on Sept. 15.
"What this does is give a blessing to the M.P.L.A.," said Mr. Muekalia, using the intitials in Portuguese for Mr. dos Santos's political party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. "It has a psychological impact on the Government people."
Administration officials said the easing of the embargo would mean that the Angolan Government would be able to buy items like boots and uniforms.
But they acknowledged that the definition of nonlethal materiel of left sufficiently vague that the decision could also allow Angola to buy C-130 transport planes, so long as they were not configured to mount armaments.
One official said there was nothing the United States could do if a transport plane was bought and later fitted with gun mounts.
Mr. Patricio declined to say whether his Government would try to buy such planes. In the past, the Angolan Government was turned down in its attempts to buy them.

HEADLINE: As Mandela Arrives, Elections Fund Starts $10 Million Corporate Drive

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD

 BODY:
A corporate effort to raise at least $10 million to help South Africa hold democratic elections next year was announced yesterday, hours before Nelson Mandela arrived in New York to begin a two-week tour of the United States.
The South Africa Free Elections Fund was organized by Theodore C. Sorensen, a senior partner in the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, with encouragement from Mr. Mandela. The anti-apartheid leader was to meet with the fund's board. 
 The announcement underscored the primary purpose of Mr. Mandela's visit, which is to gain money and other assistance for South Africa and for Mr. Mandela's African National Congress.
Encouraging foreign investment in South Africa is also a primary goal of South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, who was to arrive in Washington yesterday and leave on Sunday. President Clinton is scheduled to present the Liberty Medal to both men in a ceremony in Philadelphia on Sunday, the Fourth of July.
The African National Congress is preparing to compete against Mr. De Klerk's National Party and others in voting next year that could end more than three centuries of white minority control of South Africa. The congress was banned in South Africa for more than 25 years, until Mr. de Klerk legalized it in 1990.
 
Other Cities in Tour
 Organizers of the Mandela tour said that the trip would include stops in Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Indianapolis.
Mr. Mandela was wasting no time in his fund-raising efforts. Within hours of his arrival on a British Airways Concorde flight at Kennedy International Airport, the 74-year-old president of the African National Congress appeared at a rally at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn.
Mr. Mandela said the African National Congresss needed money to help mobilize the vote next year. "What we want is to have the capacity on the day of the election to bring our people from their homes, from their places of work, to the voting booth," he said. "If we don't have that capacity, we may lose the election even though we may be the most popular party."
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who addressed the crowd before Mr. Mandela, said Americans now had an "opportunity to play a role in easing the transition to majority rule in South Africa."
Mr. Dinkins joked that Mr. Mandela was tiring because "so many of oiur ministers were so generous -- he was standing there receiving checks."
The Rev. Patricia Reeberg, executive director of the New York City Council of Churches, which organized the event, said she was anticipating an overflow crowd of 3,000 and $250,000 in pledges and donations.
 
Meeting With Board
 This morning, a meeting is scheduled with the board of the corporate fund-raising effort, led by Anthony J .F. O'Reilly, chief executive of the H.J. Heinz Company.
Others on the board include its vice chairman, A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., a former Federal appeals judge now with Paul, Weiss; former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance; former Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta; Robert S. McNamara, former World Bank president and Defense Department Secretary, and Peter Guber, chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
Mr. Sorensen, who was a speech writer and top aide to President John F. Kennedy, worked behind the scenes on issues involving South Africa with several of the other people involved. He will serve as counsel to the group. Mr. Sorensen was unavailable for comment yesterday.
 
To Meet With Clinton
 Mr. Mandela was to spend this afternoon in Washington, meeting separately with the House and Senate foreign relations committees. Tomorrow, he is to have separate discussions with President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Friday is also the day that constitutional negotiators in South Africa are expected to ratify an April 27, 1994, date for the nation's first universal suffrage elections.
Mr. Mandela was said to be considering using that occasion to call for the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa. But the timing of such a proclamation is considered politically sensitive as the constitutional delegates are still debating the creation of a multiparty committee that would run South Africa until the elections are held.
After campaigning for years for sanctions, the African congress now believes they must be lifted to provide the kind of economic investment in South Africa needed to allow a new government to meet black aspirations for a higher standard of living.
 
A Challenging Task
 But getting sanctions lifted quickly may be easier said than done. Although the Bush Administration ended comprehensive Federal sanctions, at least 28 states, 24 counties and 92 cities, including New York, also passed laws against doing business with South Africa.
Dumisani Kumalo, projects director for the New York-based Africa Fund, said getting all of them repealed would require a coordinated effort and would hinge on the ability of Mr. Mandela and others to convince the various governments that apartheid is indeed on the way out.
Meanwhile, as elections approach, the African National Congress must mount a campaign against an entrenched National Party Government, in power for 45 years, that has access to both money and the media.
Although whites make up less than 15 percent of South Africa's population of 40 million, and the African National Congress is regarded as the most influential and popular black political group, nonwhite politics are fragmented in many groups, based on ethnic or ideological differences.

HEADLINE: Lucky to Be in the Bronx? Bombers Aren't So Sure

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
There is a peculiar hysteria that strikes New York City every time George Steinbrenner threatens to move the Yankees from the Bronx. A low-grade panic fixates on one image: could a C (for Connecticut) or an NJ (perish the thought) ever be superimposed on the elegant and justly famous Yankees pinstripes?
To Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the image is unthinkable and has led him to champion -- as last a resort, he says -- the idea of constructing a gleaming new stadium on a railyard in midtown, even if that means moving the Bronx Bombers out of their legendary home and into Manhattan. 
 But even if the Yankees stay put, just the notion of a move to say, New Jersey's Meadowlands, exposes long-simmering anxieties about the decline of cities and especially this city, whose heart has been broken before by teams it loved.
It also forces uncomfortable questions: Is the Bronx, home to the winningest and most lucrative baseball team, still a good place to play the game? Are cities the best places for baseball if its fans live outside them?
The debate touches on issues like the population shift to the suburbs, the fear of crime in urban neighborhoods and the failure of baseball to attract minority customers -- the Bronx is half Hispanic, and Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are huge baseball fans even if they do not attend Yankees games in huge numbers.
"To some degree baseball is being thought of in the same way as American cities, that its best days are passed," said Roger Angell, the baseball writer for The New Yorker. "Maybe that's another reason for them to stick together."
Though nine years remain on the Yankees' lease in the Bronx, speculation about a possible move has intensified in recent weeks, in part because the team is doing well after years of mediocrity. But also Mr. Steinbrenner is back in baseball and making his voice heard.
People are listening: on Tuesday, a person close to Mr. Cuomo said the Governor planned to meet with Mr. Steinbrenner on Friday to discuss a new stadium on the western edge of midtown Manhattan. Also reportedly invited was Rupert Murdoch, the new publisher of The New York Post, to talk about building television studios or an arena to help finance a project whose price tag starts at $200 million. Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development and Governor Cuomo's liaison to Mr. Steinbrenner, was also scheduled to attend the meeting.
 
Cuomo Backs the Bronx
 But yesterday, in an apparent measure of just how sensitive the issue of a Yankees move is, Mr. Cuomo repeated in a news conference in Albany that the Bronx is his first choice and that he would not meet with the two men together. A state official said it was not even clear that Mr. Cuomo would keep his appointment with Mr. Steinbrenner.
Neither Mr. Cuomo nor the official denied that such a meeting was scheduled, nor would they say whether he had simply changed plans after reports of the meeting were published yesterday. The Governor's dilemma, various state and city officials say privately, is whether he can talk about a new stadium in Manhattan without seeming to impale current negotiations to keep the team in the their 70-year-old home astride the Harlem River.
"I know that the Governor and Vince feel that George may not wish to stay in the Bronx," Mayor David N. Dinkins said at a news conference yesterday at City Hall. "But I haven't certainly reached the conclusion he won't stay."
Although all discussion is preliminary at this point, the concern on all sides underscores how seriously officials are taking Mr. Steinbrenner's complaints about parking, security and attendance, which has declined steadily over the last five years (though it has picked up considerably in recent weeks). For city and state officials the worst-case scenario would be for Mr. Steinbrenner to take his team to New Jersey, a move that would crush the city and be no help to Mr. Dinkins in this fall's tough election nor to Mr. Cuomo next year if he seeks a fourth term.
To many Yankees fans, even talk of a new stadium nears blasphemy and there are few fans who do not see Mr. Steinbrenner as baseball's chief heretic.
"We would be prosecuting him within a few days if he moved out," said Michael Friedlander, 24, a Yankees fan and intern with the Bronx District Attorney's Office.
Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said: "You can't blame it on the Bronx. What you can blame it on is that the Yankees have been dwelling near the basement, and fans don't come back that quick."
As a permanent home for the team, Yankee Stadium carries a decided New York appeal, along with a healthy portion of the city's baggage.
On the plus side is the emotional tug to keep the team that has won 22 World Series at its home. The stadium is also a major anchor for the Bronx and is expected to play an important role in the recently announced Bronx Center plan. That proposal would include a 3,000-car garage, a Metro North Station, a baseball museum and other perquisites to keep the team in the borough for the long haul.
The stadium would also be in step with recent thinking in baseball, if not in other sports, toward keeping stadiums inside cities: Toronto and Chicago have recently opened well received city stadiums and fans are still falling over the new Camden Yards in Baltimore as a model for new parks. By the same token, so would the site on the West Side of Manhattan.
But city, state and borough officials all concede that Mr. Steinbrenner is right on several fronts. They agree Yankee Stadium should have more parking, more police, more lighting and better cleaned highways surrounding it. All these issues are the subject of negotiations between the city and the ball club, even though city officials said it is not clear yet where the money will come from in the effort to attract fans during this winning season.
 
Negative Perception
 What the officials cannot do is overcome the negative perception of the Bronx, and even more important, the significant shift of city life to Westchester County, New Jersey and Long Island. The team claims that 68 percent of its fans come from outside the city. From the bleacher seats of the suburbs, the borough looks nasty, dangerous and hard to get to.
"I wouldn't drive through there at night on a bet," said Richard Lettwin, 62, a retired packaging manufacturer from Harrison in Westchester County, who in fact has stopped going to night games. "They have Uzi's down there at night. It's a no-man's land. And walking through the streets? Forget about it."
Mr. Ferrer accuses Mr. Steinbrenner of exaggerating the borough's danger. And he has produced figures showing an average of two reported crimes, excluding ticket scalping, per game -- mostly theft from cars. The Yankees do not dispute the numbers, but say the matter is one of perception.
Mr. Ferrer also contends that Mr. Steinbrenner could fill the stadium if he just looked to his back yard and tried to develop the new Bronx residents as fans.
"Latinos, particularly Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, are rabid baseball fans, not only in the Bronx but in upper Manhattan," Mr. Ferrer said. "So George, instead of leaving the stadium, cut the ticket prices a buck or two."

HEADLINE: Russia to Get $1.5 Billion Loan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund approved a $1.5 billion loan for Russia today, assistance viewed as crucial to President Boris N. Yeltsin's reform efforts.
The decision was immediately praised by the Administration, which has made support for Mr. Yeltsin a major element of its foreign policy. The approval came less than a week before President Clinton and other leaders are to meet with Mr. Yeltsin in Tokyo. 
 I.M.F. officials said they had waited to approve the loan because they wanted to make sure that Russia was committed to taking steps to slow inflation and control its budget deficit.
The fund said Russia would be able to qualify for an additional $1.5 billion in six months, "provided that progress continues to be made in the implementation of the policy program." The I.M.F. said it wanted Russia to get monthly inflation below 5 percent by the end of the year. The rate, which had been almost 30 percent a month, slowed to 19 percent in May.

HEADLINE: Judge Gives Order That May Delay Trade Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
In a move that will delay and perhaps even derail approval of a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, a Federal judge ordered the Government today to prepare a lengthy study on the agreement's effects on the environment.
The Clinton Administration immediately said it would appeal the order. Supporters and opponents in Congress said that unless the order was overturned the agreement's chances of approval could be seriously hurt. 
 "My fear is that Nafta is finished unless this ruling is overturned," said Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who supports the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Congress is sharply divided over the agreement. If the vote is delayed until next year, lawmakers would then be faced with a hotly disputed measure in an election year.
Until today's ruling, the Administration had planned to submit the agreement to Congress by September. The order by United States District Judge Charles R. Richey does not prohibit it from doing so. Nor did the judge prohibit Congress from ratifying the accord, even before the environmental study is done.
But trade experts said that with Congress sharply divided over the pact, chances of passage were slim if the Administration tried to push it through without first waiting for the environmental study. Administration officials and environmentalists said it would probably take at least six months to do the study, which is known as an environmental impact statement.
Representative Robert Matsui, a California Democrat who is one of the pact's leading supporters, said the ruling would make it easier for Congress's many fence-sitters to oppose the agreement, at least for now.
"Since a judge said there must be an environmental review, members can now say there must be major environmental problems with the agreement," he said. "This hurts us at a time when we felt we were gaining momentum for the agreement."
Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has frequently criticized the pact, said that today's ruling was a "warning flag that the environmental issues have to be seriously addressed." He added that "the Bush Administration, in a rush to negotiate the treaty, ignored these important concerns."
The three environmental groups that brought the lawsuit hailed the ruling, saying it would force the Government to pay more attention to environmental factors when negotiating agreements with other countries.
But Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the Government would appeal quickly and would ask that the case be expedited. He said the ruling "interferes with the President's ability to negotiate international trade agreements."
Judge Richey's ruling also worried the Mexican Government, and the new uncertainties about the pact helped push down Mexico's stock market by nearly 2 percent today.
Ruling in favor of the three groups -- the Sierra Club, Public Citizen and Friends of the Earth -- Judge Richey said the trade agreement could affect everything from pesticide regulations to air pollution on the Mexican border. For the most part, the judge faulted the Bush Administration for not carrying out the study and said his ruling "should not be construed as a failure of the present Administration."
"An impact statement," he wrote, "is essential for providing the Congress and the public the information needed to assess the present and future environmental consequences of, as well as the alternatives to, the Nafta when it is submitted to the Congress for approval."
The Parliament in Canada has ratified the agreement, but the ratification does not take effect until the pact is approved by the United States Congress. Canada is to hold parliamentary elections later this year, and with that country divided over the pact, there is a possibility that opponents of the pact will pick up seats and try to at least change some of its provisions, if the accord has not gained Congressional approval by President Clinton's self-imposed deadline of Dec. 31.
 
A Plaintiff's View
 Joan Claybrook, director of Public Citizen, one of the plaintiffs, said the environmentalists might have done President Clinton a favor by causing a delay in Congress's voting on the accord. After being battered and bruised from the fight over his economic package, the President was facing two all-out fights this fall to win approval of the pact and of his health-care package.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the ruling might not be such a defeat for the President, because he was not sure the Senate would approve the accord right now.
The Administration is negotiating side agreements to the accord, one of which would address environmental concerns. Judge Richey's decision does not involve the side agreements, which have yet to be completed.
He ruled that an environmental study was mandated under the National Environmental Policy Act. Such a study would probably examine how the agreement would affect the environment of border states, and whether air and water pollution in border areas would increase if the pact caused industries to flock to Mexico. Environmentalists said the study should also look at whether the pact would affect American regulations on pesticide content in imported food.
A major delay in approving the pact would be an embarrassment for Mexico's President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. A delay could stir resentment in Mexico and make it more difficult for Mr. Salinas's party to win in next year's elections. Mexican law prevents him from running for re-election.
However, Mexican Goverment officials insisted today that the treaty would go forward. "This decision by the judge will absolutely not delay the process of negotiation," said Jaime Serra Puche, the Mexican secretary of commerce, who believes the treaty will still be in place by Jan. 1.

HEADLINE: Out of the Classroom and Into the Working World

SERIES: Starting the Climb -- A periodic look at summer interns.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
It is that time of year again, when thousands of America's brightest swarm to the office towers in New York and other cities to meet the real world. The summer interns, associates, fellows -- and not a few gofers eager to learn a thing or two between errands -- have arrived.
There are pathways up from internships in a wide range of careers, and internships are on the resumes of many top executives. Accordingly, these ambitious young people bubble with high hopes, though the line between dreams and delusion may prove perilously thin. 
 What clearly hangs in the already humid summer air is a sense that things are scarcer than before. In most fields, internships have become harder to get. The idea of a summer job becoming a career, always extant, is ever more compelling.
For people who have worked for a long time, there is a bit of foolishness to all this purposefulness, of course. Careers evolve over years, decades. But to an intern, as the summer begins, 10 weeks seem precisely enough time to build a stairway to the stars.
Knowingly, or not, they are marching to the wisdom of E. B. White who said, "No one should come to New York unless he is willing to be lucky."
The stories of five who came follow. Each will be revisited over the summer to see how things are going. Their employers, too, will be asked how and whether expectations are being met.
 
William McRae:
Learning Lessons In the Law
 William McRae is keenly aware that summer associate positions with big law firms are in shorter supply, and that he is lucky to have one. But he is still nervous.
"You and the firm are trying to size each other up," he said. The stakes are the offer of a permanent job after he finishes his third year of Harvard Law School. "A lot of people graduate without jobs," he said flatly.
His approach is to focus on practical legal tasks, a process he likens to putting a puzzle together. "Sooner or later, you have to sit down at the beginning and work through the long, drawn-out training," he said. "It's the beginning of my long apprenticeship."
Already, he has worked on a complicated corporate transaction and is now taking a turn in the litigation department at Chadbourne & Parke. He is keenly conscious of the trust placed in him. "You really don't want to mess up," he said. "Even if you have an excuse, you just wouldn't feel good about what you'd done."
He has also been part of the social whirl big firms have traditionally thrown for summer associates: a reception in the firm, a party in the apartment of the senior partner, a baseball game and, soon, a full day at a country club.
The background of this 24-year-old is delightfully quirky. He grew up in Atlanta where his parents are in sales, his father in a liquor store, his mother in a department store. He unsuccessfully tried to teach himself Sanskrit in high school. He chose to major in philosophy at Williams College, in part to learn the difference between good and bad thinking.
Last summer, he worked with the Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs in the Russian Parliament. He translated and helped with legal research, answering such questions as "How do they do this in Delaware?"
He is making $1,600 a week, lives on the Upper West Side and enjoys jogging around the Central Park reservoir.
"I suspect this is the type of place that would keep me interested for a very long time," he said, a bit wistfully.
 
Nick Lobel-Weis
Making Ends Meet In the Theater
 Nick Lobel-Weis, by contrast, makes $100 a week at the League of American Theaters and Producers, keeps a roof over his head by moving around and cat-sitting and works three nights a week as a busboy to hold everything together.
But he is so happy that he thinks of himself as a surfer riding a great wave. In the theater world, he says, many companies take on summer apprentices to do lighting and other chores, printing up brochures to attract them. The catch is that they pay for the privilege, as many of his friends do.
So Mr. Lobel-Weis is actually grateful for the 10-hour days. He has learned to keep lists to keep his hundreds of assignments from falling through the cracks.
"It's insanely paced, the hours are eternal and I love it," he said.
Mr. Lobel-Weis, 20, grew up in Woodstock, N.Y., then attended Fieldston School in Manhattan. His theater experience began at age 14 when he worked as an intern in a summer theater in Woodstock. He started in acting but found he preferred theater's technical side. For four summers, he hung lights, worked on sound and the like.
He will be a sophomore at Oberlin College, which gives credit for off-campus independent study. Last summer, his father, a lawyer, happened to meet Barry Weissler, producer of "Falsettos" and other Broadway shows. "Have him send me a resume," he said.
The result was an 14-hour-a-day internship last summer, the chance to see "Falsettos" 65 times and, ultimately, this year's internship, in which the biggest project is promoting the 100th anniversary of Broadway.
One of Mr. Lobel-Weiss's tasks has been to market Broadway T-shirts, an enterprise that has put him in contact with many of the nation's larger regional theaters. His plan is to build a career in theater's business side, perhaps as a producer, and all this helps immensely.
"Relationships in this business, as I see it now, are very important," he said.
 
Nitika Smith
Setting Examples In Medicine
 Nitika Smith does not really fit brief descriptions. She is part American Indian and dances in pow-wows. She is part African-American and serves as president of the Empowered Blacks United in Science, an organization she helped found at University of California at San Diego.
The goal is to encourage blacks in the sciences at a time she says many are turning away from them. "You just have to know you don't have limits," Ms. Smith said. "If you want to go for science, go for it."
Ms. Smith, 21, from El Centro, Calif., is one of 25 participants in Cornell University Medical Center's Summer Research Fellowship Program for Minority Premedical Students. The idea, getting more blacks into medical school, works: usually 95 percent decide to apply and 99 percent of those get in. "I can't lose," she said matter of factly.
Ms. Smith's research project involves searching for antibodies that might contribute to women's infertility. She works a full day, studies two or three hours a night and is learning that her $120 a week stipend does not go all that far in New York.
Sometimes she thinks she may someday find the cure to cancer. And sometimes she just feels more comfortable with the idea of medical school.
"People get through it," she said. "Every year, there are more doctors."
 
Brett Grossman
Facing Reality In Advertising
 Brett Grossman, 21, has had some rude experiences since starting at Avrett, Free & Ginsbery Advertising three weeks ago. One of his assignments has been to visit drugstores to study the placement and pricing of pharmaceuticals that compete with one of Avrett's accounts, which he would not name.
"I was kicked out of five Duane Reade stores," he said. "But Pathmark, they're nice."
What the Southern Methodist University student says he is learning is the limitations of textbook theories. Real-world problems, he is learning, hinge on how much of a campaign the client can afford. "Playing a video game with a military fighter is a lot different than flying a mission," he said.
Mr. Grossman was one of five advertising students selected from 250 applicants for the Vance Stickell Internship Program of the American Advertising Foundation, which gave him $4,500 to cover transportation and all expenses and placed him with Avrett. He previously worked as an intern in two Dallas agencies.
He is a Mexican citizen and grew up in the California's San Fernando Valley. This is his first trip to New York, and he senses a certain tension; a sharp example was a woman's tirade when his briefcase brushed her leg on a bus.
"I find myself not smiling on the streets," Mr. Grossman said, "and that's a disappointment."
But he never forgets his purpose. "I want to feel like I'm ready to get a job when I finish this," he said. The agency's intern from last summer works in an adjoining office.
 
Amy Luberto
Taking Stock In Accounting

Amy Luberto calls the gray-flannel image of accountants a cartoon artifact, though the 21-year-old accounting student laughs about being called "a digit head" at Pennsylvania State University.
She is one of 18 interns at KPMG Peat Marwick's New York office, where she is auditing big companies' books. She says it is fun to try to guess what they had in mind, but that hard work is how one finds the real answer.
"In anything you do, you have to have some sort of internal control," Ms. Luberto said of her chosen field.
Peat Marwick's program pays interns the equivalent pay for its starting auditors, who make $30,000 a year, plus overtime. It also provides them with a mentor -- "a guardian angel," she says -- and invites them to baseball games and a country club.
Ms. Luberto guards against inflating her sense of self-importance. "I'm just the intern; I'm here to learn," she said.
But she worries that senior accountants will be too busy to answer questions and then criticize her should she make a mistake. So far that has not happened. She smiles, holds her breath and dreams of a permanent job with Peat Marwick.
Her parents live in Wood-Ridge, N.J., about a half-hour's drive to Manhattan, so she commutes to work by ferry and bus. Though she has visited the city many times over the years, she has been unfavorably impressed by the crush of humanity on Monday mornings. "You see things that you never see in New Jersey," she said.
It hardly dulls the college cheerleader's infectious cheer. "How could I pass this up?" she asked. "As long as I do O.K., I'll be happy."

HEADLINE: Trade in Auto Parts Favors Japan Despite Gains by U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 30

 BODY:
Japanese automobile manufacturers appear to be on track toward reaching their target of doubling their 1990 purchases of American-made auto parts by 1994, according to executives and analysts on both sides of the Pacific.
But that is not reducing the flow of auto parts Japan keeps shipping to the United States. To the chagrin of some American executives, the trade deficit with Japan in auto parts actually increased almost 10 percent last year to $10.9 billion. 
 Now, as Washington is pushing Japan to agree to numerical goals for buying more American products, the auto parts experience provides evidence that such an approach can open doors in Japan. Indeed, American parts are now starting to be incorporated into the designs of future Japanese autos, which could lead to bigger sales in the future.
But the experience also underscores the complexities of the target-setting approach, which critics brand as managed trade.
"It is true that we have increased auto parts sales," J. P. Reilly, president and chief executive of Tenneco Automotive and chairman of the Auto Parts Advisory Committee to the Commerce Department, said in a speech at a conference earlier this month in Detroit.
"But we have made only marginal progress in reducing the trade deficit," he continued. "It is not because we have not tried. It is very frustrating. It seems the harder we try, the further behind we get."
What is causing this to happen, he said in a later interview, is that Japanese auto makers are shifting more production to America. Even as they buy more American-made parts for their American factories, they are also importing more parts from Japan. The result: the auto parts deficit does not shrink.
Americans also said that while they were happy the overall target could be reached, they had been somewhat dissatisfied with the exact nature of the purchases. To wit:
*A substantial but undetermined portion of the "American" parts being purchased are made in the United States by Japanese suppliers that have set up shop in America. Such purchases, while helping Japanese-owned companies that employ Americans, do not help existing American suppliers who believe that they are locked out of the Japanese market.
*Most of the American parts being purchased are for use in the American factories of Japanese auto makers. Exports of American parts to Japan are not increasing fast enough to satisfy American trade officials.
*Many of the parts being purchased from American companies are simple mechanical parts as well as carpets and aluminum, rather than high-technology components like engines and electronic controls that account for much of the vehicle's value. This, however, appears to be changing.
The Japanese car companies announced during President George Bush's trip here in January 1992 what they called voluntary plans that collectively would amount to purchases of $19 billion of American parts by the 1994 fiscal year, which ends in March 1995. That compared with $9 billion in the fiscal year ended March 1991.
In the fiscal year that ended in March, Japanese auto companies bought $13.6 billion of American parts, up 30 percent from a year earlier, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. If that rate of increase continues for two years, the target will be easily exceeded.
The Administration is now trying to come up with proposals for what to ask Japan to do next, such as setting a new, higher target for 1996 or 1997.
Japanese industry and Government officials say the purchase plan is a voluntary goal, not a promise, and that they do not want to set any more. The United States, they say, is already misinterpreting the plan as a commitment.
"If we do not reach the goal we will be criticized, and if we do reach the goal the U.S. will demand a larger figure for fiscal year '95 and '96," said Hisayoshi Umemoto, manager of the auto association's parts and materials department.
In any case, the United States' $31.5 billion trade deficit in autos and auto parts with Japan, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the entire trade deficit with that country in 1992, will prove to be highly resilient.
 
Deficit May Decline
 In a soon-to-be-released report, the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan estimates that the parts deficit will range between $8.8 billion and $10.6 billion in 1996 compared with $10.9 billion in 1992. The small reduction reflects the fact that Japanese auto production in the United States is increasing, bringing in more parts from Japan.
The trade deficit in autos might decline somewhat more significantly, reflecting fewer exports from Japan. The report predicts it will range from $16.6 billion to $21.08 billion in 1996 compared with $20.6 billion in 1992.
Auto executives agree that the numerical target has led to a sharp increase in discussions with Japanese companies, though that has not always led to sales.
"I used to go to Toyota and get shifted back and forth between international purchasing and Nummi and we couldn't get our foot in the door," said Glen Fillion, executive director of engineering for the Japanese subsidiary of the Dana Corporation. Now the Toledo, Ohio, company is supplying drive shafts for Toyota pickup truck production in both Japan and at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., Toyota's joint venture with General Motors in California.
To be sure, Japanese purchases of American parts had been rising before the target was set and would have continued rising even without a target. As more Japanese auto production has shifted to the United States, local content regulations, as well as the convenience of a nearby supplier, have worked in favor of more parts purchases from the United States. And now, with the appreciation of the yen, it makes economic as well as political sense for Japanese companies to buy American parts.
But the downturn in Japan's domestic auto production has made it more difficult for the auto companies to import American parts. Japanese suppliers are hurting and starting to complain about new competition.
Teiji Suzuki, executive managing director in charge of international purchasing for Nissan, recalled hearing from Mr. Reilly at the Detroit conference that American parts makers had increased their sales to Japan but not sufficiently. "I told him, 'Congratulations, Mr. Reilly, Japanese parts makers have decreased their sales to auto makers in Japan.' He didn't say anything after that."
 
Trade Representative's Concern
 Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said here this week that he was concerned that American exports of car parts to Japan were only $1 billion annually, or about 1 percent of Japan's $98 billion market. The 1992 purchase plan calls for $4 billion of the $19 billion in American parts purchased to be exported to Japan.
Japanese officials say that imports from the United States accounted for $2.4 billion of the $13.6 billion in American parts procured last year, and that imports have more than doubled in four years. The discrepancy between the United States and Japanese figures is that the Japanese count general items like carpets and leather that are used in cars but are not classified for customs purposes as auto parts.
As for the claim that they are not buying high-technology parts, Japanese companies say that such parts must be designed into the car from the outset, making it difficult to buy such parts immediately.
"At the beginning, we tended to purchase parts like tires and glass that don't require joint development," said Hiroyoshi Ono, a spokesman for Toyota.
Now more complex parts are being purchased, they say. Toyota recently announced it might buy cruise-control systems from the Ford Motor Company. Nissan is buying steering gears and other parts from TRW.
 
Target Too Early
 Mr. Kantor, the trade representative, said Washington had already expressed its concern to the Japanese Government that much of the American parts purchased by transplant auto factories came from 400 or so Japanese-owned suppliers that had set up factories in the United States.
"This is just replicating their exclusionary practices in the United States," said Lee Kadrich, director of government affairs for the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association, a trade group.
But Japanese officials say that such Japanese parts factories in the United States employ Americans and often buy their components from American companies.
The Japanese auto makers association will not provide figures that distinguish between American-owned and Japanese-owned factories.
But a new study by the Boston Consulting Group, which was commissioned by the association to assess the quality of United States suppliers, estimates that Japanese auto factories in the United States obtain only 26 percent of their parts from traditional American suppliers. Some of the imports of American parts to Japan also come from Japanese owned companies.
Still, that situation now appears to be changing as well. "Traditional suppliers have been brought into the process," Mr. Reilly said.
The Boston Consulting Group said there was still a gap between American and Japanese suppliers in their ability to support Japanese auto companies.
The Big Three American auto companies make 50 to 70 percent of their parts themselves and give detailed designs to suppliers for the rest. The report said American suppliers had had trouble adjusting to the system used by Japanese auto companies, which is to buy most of their parts from outside and let suppliers design those parts.
Toyota established a supplier support center in Lexington, Ky., last year and is now working with 19 American suppliers on improving quality and productivity.

HEADLINE: Mexican Stocks Post Losses

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Mexican stocks fell in heavy trading in the United States yesterday on worries that an American court ruling would delay the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Traders said selling pressure was somewhat restrained because it was unclear during trading hours whether the ruling would be supported by the Clinton Administration. 
 One trader said the news gave investors an excuse to take profits. Mexican stocks advanced Tuesday on expectations of a decline in Mexican interest rates, he said.
Rates on Mexico's 28-day Treasury bill fell yesterday, which helped offset the selling pressure on stocks, traders said.
The shares of Telefonos de Mexico, the Mexican telephone company, took the brunt of the selling, in part because it is so widely held. Telmex shares fell $1.625, to $46.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: May Factory Orders Fell 1.4% for 3d Drop in Row

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Orders received by the nation's factories tumbled in May for the third straight month to the lowest level since November, the Commerce Department said today.
The 1.4 percent decline in May orders followed a revised three-tenths of 1 percent decrease in April orders. The April drop was previously reported as one-tenth of 1 percent. 
 Economists said manufacturers again curbed output to trim stocks of unsold goods, which grew for the fourth consecutive month. Inventories rose three-tenths of 1 percent in May, to $381.4 billion, after a two-tenths of 1 percent rise in April.
They also attributed the drop to weak demand for United States exports and a reluctance among businesses to purchase big-ticket items because of uncertainty over President Clinton's economic program.
"U.S. manufacturing is stagnant at this time," said Allen Sinai, Economic Advisers Inc.'s chief economist. "Manufacturing has been dragging the economy down."
 
String 0f Consecutive Declines
Economists had expected factory orders, which include everything from diapers to missiles, to decline just eight-tenths of 1 percent in May. Orders have dropped in four of the last five months, and the string of three consecutive declines was the first since the three months ending in March 1991.
May's level of orders -- $249.3 billion adjusted for seasonal factors -- was the lowest since November of last year, when they were $244.0 billion. But orders still were up 4 percent from May 1992.
The drop in orders offered more evidence the economy is growing only modestly. The Commerce Department said this week sales of new homes had their biggest drop in May in 13 years, and the Government's key economic forecasting gauge slipped.
Economists said the weakness in the manufacturing sector was widespread. Unfilled orders -- a sign of future production -- fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in May to the lowest level in four and a half years.
While stocks of unsold goods are not considered to be at alarming levels, they continued to swell. But economists singled out as a problem the uncertainty over what tax changes will be in the President's budget.
Certain changes are sure to affect how businesses will spend money on machinery, turbines and other big-ticket items used in production. As a result, companies are delaying purchases of such products, economists said.
"Why make the commitment until you see how things shake out?" said Richard Berner of Mellon Bank.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, a measure of business expansion plans, fell 1.1 percent after a 3.7 percent rise in April.
Shipments of manufactured goods, an indication of current demand, fell five-tenths of 1 percent in May after a 1.5 percent tumble.
Military contractors' orders, which are subject to wide monthly swings and have been hurt by military spending cuts, skidded 15.6 percent after a 7.5 percent drop in April.
Excluding military-related industries, factory orders fell 1 percent in May and slipped one-tenth of 1 percent in April.

HEADLINE: For a Grieving Mother, Freshened Tears

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Maria Alonso buried her daughter in a rural New Jersey cemetery under a cloud of questions last July. But this week, she shed fresh tears after learning that her daughter may have been one of 17 prostitutes who were victims of a serial killer.
In a dimly lighted apartment in East New York, Brooklyn, Ms. Alonso grieved over the old wounds rubbed raw again, and over the labels that people will place on "poor dead girls" like her 33-year-old daughter, Anna Lopez. 
 "Prostitutes," Ms. Alonso said with a bitter half-laugh. "It hurts a mother's heart. Why not call them victims of circumstances? He killed 17 daughters, you know. He killed 17 sisters to somebody. That's who he killed."
 
'Is He Laughing?'
 Authorities say that Joel Rifkin, an unemployed landscaper from Long Island, is a suspect in the death of Ms. Lopez, whose partially nude body was found May 25, 1992, in a wooded area off Interstate 84 in the Putnam County town of Patterson.
"The similarities in the way she was found, where she was from, what she did for a living and the way she was killed would strongly suggest he is a very good suspect in our case," said Lieut. John Noonan of the State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigations.
Since her daughter's disappearance last year, Ms. Alonso said she has not had a good night's rest. She said her mind has raced constantly. "I wondered who killed my daughter. What is he doing now? Is he laughing? Is he living a normal life."
Now, she said, she feels a mixture of relief and anger. She is glad the man who may have killed her daughter is off the streets, but she will need to summon strength for another painful chapter in the courts.
 
A Happy, Outspoken Child
 "I want to get all these families together and I want everybody to be there in court with me," Ms. Alonso said, tears welling in her eyes. "I want to show that these girls, these prostitutes, have families who care. They were probably alone on the streets, but not in the world."
As she spoke, family members nodded in agreement. "We're going to be in court every day," said Monica Aguayo, Ms. Lopez's sister. "He wants to plead insanity. But he's not insane. He's just an evil person."
Ms. Alonso, 51, said her daughter was not born a prostitute. When Ms. Lopez was young, her mother said, she was a happy, outspoken child. But she was a girl whose life began to take wrong turns.
Ms. Alonso remembers getting on her knees to plead with her daughter to not drop out of the 11th grade. She recalled seeing the signs of drug addiction in her daughter after the death of Ms. Lopez's husband from a drug overdose.
She remembers seeing her daughter, worn down by drug addiction, on the streets, and listening to her promises to seek treatment. And she recalls weeping when her homeless daughter told her that she had almost frozen to death while sleeping on a stranger's doorstep.
Most of all, Ms. Alonso, remembers the sinking feeling that she had when her daughter did not show up to collect a widow's pension check last June. "I knew in my heart she was dead," she said.

Calvin Sims Southern California's Top Grocery Chain Will Explore 2 New Niches.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
MORE Southern Californians do their grocery shopping at the Vons Companies than at any other supermarket chain. Last year, 347 Vons stores generated $5.6 billion in revenues, making the chain the nation's ninth-largest retail grocer.
But Vons has seen its sales slip lately, as it has been hit hard by an economic downturn and stiff price-cutting by competitors and wholesale grocery clubs. In the first quarter, which ended on March 28, sales at stores open more than a year declined 8.3 percent. So, Vons is looking for new ways to grow. 
 In an expansion that could make or break its dominance in the West, Vons plans to spend more than $100 million to build 10 stores in low-income areas of Los Angeles and tens of millions of dollars more to develop mega-stores that sell everything from wholesale groceries and discount drugs to dry cleaning and video services.
Vons says that the inner city has great potential because it is grossly underserved. The chain said that as many as 1.2 million people in South-Central Los Angeles do not have access to a supermarket.
After losing customers to the wholesale clubs, Vons plans to open three "Expo" stores that provide one-stop shopping for customers looking for bargain prices. The stores are planned for Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, where wholesale clubs have been highly successful. If these stores prosper, Vons plans to open more.
Some industry analysts say that while the two new ventures represent good growth opportunities, they are fraught with risks. Operating a supermarket in an urban area is more expensive than in the suburbs because of the high cost of real estate, utilities, insurance, transportation and security. In addition, the wholesale grocery club industry is rapidly consolidating, and this does not bode well for a new entrant, analysts say.
"There's no question that the inner city is a place where you can make money in the grocery business," said Douglas Christopher, an analyst for Crowell, Weedon & Company in Los Angeles, "but there is the risk that after investing millions of dollars to open these new facilities, they could be trashed or destroyed."
Mr. Christopher, who has rated Vons's stock a "hold," said that the chain had good long-term prospects but that he did not see any near-term increase in revenues, which should remain flat for the year because of weak economic conditions in the region. He estimates that Vons will earn $1.90 a share for the year, compared with $1.89 last year.
Vons's shares closed yesterday at $23.125, off 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Their range in the last 12 months has been $21 to $26.375.
Charles E. Cerankosky, an analyst for Hancock Institutional Equity Services, praised Vons's plans. "California is such a diverse market that it makes sense for them to try to reach as many different customers as possible," he said. Vons has been pursuing that strategy through its Pavilions stores, which cater to affluent customers, and its Tianguis stores, which aim at Hispanic customers.
Mr. Cerankosky also rates the stock a hold, estimating per-share earnings at $1.95 for the year. "This is a challenging year economically in Southern California, and consumers are being very careful with their dollars and there's nothing that indicates it will get better," he said.
Mary M. MacAboy, Vons's director of investor relations, said the company believed that the best way to enhance shareholder value was to reinvest in operations. By the end of this year, Vons will have spent about $1 billion over five years opening new stores, remodeling and updating technology.

HEADLINE: Issues of Corporate Securities Hit a Record

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The lowest interest rates in 20 years fueled corporate America's drive to raise cash in the public marketplace in the first six months of this year, and a record amount of securities was issued. In turn, investment firms raked in record fees.
Corporations issued $530 billion in debt and equity securities in the six-month period that ended yesterday, up some 19 percent from the previous record of $445 billion that hit the market in the first two quarters of 1992, according to the Securities Data Company, a research company. 
 The rush to raise cash slowed slightly in the second quarter, with $258.2 billion in securities issued, down from the record amount in the first quarter of $271.4 billion. But the second-quarter figure was still a healthy 15.8 percent jump over the $223 billion in securities issued in the second quarter of 1992.
 
Rush to Refinance
 With interest rates so low, corporations have rushed to refinance their debt to lower costs, even as institutional and retail investors were driven into a search for higher yields. That search has helped the equity markets, where companies have been fetching top dollar for new stock issued to the public.
The search for yield grew more intense in the last quarter, underwriters say, as more and more institutional investors and money managers decided to risk more in their investments to make up for the interest they were losing on safer securities, like Treasury debt.
"With historically low Treasury yields, fixed-income accounts are more willing to extend out along the yield curve and down the credit curve," said James B. Quigley, managing director with domestic debt new issues at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The lower rates go, the less selective accounts can afford to be in their search for yield."
That has meant that Wall Street has successfully underwritten deals that might not have been doable six months ago, helping increase Wall Street's fees. Firms earned $2.2 billion in the second quarter, and a record $4.3 billion in the first six months of the year. That is up from $3.6 billion in the first two quarters of 1992, according to Securities Data.
 
Initial Offerings Gain
 Initial public offerings continued at a strong pace, with $26.5 billion in new securities issued in the first six months, up from $20.9 billion in the first half of 1992. But underwriters said that the initial offering market had begun changing in recent weeks, as investors turned away a bit from companies expected to grow rapidly and toward more defensive investments, like convertible or preferred securities, which offer high yields.
Merrill Lynch, the perennial leader in underwriting since the late 1980's, again captured the top spot, with $99.6 billion in the six-month period, for 18 percent of the market.
The biggest changes in rank in the period came in equity underwritings. Dean Witter Reynolds, which ranked 11th in common stock underwritings in the first six months of 1992, rose to rank fifth. Salomon Brothers, which had been hobbled by the 1991 Treasury markets scandal and ranked 10th in the first half of last year, showed signs of renewed vigor, rising to rank sixth in common stock underwriting.

Dollar Gains After Clinton Urges Lower German Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against major foreign currencies in active trading yesterday in New York following President Clinton's suggestion that Germany should lower its interest rates.
Gold and silver prices fell. Gold for August delivery slipped 20 cents, to $378.40 an ounce; July silver was 0.5 cent lower at $4.558 an ounce. 
 Traders said the dollar moved higher on a combination of Mr. Clinton's comment and technical factors.
 
 
'Expand the Economy'
 The President, speaking to reporters and relating his goals for the Group of Seven summit meting in Tokyo next week, said the Bundesbank should lower interest rates "so that all of us together can expand this economy."
The German central bank is scheduled to meet today. It has been under pressure for months to lower rates to stimulate the lagging world economy, but has resisted because of inflation fears.
If German interest rates fall, United States rates would become more competitive. That would make American investments more attractive and tend to drive the dollar higher.
Early in the day, the dollar was trading lower. Traders were concerned about the United States June employment report, scheduled for release tomorrow, said Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
But improvement in the Chicago purchasing managers' index, which measures economic activity in that area, prompted some concern about higher American interest rates in the future, Mr. Donney said.
 
 
Inflation Concerns
 If stronger economic activity brings inflation, that could prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, making the dollar more valuable against foreign currencies. This may have fueled dollar buying even more, Mr. Donney said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 106.51 yen, down 0.34 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted higher at 106.60 yen. In New York, the dollar traded late at 106.95 yen, up from 106.50 Tuesday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.4930, down from $1.5035 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound was trading late at $1.4915, down from $1.5118 Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, were: 1.7060 German marks, up from 1.6893; 1.5135 Swiss francs, up from 1.4990; 5.7470 French francs, up from 5.6910; 1,550.00 Italian lira, up from 1,536.00, and $1.2822 (Canadian ), up from $1.2821 (Canadian).

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Hartford May Try to Lure Patriots

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 30

 BODY:
A plot to bring the New England Patriots to Hartford to play in a new stadium here was revealed today by the Governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., and the chief plotter, Francis W. Murray of Philadelphia.
The state would build the stadium and Murray, a former minority owner of the Patriots, would provide the team. 
 However, Weicker and Murray both acknowledged that for this plan to unfold, by its target date of 1996, several things need be sorted out.
Primary is the acquisition of the National Football League franchise by Murray's group of financiers, which yesterday made an offer of $133 million to the Patriots' owner, James Busch Orthwein of St. Louis.
Murray believes that such a sale in turn is dependent upon St. Louis being granted one of the two expansion franchises the N.F.L. will award in October. A 70,000-seat indoor stadium is under construction there in anticipation of an N.F.L. team.
 
A Cost of $200 Million
 The price offered Orthwein, said Murray, is the equivalent of the $140 million the N.F.L. seeks for its expansion franchises, minus a 5 percent discount.
According to Murray, the 65,000-70,000-seat outdoor stadium -- with a grass field plus skybox amenities missing at spartan Foxboro Stadium, where the Patriots have played since 1971 -- would cost about $200 million. Six sites along the Connecticut River are under consideration. "We're not at the point where I can give details about costs and locations," Weicker said.
The new stadium is tied to an economic plan whereby a bond issue would provide construction funds. Its debt service would be covered by tax revenues generated by stadium events from ticket sales, concessions, increased hotel, restaurant and transportation activity.
"The facility can pay for itself without cost to the taxpayer," said Murray, who has a 30-year lease in mind for the team.
 
Share With the Huskies
 An offshoot of the plan would be co-tenancy of the new facility here, now called Connecticut Riverfront Stadium, by the University of Connecticut football team. Weicker foresaw an upgrading of the UConn football program from its present Division I-AA status in the Yankee Conference to I-A and possible Big East membership.
"I've already spoken to Lew Perkins about that," said Weicker, referring to the UConn athletic director.
The stadium would be designed for football only, Murray said. It would be in use about 17 times a year: eight regular-season and three preseason games for the Patriots and six home games for the UConn Huskies.
 
'Moving Next Door'
 The Foxboro Stadium, seating 60,794 and seldom filled, cost $9 million and was the least expensive of the first-generation of 16 sports stadiums for professional baseball and/or football teams built between 1961 and 1976.
The usual economic impact and market-area statistics were offered while stress was made on "keeping the Patriots in New England," said Murray, rather than snatching them away from the Boston market. "We would just be moving next door," he said.
Foxboro Stadium is 22 highway miles south of Boston and 60 milesnortheast of Hartford. Downtown Hartford is 105 miles from Boston and 120 from New York. Territorial boundaries in the N.F.L. extend 75 miles so, in theory, there would be no invasion of the New York television market.

MARATHON OIL TO IDLE INDIANA REFINERY TEMPORARILY

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The Marathon Oil Company said yesterday that it would temporarily stop production at its unprofitable 50,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Indianapolis beginning Oct. 1. The company, a subsidiary of the USX Corporation, said it would idle the refinery because of "unfavorable plant economics" and the growing expense of meeting environmental standards. The refinery is Marathon's smallest, producing about 8 percent of the company's refined products. 
 The plant employs 255 people -- 111 salaried and 144 union workers -- but it was not clear how many employees would be laid off, a plant spokesman, Steve Wagner, said.

HEADLINE: Mr. Stein Quits

 BODY:
There is more to life than politics, and more to public service than being an elected official.
 -- Andrew Stein, in his statement retiring from politics
 It often seemed, during most of his 25 years in public life, that there really was nothing but politics for Andrew Stein. It drove him and shaped him. He loved the hobnobbing, the glamour, the celebrity. A child of John Kennedy's shirt-sleeved generation of gilded politics, most of all Andrew Stein reveled in the game. 
 Now he says he just doesn't love it anymore. He's giving up his job as President of the City Council, just renamed Public Advocate, and declares he will never run for office again. That's hard to believe for those who have watched him from the early days when he dreamed out loud of being the first Jewish President, to his recent debacle as a failed candidate for mayor. But Mr. Stein claims he means it, and if he does, his decision speaks to his hard-earned political acumen.
Most public figures don't know when to call it quits. Weakened by his unsuccessful mayoral campaign and facing a job diminished in power, the 48- year-old Mr. Stein had the sense to bow out gracefully. He might have won re-election, but if his ambition had fled, why bother?
That, of course, is the hardest to accept -- the idea of an ambition-free Andrew Stein. He has been a fixture in the public life of New York City since he ran for the Assembly when he was 23. He won, largely thanks to his father's money, and has tried ever since to live down his reputation as a creature of political extravagance and parental largess.
To some degree, he managed to improve his image. His probe of fraud in the nursing home industry, despite some investigative excesses, helped clean up corruption and saved many elderly people from poor care. Subsequently, as Manhattan Borough President and then City Council President, Mr. Stein exposed problems in the city's emergency medical service, in the school custodians' union and in the training of doctors. Candid about his limitations, he always surrounded himself with knowledgeable, talented staff members, and always knew how to earn the media's attention.
That was his greatest strength but also his greatest weakness: Mr. Stein cared too much about publicity and image, which made the most damaging error of his mayoral campaign all the more curious. His conspicuously lavish fund-raising events left a sour taste in the mouths of recession-weary New Yorkers. Instead of celebrating the reforms of the city's system of campaign financing, he resisted them. This reliance on outdated money politics, and other flaws in his campaign, stalled Mr. Stein's mayoral effort; in May he dropped out.
What now for Andrew Stein? He isn't quite saying, but here's a guess. Whatever the next phase of his career, New Yorkers will be hearing from him. In the words of his father, the publisher and businessman Jerry Finkelstein, politics is "never out of anybody's blood forever."

HEADLINE: The Shrinking African Giant

 BODY:
Once Nigeria was considered the anchor and bellwether of a huge continent. Blessed with clever and energetic peoples, favored with ample oil resources, it is also Africa's most populous country, with 110 million inhabitants. But despite size and wealth, Nigeria lingers in the doldrums, perpetually a country of the future.
This year was supposed to be different. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, a self-installed President since 1985, promised to hand over power in August to an elected successor. Nigeria's armed forces had organized two political parties, one right of center, the other tipping to left. Nigerian diplomats disseminated glossy brochures, filled with diagrams showing how a new federal system would unite the mostly Muslim north with the Christian and animist south. 
 Alas, it all proved illusory. Twice General Babangida postponed elections. After Nigerians were finally allowed to vote on June 12, the general canceled the result, claiming the poll was marred by widespread fraud. Over the protests of the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, a wealthy industrialist and publisher, the general promised yet another election in late July, but with different candidates.
The President-General has earned his nickname: Maradona, after a soccer player celebrated for his stealthy footwork. He talks enough democracy to placate Americans and other foreigners, yet prevents the growth of a credible opposition. And now, faced with the threats of a general strike and the resignation of 30 senior military officers, he speaks menacingly of crushing opposition with force.
The Clinton Administration was right to suspend its modest foreign aid programs when the election was voided. Nigeria can never evolve a political system commensurate to its size and importance if its military leaders, as in bad old colonial times, treat civilians as incompetent. Meantime, billions of petrodollars melt into the sands, and Africa's giant continues to shrink.

HEADLINE: Veteran Communist Crowns A Comeback in Azerbaijan

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAKU, Azerbaijan, June 30

 BODY:
Heydar Aliyev, the former Communist boss of Azerbaijan and Politburo member in the Soviet Union, consolidated a dramatic comeback today by naming the republic's dominant warlord as his Prime Minister and head of all internal and external security forces.
After two days of negotiations with Surat Husseinov, the 34-year-old maverick military commander whose move on the capital earlier this month drove the elected President into exile, Mr. Aliyev convened a Parliament and presented Mr. Husseinov as head of his Government and of the military, security ministry and interior ministry. There was only one dissenting vote. 
 Mr. Husseinov, a dapper man who had been director of a wool factory and amassed a mysterious fortune in recent years, spoke briefly and deferentially, leaving the floor largely to the 70-year-old Mr. Aliyev. The latter mixed pledges of economic and military revival with references to Islam and warnings to the opposition both before the Parliament and at a news conference.
 
Return From Political Limbo
 The parliamentary session effectively consolidated Mr. Aliyev's return after six years in political limbo. While he waited in the wings, for a while in exile in Moscow and then as leader of his native region of Nakhichevan, Azerbaijan was wracked with a debilitating war with Armenia over the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh and by see-saw power struggles in Baku.
The last of these, a year ago, brought to power President Abulfez Elchibey, a scholar and former dissident, at the head of a broad coalition called the Popular Front. Though enormously popular at the time and elected President with 60 percent of the national vote, Mr. Elchibey failed to reverse Azerbaijani setbacks in Nagorno-Karabakh or to control the disintegrating economy and rampant corruption.
Mr. Elchibey's final defeat began on June 4, when the Government staged a clumsy attempt to disarm Mr. Husseinov's militia in the northern city of Gyandzha. Mr. Husseinov had been dismissed as military commander the previous February by Mr. Elchibey, and he now sent his militia toward the capital.
In the ensuing panic, Mr. Elchibey asked Mr. Aliyev to come to Baku as a mediator but then fled the capital for his native village in Nakhichevan. Mr. Aliyev was chosen as head of the Parliament and on Mr. Elchibey's flight was named the acting president. Mr. Elchibey, however, has refused to resign as President.
 
U.S. Recognizes Rival
 The United States and Turkey have so far continued to recognized Mr. Elchibey as President, though Russia demonstrated its satisfaction with the return of Mr. Aliyev by suspending the activities in Russia of a small ethnic group that has been agitating for independence from Azerbaijan.
Mr. Aliyev has joined the ranks of 11 former Soviet officials, including President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who have remained or returned to power in newly independent republics. Asked about that at a news conference today, Mr. Aliyev feigned surprise at the question.
"The question makes no sense," he said. "There is no longer a Soviet Union, no Communist Party which led the Soviet Union alone through force. The people who come to power are those people can trust. What they did for the old Soviet Union has no significance. It makes no sense to divide officials into the 'former' and the 'new.' "
Like his other former comrade, Mr. Aliyev has his work cut out for him. There is the immediate challenge of Mr. Elchibey, who still has a following that could mount a mettlesome opposition and even resort to arms.
 
Threats to Opposition
 In his comments to Parliament, Mr. Aliyev issued veiled threats against the Popular Front and other political movements. "I don't want to use force, but while they should know that pluralism and political discussion can continue, armed groupings cannot," he said.
There is also no guarantee that Mr. Husseinov will work smoothly with Mr. Aliyev. An ambitious and popular leader, Mr. Husseinov is backed by a powerful militia, whose blue-bereted soldiers strutted on the streets outside Parliament during all the meetings.
There is also the five-year-old war in Nagorno-Karabakh, the most tenacious ethnic struggle in the former Soviet Union. Seizing on the chaos in Baku, Armenian forces have consolidated their grip on the disputed territory and in recent weeks have attacked Azerbaijani towns well beyond its borders.
Both Mr. Aliyev and Mr. Husseinov pledged to "win back lands lost to the enemy," but reports from the front indicate little Azerbaijani resistance.
 
Meeting With Oil Companies
 Mr. Aliyev also has the task of reassuring foreign governments and oil companies of his intentions. Mr. Elchibey's Government had been in the process of negotiating a lucrative deal with several foreign oil companies from Britain, the United States, Turkey and Norway for the development of offshore oil deposits in the Caspian Sea.
The Council of Ministers moved a week ago to suspend negotiations to cancel the "unified field" plan that would have treated the foreign companies as single consortium, raising the likelihood of a prolonged new round of bidding and negotiations. Mr. Aliyev today insisted that foreign companies and governments had nothing to worry about and scheduled a public meeting with oil company executives to demonstrate his good will.
As he has since Mr. Elchibey fled on June 18, Mr. Aliyev maintained that he has "great respect" for the absent President but that he could not run the country from his remote village. Mr. Husseinov was more blunt, branding Mr. Elchibey a "criminal" who should be prosecuted for crimes against the state.
At the same time, Mr. Aliyev has wasted no time building his image and authority. The state television has aired daily programs hailing his achievements, and the Russian-language Baku daily, Bakinets, carried a brazenly adulatory declaration on its first page, headlined in part, "HE Has Returned!!!"
Though many another republic has experienced Azerbaijan's pattern, passing from the elation of independence to disillusionment and the desperate recall of a former Communist chief, Mr. Aliyev's comeback was especially dramatic.
The former K.G.B. chief in Azerbaijan, he was named the Communist leader of the republic in 1969 under Leonid I. Brezhnev and soon gained a reputation as one of the most sycophantic regional leaders in the Soviet Union. In 1983, Mr. Brezhnev made him a full member of the Soviet Politburo and in the first years under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he became a Deputy Prime Minister of the Soviet Union.
Mr. Aliyev was ousted from the Kremlin in an internal political shake-up in 1987. For three years he languished in oblivion in Moscow. His rehabilitation began in January 1990, when he addressed a rally in Moscow denouncing a bloody military intervention by Soviet forces in Baku and soon after he returned to Azerbaijan, now as a anti-Communist nationalist.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 3, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the comeback of a veteran Communist, Heydar Aliyev, in Azerbaijan misidentified the Soviet leader who made him a full member of the Soviet Politburo and misstated the year. Yuri V. Andropov appointed him, in 1982.

HEADLINE: Kuwaitis Back U.S. Missile Strike on Iraq Capital

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, June 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's decision to fire missiles at Iraq's intelligence complex last weekend has been greeted warmly by Kuwaitis, for whom Iraq's guilt in an attempt to assassinate former President George Bush in April was never in doubt.
"It is part of the punishment that most people around here believe is well deserved by the Iraqi Government," said Fatma Hussein, editor of Samra, a publication concerned with women's issues in Kuwait. "We hope there will be more." 
 Her remarks echoed national sentiment in the small emirate, which is still traumatized by the Iraqi occupation and devastation of its economy during the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990-1991.
The trial of 16 men accused of plotting to kill Mr. Bush with a car bomb is to resume on Saturday, but may be further postponed "to permit the continuing questioning of defendants and their access to lawyers," Al Watan, a Kuwaiti daily, reported.
Two sessions of the trial have so far failed to attract much of an audience, and most Kuwaitis reached by telephone did not immediately recall its status. The sessions, held on June 5 and June 26, were reported on the inside pages of Kuwaiti newspapers and hardly at all in other regional news outlets.
"Frankly no one cares about the trial," said Mohammed al- Ghoderi, the director of an art gallery in Kuwait. "The fact that Saddam is a bad guy needs no proof for Kuwaitis. Still, the American hit of the Mukhabarat headquarters had tremendous support here for a day or so; then people slipped into the other concerns of the country."
The Mukhabarat is the Iraqi intelligence service.
Mahmoud al-Ghanem, a businessman in Kuwait, said: "The verdict on whether the Iraqis tried to kill Bush has been passed by the virtue of the American strike. Obviously the Americans believe these guys did try to kill Bush. We never doubted it. So, the trial is just a procedural thing now."
Kuwait's mood seems to be far from the trial. Attention is focused on other issues, including a parliamentary inquiry into financial irregularities by former officials -- among them members of the Kuwaiti ruling family -- that may involve as much as $5 billion missing from the public treasury.
In the last week, another highly emotional issue has erupted with a vehement public rejection of what seemed to be an awkward Government attempt to start reconciliation talks with Yemen and Tunisia, which supported Iraq during the gulf crisis. Last week, Tunisia's Foreign Minister went to Kuwait on an official visit and was greeted with cries of "Go Home."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Iraqi Is Conciliatory
 BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 1 (Reuters) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said today that Iraq had no intention of retaliating for the United States missile attack on Baghdad and that his Government hoped for better relations with the Clinton Administration.
"We would like to have a quiet peaceful relationship with the United States of America and the world at large," Mr. Aziz said in an interview in Baghdad with Cable News Network.
In the first comment to the West by a senior Iraqi leader since the attack, Mr. Aziz also repeated the Iraqi Government's denial of involvement in any plot to kill George Bush.
"This attack on Iraq was totally unjustified," Mr. Aziz said of the missile attack. "Iraq is not the enemy of the United States. We might have differences, yes, but those differences should be solved in a civilized manner."
Asked whether Iraq planned to retaliate, he said: "We are not contemplating any designs of revenge." 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
No Comment by U.N. Chief
 GENEVA, July 1 (Reuters) -- Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali declined to comment today about whether the United States missile strike on Baghdad was legitimate under the United Nations Charter.

HEADLINE: Seoul's Leader Says North Is Manipulating U.S. on Nuclear Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 1

 BODY:
A week before President Clinton arrives here to reaffirm American solidarity with a longtime ally, President Kim Young Sam cautioned today that North Korea was manipulating its current negotiations with the United States "to buy time to finish their project" to build nuclear weapons.
In a turnaround from three months ago, when South Korean officials voiced fears the United States might be too aggressive in its dealings with the Communist Government in Pyongyang, Mr. Kim said he hoped the United States "will not continue to be led on by North Korea" when talks over nuclear inspections enter a third round in Geneva in two weeks. 
 His comments seemed to reflect a growing concern in Seoul that the Clinton Administration had already offered much to the North -- including legitimacy by engaging in the direct talks with the Government of Kim Il Sung for the first time since the end of the Korean War -- in return for little.
 
Says 'Time Is Running Short'
 Mr. Kim, who took office four months ago, declined to say exactly how long the talks should continue before the United States, South Korea and Japan should seek approval of the United Nations Security Council of economic sanctions on the North for its refusal to allow full international inspections.
But he said that "time is running short" and suggested that "by early next year they will be able to produce plutonium" in large enough quantities to produce several weapons.
His Foreign Minister, Han Sung Joo, said earlier this week that the North should only be given another month or two before the issue moves to the Security Council.
President Clinton's visit here, after the summit meeting of the seven leading industrial nations in Japan, will cap his first venture into Asia as President. The White House is planning to use it as a chance to portray him as prepared to face down the North Korean threat.
As many Presidents have done on their visits here, Mr. Clinton is scheduled to travel to the heavily armed demilitarized zone, have lunch with some of the Americans troops and make an address on Asian security to South Korea's national assembly.
Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kim is combatting an image at home of inexperience in diplomacy and military matters, and today he appeared to be taking a harder line against the North than in previous public statements. In the past, Korean officials have spoken of the risk of reviving a military confrontation.
In a wide-ranging interview at Blue House, the presidential mansion, he also said that since taking office he has been astounded to discover "how deeply corruption had embedded itself in government and society" and suggested that his predecessor, Roh Tae Woo, had ignored overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing in his Government.
Mr. Kim said that in his first few months in office he had purged South Korea's military and its intelligence services so that "never again can this kind of corruption take root."
 
Investigations Under Way
 But he said that many investigations were still under way, including one involving huge unexplained deposits in the accounts of senior officials of Mr. Roh's Government who were involved in a $6 billion purchase of American-made F-16 fighters to South Korea.
Mr. Kim's comments on the North Korean talks come at a critical juncture in the effort to get the North to abandon its nuclear project, although there is conflicting intelligence about how close it is to producing a workable arsenal of nuclear weapons.
So far the American talks, headed by Robert Gallucci, a deputy secretary of state, have succeeded in getting the North's hard-line Government to "suspend" its plan to leave the treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons.
 
'A Tug of War'

But they have failed to make any progress on the inspection issue, meaning that the situation is almost exactly where it was in March.
Now the North appears to be trying to slow down the subsequent negotiations. "At this point we are into a tug of war with them" over how fast to move, one of Mr. Kim's senior aides said.
When North Korea first announced that it was planning to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the Government here took a soft line, hoping quiet persuasion would work.
The United States took a tougher view, with some officials hinting that if a diplomatic route could not be found to end the North's nuclear program, a military one might be considered.
 
Endless Discussions Feared
 Now the roles seem reversed. Some Korean officials are concerned that the United States could get dragged into endless discussions with the North, veering into questions of when economic aid could begin to flow or the establishment of diplomatic relations.
In another sign of recent American flexibility in the talks, United States delegates made it clear that if North Korea allowed inspections, Washington would cancel joint military exercises with South Korea and reaffirm that it would not introduce nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula.

HEADLINE: A Russian Tradition So Old It's Revolutionary: Trial by Jury

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 1

 BODY:
"It will be hard to change," admitted Judge Galina Zmicharovskaya, who presides in the Siberian region of Irkutsk. "I'm used to deciding on the evidence myself. But I'd like to try it."
Judge Zmicharovskaya and dozens of her colleagues from all over Russia are weighing what they've learned from a short course in a tradition long forgotten in this country: trial by jury. 
 The course, offered at the Russian Legal Academy here in the capital, is part of an effort by advocates of change in President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government to introduce jury trials in Russia -- as a symbol of human rights and as the best way to correct decades of judicial abuse.
"Under Stalin, there was the complete subordination of criminal procedure to Party rule," said Aleksandr Yakovlev, a professor at the Russian Academy of Science's Institute of State and Law. "The idea now is for the jury to guarantee the independence of the court."
 
Compulsory 'Civic Duty'
 The details hang on a bill now pending in Parliament, but the advocates say they hope to put juries in some criminal courtrooms in five of Russia's 88 regions, including suburban Moscow, by the end of the year. Jurors, chosen from voting rolls and paid a daily fee out of the Federal budget, will serve, if the defendant so chooses, in the mid-level courts that handle everything from robbery to the capital crime of murder.
Jurors must be at least 25 years old and free of criminal convictions. And jury service is to be compulsory. "It will be a civic duty," said Sergei Pashin, the young lawyer who heads the reform unit in the State Legal Agency and who is the project's chief architect.
The bill, expected to become law during the summer, also allows the 12 jurors to ask questions of witnesses as well as the defendant, and to reach a verdict via simple majority, rather than unanimously, if deliberations go beyond three hours. "It's not exactly like your jury trial," the 30-year-old Mr. Pashin told an American visitor. "But we have to go step by step."
 
2 Snarling Dogs and a Bike
 The classes at the Legal Academy are a start. On a recent Monday morning, about 50 Russian judges and law students crowded into a classroom to watch a jury at work, in a civil case involving an unattended auto yard, two snarling dogs and a man riding by on a bike.
The mock trial -- everything from the "all rise" to the jury charge -- was performed by a team of American judges and lawyers on a visit sponsored by the American State Department. The jurors were drawn from the Russian judges and lawyers in the audience. After deliberating for 90 minutes, they found for the defendant, rejecting the fallen bicyclist's charge of negligence and his request for damages of $500,000 (an amount so mind-boggling to the academy's interpreter that she twice asked for clarification).
"It was a good verdict, given the evidence," said Judge Judith Chirlin of Los Angeles County Superior Court, who presided over the case. (The real-life Los Angeles trial on which the drama was loosely based, she notes, ended with an award of about $175,000 to the plaintiff.)
The civil trial, requested by the academy in light of Russia's move toward a market economy, came a day after the American team walked their students through a typical criminal trial. That detailed discussion prompted a flurry of questions about evidence ("Why is hearsay not allowed as testimony?") and about the jury's role in evaluating it ("Does a defendant's good or bad character bear on the verdict?")
 
'Reconstruct the Mentality'
 Members of the Russian legal system have come to the United States, too, to learn about jury trials. In December, four Russians, including Mr. Pashin, came to Harvard University Law School for a two-week seminar with law professors, lawyers and jurors. The program was headed by Philip B. Heymann, who was then the director of the school's Center for Criminal Justice and is now the deputy Attorney General.
The Russians also went on field trips to Boston and Cambridge courtrooms. "They were fascinated by the jury creation process," said Carmen Ortiz of the Middlesex County Attorney's Office. "They asked, 'How do you make people come in for jury duty, and maybe give up two weeks of their time?' "
About 600 of Russia's 12,000 judges, mostly from the five designated regions, have completed jury training in Moscow. Besides mock trials, the training involves reading, lectures and practice sessions. "You can't make a good judge in a month," said Lev Khaldeyev, the program's dean. "But we try to reconstruct the mentality, the presumption that there's no need for evidence."
Under the lingering Soviet system, criminal cases are decided by a judge and two "lay assessors," whose compliance is almost guaranteed. Procurators, as prosecutors are called here, have broad investigative powers. As "supervisors of legality" in society, they have much sway with the judge.
 
Don't Always Show Up
 Often they do not even show up in court; they simply send in a dossier chronicling the case against the defendant. Despite recent changes, the defense lawyers, known as advocates, can do little more in court than chip away at the charge or the sentence. Conviction rates run to 99 percent.
"Defense attorneys feel they are up against the prosecutors and the judges here," said Aleksei P. Galoganov, a prominent advocate, in a recent talk with experts from the United Nations' Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch, here to assess legal reform. "As for presumption of innocence, we were taught it was a 'bourgeois' concept."
For Mr. Pashin and his team, jury trial is more than a short cut on the road to changing all this. It is the only road, given the legacy of Soviet justice. "The judge is thinking that the accused person is guilty," he said. "So we have to give the layman the right to be the judge." What's more, Mr. Pashin says, only juries can make lawyers, especially prosecutors, perform more professionally. "They will have to prove their indictments to independent people, who demand better evidence," he said. "Juries are a way to wake them up."
Some American experts caution that the Russians may be putting too much stock in the power of juries. "To look at the jury as a quick fix is an illusion," said Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee For Human Rights, a private group that works to promote human rights and has just published a report on legal reform in Russia. "It's a radical change that takes power out of the hands of the government, and that's a right instinct.
 
Pressure Can Be Unfair
 "But it must be brought in after an independent judiciary is in place," he said. "After all, if a juror is threatened or bribed, he has to have a legal system to stand up for him. To put all the pressure on 12 people to make up for a century of legal abuse is unfair."
Already, the Russian regions involved in the first planned phase of jury trial are complaining of limited resources, though their leaders support the idea of jury trial. Suburban Moscow authorities fear that their pretrial detention cells, already filled to four times their capacity as crime rises, will be taxed further by the longer jury trials. In Ryazan, about 180 miles southeast of Moscow, there aren't enough prosecutors, courtrooms, telephones or chairs. None of the regions yet have computers for jury selection or court-stenographic equipment.
But Mr. Pashin, who drafted the law that created Russia's Constitutional Court in 1991 and pushed through bills on the right of habeas corpus and the independence of the judiciary, is convinced that reforms will not work without juries. "Established democracies like America can afford to be disillusioned with jury trial," he says. "In our country, we have no other way to reform."
Juries are not new to Russia. They first appeared as part of the great legal reforms of 1864, shortly after Czar Alexander 2d abolished serfdom. The jury system gradually flourished over the next 50 years, producing lawyers like the legendary Fyodor Plevako, who became famous for brilliant courtroom speeches that acquitted hundreds of peasants and workers. "Historically, jury trial seems to go in parallel with the development of democracy here," said Mr. Yakovlev, a participant in the Assembly now drafting Russia's new Constitution, which will provide for juries.
Jury trial was banned by the Communists soon after they took power in 1917. "The Bolsheviks were full of praise for jury trials as long as they acquitted revolutionaries," Mr. Pashin said. "But when the Red Terror was unleashed, there was no place for trial by jury anymore."
 
Still a Hazy Concept
 For most Russian citizens today, trial by jury is a hazy concept, clarified only a bit by exposure to American crime movies. Few know about the planned reform, and some still feel that serious crimes like murder are better judged by legal experts. Many, though, express support for a system that puts justice in the hands of more than a few. "Jury trial is how many, 12? Then I'm for it," said a private chauffeur who regularly picks up fares for extra rubles near the Parliament. "It's a better way to get to the truth."
Mr. Khaldeyev of the Legal Academy likes to point out what happened at a mock jury trial presented by an American team last year in President Yeltsin's hometown, Yekaterinburg. "I had asked the American playing the prosecutor to act as one of our prosecutors would," Mr. Khaldeyev said. "So when he lost the case, he began to berate the judge." After a few minutes of repeated warnings, Mr. Khaldeyev says, the judge finally ruled the prosecutor in contempt of court. "His hammer came down, and he said, 'Five days in jail,' " he recalled gleefully. "And the audience, which was full of our judges, broke out in applause."

HEADLINE: Haitian Army Aide Sees Progress Toward Accord

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
Appearing to break a five-day deadlock in talks aimed at restoring democracy to Haiti, a spokesman for Haiti's army leader announced yesterday that the commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, was close to approving a settlement package proposed by United Nations mediators.
In an evening news conference after an intense afternoon of discussions on Governors Island, in New York Harbor, the spokesman, Serge E. Charles, called the plan "a good proposal." He added, "We don't see any reason why a solution cannot be reached soon." 
 Mr. Charles said the proposal called for the restoration of Haiti's elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, by Oct. 30. Mr. Charles said the settlement, once sealed, included the end of the international embargo on oil supplies for Haiti and the resumption of "technical and military aid to the country."
Shortly before 9 P.M., a United Nations spokesman said that an agreement with the Army was imminent, but that no further announcements would be immediately forthcoming. Journalists were asked to leave the island.
Minutes before Mr. Charles's announcement, officials in Washington said the Administration would request $37.5 million in aid for Haiti, to be made available immediately after a settlement, to help repair damage to the country's devastated economy and rehabilitate the 7,000-member Army.
Mr. Charles would not say explicity that General Cedras would step down immediately, as has been demanded by Father Aristide, but he told reporters, "We believe that the laws in our constitution will deal adequately with the question of the Army staff."
Mr. Charles, speaking in French, said that "if General Cedras's departure would contribute to a solution, he is ready to go."
Senior diplomats involved in the negotiations said the military delegation had all but accepted the United Nationsplan.
A member of Father Aristide's delegation, told of the Haitian military's response to the proposal, said that if it held up under examination, "it would be important, very important, and would move us significantly in the direction of something lasting."
The announcement by the Haitian military came after a day of apparent setbacks in which the delegation of Father Aristide angered United Nations officials by mentioning only two of the elements of the solution in briefings with reporters: the departure of General Cedras and the military high command, and the early return of the President. The two sides appeared to be sparring over dates for Father Aristide's return as President.
Dante Caputo of Argentina, the United Nations special envoy to Haiti who has led the talks, emerged from meetings in the early evening to tell reporters that the Aristide delegation had "distorted the equilibrium of the proposal and created risks and dangers."
 
Risk of a Backlash
 Later, diplomats said that by emphasizing the price the military had to pay, Father Aristide's aides were potentially inciting hard-line elements of the armed forces in Haiti and the most conservative elements of the business community to mobilize against an accord. Early yesterday, there were reports of mysterious bomb explosions in several neighborhoods of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.
Responding to the United Nations criticisms, one adviser to the President said, "We purposely, honestly tried to put the onus on the Army."
A senior diplomat who has played an active role in the talks said the apparent breakthrough, after five days of frustrating talks marked by advances followed by sudden setbacks and then long, sterile waits, was the product of a new negotiating strategy by Mr. Caputo.
Late yesterday, it was still unclear what form the international presence in Haiti would take after a settlement. Mr. Charles, General Cedras's spokesman, said the United Nations proposal no longer contained mention of an international police force, which had been a centerpiece of past efforts.

HEADLINE: Mandela to Hold Off Calling for an End to Sanctions

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela said today that despite some recent progress on talks over the transition to majority rule in South Africa, he is not yet able to make a much-anticipated call for a lifting of all sanctions against his country.
On his second day in the United States, Mr. Mandela said he might be able to make such an announcement within three weeks if talks with the white South African Government and other parties make sufficient advances on plans for establishing an interim government until elections next year. 
 But his comments disappointed many in the Clinton Administration and on Capitol Hill who had hoped that the negotiations would have made more progress by now. The American officials had anticipated that Mr. Mandela would take advantage of his visit to the United States, including two appearances with President Clinton, to make a dramatic announcement calling for the lifting of sanctions in the next few days.
 
U.S. Prepares Incentives
 The black nationalist leader, who is president of the African National Congress, explained that such an announcement continued to hinge on progress toward the creation of an interim government that would run South Africa until multiracial elections -- the first under universal suffrage -- take place next April.
One Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said American officials had prepared a package of incentives in anticipation of the simultaneous visits by Mr. Mandela and President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa, both of whom arrived in the United States on Wednesday.
Announcement of a package, including election assistance and help in obtaining foreign investments, will now not be made during their trip, the official said.
"Some elements of it will be in a presidential statement, saying that if we get a date for the election and the transitional executive councils we can push ahead on these things," the official said.
The Bush Administration lifted comprehensive Federal sanctions against South Africa last year, but many state and local restrictions continue.
 
New York City Sanctions
 New York City's sanctions, for example, bar city contracts and investments by municipal pension funds with banks and other companies that do business with South Africa. Mayor David N. Dinkins has indicated that he is prepared to seek the lifting of sanctions at Mr. Mandela's request.
The creation of a transitional government is being debated in constitutional talks in Johannesburg. Delegates there are expected Friday to ratify an April 27 date for the election, but with something short of full agreement by all parties in South Africa's political spectrum.
Mr. Mandela said today that he had been getting updates on the talks by telephone and that he had discussed the situation with Mr. de Klerk. The two leaders are scheduled to receive the Liberty Medal from Mr. Clinton in Philadelphia on Sunday, the Fourth of July.
After decades of campaigning for international sanctions against the white Government in South Africa, Mr. Mandela and the African National Congress are walking a fine line in seeking commitments for future investment in South Africa without asking for the lifting of sanctions before a black or multiracial government actually is established.
A key challenge for Mr. Mandela is to convince the international community that the era of apartheid -- legalized racial segregation -- is indeed ending.
 
Complications of Violence
 The question is not just one of semantics and timing. Many of the 29 states and more than 100 American cities that have adopted sanctions against South Africa said explicitly that they were not to be lifted until apartheid had ended.
Mr. Mandela's task is complicated by continuing violence in South Africa, including the recent storming of the constitutional talks by hundreds of armed white extremists who damaged the hall and roughed up some delegates and journalists.
Dumisani Kumalo, projects director for the New York-based Africa Fund, said the incident undermined both an end to sanctions and the inclination of businesses to invest in South Africa even if restrictions were lifted.
Mr. Mandela met with members of the House and Senate foreign relations committees today. On Friday, he is scheduled to meet separately with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Mr. Clinton.
Speaking after his meetings with committee members, Mr. Mandela said the African National Congress had at one point opposed lifting sanctions until after South Africa's Parliament ratified a transitional government.
The Parliament is not scheduled to resume until September. But Mr. Mandela said that, with an unemployment rate among blacks of 48 percent and a "rocketing" crime rate, the A.N.C. hopes to persuade other parties to adopt a transitional formula beforehand. He said Mr. de Klerk had assured him that Parliament would move quickly on the matter.
Mr. de Klerk meanwhile spent the day in private talks with leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which continue to bar assistance to South Africa. He also has meetings scheduled on Friday with Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher.

HEADLINE: New Mayor Faces Hard Part: Running Los Angeles

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 1

 BODY:
He's made all the right moves so far, cajoling legislators in Sacramento for money, jogging with President Clinton in Washington, riding in the gay-pride parade on Sunday and appointing a respected City Council aide as chief of staff.
Now the question is whether Richard J. Riordan, as Mayor, can rescue this city of fan palms and hibiscus blossoms from its slide into racial discord, criminal violence and economic despair. Will American urban salvation be found in the likes of this conservative 63-year-old Republican, a millionaire businessman who has never held elective office before? 
 The tall, ruddy Mr. Riordan, who was born in Queens, was sworn in today as the first Republican in a generation to lead what is now the second largest, most diverse and perhaps most problematic city in America.
"We must together create a will among all Angelenos to take back our neighborhoods," he said, standing on the south steps of City Hall before about 1,000 people. And, in an exhortation that reflected the gloom in Los Angeles, he urged Angelenos, "Don't lose heart."
 
Farewell to Bradley
 It was a festive occasion, almost as much an emotional farewell to Tom Bradley, who retired today after 20 years as Mayor, as a welcome to the new Mayor. But for now, at least, nearly all Angelenos are rallying around Mr. Riordan as this city's only chance.
"How could you not want him to succeed?" asked William G. Ouchi, a professor of management at the University of California at Los Angeles and an adviser to Mr. Riordan. "The stakes are too high. I, like others, have wondered whether L.A. suffers from some deep underlying disease that is incurable. But if you use the very considerable resources here, this place can be a place New Yorkers love to hate again."
Mr. Riordan's election victory over City Councilman Mike Woo, coming a year after the city's devastating riots, symbolized a growing frustration with liberal Democratic remedies for urban ills. He has pledged to expand police protection, contract out many government services to private business and improve the business climate.
 
City in Deep Trouble
 If he has been spared the partisan barbs that might be expected in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, that is because everyone here knows that Los Angeles is in big trouble, having cut the city work force by 10 percent over the last three years and facing what economic forecasters say are another two years of recession.
"Riordan's off to a good start," said said city Controller Rick Tuttle,' a Woo backer. "He has impressed me by his willingness to jump right in."
Mr. Riordan has taken pains to prove himself anything but a conservative ideologue. The chairman of his transition team was William Wardlaw, who headed Bill Clinton's California campaign. Another transition team member was J. Stanley Sanders, a black lawyer who was a losing candidate for Mayor in the April primary. In Washington, Mr. Riordan was greeted warmly last week by President Clinton, even though the President endorsed Mr. Woo.
Mr. Riordan's appointment of William McCarley, the chief legislative analyst at the City Council, as his chief of staff has won raves here as a sign that he means to work closely with the fractious 15-member Council. Mr. Sanders, who is overseeing appointments to the city's 32 boards and commissions for Mr. Riordan, said the new Mayor would not put a high priority on cultural diversity just for the sake of diversity when it comes to filling jobs.
"He may be the least political of recent mayors," Mr. Sanders said. "So reaching out in the traditional sense is probably not going to be as high a priority as you would think, not as high as economic development in South Central and joblessness. You will see a lot of different faces on boards, more businessmen and not nearly as many community activists.
"His No. 1 priority, which is central to his take as a businessman," Mr. Sanders said, "is public safety."
Indeed, in a move clearly meant to restore morale among the police force, Mr. Riordan on Wednesday appointed Bill Violante, president of the Police Protective League, the police union, as a deputy mayor. He also named two other deputy mayors, Michael Keeley, a law partner of Mr. Riordan's who is gay, and Jadine Nielsen, his campaign manager, who was an aide to former Senator Alan Cranston, a Democrat.
 
Dose of State Reality
 Mr. Riordan has already got a cold dose of reality. When he visited Sacramento, the state capital, two days after his June 8 victory to lobby Gov. Pete Wilson, a fellow Republican, and lawmakers against cuts in state money for the city, he came away stunned. He called the state fiscal process "infinitely more complicated and difficult than man could ever dream of."
And when he went to Washington, he got bad news from Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both Democrats, who told him that his main campaign pledge to raise money for 3,000 new police officers by leasing Los Angeles International Airport to a private operator would not pass Congress. But they agreed to help change Federal laws and rules to permit diversion of airport-generated revenue to city purposes other than the airport.
Returning to Los Angeles, Mr. Riordan pragmatically trimmed his jib. "I have not given up leasing the airport," he told reporters. "But, as I said during the election, I am not an ideologue. If we can find other ways to take money off the airport for police purposes, I have an open mind to that."
Mr. Riordan, whose father was president of the Stern Brothers department store in New York, moved to Los Angeles in 1956 as a young lawyer. He built a fortune here estimated at more than $100 million as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, reaping investments from high-tech computer and pharmaceutical companies and the toy concern, Mattel, among others. Though never a candidate before, he became an important power broker in Los Angeles and California, giving generously to Democrats and Republicans alike.
For now, Mr. Riordan is being welcomed at City Hall as fresh air.
"For a change, the city is getting some good press," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the influential chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee, who accompanied Mr. Riordan to Washington. Mr. Yaroslavsky had endorsed neither candidate. "We need to help Riordan succeed," he said. "This city is at a state now where ego and pride of authorship are no longer tolerable."
But he warned that Mr. Riordan would need patience, not his strongest suit, and would have to "recognize he is not the chairman of a company."
 
Pushing Privatization
 Mr. Riordan is an enthusiastic proponent of the privatization of garbage collection and other services, drawing heavily on the theories of the Reason Foundation, a Santa Monica libertarian group that argues for privatization of nearly all government services except police and courts.
"Having a city as large as Los Angeles, which has been so resistant to privatization now poised to at least seriously consider it is very exciting to us," said Robert W. Poole Jr., president of Reason.
In this, the Mayor will be fought by labor unions, and much of the traditional Democratic apparatus that still controls the City Council.
But Kelly Candaele, political representative of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which endorsed Mr. Woo, considers Mr. Riordan a pragmatist who will adjust to political realities. "He's got people around him who realize he is running a Democratic city with a Democratic council," Mr. Candaele said.
The Mayor's effectiveness will depend in good part on the extent that he can use his force of personality to make up for a city charter that gives him relatively little formal power.
"People say this is a weak-mayor system," Professor Ouchi said. "They have a big surprise coming. Strong leaders have great flexibility given weak structures."

HEADLINE: Flood Idles Barges on Mississippi, Raising Costs of Shipping Products

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 1

 BODY:
The flood-swollen Mississippi River will be closed to boat traffic for three more weeks or longer, causing tens of millions of dollars in losses to the shippers and companies that must find other, more expensive ways to move their products.
Some consumers could see higher prices in the weeks and months ahead on everything from grain to electricity because shipping costs are increasing and the cost of grain futures contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade have been rising as fast as the river. 
 A rise in the price of futures contracts strongly indicates that retail prices will increase. And barges loaded with coal are tethered at ports along the southern Mississippi River, unable to reach the coal-powered power-generating plants north of St. Louis.
A 500-mile stretch of the Mississippi between St. Louis and St. Paul remained closed to barge traffic today as the water continued to rise. The river is not expected to crest in Davenport, Iowa, until Saturday, said a spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers in Davenport. The crest is expected to reach 22.3 feet, but it could be higher, depending on rainfall.
 
Clinton to Visit
 In Washington, the White House announced today that President Clinton would tour eastern Iowa on Sunday on his way to Tokyo for an economic summit meeting. Mr. Clinton will visit Davenport with Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.
"It's a very, very serious thing for the farmers," Mr. Clinton said. "It's the most rain they've had in over 100 years."
The National Weather Service has predicted rain for the next five days for parts of the upper Midwest..
The Corps of Engineers reported Wednesday that it would take at least 20 to 25 days to reopen locks and dams along the upper Mississippi to barge traffic.
The companies that do business on the river are being hurt by the flood. Nearly 50 percent of the 2,000 barges and 30 towboats that the Archer Daniels Midland Company operates on the river are idle. A spokesman for the Decatur, Ill., company predicted that lost revenue from the idled barges would reach $20 million.
The American Commercial Barge Line Company, one of the largest barge operators on the river, said 300 of its barges and about 12 of its towboats had been tied up for safekeeping. As the flood waters move south, the number of barges that eventually are idled "will grow," said Norb Whitlock, the company's senior vice president.
The company loses about $300 each day that a barge is idled and must also pay out about $3,000 a day for crew salaries and the fuel to keep the barge generators operating.
Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis said it was incurring significant costs and lost revenue because 40 percent of its 600-barge fleet could not navigate the flooded river.
A Cargill spokeswoman said the time was fast approaching "when we'll have to decide on whether to use alternate methods of transportation" to move grain. Cargill loaded no barges Wednesday at its port in Savage, Minn., near St. Paul. Normally, four or five barges would be loaded, each with 50,000 bushels of grain.
The most likely alternatives for transportation are rail and trucking, but they cost at least $5 more per ton than barge shipping, said Mr. Whitlock of American Commercial Barge Line.
Some barges loaded with coal and cement are already waiting at docks along the southern Mississippi, unable to move north because of the flooding, Mr. Whitlock said.

HEADLINE: Remnant of Jobs Bill Approved in House

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Congress passed today what remained of President Clinton's jobs bill, 10 weeks after Senate Republicans killed a much larger version, which was then one of Mr. Clinton's top economic priorities.
The House vote was 280 to 138, mostly along party lines. The measure was sent to the Senate, which sent it to President Clinton on a voice vote. The votes came a day before the scheduled release of the June unemployment figures, which were expected to edge upward from May's 6.9 percent. 
 The bill contains about $1 billion for summer jobs, small-business loans and other programs Mr. Clinton had sought earlier this year in hopes of quickly helping the economy. The President had originally sought nearly $20 billion.
The Administration said its original bill would have created 500,000 jobs but gave no estimate for the smaller plan. Republicans argued that today's bill was loaded with wasteful projects.

HEADLINE: Parties Play Budget Game By Different Sets of Rules

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Call it the battle of the pie charts.
Having lost the budget battle in the Senate last week, the Republicans appear convinced that they will win the political war by using pie charts to argue that President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan would mean more than twice as much in tax increases as in spending cuts. 
 Worried by the Republican onslaught, the Administration has undertaken a counteroffensive. Wielding pie charts of its own, the Clinton team contends that its plan is evenly weighted between tax increases and spending cuts and that the Republicans are too cowardly to vote for tough deficit-reduction measures.
The debate is far more than academic. The Republicans want to tar Mr. Clinton with the label of tax-and-spend Democrat, an image he is struggling to avoid. The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, is already boasting that he will bludgeon the Democrats with the tax issue in the 1994 elections.
 
2 Teams, 2 Sets of Rules
 The debate often seems like a rugby scrum on a muddy field where the players cannot agree even on how to keep score. The two sides part company not only over the ratio of tax increases to spending cuts but also on the very size of the President's package. The Administration says the Medicare cuts, gasoline taxes, income tax increases and other measures passed by the Senate would pare the projected deficit in the Federal budget by $499 billion over the next five years; the Republicans put the figure at $380 billion.
As for the ratio, the Administration claims a virtual balance: $243 billion in higher taxes and $256 billion in spending cuts. The Republicans say the actual figures are $258 billion in tax increases and only $122 billion in spending cuts. That is a tax-to-cut ratio of 2.11 to 1, and the Republicans contend that the version of the package previously passed by the House is a good deal worse.
Although the debate is harsh, divisive and often confusing, there is a simple explanation for how the two sides arrive at estimates so vastly different. That explanation lies in varying definitions of spending reductions.
The Republicans say Mr. Clinton is up to some budgetary sleight of hand when he counts as spending cuts the increases that his package would impose in user fees; the savings that the plan claims in interest payments on the Federal debt, and some of the savings that were dictated by a budget accord that President George Bush struck with Congress in 1990.
So the Republican number crunchers subtract from the Administration's spending-cut estimate the $15 billion increase in user fees, the $55 billion savings in interest and the $44 billion savings resulting from the 1990 accord. The Republicans treat the user-fee increase as a tax increase instead, and do not count as deficit-reducers at all the savings from either the lower interest payments or the 1990 agreement.
When all three of these elements -- along with some lesser sums claimed by the Democrats but disputed by the Republicans -- are subtracted from the Administration's estimate of $256 billion in spending cuts, the result is the $122 billion figure that the Republicans put forth.
And if the $15 billion rise in user fees is treated not as a spending cut but as a tax increase, then the $243 billion in tax increases estimated by the Administration becomes the $258 billion estimated by the Republicans.
The Democrats call this kind of calculating hypocritical. They note that Mr. Clinton is treating user fees and interest savings in the same way the Bush Administration did. Further, they point out, although $44 billion in "new" savings result from the accord of 1990, the Bush Administration was never required to specify then, as Mr. Clinton is doing now, exactly which programs would be cut to realize those savings.
Which side is the more credible with regard to these three major budget issues?
USER FEES. The Administration says it can collect $15 billion over five years by raising the fees that Americans are charged for activities like logging and livestock grazing on Federal land and the use of inland waterways and national parks.
The Administration treats these fee increases as spending reductions because they would help offset certain outlays, for instance the Government's spending on national parks. The Republicans' position: User-fee increases are tax increases.
The director of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert D. Reischauer, a Democratic appointee whose role is to be a nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, said past Administrations had treated user fees differently from taxes.
When the Government taxes, it extracts resources from the public, he said. "But user fees are by and large payments for goods and services that the Government provides; by and large they are voluntary transactions," he said. "That's why they are treated on a different side of the ledger" from taxes.
INTEREST SAVINGS. The Administration says its budget would achieve the $55 billion saving in interest payments by holding down not only the buildup in the Federal debt but also, because the demand on the credit markets would be restrained, the interest rate on that debt. The Republicans counter by saying interest savings are not a direct result of any policy decision but instead largely a result of factors over which the Administration has little control, including low inflation.
Clinton aides call that argument disingenuous. They say the $55 billion is a direct result of the $444 billion they claim in other deficit reduction and is therefore a genuine cut. They also point to Bush Administration documents that counted interest savings as spending cuts in the 1990 budget agreement.
Mr. Reischauer's verdict: "The fact is, interest is an outlay of the Federal Government. And by commonly accepted definition, lower interest payments mean that spending will be lower."
SAVINGS FROM THE 1990 ACCORD. Since the Administration is taking credit for $44 billion in spending cuts mandated by a three-year-old agreement, the Republicans allege double-counting. But as the White House points out, neither Mr. Bush nor that earlier Congress had to make the politically painful decisions as to where those cuts would be made.
Mr. Reischauer's view: "This is a case of the glass is half-full or half-empty. It's true the $44 billion was agreed to in 1990, but it will be this Congress and this President who take the political heat. Nobody was ever voted out of office for capping expenditures in general in some future year."

HEADLINE: New GATT Chief Turns Up Heat

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 1

 BODY:
Declaring that "it is simply not good enough for international leaders to mouth good intentions about trade," Peter Sutherland became the world's top trade official today and said the core of a long-delayed world trade agreement must be hammered out in Tokyo next week.
In an interview here at the quaintly staid headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade just a few days before the Tokyo summit meeting of major industrialized nations, Mr. Sutherland, a 47-year-old Irish lawyer, immediately served notice that he would be as blunt and outspoken as his predecessor was mild and circumspect.
 
 
'Shoot From the Hip'
 "I am going to say it as it is, and shoot from the hip," Mr. Sutherland said, using language in sharp contrast to the chain-smoking Arthur Dunkel, his predecessor. Mr. Sutherland said he had twice rejected the job but took it this time after receiving assurances from trade officials -- including Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative -- that they want a GATT accord this year. 
 "I am taking this position having been led to believe that world leaders intend to conclude the Uruguay Round of trade talks by Dec. 15," Mr. Sutherland said. "For that target not to be utopian, we need a market access-agreement at the Tokyo summit."
Mr. Sutherland added: "If the summit fails -- and there are ominous signals right here on day one -- then the trade negotiations will become very difficult. It can't all be done on the back of an envelope on Dec. 14. Tokyo is an acid test."
In effect, the new GATT chief made it abundantly clear that both Mr. Kantor and the European Community's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, had promised him progress in Tokyo, and that he would feel double-crossed if this did not materialize.
"It is essential," he said, "that the United States, the community, Japan and Canada provide the launching pad for the takeoff of negotiations in Tokyo. Rhetoric about the importance of the Uruguay Round is not good enough. I am a facilitator. But I cannot facilitate a lack of will."
 
 
Goal: World Prosperity
 The last four economic summit meetings have all failed to advance the trade negotiations, which began in Uruguay in 1986. The talks are aimed not only at increasing world prosperity by lowering or removing tariffs and other trade barriers, but also at incorporating whole new areas of economic activity -- including services and intellectual property -- into GATT regulations to expand commerce in these areas.
To avoid a fifth, humiliating failure to advance the Uruguay Round at the summit meeting, trade officials from the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Community have been holding talks aimed at reaching a so-called market-access agreement that could be announced in Tokyo and would be an important part of an overall GATT accord.
The market-access talks aim to lower existing high tariffs on products like textiles, clothes and agricultural goods, eliminate tariffs altogether on some like pharmaceuticals and set out reciprocal arrangements in new GATT spheres like the protection of copyrights and the establishment of financial services in foreign markets.
But, apparently irked by America's threats to impose duties on European steel products, French officials have balked, saying no market-access agreement will be possible in Tokyo.
Their stand has flatly contradicted the message that emerged from trade talks in Paris in early June, when all parties was distinctly optimistic.
"I am extremely worried by the French attitude," Mr. Sutherland said. "If any one country is intent on bringing down the multilateral trading system, I'd be very surprised. But if there is such a country, it should say so." He added, however, that France was not alone in making difficulties.
 
 
Shaming World Leaders
 Mr. Sutherland -- whose abundantly direct style at times appeared close to shaming world leaders into finally honoring their trade promises -- said he was a passionate believer in open trading systems because he viewed the alternative as "a return to the darker pages of our history."
"I have given up an entire career," he said, referring to his decision to leave his position as chairman of Allied Irish Banks in order to take the GATT director general post, "because I wanted, so to speak, to put my money where my mouth is. I intend to make sure that others -- and I mean world leaders -- do the same."
Turning to recent claims by President Francois Mitterrand and other French politicians that the developed world cannot trade openly with developing countries that use cheap labor, offer no social security and pollute the environment, Mr. Sutherland said he saw such talk as veiled protectionism.
"Protectionism is a recipe for making Europe an industrial graveyard, a museum piece, paralyzed by inefficiencies," he declared. "Look at the failure of the industries we've tried to protect -- steel and shipyards. It's a basic fact that open trade has been positive for the world. The Uruguay Round cannot, at this stage, start trying to impose social and environmental legislation on developing countries."
Cracking his fingers in apparent agitation, Mr. Sutherland added: "It's time to stop pointing fingers and seeking excuses. The alternative to open multilateral trade could be terrible rifts both within the developed world, and between the developed world and developing counties."

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the Forests;
Clinton Plan Shifts Emphasis From Logging But Does Not Create Off-Limits Wilderness

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 1

 BODY:
he plan that President Clinton announced today to bring peace, jobs and a degree of protection to the ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest will not end the decade-long civil war in the woods here.
But the plan does signal a historic shift in the way the Federal Government will manage more than 23 million acres of public forests in America's timber basket. Logging will no longer dominate decisions, with the number of trees cut reduced by more than two-thirds from its highest levels. At the same time, there also will not be any large formal wilderness areas, which would be off-limits to anything but light-footed visits by man. 
 Mr. Clinton's program also calls for about $1.2 billion in aid for displaced workers and economic development.
Amid the predictable chorus of criticism from both sides, and an extraordinary shouting match between Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, the plan is viewed as somewhat of a curiosity by those who live and work in the woods. Some workers see in it the outline of a painful, but at least predictable, future.
 
'It's Up to the Marketplace'
 "In the short-term, this looks like a significant amount of timber for us," said Robert Cugini, a third-generation mill owner in Renton, Wash., just outside of Seattle.
When Mr. Cugini's father took over the family timber operation, there were 15 sawmills in the Seattle area. Now there is only one: his Barbee Mill. And he said the President's plan should allow him to stay open. "Beyond that, it's up to the marketplace," he said.
As outlined by the President, the plan would set aside about seven million acres of old-growth reserves, or about 80 percent of the nation's remaining ancient forests, with some limited logging in those areas. The reserves would not be straight lines on a map, or formal wilderness areas, but would be set up to protect streams and watersheds, primarily those with salmon. If fish return to these streams in significant numbers, it could help the sagging Northwest fishing industry, Administration officials said.
Ten areas, ranging from 80,000 to 380,000 acres each, would be set up as experimental logging areas. The Forest Service has already announced that it is phasing out clear-cutting, in which all trees in a given area are leveled. In the experimental areas, logging would be selective.
The rest of the timber would come from lands where species are not threatened. The total cut would be about 1.2 billion board feet a year. In the 1980's, the Forest Service allowed nearly 5 billion board feet to be cut.
The White House, boxed in by environmental laws that are politically difficult to change, has chosen to try to fix what is most valuable in the forests -- the salmon streams and watersheds -- and let scientists experiment with how to allow logging in other areas without damaging the ecology.
All this will make for a new day at the Forest Service, which has managed the public woodlands with timber industry's best interests at heart.
But it is not the new era Mr. Clinton had in mind. The President was forced to accept a plan that he clearly did not like and that infuriated Mr. Foley, who has long guided Northwest forest decisions with behind-the-scenes power and a tilt toward the industry.
"I finally had to tell the President that this is the best we can do," Mr. Babbitt said in an interview.
The President was under pressure from Mr. Foley, who said he was shocked by how low the projected timber harvest would be. In the past Mr. Foley -- whose district includes the huge Colville National Forest, which is not subject to spotted owl restrictions -- had been able to see that forest plans were more to his liking.
But not this time. An 11th-hour effort by Mr. Foley to get more logging in the plan broke down into an hour-long shouting match with Mr. Babbitt on Monday.
"The meeting was extremely intense," Mr. Babbitt said. "The Speaker was very candid. He said: 'This is an unbalanced result. A bad result. And I'm just very unhappy with it.' I told him that the President cannot duck this decision."
 
Lawmakers Plot Strategy
 Most of the plan will not need Congressional approval, Administration officials said. But Mr. Foley is now hinting that he may try to change the Endangered Species Act, which would put him in conflict with most Democrats in Congress.
Mr. Babbitt told the President there was no other choice unless the Forest Service wanted to be tied up in a court fight for two years. Virtually all logging in Federally managed forests in the Northwest has been off-limits because of court injunctions on behalf of endangered species.
Had the Administration allowed logging to return to anything near the levels of the last decade, it could have faced dozens of lawsuits to protect species that are disappearing as the forest is logged.
The plan is not the win-win compromise that the President had promised in the campaign. Owls and loggers could live with each other, he had said.
What has driven Federal forest management more than anything for three years have been the rulings of Judge William Dwyer of Federal District Court in Seattle. He has ruled that past timber-cutting levels were "a remarkable series of violations of environmental laws."
The Clinton plan will be presented to the judge next week, with the hope by the Administration that he will lift the injunctions and allow logging to resume.
"The real question for us is whether this is enough to get timber into the mills," said Mr. Cugini, who has 80 employees at his Barbee Mill.
Timber prices have fallen considerably in recent weeks, after a run-up earlier in the year. The Federal forests of the Northwest provide about 10 percent of the building lumber produced in this country.
The Administration plans to provide $1.2 billion in economic assistance over the next five years to depressed timber communities. The money, most of which would come from existing Forest Service and Interior Department budgets, would be used to provide new jobs in forest restoration, for retraining loggers and for schools, roads and community centers in areas hit hardest by the reductions.
The Administration estimates about 6,000 jobs would be lost. When paired with the economic package, it would work out to better than $200,000 a lost job.
The timber economy of the Northwest has been retracting for 20 years, but the decline has accelerated with spotted owl restrictions. In 1990, there were 145,000 people working in the Northwest forest products industry. Two years later that number was down to 125,000.
With this plan, the Administration says it can stop the slide of job loss and set up a sustainable forest economy, but many timber workers are suspicious, if not openly hostile.
"I've seen the ups and downs," said Lonnie Matter, who works at the Barbee Mill, "but I've never seen it this bad."

HEADLINE: Purchasing Managers Report a Drop for June

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
The spate of weak economic numbers continued today as the nation's purchasing managers reported that their industrial index skidded in June to under 50 percent, the dividing line between expansion and contraction. It was the lowest reading in 18 months.
Meanwhile, outlays for construction were reported to have edged up a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in May, which analysts considered disappointing, and confidence among top business executives ebbed. 
 The only bit of upbeat news was that 11,000 fewer people made first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week, a development that fanned some hopes that the June unemployment data to be published Friday would be encouraging. Expectations were that payrolls expanded by perhaps 150,000 while the unemployment rate remained close to May's 6.9 percent.
 
 
Fresh Concerns
 But the sharp decline in the purchasing managers' index, to 48.3 percent from 51.1, attracted the bulk of today's attention. This prompted fresh expressions of concern about the durability of the business expansion, which has been officially under way for more than two years but has been below normal and, in some sectors, hard to even detect.
"The desired improvement in new orders failed to materialize in June, resulting in a decline in the manufacturing sector and a dismal conclusion to the second quarter," said Robert J. Bretz, director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. and chairman of the National Association of Purchasing Management's business survey committee.
Only eight of 20 industries reported June growth greater than May's, and the weakness was reflected in lower employment and production as well as the slump in orders.
"It's pretty compelling evidence that there's not much sign of life in the manufacturing sector," commented Richard B. Berner, chief economist for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. He called the situation disappointing in light of interest rates that have tumbled.
 
 
Clinton Budget Cited
 One common explanation, of course, is that the Clinton Administration's budget legislation and still-developing health-care program is prompting employers to avoid making new investment or hiring commitments.
Mr. Bretz guessed that while many corporate decision-makers "don't like" the Clinton budget, which is heavy on tax increases and may be unrealistic about spending cuts, companies could be cutting back more than will prove necessary.
Whether significant deficit reduction will actually be achieved was one of the main points of contention at a meeting early this week of an 11-member economic advisory committee of the American Bankers Association.
Despite the parade of mostly poor June statistics, however, the panel projected a 3 percent rate of growth in the third and fourth quarters of the year. This would be markedly better than the first-half pace, which was marked by a slim seven-tenths of 1 percent January-March gain followed by a gain of probably less than 2 percent for the second quarter that ended Wednesday.
Low interest rates, lively motor-vehicle sales and robust capital spending should keep driving the economy forward, the panel contended.
 
 
New Orders
 The decline in the purchasing managers' index, to the lowest point since December 1991, was the fourth in the last five months after the index rose without interruption from October through January, the association's report showed. The new orders component, accounting for 30 percent of the index, fell even more steeply, to 49 percent in June from 53.5 in May, and was the lowest reading since September 1992.
Employment in factories fell once again -- and at the most rapid clip since early last year -- and even the pharmaceutical industry, which kept adding jobs through the latest recession, has now begun "downsizing," the group found.
The Commerce Department's construction report for May showed a one-tenth of 1 percent advance, but the pickup was entirely in the nonresidential sector, which had plunged nearly twice that much in April. Spending on new homes fell four-tenths of 1 percent, consistent with recent reports of poor starts and sales.
The Conference Board, which earlier this week reported a second straight decline in consumer confidence for June, said today that its quarterly gauge of executive confidence dropped nine points, to 57. While this was the lowest since late 1991, by historic standards business confidence remains "fairly high," the organization said.
First-time applicants for state unemployment benefits numbered 340,000 last week, down from 351,000 in the week ended June 19, the Labor Department reported. This decline, which followed two increases, helped nudge the four-week moving average down by 1,750, to 344,750.
A total of 33 states and territories had lower regular claims for the week ended June 19, with New York and Tennessee posting the biggest declines, more than 2,000 each. The biggest increase, 4,436 claims, was in Illinois.

HEADLINE: Police Detail Confession of L.I. Murder Suspect

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGDALE, L.I., July 1

 BODY:
In their first detailed account of the confession of Joel Rifkin, the New York State police said today that it was hours into their interrogation before he hinted that he had killed many more women than the one found in the back of his pickup truck.
For hours after his arrest early Monday, Mr. Rifkin sat in the state police barracks here, talking to a senior investigator, C. Thomas Capers, and others about that decomposing body, said Thomas A. Constantine, the superintendent of the state police. The case seemed bizarre but not extraordinary. In fact, investigators thought they were dealing with, as one top official put it, "just a one-person homicide." 
 And then, shortly after 12:30 P.M. -- with a crowd of reporters gathering outside the barracks for a news conference about the discovery of the body in the truck -- Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, began talking about more bodies. And more bodies. And more bodies.
 
After the Revelations
 "He suddenly opened up," Mr. Constantine said of the man who the authorities say confessed that afternoon to killing 17 women. "Until then, the focus had been on the one body in the car."
In a telephone interview today, Superintendent Constantine talked about the sequence of events in the barracks that precipitated one of the most extensive murder investigations in state police history. He also described the mobilization that followed Mr. Rifkin's revelations, a 24-hour period in which teams of state police investigators who had worked on other mass-murder cases were dispatched to Long Island, and state computer experts engaged to begin drawing links between open murder cases in the metropolitan area and the astonishing claims of the mild-mannered suspect. For the state police, whose image has been tarnished by an evidence-tampering scandal upstate, the confession has given the agency a starring role in a public drama that is being covered intensively by the media and monitored closely by other law-enforcement agencies involved in the case.
In the last few days, however, some of the agency's tactics and decisions have been criticized, notably the failure to videotape the interrogation or to obtain a signed confession, an omission that has been criticized by some police officials and prosecutors.
Robert Sale, the lawyer for Mr. Rikin, questioned the public way the state police are conducting their investigation.
"It wouldn't surprise me," Mr. Sale said today, "that if Amelia Earhart washed up on Coney Island, an effort was made to connect her to Joel Rifkin." In addition, Mr. Sale said he could not rule out the possibility of challenging the admissibility of the confession and whether Mr. Rifkin's Miranda rights were properly read to him.
On Wednesday, Capt. Walter Heesch, who is heading the state police investigation, said that "based on the things that were available to us at the time, we didn't do it," referring to the lack of a recorded statement.
The comments of Mr. Constantine -- whose agency is spearheading the inquiry into Mr. Rifkin's claims -- cast doubt on speculation that Mr. Rifkin had hoped to be captured and thus prevented from killing again. The suspect, who is charged with one count of second-degree murder, was stopped by troopers just after 3 A.M. on Monday. He was stopped for failing to have license plates on his pickup, the police said.
 
Those Identified, and Found
 Indeed, the Superintendent's account suggested that it was the trusting relationship that developed between Investigator Capers and Mr. Rifkin that led to the confessions.
As of today, state police officials said that they had the identities of 17 people whose names were taken from driver's licenses, credit cards and other forms of identification found among the articles seized this week from the bedroom of Mr. Rifkin's house in East Meadow. Of that number, they said, three people have been identified as possible victims, while three others have been contacted and found to be alive.
State police officials said they were linking Mr. Rifkin to the murders of 13 women, including eight whose bodies were found in New York City, two in Suffolk County and one each in Nassau, Putnam and Orange Counties. Except for two bodies found on Tuesday, one near Kennedy International Airport and the other in the Hamptons, and the body found in the pickup, all the other victims had been found months or even years before Mr. Rifkin's arrest, and their cases had languished, unconnected and unsolved.
The newest addition to the list of those suspected of being Mr. Rifkin's victims was a woman whose body was found in a cardboard box floating in the Hudson River off Pier 45 at West 10th Street on July 14, 1991. The New York City police identified her as Barbara M. Jacobs, 19, of 2 St. Marks Place in the East Village.
Additionally, the New York authorities said they were looking at a New Jersey case as possibly being connected to Mr. Rifkin. In recent days, the New Jersey State police have been saying they were seeking to learn whether Mr. Rifkin was involved in the death of a woman with the tattoo of a tiger on her thigh. Her body was found in Warren County.
Some state police officials say that the troopers' suspicions about Mr. Rifkin had been raised almost from the moment he was arrested. "We were aware from the initial moment from his character and profile there was more to look for than the initial crime," Lieut. Eugene Corcoran, one of the supervisors on Long Island of the investigation, said today.
But Mr. Constantine said it was many hours into the interrogation of Mr. Rifkin before the discussion escalated to talk of more than one body.
He was in police custody for about 12 hours before his lawyer, Mr. Sale, called by Mr. Rifkin's family through an intermediary, ordered the questioning stopped.
 
Asking the Right Question
 Superintendent Constantine said that with reporters waiting just a few yards outside the doors to the barracks, Investigators Capers had to decide whether to try to draw the suspect out slowly, case by case, or glean as much as he possibly could about the scope of his confession before word leaked to the press.
"He had a choice," Superintendent Constantine said in the interview today, "and he opted to get as much as he could, to get all he would talk about as quickly as he could."
Lieutenant Corcoran said that it was a matter of asking Mr. Rifkin the right question. "We asked if there was anything else he wanted to tell us and he described the other 16 crimes he committed," he said.
A news conference originally scheduled for about 1 P.M. was pushed back later and later in the day. By about 3:30 P.M., rumors began to circulate among the reporters at the barracks that the case involved mass murder.
Mr. Sale, the lawyer, said he was contacted about the case at 3:30 or 3:40 P.M., about 12 hours after Mr. Rifkin's arrest. About 20 minutes later, he called the authorities. "The police were called by me at approximately 4 o'clock and advised that there was to be zero further questioning," he said. State police officials said they immediately complied.

HEADLINE: For 5 Regents Graduates, Goals Delayed, and Reached;
Academic Elite of a Poor Bronx High School, 5 Years Later, Tell of the Roads They Traveled

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Five years ago, the 270 graduates of Theodore Roosevelt High School packed the auditorium of Lehman College for commencement. Every other word sounded like "success" and "destiny" as cameras clicked and families grinned. It was so hot that day, June 24, 1988, that some of the girls wore bikinis under their flowing white robes, anticipating a later celebration on the beach.
Among the graduates from this poor Bronx neighborhood where just finishing school was a big deal were 26 young people who received Regents diplomas, the school system's certificate of academic achievement. They included the valedictorian, Marcia Morgan, an aspiring physician whose family came from Jamaica, and Arnold Arias, a quiet Dominican who hung out with a group of guys who called themselves The Lost Boys. 
 In the years since, the two have led very different lives. Ms. Morgan just received her bachelor's degree in biomedicine and is preparing for medical school. After a dark journey through the Navy, a handful of clerical jobs and two suicide attempts, Mr. Arias is unemployed and hoping finally to begin college full-time in the fall.
Their stories vividly illustrate the obstacles faced by inner-city students all over America, the children of communities where many people cannot see a clear connection between school and later success. And they offer a vision of a way out, too, of the triumphs possible with the help of special programs and caring people.
 
Depression and Uncertainty
 The conventional wisdom of most middle-class Americans is that education is the route out of poverty, but the academically elite Roosevelt graduates say that it is not so simple. They saw many a potential doctor or teacher felled by street violence, low expectations, family troubles, a lack of role models or knowledge about getting financial aid or good jobs.
Ms. Morgan had much of what Mr. Arias lacked -- family support, clear goals, inner strength, mentors and role models found in programs for minority students interested in health care.
Mr. Arias, 23, was bedeviled by clinical depression, a troubled family that relied on welfare, and uncertainty about what concrete steps he needed to take to escape the chaos around him.
"None of us were too sure what would happen or where we wanted to go," Mr. Arias said. "I saw my neighborhood as a bunch of losers -- crackheads, people hanging in the streets. I wanted more; I deserved more. I just wasn't sure of how to go about it."
Some of the others among the academic elite that day tell similar tales. They include Zuzet Menendez, a bubbly 22-year-old woman whose family had fled Cuba; Ruble Hastu, 22, whose family came to New York from Guyana, and Jeanette Cotto, who learned English at age 9 after her single mother moved the family from Puerto Rico. Their special diplomas signified that they had passed Regents exams in a variety of subjects and taken a course load above the state minimum requirements.
Ms. Cotto, 22, now entering her junior year as a Spanish major at Hunter College, was forced to take time off from school to care for her ailing mother. Ms. Menendez, who has a bachelor's degree in communications and Spanish from the State University of New York at Cortland, is a corporate communications student at Ithaca College. Mr. Hastu, who figured the Army was the best way out of the Bronx, hooks patients up to dialysis machines in a New Jersey hospital. He dreams of being a nurse.
"I always knew I wanted to go to college," Ms. Menendez said, "but a lot of other people I knew who were just as smart never believed they would go anywhere so they never acted like they would."
 
Studious, and an Outsider
 Roosevelt had a bad reputation. In 1984 -- the year that most of the Regents graduates were freshmen -- one in four Roosevelt students quit school, fewer than one in seven graduated within four years, and almost one-third had limited proficiency in English. The neighborhood was such, Ms. Cotto recalled, that to be studious was to be labeled an outsider.
"Only two people in the building where I live graduated from high school," said Ms. Cotto, whose impoverished mother had little education. "They didn't call me a nerd, but they didn't want to be around me."
What made the difference for both Ms. Cotto, Ms. Menendez and Ms. Morgan was caring teachers and family support, especially from older siblings who encouraged them to stay in school or who set an example themselves by work or study.
"My parents have always instilled certain values in me," the 21-year-old Ms. Morgan said. "That you're unique; that there's something out there for everyone and you have to make up your mind to go for it."
 
A Troubled Journey
 Arnold Arias found himself lost almost from the beginning.
Mr. Arias, whose mother grew up "dirt poor" and with a second-grade education, came here from the Dominican Republic when John F. Kennedy was President and the country was awash in prosperity and promise. A divorced mother on welfare, she was simply not able to show her four children a better way, Mr. Arias said.
Mr. Arias's older brother ran the streets, teasing him about his bookish ways, he said. He took home excellent report cards, but his mother never saw them as his way out of their hand-to-mouth existence. Instead, he escaped by watching seven or eight hours of television a night.
He did not identify a career goal at Roosevelt, so he was passed over by counselors and teachers. He did not take part in extracurricular activities. Except for a 12th-grade gym teacher who asked what he wanted to do with his life, Mr. Arias said that no one at the school gave him information about college applications or questioned his aspirations. Because he was quiet and had good grades, no one knew that he was troubled.
"I wanted to go into the service," he said of his decision to go into the Navy. "People told you what to do."
Navy life only lasted four months after Mr. Arias was shipped out to San Diego. Navy officials failed to keep their promises about sending him to school and promoting him, he said. After his honorable discharge, Mr. Arias got a job as a mail clerk and began seeing a therapist. He tried to kill himself twice and was hospitalized for several weeks.
Mr. Arias slowly recovered and began to return to his dream of academic success. He garnered credits in data processing at Bronx Community College and spent one semester at the State University in Albany. He plans to enroll as a psychology major at Lehman College in September.
If there was one thing Marcia Morgan had, it was people. Her parents, who sent her to a strict private school in the verdant little Jamaican town of Manchester, made it clear that they would help their oldest child reach her goal. Ms. Morgan, a tall woman with beautifully clear skin and expressive eyes, decided she wanted to be a doctor when she around 7 years old after her mother was briefly hospitalized.
In her senior year, Ms. Morgan participated in a program called Bridge to Medicine. For three hours, five days a week, she took college-level courses in chemistry, calculus and English literature at City College.
Ms. Morgan said that she eventually hopes to work somewhere like Harlem Hospital, where she can make a difference.
"A lot of kids aren't encouraged to make it," Ms. Morgan said. "A lot of teachers don't care. Most of the homes I know are broken, so it is very important for the schools to take the responsibility to say how important education is."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Vital for Mexico's Leader

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 1

 BODY:
Jan. 1 has become a do-or-die date for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, and nothing -- not fence-sitting by American Congressmen, high Mexican interest rates or a United States judge's ruling that could threaten the North American Free Trade Agreement -- has weakened his pledge to have the pact in place on that day.
That stiff-necked attitude shows just how vital a role the accord plays in his attempt to transform Mexico. In many ways, he has staked the judgment of history on timely approval of the agreement. 
 The expectation that the accord will be in place by the first day of next year has also become the touchstone of Mexico's economic and political policies. Defeat of the agreement on Capitol Hill, or even a delay, is now likely to cast a shadow of doubt over the ability of Mexico to maintain momentum for its broad economic reforms, and even on the outcome of next year's presidential elections.
"This could underscore just how fragile Mexico's whole economic and political balance actually is," said Denise Dresser, a professor of political science at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.
The surprise ruling on Wednesday by Judge Charles R. Richey of Federal District Court, which required an environmental statement on the free trade pact, sent the Mexican stock market down 30 points, or nearly 2 percent, on Wednesday as big stocks like Telefonos de Mexico lost about 3 percent of their value.
Today, the market staged a weak rally, advancing 1.46 points. In New York, Telmex American depository receipts actually rose 25 cents to close at $47 a share, the third-busiest issue on the Big Board.
Despite the concern and the market's slide, some analysts in Mexico and the United States, including John F. H. Purcell of Salomon Brothers, doubted that the ruling would impede the progress of the accord.
Mr. Salinas is on a tour of southern Mexico and has not made any public statement. His Commerce Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, in a news conference on Wednesday, basically ignored the ruling, saying the negotiations on side agreements concerning labor and environmental issues would continue, and that there was no need for a contingency plan because the agreement would be in place by Jan. 1.
While they clearly have the most at stake in the pact's future, Mexican officials are virtually powerless to do anything but note publicly that Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, has said that he is confident the court ruling can be quickly overturned on appeal, and that Congress can consider the pact in September.
Of course, Mr. Salinas's Government has had to maintain the promise of the free trade pact with the United States and Canada to keep foreign capital flowing here, though that has been costly. To push inflation down to around 10 percent, the economy has slowed and unemployment has risen.
It was expected that once the agreement was passed, Mr. Salinas would find it easier to undertake a peso devaluation that many analysts have predicted because foreign capital would be flowing easily. He was also expected to loosen fiscal restraints and pump money into social programs in the last year of his administration.
After his own near-defeat in 1988, Mr. Salinas and his Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico for more than 60 years, consider next year's election critical. Under the Mexican system, Mr. Salinas personaly selects his party's presidential candidate, which until 1988 has meant without qualification that the president picks his successor.
By custom, the president does this in November or early December of his next-to-last year in office. But Mr. Salinas, now in his fifth year, had been expected to hold off until the agreement was certain, so that the state party candidate would not be hurt by any uncertainty stemming from a pact still up in the air.
Now it appears he will have to make his choice without knowing the agreement's fate, leaving the opposition a potentially serious opening.

Price on Treasury Long Bond Falls

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond slipped yesterday as soaring prices of gold and other commodities briefly reignited fears of inflation.
But prices for short-term Treasury securities rose on speculation that today's employment data would be weaker than expected. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 3/32 point, or 94 cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.68 percent, from late Wednesday's 6.67 percent.
Short-term Treasury prices rose 1/16, and intermediate maturities rose 1/16 point to 3/32 point, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.03 percent as the discount rate dropped three-tenths of a percent, to 2.98 percent. Six-month yields fell to 3.18 percent as the discount fell two-tenths of a percent, to 3.10 percent. One-year yields dropped to 3.39 percent as the discount rate fell four-tenths of a percent, to 3.27 percent.
 
 
Manufacturing Weakness
 Traders partly attributed the advance in short-term prices to news of weakness in the manufacturing sector.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index fell to 48.3 percent in June from 51.1 percent in May, indicating a contraction in manufacturing.
"People were expecting a reading between 50 and 51," said Jason Franklin, a trader at Prudential Securities Inc.
The weaker number suggests there will be less pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates to combat inflation, said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Capital Markets. Higher interest rates, which can be a drag on economic growth, erode the value of already-sold fixed-income securities.
Remarks at a Senate Banking Committee hearing added to sentiment that the Fed, which reportedly leaned toward a tighter monetary policy at its policy meeting in mid-May, would be hard pressed to raise interest rates.
Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he was concerned about the dampening effect President Clinton's deficit reduction program would have on economic growth. He said the Fed should compensate by keeping interest rates low.
 
 
Employment Expectations
 The employment data for June, due out this morning, were expected to further expectations that the economy was growing only sluggishly. A consensus of economists calls for an increase in nonfarm payroll jobs of 125,000 to 140,000. But many economists have reduced their forecasts following the recent accumulation of data showing weakness during the month.
Meanwhile, a spurt of $9 an ounce in gold prices touched off some selling of long-term bonds and pushed prices down. Gold is considered a hedge against inflation.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.26, to 1,306.97.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 3 3/8 percent, down from 3 1/2 percent late Wednesday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 102 17/32, up 1/32 from late Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was 5.72 percent, down from 5.76 percent.

The President's Logging Plan Finds Its Fans on Wall Street.

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
HAVE stocks of companies in the wood and paper business finally hit the rebound? Or will prices start sinking again faster than investors can yell "timber"?
Those questions were raised yesterday when President Clinton disclosed a plan to reduce logging on Federal lands to meet environmental concerns. Timber companies groaned with dismay, saying the plan would harm the industry. But on Wall Street, investors cheered, giving shares in most paper and forest companies a sharp boost. 
 That split decision underscores the steel nerves it will take to invest in the paper and forest products business for the near term. It is an investment that could prove immensely profitable, but only for investors willing to hold tight on what is sure to be a wild ride.
The investment issues begin with a simple primer in the laws of supply and demand. Under the Clinton plan, the average annual timber sale from Western national forests would be cut to about a third of the booming levels of the mid-1980's. Investors recognized the sharp cutback would likely drive up lumber prices -- the most important element in the industry's profitability.
And so the run-up began. On a day when the Standard & Poor's 500 was down a bit, the S.& P. paper and forest product group rose more than 15 points to close at 875.63. Even companies with little business in Federal forests in the Pacific Northwest rose, in anticipation of a firming of lumber prices industrywide. Among the biggest winners in the group were Georgia Pacific, which rose $2.625 to close at $61 a share; the Weyerhaeuser Company, which climbed $1.375 to close at $44 a share, and Louisiana Pacific, which rose 75 cents to close at $32.75.
Investors would seem to have good reason to make a dash for the timber-related stocks. Lumber prices have tumbled more than 40 percent since the record highs in March after a speculated housing boom failed to materialize -- and the stocks of paper and forest product companies went right along with them.
But some investors may have overlooked a critical fact: Nothing has changed on the demand side of the equation. And that is where these companies face big challenges.
"The biggest concern for these stocks is not on the supply side," said Michael Bowyer, an industry analyst with Duff & Phelps. "The most important factor underlying what price these stocks should have is happening on the demand side."
With new-home sales and housing starts falling, the demand for wood products has been slackening significantly, and analysts say they expect results for the timber industry in the second quarter to be far below those of the first.
"There is not enough demand in this economy at present to push even the constricted supplies," said Curt Cunningham, president of Pacific Futures in Seattle.
And, even with the apparent cutback in production under Mr. Clinton's proposal, the timber industry could well see a spurt in production if it met the planned limit of average annual timber sales. The Clinton plan would allow for an annual production average of 1.2 billion board feet over the next decade for Northwest national forests. But timber production from those forests this year is expected to be an anemic 600 million board feet, because environmental lawsuits have blocked the Government from awarding new logging contracts in the area for two years.
"If the President gets his proposals through, as they are currently presented, we might have more timber available for harvest than in the last three years," Mr. Cunningham said.
That prospect was reflected in the futures trading of lumber yesterday. After opening at $274.80, up almost $10, the contracts plummeted in price, closing at $265.60, up only 80 cents from the previous day.
The bottom line for investors: put aside supply. When the economy seems as if it's picking up, paper and forest products will be a good long-term bet -- but expect some sleepless nights.

Prices of Precious Metals Surge on Inflation Concerns

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals futures prices surged to their highest point in nearly three years on New York's Commodity Exchange yesterday on fears of inflation.
On other commodities markets, energy futures fell, grains and soybeans continued higher, copper futures advanced, pork futures rose and beef prices slipped. 
 Metals analysts said announcements from the central banks of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands that they would cut interest rates could signal increased inflation abroad.
 
 
'A Little Less Concerned'
 "The mind-set of Europeans now is perhaps the central banks are going to be a little less concerned about controlling inflation as they try to bolster their flagging economies," said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in Weehawken, N.J.
Early weakness in the United States dollar and technical factors touched off wide buying of all the metals, including palladium and platinum.
Gold for delivery in August rose $9, to $388.20 an ounce; July silver gained 21.3 cents, to $4.771 an ounce. July platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange advanced $8.30, to $394.30 an ounce; September palladium rose $2.80, to $140.20 an ounce.
Energy futures contracts sank on the New York Mercantile Exchange after traders misinterpreted remarks made by Madeleine Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, about the one-time sale of Iraqi oil.
She was reiterating an American position to let oil be sold for Iraq to purchase humanitarian supplies, but traders believed the remark signaled new United States willingness to lift a ban on Iraqi oil sales and flood an already burdened market. Light sweet crude oil for August was 40 cents lower at $18.45 a barrel.
 
 
Government Report
 On the Chicago Board of Trade, investors shrugged off a daunting Government report and lifted soybeans futures prices back to three-year highs achieved a day earlier. Wheat surged to six-week highs and corn futures also gained.
Rainy weather and its resulting threat to crops in the Midwest proved more important than the Agriculture Department's report late Wednesday that the number of soybeans planted as of mid-June was much more than expected.
July copper on New York's Commodity Exchange surged 1 cent, to 86.8 cents a pound, amid signs that workers at the Kennecott Corporation, a major United States copper producer, could strike.

Dollar Shows Weakness Despite German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar traded lower against leading European currencies yesterday despite a long-awaited cut in German interest rates.
Traders said the dollar was weak because of poor economic news in the United States and because it had been bid higher in anticipation of the German rate cut. The dollar rose against the Japanese yen. 
 "Today can be characterized as the classic 'Buy the rumor,' coming into the Thursday Bundesbank meeting, and 'Sell the fact,' " said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president in the foreign exchange department at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. in New York.
Germany's central bank lowered its discount rate half a percentage point, to 6.75 percent, the lowest level since February 1991. It also cut the so-called Lombard rate a quarter of a percentage point, to 8.25 percent. Some other European central banks followed suit.
Since market participants have been trading in expectation of the cuts, the moves did not prompt buying. But news of a sluggish American economy did provoke selling, analysts said.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index fell to 48.3 percent in June from 51.1 percent in May. That level indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector.
"At the time of the release of the purchasing managers' report, there was a flurry of activity," said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. "The dollar went down a little bit, but it came back," he said.
The dollar's gain against the yen was mostly a result of technical trading, Mr. Flanagan said. Much of the market's activity, he said, was muted in advance of the American employment report to be released today.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 108.10 yen, up 1.59 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, it fell to 107.40 yen. In New York, the dollar traded at 107.38 yen late in the day, up from 106.95 on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5085, from $1.4930 late Wednesday. In New York, it was quoted at $1.5150, up from $1.4915 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Wednesday rates, were: 1.6950 German marks, down from 1.7060; 1.5095 Swiss francs, down from 1.5135; 5.7240 French francs, down from 5.7470; 1,542.00 Italian lire, down from 1,550.00.

HEADLINE: Jersey City's Interim Mayor Is Sworn In for First Full Term

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, July 1

 BODY:
People just couldn't do or say enough about this city's future or its new Mayor today as Bret Schundler, a Democrat turned Republican, was sworn into his first full term.
The ceremony under flowing flags at Liberty State Park attracted a crowd that was a Who's Who of state politics -- testimony to the perception that the comparative political newcomer being inaugurated today could provide important support to those up for election later this year. 
 Gov. Jim Florio, who needs a big vote out of Hudson County to win re-election in the fall, brought $3.3 million and a summer-jobs program with him as he joined other speakers in predicting that Mr. Schundler would lead the city in a revitalization that would become a national model.
 
Recollection From Kemp
 "I am more than anxious," Mr. Florio told the 1,000 residents at the ceremony on the banks of the Hudson River, "to work with your Mayor and all of the people of Jersey City to make it not just one of the best cities in the state but one of the best in the United States of America."
In a day when expressions of love for this post-industrial city of 228,000 was on everyone's lips, Jack F. Kemp, the former Republican Congressman and ex-Federal Housing Secretary, was more than up to the challenge. Recalling when President John F. Kennedy expressed solidarity with the people of West Berlin by declaring "Ich bin ein Berliner," Mr. Kemp said, "As an American, in this time and place, I want to say Ich bin ein resident of Jersey City!"
The 34-year-old Mayor obviously enjoyed being courted by political figures of both major parties. As he began his inaugural address on the theme of a "new beginning" for the city, he said, "Something is happening -- it must be, just look at the people on this podium."
The Legislature's Republican leaders, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian; Christine Todd Whitman, Republican candidate for governor; former Governors Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, and Brendan T. Byrne , a Democrat, and members of the Legislature and the nine-member City Council sat in two long rows, smiling in the midday heat through the two-hour ceremony.
 
Senate Bid by Kean?
 As he walked to the dais, Mr. Kean confirmed reports that he was considering a run for the United States Senate next year against the Democratic incumbent, Frank R. Lautenberg. "I'm giving it serious thought," he said. "I'll have something to say in four to six weeks."
Mr. Florio made the $3.3 million that the city will receive under a bill distributing utility tax revenue seem like a personal gift to Jersey City, though the the bill he signed during his address will distribute $77 million to municipalities across the state. The Democratic Governor said he would sign the summer-jobs bill at a later stop.
Mrs. Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, reminded residents that she has campaigned with Mr. Schundler in the past.
"The people were waiting for a leader," she said, "And in Bret they found someone who cared deeply." She said Mr. Schundler's success in lowering the city's property tax, putting more police officers on the streets and reviving one of the city's main shopping streets shows it is possible "to allow our cities to breathe again and grow."
Mr. Schundler told reporters before the ceremony that it was "conceivable" that he would endorse either Mrs. Whitman or Mr. Florio "but not today."
Mr. Schundler, who was a field coordinator for Gary Hart's Presidential campaign in 1984, changed his party registration to Republican in 1991 to make an unsuccessful run for one of Hudson County's three State Senate seats. Last November he finished ahead of 18 other candidates in a special election to complete the term of former Mayor Gerald McCann, who was sent to Federal prison after his conviction on fraud charges. And in May he won a full term, defeating a candidate backed by the city's Democratic organization headed by Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County Executive.
 
Another Theme
 It is because he appears to have his feet in both parties that Mr. Schundler is being wooed by the candidates for governor and the Legislature. But today he pressed another theme: that party labels mean little in a city fighting for its economic life.
He noted that he won in May as the Republican incumbent with 70 percent of the vote in a city with a 70 percent Democratic registration.
"This doesn't suggest a victory of party, it suggests a transcendence of party and a victory for the people," he said. "It proves that people do not dream partisan dreams; they dream human dreams."

HEADLINE: Germans Reduce 2 Key Rates

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, July 1

 BODY:
The German central bank lowered two key interest rates today, answering calls from President Clinton and European leaders to loosen the monetary reins in Europe's largest and most depressed economy.
The Bundesbank's moves, which were made at a meeting in the economically devastated eastern German city of Leipzig, also took Chancellor Helmut Kohl off the hook on the issue of high German interest rates in advance of next week's summit meeting in Tokyo of the seven leading industrial nations. 
 The bank's central council reduced the discount rate, the rate it charges commercial banks for short-term loans, to 6.75 percent from 7.25 percent, the lowest level since early 1991. It also cut a second measure, the Lombard rate, which acts as a ceiling on money market interest, to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent.
 
 
Fifth in a Series
 The decision today to reduce both rates was the fifth in a series of reductions that began in September, when they were at post-World War II highs of 8.75 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
"The money market can no longer say we have a high interest rate policy," said Dr. Helmut Schlesinger, who as president of the Bundesbank since 1991 has been criticized throughout Europe and in Britain for having waited far too long to bring rates down, and then for reducing rates only in modest steps.
Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt, said: "It is not a high interest rate policy, nor is it a low interest rate policy yet. It is more of a middle policy."
"Everyone understands that the G-7 governments want to see lower German interest rates," Mr. Pietsch added, referring to the Group of Seven industrial nations. "I think today's step is a reasonable effort to meet those concerns and will be a positive contribution to the Tokyo summit."
The bank had made its last cut on April 22, before a series of pessimistic economic forecasts predicting that German economic activity would shrink by more than 2 percent this year and drag the rest of Europe down.
 
 
Move Pleases Clinton
 President Clinton had pleaded on Wednesday for a further reduction. "I think the German central bank should continue to lower interest rates there so that all of us together can expand this economy," he said at a photo session with Congressional leaders in Washington. The White House welcomed the bank's announcement today.
Financial and monetary analysts had been expecting a further move by the bank today, and in anticipation the dollar had surged -- to 1.7103 marks on the currency markets in Frankfurt today, 7.3 percent higher than its value at the beginning of June.
After the announcement, the dollar retreated somewhat, to 1.7055 marks in late trading in Frankfurt. In New York, the dollar was at 1.6950 marks late in the day, down from 1.7060.
Since the Bundesbank is considered unlikely to make any further decisions on interest rates until the end of summer, other bankers thought any further significant rise in the dollar's value would come only if the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington raised its discount rate, which is now 3 percent.
 
 
No Danger for the Mark
 Since spring, the Bundesbank has had one eye on the effects in the currency markets of its decisions affecting the mark. Dr. Schlesinger said today that the bank was determined to preserve the currency's position as an anchor in the European monetary system, and analysts said that the reduction seemed unlikely to endanger it.
Brendan Brown, chief economist for Mitsubishi Finance International P.L.C. in London, said: "The economic geography of Europe is overwhelmingly in favor of the Deutsche mark. Also, the Bundesbank has built a longstanding reputation as the best independent central in the world at maintaining the currency's stability and keeping inflation down."
German rates, he said, were now "not all that high if you take into account what is happening with monetary growth or the record budget deficit in Germany, which is unprecedented in any cyclical comparison."

HEADLINE: City Opera Musicians Bar Wage Freeze

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
The musicians of the New York City Opera Orchestra have rejected the company's request for a wage freeze this season, the company and Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians said yesterday. The union had agreed to a wage freeze for the month of June, when the company was on tour, but negotiations for a freeze for the coming season broke down early this week.
The City Opera, which posted a deficit of $2.9 million in 1992 and is projecting a deficit of about $1 million for the fiscal year that ended on Wednesday, first asked the unions for a freeze last October. Christopher Keene, the company's general director, said at the time that a seasonlong wage freeze would save the company about $500,000, and would make it possible for City Opera to break even in its 50th-anniversary season, which opens on July 28. 
 In rejecting the freeze, Florence Nelson, the vice president of Local 802, pointed out that in 1989 the musicians had agreed to a contract in which the greatest benefits -- salary and pension fund increases, and an extra vacation week -- were scheduled to take effect this year.
 
Guarantee Rejected
 "Even so," she said, "we said we would accept the freeze in exchange for a guarantee that we would not lose working weeks next season, when the company changes its schedule from summer and fall to fall and spring. They either could not or would not give us that guarantee."
The current contract expires on May 30, 1994, and Irwin Schneiderman, City Opera's co-chairman, said yesterday that the company could not offer the players the assurance they sought. "By agreeing to the guarantee, we would be agreeing in advance to the most important economic issue in a contract that we have not yet begun to negotiate," he said. "We can't do that."
Mr. Schneiderman said that the company's failure to obtain a wage freeze would not imperil the coming season, but that the board and Mr. Keene would have to search for other economies. Mr. Keene was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Arbour Deal Is Done: The Man Is an Islander

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FREY

 BODY:
The playoff ride was too exciting, the future possibilities too intriguing for Al Arbour to give up now. And so Arbour, who seriously considered ending his 18-year coaching career with the Islanders this summer, has instead agreed to sign on for at least one more year as the team's head coach.
General Manager Don Maloney said yesterday that he and Arbour had come to a good-faith agreement that would keep Arbour behind the Islanders' bench for a minimum of one more season and in the organization beyond that. Consistent with his past agreements with the Islanders, Arbour will sit down with Maloney following the 1993-94 season and reassess his options, deciding then whether to extend his coaching contract or move into a front-office role.
 
'Gets Your Juices Going'
 "There's no doubt that when you're out of it for a while and you get back into the playoffs, it certainly gets your juices going," said Arbour, who led the upstart Islanders past the Pittsburgh Penguins and into the Wales Conference finals this spring. "The question is always whether the challenge is there, and that's what brings me back. I thought with the club and the way we finished, there would certainly be a challenge to keep it going that way." 
 The decision, in effect, means that Arbour will finish out his career with the Islanders, the team that he has coached for all but three and a half seasons of its existence. With his credentials -- and, particularly, his success with a young team last season -- Arbour had been considered a candidate for other head coaching jobs in the National Hockey League.
"I thought of that," Arbour said. "I decided the one thing was I didn't want to go somewhere else. Really, I'm an Islander, and I want to remain one."
 
With Team Since '73
 After coaching three seasons in St. Louis, Arbour joined the Islanders in 1973, the team's second season in the league. Since then, he has coached the team for all but a two-and-a-half season stretch in the mid-1980's, when he retired briefly. He has coached more games (1,522) than any coach in N.H.L. history, compiling a 745-541-236 record (703-501-211 with New York) over that span. He guided the Islanders' franchise to four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1980-83.
"At this stage, the youth of our team, the mix of our team with personalities, Al's the guy who fits the bill," said Maloney, who said he was "thrilled to have him back."
"He's the guy we wanted on the job," added Maloney. "I'm sure it speaks for itself the effort and commitment he gave this year."
 
Won't Come Cheap
 Maloney said he and Arbour had not come to terms on his salary. Maloney has acknowledged that he will have to pay Arbour according to the market rate for the current crop of elite coaches, and these days, the elite do not come cheap. Mike Keenan, the new head coach of the Rangers, is reportedly making about $900,000 a year, and Scotty Bowman was given a salary of about $800,000 when he signed on with the Detroit Red Wings last month.
"Certainly the economic climate has changed and we are respectful of that," Maloney said.
Arbour spent some time at his home in Florida mulling the decision after his team was eliminated from the playoffs by the Montreal Canadiens, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. He then joined Maloney in Quebec for the N.H.L. draft last week, but said he did not want to complicate matters during the draft, so he put off his decision until a few days ago.
 
SLAP SHOTS
 DARIUS KASPARAITIS, the Islanders' hard-checking defenseman, was arrested early Wednesday morning in Suffolk County on Long Island and charged with driving while intoxicated. According to SALVATORE YOVINO, a police spokesman, Kasparitis, 20, was spotted driving his 1993 BMW in an erratic manner in an eastbound direction on Rt. 25 in Huntington, L.I. He then led police on a high-speed chase before being stopped in Commack at 4:25 A.M., said Yovino. He was arraigned yesterday in a Central Islip Court and released on his own recognizance, pending a Sept. 7 hearing. According to Kasparitis's lawyer, ROBERT CURRAN, his blood-alcohol level was reported to be at .20, double the legal limit. Islanders' General Manager DON MALONEY said yesterday that he had spoken with Kasparitis, but that he had no comment about the situation.

HEADLINE: Raise Social Security Taxes

BYLINE: By Robert M. Ball; Robert M. Ball, chairman of the board of the National Academy of Social Insurance, was Commissioner of Social Security from 1962 to 1973.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Nobody likes being singled out for a tax increase, and it's no surprise that most higher-income Social Security beneficiaries oppose President Clinton's plan to tax more of their benefits. Nevertheless, it is a good idea.
It is only fair. Why should Social Security -- by far our biggest pension system -- be taxed differently from private pensions and Government career pensions? Retirees under these other plans pay income tax on the part of their benefit that exceeds what they paid in. They don't pay on their own contributions because those have already been taxed, but the rest of the benefit is income with no more special claim to exemption than other income, like workers' wages. 
 The President has proposed to tax 85 percent of Social Security benefits for higher-income retirees, as against the 50 percent now taxed.
Mr. Clinton proposed a fixed percentage because it just isn't worth doing (and explaining) the complicated individual calculations necessary to apply the exact rules for private pensions to millions of Social Security beneficiaries. Anyway, virtually every beneficiary will be better off with the 85 percent figure. Employees' contributions to Social Security are almost always less than 15 percent of the expected lifetime benefit because while benefits are indexed to wages and prices, employees pay Social Security taxes as they earn their wages, unaffected by subsequent inflation.
I favor the President's plan not only because it would make the tax code more equitable but because I believe it would strengthen Social Security as an institution. Identifying it with all other earned retirement income would emphasize that Social Security is not welfare. Taxing Social Security like other pensions would show that it is an earned right and help hold off proposals to cut benefits.
Social Security was tax-free until 1983, not because of a specific exemption but because of an interpretation of its benefits as a Government grant, really a gratuity, and not an earned right. When the Social Security law was drafted in 1935, some feared the Supreme Court might rule it unconstitutional because of its unprecedented linkage of levying taxes and granting benefits in a social insurance system. So the parts of the law granting benefits were kept entirely separate from the parts imposing taxes.
But if the benefits weren't connected to the taxes, what were they? One Treasury ruling said Social Security was "considered a payment in promotion of the general welfare and is not taxed," while the taxable portion of a civil service pension was "considered to be in the nature of deferred compensation paid by the employer."
This distinction is damaging to Social Security, which also grows out of employment and is paid for by employees and by employer contributions -- a deferred wage.
Besides reinforcing the program's philosophical basis, taxing Social Security benefits would end up costing the elderly less than the benefit cuts proposed as an alternative. Since the proposed tax (like the current tax) exempts single taxpayers making less than $25,000 a year and couples making under $32,000, only 22 percent of beneficiaries would pay. And those taxes would most affect the elderly early on, when they can best afford it. Total income, including work earnings and private pension income, which is not indexed for inflation, often declines over the years. Tax rate brackets and exemptions increase with inflation. So over time, a larger share of income falls into a lower bracket or becomes exempt, allowing retirees to keep more of their benefits in old age, when they most need them.
By contrast, cutbacks in cost-of-living adjustments or an across-the-board reduction in benefits would affect lower-income people as well as higher-income people and would tend to hit harder as retirees grew older.
Ultimately, Social Security should be taxed as regular income, without special low-income exemptions. But eliminating exemptions now would cut too deeply into what many pensioners count on. Instead, inflation will eventually make today's low-income thresholds obsolete, while regular income tax exemptions will in-sure that about 40 percent of recipients will still pay no taxes on benefits.
The President's proposal would reduce the deficit some $32 billion in five years. But the major virtues of this particular plan are philosophical: to promote tax equity and to emphasize working people's earned right to Social Security by treating it like any other earned pension.

HEADLINE: Who Can Harness History? Only the U.S.

BYLINE: By Brent Scowcroft; Brent Scowcroft, president of the Forum for International Policy, a foreign affairs foundation, was national security adviser to George Bush.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For the first time since the Hitler era, no would-be global dictator is working to overthrow the established order. Despite the many civil wars in the world, the U.S. has an opportunity to mold an international system more compatible with the values we have held for two centuries. But we may be letting that chance pass through our fingers. The tremendous domestic tasks facing us call not just for our immediate attention but for continued real sacrifice.
Some say that we have carried the weight of world leadership long enough and that we no longer need to maintain a large military establishment. These attitudes are understandable but misguided. Beyond the responsibility that goes with power and the altruistic obligation most Americans feel toward their fellow man, very practical, even selfish reasons should move us. 
 America has never been more dependent on the outside world for its well-being and that dependency is steadily growing. International economics and the global environment are by definition two issues that know no boundaries yet demand skillful management to avoid large-scale disaster. National boundaries are also becoming irrelevant barriers to terrorists, drug traffickers, and even refugees whose motives are simply a better life -- or life itself.
Foreign trade -- open trade -- also is vital to America. Since 1988, 70 percent of U.S. growth has come from exports, exports of consumer goods are up 55 percent and export-related jobs have increased 42 percent.
The U.S. cannot prosper amid chaos and conflict, economic isolation or hostile trading blocs. Foreign policy and domestic policy have become two sides of the same coin.
A better world can emerge only as a result of strong and enlightened leadership. Whether we like it or not, the U.S. alone can provide that leadership. No other power, no international organization, has the global view, respect and the reach to touch every corner of the world. Left to its own devices, history will sooner or later serve up another nasty surprise.
This is not an argument for the U.S. to be the world's lone policeman. There will remain, however, a critical need to lead the world into action. This is not a call for unilateralism. But "multilateralism" is no option if it becomes an excuse for inaction or for waiting for others to galvanize the international community into action. In the gulf crisis, for example, the U.S. mobilized a great international coalition to defeat Iraqi aggression against Kuwait, at the same time leading the U.N. Security Council to provide the moral and legal judgments and authority for the military action.
Somalia is a more recent case in point. No country but the U.S. had the military and logistical ability to restore order quickly so that humanitarian relief could be delivered to end the starvation. That was all done in cooperation with the Security Council, by a U.S.-led coalition, with the understanding that after the initial relief operation U.S. forces would be replaced by other U.N. contingents.
Somalia has turned out to be more complicated than originally perceived. The warlord Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid challenged U.N. authority, killing a number of U.N. troops. This led to U.N. forces engaging in offensive military action and U.S. forces fighting under a U.N. commander, both precedent-breaking steps. Still, the operation is on course, and the U.S. can be proud of the role it played in Operation Restore Hope and continues to play under U.N. authority.
Neither the U.S., a U.S.-led coalition nor the U.N. can intervene to right every wrong, deal with every injustice or reverse every breach of the peace. The first priority should be external behavior -- political, economic and military -- in the international community. In addition, we must lead the way toward promoting respect for and the sanctity of the individual in societies everywhere.
When the international community acts, especially these days when its enhanced authority is getting established, it is critical that each test of strength be successful. Success will breed success and deter aggression that might otherwise take place. Early failures would encourage flouting of the world order. During the cold war, this principle was called deterrence, and we should never forget that, while the context may have changed, the principle remains valid.
The seemingly intractable conflict in Bosnia illustrates the complexity of the problem. The Bush Administration concluded that the situation on the ground created by the warring parties could not be significantly modified without enormous amounts of force. Even in such a case, achieving success, in any reasonable definition of that term, as in Kuwait and Somalia, appeared illusory, if not impossible.
The Clinton Administration seemed initially inclined toward military intervention but backed off, confronted by the lack of international and domestic support. The decision clearly shows that leadership also consists in knowing the limits of multilateralism.
We cannot lead effectively if the already shrunken military establishment has to bear the disproportionate weight of budget reductions, as seems to be the case these days. We need to maintain a global presence backed up by credible forces. Deterrence and defense depend on it.
All Americans have a desire to bequeath to their children a more stable and prosperous world than they inherited. We can strive, while foreign affairs are in a relatively unsettled state, to be the indispensable ingredient in fashioning a stable world order -- or we can turn inward as we did after World War I, until another mortal threat reminds us that our fate depends on the world in which we live. We do not have the luxury of putting our leadership on hold until we get our domestic house in order. Unfortunately, there is no holiday from history.

HEADLINE: Why New Yorkers Have Fought Hard to Keep Rent Regulation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
After the tulips, the first robin and the rhubarb, there invariably comes your editorial excoriating New York City rent regulation. This year a bumper crop: not one, but two (June 14 and June 22). 
 As usual, you blame rent regulation for property tax losses, no new construction, the deterioration of buildings, abandonment and "making a sick real estate market sicker." Landlord greed, of course, has nothing to do with it. Unfortunately, these fictions don't fit the facts.
Abandonment, for instance, occurs to the same degree in cities with rent regulation as in those without, and abandonment in this city is highest in neighborhoods with the fewest rent-regulated buildings and lowest in neighborhoods with a high proportion of regulated buildings.
Many things affect new construction, but rent regulation isn't one of them, as new buildings are not regulated unless the owner voluntarily submits to regulation in exchange for tax abatements. (Most do, by the way, which should make one wonder how onerous the controls really are.)
Regulation fosters maintenance because owners who make major capital improvements, like new windows or heating systems, are rewarded many times over the actual cost through permanent bonus rent increases. Moreover, landlords who refurbish an apartment between tenants get to increase the rent permanently by one-fortieth of the cost.
Could the city collect higher property taxes if rents were deregulated? Probably, at least for a while, but the bottom line wouldn't be better. To raise $100 million more in property tax revenues, rents would have to be raised $500 million to $600 million. This is not new money; it's just a transfer of funds from tenants to landlords and would mean tenants would have less to spend on everything else. Those who can will move elsewhere; those who can no longer afford the rent will turn to the city for shelter. Instead of a revenue gain, a net loss is all but inevitable.
Contrary to myth, more than half of regulated tenants are nonwhite or Spanish speaking; since 1978, rents for regulated apartments have grown faster than inflation and wages, which means that, despite controls, shelter takes an ever larger share of household income; well over half of rent-regulated households paid more than 30 percent of income to rent in 1991; in 1990, 77 percent of rent-regulated households had incomes less than $40,000, while a mere 3 percent of rent-regulated households had incomes of $100,000 or more.
This 3 percent has some people's knickers in knots. You and some State Senate Republicans propose that the state take on the huge administrative burden of ascertaining every regulated household's income to flush out these possibly unworthy beneficiaries. That would cost us taxpayers at least $10 a year per unit, more than $10 million a year for the million-plus regulated units. Court battles will ensue. It hardly seems worth it.
New York's real estate market may indeed be "sick," but the infecting agent is the delusion of easy and quick profits carried by the owners and those who finance them. Tenant fears of deregulation can hardly be characterized as "misplaced." It's not for nothing that it's called rent stabilization.

HEADLINE: Student Loan Bill Fixes What Isn't Broken;
Slower on Federal Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In an otherwise excellent article, you state inaccurately that "the national service program is designed to meet President Clinton's objectives of reducing interest rates on student loans by replacing banker intermediaries with Education Department administrators" ("Clinton Wins Key Votes on Plan for Service Tied to School Loans," front page, June 17). 
 National service is surely a tremendous idea. But it will have no effect on the interest rates on Federal college loans.
National service is a stand-alone issue, perfectly able to exist apart from the President's other major higher educational proposal -- which might have some effect on interest rates -- to make student loans direct from the Federal Treasury.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that direct Government lending will lower interest rates. There is a good chance it will do the opposite. As Representative William F. Goodling, a Pennsylvania Republican, told a House subcommittee June 10, if the Administration's proposed interest rate formula under direct lending were in place today, student loan borrowers would be paying a rate 3/4 percent to 1.4 percent higher than under current law.
My organization, a nationwide coalition of nonprofit education loan organizations, including guarantors and secondary markets, supports national service. But that is a different issue from direct Government lending. We believe there is too much risk involved in full and immediate implementation of direct lending.
Instead, the program should be phased in, tested and evaluated before a final commitment is made. This is the approach taken by the proposal approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Punitive Smokers' Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jeffrey Harris states that a $2 increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes (Op-Ed, June 4) would increase excise tax collections from $5 billion to $32 billion. Michael Grossman (letter, June 18) accuses Professor Harris of underestimating the response of smokers to higher taxes, thus overestimating the likely tax revenues. Mr. Grossman's research suggests a tax of $1.26 a pack would maximize Federal revenues from the cigarette excise tax. 
 A statistical analysis of state excise taxes on cigarettes, based on data from 1960 through 1990, suggests that both Mr. Harris and Mr. Grossman may be wrong. In this study Kevin Grier and Richard Wagner, economists from George Mason University, calculated that 35 cents to 40 cents a pack was a revenue-maximizing rate for state excise taxes on cigarettes. Increases beyond that level, it was predicted, led to reductions in tax collections. This can be generalized to the Federal level, with the caveat that cross-border effects will be less strong, reducing the relevant elasticity somewhat.
Nonetheless, the Grier-Wagner study assumed a given level of the Federal excise tax, now 24 cents a pack. Raising this to $2 or $1.26 a pack is a radical increase in the level of excise taxation. If the Grier-Wagner estimates are correct, there is a much higher response by smokers to an increase in the excise tax than Mr. Harris and Mr. Grossman suggest.
It seems very likely that tax increases of this magnitude will lead to a reduction in tax collections. This means that Government has milked smokers for all the revenue it can.
Tax increases of $2 or $1.26 a pack will lead to a reduction of Federal excise tax collections if the experience of the states is repeated. Such a level of taxation on smokers is simply punitive; it succeeds in nothing but fleecing low-income, working-class smoking families of more than $2,000 a year.

HEADLINE: Clinton Proposes to Soften the Blow of Base Closings

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
In an effort to cushion the economic blow to communities suffering military base closings, President Clinton today announced a package of proposals to speed and increase assistance to scores of affected areas.
Mr. Clinton's plan, a combination of existing programs and new proposals that would require Congressional approval, was announced by the President at a White House news conference. 
 Mr. Clinton also said he had approved an independent commission's recommendations to close 35 major bases and expand or reduce 27 others. The recommendations of the panel, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, now go to Congress for approval, which is expected.
Under the Administration's plan, the Pentagon would speed the transfer of former military bases to communities for other uses, quicken the environmental cleanup on the sites, improve coordination between Federal and local authorities and increase economic planning grants.
The White House said the package would cost about $5 billion over the next five years. The Federal grants that are part of this package would amount to an average of $1 million for each community over that period. Most of this money has already been appropriated or is included in legislation before Congress.
 
All Jobs Won't Be Saved
 Mr. Clinton, joined at the news conference by Vice President Al Gore and five Cabinet Secretaries, cautioned that the measures were not a panacea for the cites and towns about to lose their bases.
"Even with all these aggressive efforts, the closing of a military base, as with any large employer, will inevitably be traumatic for the host community," he said. "I cannot promise that every job will be saved."
Independent analysts applauded the Administration's proposals but urged Mr. Clinton and his senior advisers to be more specific.
"It's a good start, but we're going to need more details on how he hopes to solve problems than the glimpse we saw today," said Keith Cunningham, an analyst with Business Executives for National Security, a policy group in Washington.
Not all local officials were willing to accept Mr. Clinton's plan as a consolation prize. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that New York State might offer a legal challenge to the commission's recommendations to close Plattsburgh Air Force Base and the Staten Island Homeport and reduce Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y.
Mr. Clinton's proposals build on several existing Federal programs, but they also include a few new ones. He said he would consider asking Congress to change the law to allow the Defense Department to transfer bases to communities at a discount from their market value, or even at no cost, for purposes of economic development. At present, such transfers are allowed only if the bases are converted into parks or other public sites.
Finally, the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment has increased the average size of planning grants it offers to communities where bases or military industry plants are closed, to $300,000 from the previous average of $100,000.
The new proposals are directed at all communities where bases are being closed, including those from the earlier rounds of closings, in 1988 and 1991, Pentagon officials said.

HEADLINE: Aid for Owls, Trees and Loggers

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan to manage and protect 800-year-old forests and spotted owls in the Northwest won't end the tension between loggers and environmentalists, but he has taken a giant step in the right direction. He shields not just a bird, but a rich, irreplaceable ecosystem of timber, water, fish and fowl, while still permitting sustainable logging.
The President offers a reasonable compromise. He would allow logging that environmental absolutists prefer to ban outright, but would set tight limits that timber interests misrepresent as ruinous. 
 The issue was joined two years ago when a Federal judge in Seattle ruled that rapid cutting on lands controlled by the Forest Service violated the nation's environmental laws. He ordered cutting halted until the Government devised protections; the Clinton plan is subject to his approval.
The most striking feature of the President's proposal is its sharply reduced ceiling on logging in the affected forests. It allows less than one-third as much cutting over all as in the 1980's, with tight control in designated areas of old growth. Loggers will protest the rollback, with the outspoken support of House Speaker Tom Foley, who hails from the state of Washington. But cutting could not have continued at the earlier pace; sooner or later there would have been nothing left to cut.
While the industry and its workers blame Government curbs for their troubles, there are at least three other factors -- automation, Southeastern timber development and subsidized exports of logs for finishing in foreign mills. (Mr. Clinton sensibly wants to end those subsidies.)
To compensate for the inevitable loss of work under new logging limits, the President offers retraining and new jobs in forest preservation, plus economic aid for affected communities.
With impressive foresight, the Clinton plan also seeks to head off future trouble by concentrating on watershed areas; preservation of streams and rivers as well as the surrounding forest should prevent new crises over fish and wildlife and, not incidentally, keep water supplies clean. In addition, 10 areas are to be designated for joint experimentation by local interests and the Government, looking for better methods of logging and preservation.
Closer inspection and judicial review of Mr. Clinton's plan will doubtless raise challenges to its particulars. For now, credit the Administration for serious effort to resolve a troublesome conflict.

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Guarded Optimism

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
Inside the small offices of the Caribbean Air Mail on Church Avenue in Brooklyn, a constant flow of Haitians poured in and lined up yesterday, waiting to wire money to relatives in Haiti.
During these often long waits at the Haitian version of a Western Union, the conversation usually consists of pleasantries about the family back home and the difficult economic times. 
 But yesterday the talks centered on the sudden twist of events that may bring about the return to power of Haiti's President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
 
'A First Step'
 "It's a first step," said Frantz Toussaint as he waited to wire about $100 to family members in Port-au-Prince, the capital. "It's about time the situation is resolved. The Haitian people have suffered long enough."
After nearly two years of disappointment, the development has been received here with guarded optimism.
"In a struggle it's hard to define the struggle immediately," said Mr. Toussaint, who has lived in Flatbush for more than six years. "But there was a beginning to this crisis, so there will be an end and that end will be democracy."
Yesterday, under a cloudy sky, there was no dancing in the streets of Flatbush. Instead, along Nostrand and Flatbush Avenues, Creole-speaking men and women huddled around radios in barbershops, grocery stores and record shops, grasping for every bit of information.
"Cedras might as well stay here," said Jean Simeus, a resident of the Midwood section of Brooklyn, who was standing in front of St. Aude Barber Shop. He spoke of Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader, in Creole. "There's nothing for him to do in Haiti."
Just a few doors away from the barbershop, Jean-Robert Momperousse, owner of La Difference Bake Shop, quickly took out a pink and blue coffee cup with a picture of Father Aristide encircled in hearts.
"He is the solution," Mr. Momperousse said of Father Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president. "He started to do a job and when he returns he will continue to do a good job."
Under the agreement, Father Aristide will choose a Prime Minister. When the Parliament accepts the candidate, it will grant an amnesty to those involved in the coup, including General Cedras and the Port-au-Prince Police Chief, Michel Francois. Then the army's high command will resign.
"It's not just Cedras and Francois -- the whole high command has to go," said Alain Moise standing in front of the bakery shop. "And they should go even before the sanctions are lifted and before there is a new Prime Minister. Otherwise it's just a continuation of the coup d'etat."
Jacques Larose added, speaking of Father Aristide returning: "I'll believe it when I see it. These Haitians can come up with all kinds of ways to surprise you."

Turks Espouse Change (She Has a 'Smile of Steel')

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey

 BODY:
Her family's wealth is said to total some $50 million. Her clothes are designer-chic and her command of languages makes her just as at home in Munich or Maine as on the Sea of Marmara.
That is to say, even if she had not just become the first woman to be Turkey's Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller would be a defining emblem of what unabashed success means in a land that has propelled itself in a decade from military rule to free-market riches -- a boom that has restated Turkey's claim for acknowledgement as a worthy partner of the West. 
 Yet there is a twist to Mrs. Ciller's rise to prominence that underlines the uncertainties of a country rooted in Asia and Islam but yearning to be European: when some Turks fete her appointment as their leader, it is not so much to simply celebrate a woman breaking a masculine and Muslim mold, but to go further and say that with a woman at their helm who can now deny their claim to a modernity defined in Western terms?
"This shows that Turkey is a part of the Western world, that Turkey is a civilized country," said President Suleyman Demirel, her predecessor.
Mrs. Ciller's election on June 14 by the dominant True Path Party, Mr. Demirel said in an interview, sent "a very good message."
"Many people are afraid that Turkey is becoming fundamentalist," he said. "People are asking that question. And then, here's the answer."
Paradoxically for the 67-year-old Mr Demirel, though, the election of the 47-year-old Mrs. Ciller sends the rather less comforting message that people have tired of a generation of old-guard politicians, like himself, who have traversed the stage of public life -- sometimes at center, sometimes in the wings, sometimes in military-enforced silence -- for more than three decades.
"Everybody said, 'She's a change, let's try her,' " said Nur Batur, a prominent journalist in Ankara. "Nobody rejected her because she is a woman. What they think is that she'll bring change. What change? That's the big question."
Mrs. Ciller (pronounced CHILL-air) herself has cast her appointment in the same way. "Nobody can resist a ripe idea," she told the party congress that nominated her as leader of the True Path Party, and thus as Prime Minister-designate. "The idea today is change."
In a land that has pursued Western aspirations since the founding of the modern Turkish republic in 1923, Mrs. Ciller has obvious credentials. The daughter of a wealthy Istanbul family, she was educated at the city's prestigious, American-run Roberts College.
In the 1970's, she lived in the United States, studying economics. She received a master's degree from the University of New Hampshire and a doctorate from the University of Connecticut and pursued further studies at Yale.
Such is her association with America that her leftist adversaries say she actually is American, although she has denied their assertion that she and her husband were granted United States citizenship 14 years ago.
Not only is she the first woman to be the country's Prime Minister, she is also the first Prime Minister since 1923 to be born on the European side of the Bosphorous.
What she is, Turkish newspapers have decided, is the "lady with a smile of steel" -- a description supposed to denote the powerful will that was already evident in 1963 when, at her marriage to Ozer Ucuran, a businessman, she refused to take his name and persuaded him to take hers, an unusual feat in a Muslim society.
Neither is she afraid of saying out loud what others say privately about Turkey's European allies. "The Europeans," she told one interviewer, "should realize that Europe is not an exclusive Christian club."
"She is not a person who's frightened of breaking eggs to make the omelet, and she has very strong determination," a Western diplomat said. "If that means that some people won't like her, she'll say, 'Too bad.' "
 
At a Disadvantage
 But her relative lack of political background puts her at a disadvantage, some say. Mrs. Ciller entered politics from academia, and was an economics professor only three years ago.
Neither has her track record so far shown an ability to convert her knowledge of economics into the practicalities of tussling with the huge inflation that has come on the wings of Turkey's booming, export-oriented growth.
While still in opposition in the late 1980's, Mr. Demirel appointed her an economic adviser, hoping to broaden his party's support from its roots in Turkey's vast hinterland and embrace urban intellectuals and business people.
When Mr. Demirel won power in 1991, Mrs. Ciller became a junior minister and the newspapers took to calling her "The Princess" or "The Daughter" -- a patronizing label that soon fell into disuse as she tilted against Mr. Demirel's instinctive caution and consensus-building in economic policy.
Whatever the relationship, though, she was unable to redeem her pledge to bring down inflation -- currently running at 65 percent -- to around 40 percent, and has failed to accelerate the selloff of Turkey's vast, loss-making state enterprises. The two issues lie at the core of the country's economic problems, despite its 1992 growth rate of almost 6 percent, one of the world's highest.
"She has not so far proven herself to be a manager," a Western official said.
As Prime Minister, she has more freedom to attack those problems. As leader of a party whose popularity is faltering and as head of a coalition whose future is unclear, however, she arguably has less.
Her coalition partner, the Social Democratic Populist Party, is to elect a new leader in September who may be less accommodating than its present boss, Erdal Inonu, diplomats say. Her adversaries have been whispering darkly to diplomats and journalists that they have compiled 13 "dossiers" concerning the ways she and her husband made money in real estate.
But she is still enjoying a honeymoon with both Turkey's bellicose press and opposition parties.
"She represents the same thing in Turkey that Clinton represented in the U.S.: change," a Western diplomat said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Orders Sharp Budget Cuts To Save New York's Bond Rating

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Responding to pressure from fiscal monitors and Wall Street, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday took the unusual step of ordering significant new cuts in New York City's budget only two days into the new fiscal year.
Mr. Dinkins said he was trimming the new budget and planning to make similar reductions in future budgets to head off a threat by Standard & Poor's, a major credit-rating agency, to lower the city's bond rating. 
 In practical terms, a lowering of the bond rating would have made it more costly for the city to do business because its bonds would have been more expensive and more difficult to sell to investors. In political terms, a lowering would have opened Mr. Dinkins to charges of poor fiscal management by his opponents in this fall's election, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal.
 
Rating Remains at A-
 After hearing the administration's proposals in meetings over the last few days, Standard & Poor's announced yesterday that it would maintain an investment-grade rating of A- for New York City, though it continued to express some reservations about the city's future budgets and overall fiscal health.
Mr. Dinkins's plan would cut about $130 million from the city's $31.2 billion budget through reductions in capital spending on projects like roads, bridges and schools; attrition of the work force, and other cost-saving measures, officials said.
Those cuts will grow to about $400 million in next year's budget, which is now projected to have a deficit of $1.7 billion. The city's fiscal year runs from July through June.
Asked at a news conference why he was cutting the budget only three weeks after negotiating it with the City Council, Mr. Dinkins replied, "You don't have a usual situation. We're taking an action now that seems to be indicated by the circumstances."
That comment seemed to be a reference to the reaction that greeted the budget, which was passed on June 12.
It was criticized by many fiscal analysts and government monitors, who said it relied on too many stopgap measures, avoided tough decisions and threw future budgets into jeopardy. Standard & Poor's, which began to review its rating with the adoption of the budget, was among those critics.
Some analysts also maintained that the Mayor had shied away from making significant and necessary cuts in the city's budget because he feared alienating supporters in an election year.
Perhaps for the same reason, the Mayor yesterday did not publicly announce the amount of the reductions in this year's budget, preferring instead to emphasize the cuts that would take effect in the next fiscal years. Senior administration officials supplied the amount of the current cuts but would speak only vaguely about their impact.
Though mayors often tinker with spending plans during the course of the year, it is rare for them to make cuts so soon after a budget has been passed. The moves seemed to indicate that Mr. Dinkins had been stung by criticism of his fiscal management and was trying to shore up his reputation as he readies for a bruising fall election campaign against Mr. Giuliani.
"It's highly unusual to begin a process of modifying the budget the day after the budget goes into effect," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group that monitors the city's finances. "Usually you have to wait until further in the year to see if you have any further problems in the way revenues are coming in or expenditures are going out. I would interpret this as the city starting early the process of cleaning up the mess that everybody recognized was in the 1994 budget."
Richard Bryers, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, declined to comment on the cuts ordered by Mr. Dinkins for the current year, saying that Mr. Giuliani had not yet seen the proposals.
Standard & Poor's evaluation of the city's fiscal health differed from that of another major credit-rating firm, Moody's, which has pegged the city's bonds at a lower rating.
A downgrade of the city's rating would have forced it to pay perhaps $3.5 million in extra interest for each offering of $700 million in new bonds, which are used to finance roads, sewers, schools and other projects. Typically, the city issues $4 billion in new bonds annually. A downgrade also would have prevented mutual funds and bank trust departments that limit their investments to bonds with at least an A- rating from buying city bonds.
Mr. Dinkins tried to put the best face on the new cuts by emphasizing themes that he has often turned to during his tenure: that he has balanced all his budgets, that the recession has limited his options, and that the Federal and state governments must pay more attention to urban problems.
Senior administration officials said they would spend the next few weeks compiling a list of specific reductions that they would present at a meeting next month of the state's Financial Control Board,

HEADLINE: HAITIAN MILITARY IS SAID TO ACCEPT PLAN TO END CRISIS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
In what they described as a breakthrough in efforts to resolve the political crisis in Haiti, United Nations negotiators said yesterday that they had won the approval of Haiti's army commanders for a series of steps aimed at returning the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power by Oct. 30.
Father Aristide withheld agreement from the settlement proposed by the United Nations, however, holding out for a more rapid schedule for his return to power, the negotiators and aides to Father Aristide said. 
 The reported agreement by the military commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, put the international negotiators in what they said was the uncomfortable position of pressing Father Aristide for his approval after many long months of diplomacy, pressure and sanctions carried out on his behalf.
 
Removal of Sanctions Proposed
 Under the proposed settlement, a global embargo on oil and arms sales to Haiti imposed by the United Nations would be suspended after Father Aristide picks a new Prime Minister who would be ratified by the Haitian Parliament, a process that could take weeks.
The fact that the sanctions would not be lifted right away was apparently intended to make sure that the transition to a new government would be well under way first. The embargo was imposed by the United States and other leaders of the United Nations Security Council to force the Haitian military to agree to withdraw from power.
The pressure on Father Aristide to accept the terms of the accord was considerable, since the terms signed by General Cedras had been proposed by the United Nations mediator, Dante Caputo, and supported by the United States.
 
'A Golden Opportunity'
 In a statement in Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that it would be "highly desirable that President Aristide agree" to the proposals.
"We think that they present a reasonable solution and approach to this matter," he said. Late Thursday, Mr. Christopher called Father Aristide himself, according to members of Haiti's presidential delegation, to reinforce the point, calling the settlement "a golden opportunity."
Negotiators for both Father Aristide and General Cedras have been meeting in the United States Coast Guard Officers' Club and various residences on Governor's Island in New York harbor. Both men were on the island last night as discussions went ahead, but they did not meet.
There have been several times when hopes for a resolution arose only to be crushed by word that one party or the other remained inflexible on some aspect of the talks that the negotiators thought was about to be settled. Diplomats and advisers to the exiled President said yesterday that Father Aristide was urging United Nations mediators to move up the date for his return, making it much earlier than the Oct. 30 date agreed to by General Cedras.
Father Aristide was also reportedly pushing for the immediate retirement of General Cedras, along with that of other military leaders.
 
Cedras Would Resign
 Under the United Nations plan put before both sides early Thursday, General Cedras would resign his command only days before Father Aristide's return.
Diplomats said that several other crucial issues on the transition of power remained to be settled. Among these were the deployment under the authority of the United Nations of hundreds of international assistants with expertise in fields as varied as police work and military training, construction and economic development.
Senior United Nations officials visited the talks on Wednesday, saying that a timetable of four months was necessary because of the need to resolve these issues. But Father Aristide's advisers said yesterday that they remained unconvinced that it cannot be done sooner.
As early as next week, Haitian political parties were expected to begin meeting, probably at the headquarters of the Organization of American States in Washington, to discuss the formation of a new government with Father Aristide.
 
Amnesty for the Army
 Under the transition plan, the Parliament would also pass an amnesty for members of the Haitian army covering their involvement in political crimes related to the coup, and shortly before the President's return, a new commander would be named who would then name a new army high command.
A huge international economic development package would be started for Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, in an attempt to alleviate the poverty, which has grown much worse since the coup. In the first announcement of the aid, Washington said Thursday that it would release $37.5 million almost immediately after a settlement to create jobs and help restructure the army.
Another senior official said the current plan does not envision American participation in an international police force, in part because there is a desire to use French speakers.
The United States also does not want to have a large military or police force in Haiti because any American military presence in the region is politically sensitive.
 
Problems With Timing
 Emerging from a second session with United Nations mediators late yesterday afternoon, Father Aristide's envoy to Washington, Jean Casimir, told reporters that the United Nations proposal "contains all the elements necessary for a return of democracy" but that the presidential delegation had problems with "timing and sequence."
Mr. Casimir said his delegation hoped that, with "some concessions from both sides," an agreement could be reached.
Diplomats involved in the talks said that there was no prospect of obtaining an immediate resignation of the military leaders and that Father Aristide would have to trust the international negotiators' guarantees of "constant monitoring and verification" of compliance by both sides with the settlement's terms.
"If something happens, we'll know who is responsible and how to impose penalties," one diplomat said.
 
Overhaul of the High Command
 After hundreds of deaths in his country at the hands of soldiers since the coup in September 1991, Father Aristide has pressed for an immediate overhaul of the army command, particularly because its members have frustrated past diplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing about his return.
Aides to the President say the army is delaying handing over power partly because of huge profits it has reaped through control of much of the economy, as well as from drug-smuggling and other illegal activities.
Some diplomats were openly exasperated by the slow progress in the talks and the delay in Father Aristide's approval after a breakthrough was achieved with the army.
Diplomats said the Haitian military delegation had served notice it would wait until the last possible moment to sign the document before its return to Haiti today.

HEADLINE: Foster Care's Horrors Argue for Intact Families

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For every horror story Patrick Murphy cites in "Family Preservation and Its Victims" (Op-Ed, June 19), I can give 10 examples of the horrors of his preference: continued overreliance on foster care.
Eighteen-month-old Sara Eyerman was taken from her mother in California because child welfare authorities thought she wasn't growing fast enough. Six weeks later, she was dead of viral pneumonia because those same authorities ignored her 104-degree fever for two days. 
 Two-year-old Joey Huot was taken from his parents in Philadelphia because they were fighting with each other -- and placed in foster care with a convicted rapist. Three months later, Joey Huot was dead. The foster parents were convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
Five-year-old Melissa King was placed in foster care in Tampa, Fla. Two months later, she was dead after a beating so severe it ruptured her spinal cord. The foster mother was convicted of murder.
Mr. Murphy cites two deaths in family preservation programs and claims they are not isolated cases, but offers no evidence. In contrast, though the majority of foster parents are excellent, evidence of widespread abuse in foster care is overwhelming.
A Baltimore study found abuse in 28 percent of the homes examined. A second Baltimore study found four times the number of substantiated reports of sexual abuse in foster care as in the general population. And when alumni of what is said to be an exemplary, model foster care program in the Pacific Northwest were questioned, 24 percent of the girls said they were victims of actual or attempted sexual abuse in their foster homes.
Family preservation is not only more humane than foster care. It's also safer than foster care.
Mr. Murphy cites only one study of the impact of family preservation on placement rates. Other studies have found dramatic benefits, including a reduction in placement. After an extensive review of the literature, the Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy (the "Little Hoover Commission") concluded that the studies have produced mixed results, but there has been more than enough success to justify a major expansion of family preservation in that state.
We can, and should, debate the extent to which family preservation is a proven success. But this much we surely know: Foster care is a proven failure.

HEADLINE: Foster Care's Horrors Argue for Intact Families;
Assault on the Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The cleverness of Patrick T. Murphy's challenge to pending Federal family preservation legislation (Op-Ed, June 19) masks an insensitive assault on poor families who struggle to contend with inadequate housing, insufficient employment opportunities and the unavailability of decent child care. As Mr. Murphy has done repeatedly in Illinois, he argues from a handful of horror stories about families who have brutalized their children, concluding that family preservation dollars spent on parents charged with neglecting or abusing their children is wasted money.
Yet Mr. Murphy's tales bear little resemblance to the vast majority of families who face state intervention based on charges that they have failed to take proper care of their children. Most of the parents who populate the halls of our country's juvenile courts are not child abusers, but individuals who have been charged with "inadequate supervision" or "environmental neglect," and who have fallen short of society's high standards in their struggle to feed, clothe and house their families on pitifully inadequate resources. 
 Family preservation funds may spare many of these children from the horrors of the woefully inadequate foster care system that awaits them once they are removed from their homes.
Mr. Murphy's demonization of parents supported by family preservation funds -- most of whom come from low-income and minority backgrounds -- has little connection to the mundane routine of a typical juvenile court. It is simply wrongheaded to think that economic conditions have little to do with what distinguishes "good" parents from "bad" parents.
Congress should recognize that family preservation is not "patronizing," but rather a recognition that children generally do best with their families, and that even "good" parents may sometimes need a little extra help.

HEADLINE: In U.S., South Africa Leaders Press Clinton for Aid

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk held separate meetings with President Clinton today, underscoring their position as political rivals but individually carrying the message that each views American economic assistance as vital to South Africa's future as a multiracial democracy.
A crucial step will be to lift economic sanctions against South Africa. That awaits a signal from Mr. Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, which led the worldwide campaign that resulted in the sanctions being imposed on the white-minority government there. 
 Mr. Mandela, who had hoped to call for lifting the sanctions during his current two-week tour in the United States, said a debate over how South Africa will be run until free elections next April could delay for three weeks a decision on lifting the sanctions.
 
Reassured Americans
 But today, as Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk, the South African President, crisscrossed Washington on a busy schedule of closely parallel but separate meetings, both men sought to reassure Americans that the negotiating process in South Africa was on track and that business investment would be welcome there.
"We are keen to insure that sanctions are lifted as soon as possible," Mr. Mandela said after meeting with Mr. Clinton.
"We will make the necessary breakthroughs," Mr. de Klerk said earlier, after a session with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "It is just a matter of time."
In a statement after the meetings, the White House said that at next week's economic summit in Tokyo, the United States would press for a commitment "to reintegrate South Africa into the world economy," contingent on further progress toward a nonracial democracy.
A senior Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonimity, said that could include discussions on lifting sanctions imposed on South Africa by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The statement said Mr. Clinton praised both Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk during the respective 30-minute meetings and pledged that the United States "would be a full partner in building democracy in South Africa, including continued support for programs of voter education and training of election monitors."
The Bush Administration lifted Federal sanctions against South Africa, but some 29 states and more than 100 cities, including New York, maintain them. The United States also continues to support the sanctions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela agree that help from the world lenders is needed to help stave off the nation's deepest recession of the century, which has left nearly half of the country's black population unemployed.
 
Criticized Opponents
 Both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela used their appearances in Washington to criticize their opponents and to state the importance of keeping the negotiating process on track.
Mr. de Klerk referred to the "lunatic fringes" on the left and right in South Africa, and Mr. Mandela, answering a question during an appearance at the Freedom Forum in Arlington, Va., sharply upbraided the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, an influential Zulu leader who prefers a federation to the unified state supported by Mr. Mandela.
In a recent meeting with Mr. Buthelezi, Mr. Mandela said he told him: "In effect, you are saying: 'I want to be ruled by whites. I am not prepared to take over power.' " Mr. Mandela said he told Mr. Buthelezi that was an odd position for a black leader to take.
Mr. Mandela's day also included a luncheon with about 20 prominent black political, labor and business leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, the presidents of the N.A.A.C.P. and the Urban League, and officials from Phillip Morris, Coca-Cola and Anheuser-Busch.
 
Chided on Sanctions
 Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk refrained for the most part from criticizing each other. Mr. de Klerk did chide Mr. Mandela for not moving more quickly on sanctions.
For his part, Mr. Mandela said of Mr. de Klerk: "He did not impose sanctions. He has no right to set any timetable for their removal."

HEADLINE: In Weary Town, Mississippi Shows Its Might

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAFTON, Ill., July 2

 BODY:
The last time the Mississippi River betrayed this town this badly, it flooded Betty Gerber's street two blocks away. She and her four children were forced to live for eight weeks without electricity or cooking gas in their mobile home.
When the river finally retreated far enough, she ran an extension cord to the local car wash so she could operate her refrigerator and a small fan. 
 That nightmare was only two months ago. "This time is worse," Ms. Gerber said today of the rising river that threatens to close downtown. "I think this town is jinxed.'
Indeed, the mighty Mississippi will not leave tiny Grafton alone. It has been taunting this town of antiques shops and fruit stands since the broken promise that was springtime here. For 104 days in a row, the Mississippi and its cousin the Illinois River have been at or above flood stage along Grafton: 18 feet in this stretch of muddy banks and limestone bluffs about 45 miles from St. Louis. Grafton is where the two rivers merge.
 
Town Is Not Alone
 "The river won't stop coming," said Paul Arnold, the city's overworked flood coordinator, "and people are really getting frustrated and depressed. I've seen a lot of eyes filled with tears."
Grafton has been under siege for months, but it is not alone. For more than a week the Mississippi has been spilling over its banks from St. Paul to St. Louis, 500 miles of damage and disruption.
The flooding has stalled commercial shipping traffic on the river for two weeks or longer. Some estimates put the losses to barge companies at $1 million a day -- and climbing with every rise of the Mississippi.
The Mark Twain bridge connecting Hannibal, Mo., to Illinois was closed early today because of high water.
The river has crested in St. Paul and is expected to crest in Davenport, Iowa, on Saturday at 22.3 feet, just shy of the river's record level in Davenport of 22.5 feet in 1965. Still, Davenport has evacuated 600 people from low-lying areas, and 200 members of the Iowa National Guard have been called to help sandbag and patrol the city. President Clinton is expected to tour the Davenport riverfront on Sunday.
 
1,000 Barges Stalled
 Before touring parts of Missouri, Illinois and Iowa by air today, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said in St. Louis that the flooding was beginning to "devastate" the region's economy.
"We are very concerned about the impact to all the communities up and down the Mississippi," the Secretary said today, with the river pouring over its banks in a downtown St. Louis park. "It's clear to me that this is a significant impact already."
Up to 1,000 barges are being prevented from traveling on the river, he said, the equivalent of 40,000 trucks stalled on a highway.
The flooding has soaked businesses and spirits. It has closed bridges and streets and forced at least one post office to move. It has caused millions of dollars in losses to towns and businesses that have grown up along its banks because of the river's charms, beauty and access to markets.
"When the river stays where it's supposed to, it's a great attraction; there's nothing like it," said the Mayor of Grafton, Gerald Nairn. "But when it jumps its banks, look out. You better find a high hill and wait it out."
 
Much Under Water
 In Grafton, the river was at 25.5 feet and capturing dry ground like an advancing army. A fish stand has closed because the customers cannot get there without a boat: the lot has disappeared under the water.
So far, the river has covered Water Street, a parking lot, a bike path, stop signs, boat docks, mailboxes, backyards, fences, trees, grills, hopes, dreams and an overstuffed trash bin.
This morning, 20 families packed their belongings. The city had told the 132 families and businesses along the river to move to higher ground, before it was too late. While the city itself does not have the resources to help people move, a group of Baptist volunteers from other towns has arrived to help residents pack up and move.
All the houses in town are still standing, even though some, like Julie Zimmerman's, are in six feet of water. Since April, Ms. Zimmerman has slept wherever she could find a dry place. She has not lived in her house on Water Street since flooding forced her to live like a refugee. She first moved in with friends, but the river flooded them out, too. Then she moved into an apartment rented by the Red Cross. That was flooded on Saturday. On Monday, she slept in her car. Now she has moved on to other friends.
With the crest expected to be even higher this time, Ms. Zimmerman guided a pontoon boat up to her house to retrieve a cedar chest full of clothes and her daughter's computer. The April flooding had knocked her porch down, blocking the front door, so she had to climb in through a window.
 
River 'Like an Old Friend'
 "A lot of people who weren't here before are really upset about the flooding," she said. "I don't like it either. I bought my house in 1986 and had to move out six weeks later because of flooding. But I was baptized here, my family's here, so I'll clean up and start all over. Most of the time the Mississippi is like an old friend."
By Monday, town officials said, the river will be at 28 feet, licking at the edge of Main Street. When that happens, officials say the town will be closed off to outsiders, an unsettling prospect here because so much of Grafton's survival depends on the tourist trade that stops to fuel up on its way to a nearby state park, browse the craft shops or splash in the Raging Rivers Water Park, which is on high enough ground on the outskirts to escape the Mississippi's advance.
Grafton has also begun requiring special flood travel passes to enter certain parts of town.
Sandbags are one approach this town of 1,000 residents is not even trying. "It won't do any good," Mayor Nairn said.
The river is expected to crest here at 30 feet on Tuesday -- two feet higher than during the April flooding, which forced 25 businesses to close for 36 days.
 
Harm to Businesses
 One business that shut down in April was Uncle Andy's Corner Market, operated by Brenda Dublo. Water was more than an inch deep on the store's floor. Now the river is coming back again, and is beginning to wear her spirit down.
"I don't know from day to day if I'm going to be able to get into my store," Ms. Dublo said. "I'm doing about half of what I normally do at this time of year."
But, she said, she's better off and drier than many other merchants in town. "A lot of businesses say they just aren't going to be able to come out of this again," she said. "They're going to go belly up."
For the last week or so, Mayor Nairn has held a daily flood briefing at 1 P.M. for whoever shows up. On Thursday, about 40 people, mostly townspeople, showed up and nodded their heads in solemn knowing agreement when he said, "You people with flood insurance better get ready to use it."
Then Paul Main's voice and humor spread through the room. "This just proves what I've always said about Grafton," said Mr. Main, a 64-year-old lifetime resident. "Grafton is between a rock and a wet place, and the wet place is getting bigger."

Date Set for First Election

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 2

 BODY:
South Africa's major political parties today confirmed next April 27 as the date for elections that will end white rule and ratified a set of constitutional principles that amounted to a repudiation of the country's political past.
Seven of the 26 parties, including the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and the white separatist Conservative Party, voted against setting a date for the elections, saying several key aspects of the future state have not been resolved. 
 Although a few of the dissenters stalked from the meeting room moments before adjournment, Joseph Matthews, the head of the Inkatha delegation, said the party had no plans to withdraw from the talks.
"In two weeks, after the break, we will be here," he told reporters.
 
Progress, But Limited
 Leaders of the African National Congress said they were delighted by the progress at the negotiations and the fact that no party had yet abandoned the process. But they said the agreements so far have fallen short of the congress's criteria for lifting economic sanctions against South Africa.
Cyril Ramaphosa, the congress's chief negotiator, said leaders of the organization would meet after Nelson Mandela returns from the United States in mid-July to consider revising their conditions. A.N.C. officials predicted that a call for the repeal of sanctions is no more than a few weeks away.
By consensus, the parties endorsed a set of binding constitutional principles that would commit future governments to Western-style democracy.

Winnie Mandela Pays a Fine
 JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (AP) -- Winnie Mandela paid an outstanding fine today that was imposed by an appeals court for her conviction in the kidnapping of four people, a court official said.
An arrest warrant for Mrs. Mandela, the estranged wife of Nelson Mandela, was issued this week because she had failed to pay the $4,500 fine imposed on June 2.
Mrs. Mandela was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault in the beating of four young black men at her Soweto home. Instead of a five-year prison term, Mrs. Mandela was given the option of paying the fine or spending one year in jail. She was also ordered to pay $1,500 to the victims.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Some Searing Criticism Of Foreign Bond Funds

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
THE P.R. guy at the table was twitching, but Nicholas Bratt pressed ahead with his argument that the benefits of investing abroad come only from stocks. Foreign bonds? "I think they are speculative," said the star manager of the Scudder International Fund, with a percussive British accent on the last word.
The P.R. guy interjected that Scudder happens to have a top-performing international bond fund -- with just over $1 billlion, by far the most popular no-load fund in its category. No matter. Mr. Bratt insisted that only stocks compensate for currency risk by letting investors benefit from rising corporate earnings. "You get bailed out in equities, not bonds," he said. 
 Add Mr. Bratt to the small but prominent band of mutual fund executives willing to warn against the foreign income and bond funds that have sucked in so much money since United States interest rates sank to such unrewarding levels.
Mr. Bratt and his allies see great advantages in foreign stocks. United States shares are far more expensive, relative to their earnings, than European shares. Economic growth and earnings gains are likely to be stronger in Asia and Latin America than in the United States.
Such earnings growth allows shareholders to profit from higher stock prices and dividends. Bondholders get their fixed income, nothing more.
Foreign bond and income funds continue to multiply, with 19 making their debut in the 12 months ended in May, for a total of 94, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Assets totaled $30.4 billion. Investors traumatized by losses in last September's currency turmoil registered more than $5 billion in net redemptions through March, but became net buyers again in April and May,
They often buy and sell at the wrong time. "When everybody's talking about high interest rates abroad, the money comes pouring in," said John C. Bogle, the crusty chairman of the Vanguard Group. "When something bad happens, the money goes out."
Mr. Bogle is most skeptical about short-term global income funds, which often draw investors who think that short-term foreign debt is as stable as domestic debt. Investors who saw the value of their global income funds fall by 10 percent or more in a few days last September got a quick lesson in currency risk.
Customers shopping for what they think is a high, stable return face further danger: The more these global income funds lunge for high yields, the harder they fall. As with junk bond funds, too many buyers of global income funds confused yield, or current payout, with total returns. Total returns can become negative if the value of a fund's securities declines.
Over the last year, the highest-yielding currencies have been the most vulnerable to sudden devaluation. The Pilgrim Short-Term Multi-Market Income Fund (beware of any fund with more than five words in its name) still boasted a 9.2 percent yield in May, but currency losses had cost shareholders almost a fifth of their investment over the previous 12 months.
At the end of last year, Pilgrim turned in desperation to a new, outside adviser. A Pilgrim executive proudly noted that during the first quarter, the fund finished just above the average of similar offerings, but didn't add that the total return was just four-hundredths of 1 percent. At that rate, $1,000 invested in the fund Jan. 1 would earn $1.60 this year. And that's before a 3.5 percent, or $35, load.
Many investors in global income funds have shifted their money from savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Since these funds often attract investors who know little about currency markets, the Dreyfus Corporation has resisted introducing one. "We were worried that people would not understand the risks involved," said Diane M. Coffey, a spokeswoman for Dreyfus. "They would be buying them for the wrong reasons." Dreyfus does plan to introduce a foreign bond fund in a few months, under the assumption that investors are prepared for volatility from bonds.
The most successful foreign income and bond funds have hedged some of their currencies. Money managers can use swaps, options, forward contracts and other means of transferring the risks. Some mutual funds don't hedge at all, and generally say so in their prospectuses. Otherwise, investors are left guessing how much their fund hedges, and how great their currency risks are. The cost of hedging eats into the returns, to the point that 100 percent protection against currency risks would leave investors with yields no better than they can get from United States securities.
The T. Rowe Price International Bond Fund switches its hedging strategies depending on its currency outlook. Founded in 1986, well before most similar funds, it returned an average of 7.3 percent annually for the five years through March.
Mr. Bogle of Vanguard, ever willing to needle a competitor, said that despite its size and success, the T. Rowe Price fund had been tossed about by jittery investors. The fund's managers say that of the $450 million in the fund at the beginning of last year, about $400 million was long-term money. The fund's assets peaked at $612 million in August. During Europe's currency turmoil in September, the fund fell 6.5 percent in 10 days, almost wiping out the year-to-date income.
Many investors then fled. By the end of the year, losses and withdrawals trimmed the fund to $520 million. It has since rebounded and recaptured money to be near its peak.
William F. Wendler, an executive with the T. Rowe Price foreign funds, says that despite the perils, foreign bond and income offerings deserve attention from investors who want to diversify and capture higher yields. He delicately adds that investors might buy a foreign stock fund first. "The risk-reward ratio for international equity investments appears to be higher than it is for bond investments," he said. But most mutual fund executives are tempted to give investors what they want, not just what's best for them.

HEADLINE: Long Bond's Yield at a Low of 6.66%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices advanced broadly yesterday after a weak employment report put to rest market fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates soon to combat inflation.
Increases in long-term bond prices, however, were muted by inflation concerns during a second consecutive day of sharp gains in commodity prices. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond advanced 9/32 point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 6.66 percent, from 6.68 percent late Thursday.
Yesterday's long Treasury yield was the lowest since the Treasury began regular sales of 30-year bonds in 1977. Previous record lows were set only last Monday and Friday, as further evidence of a soft economic recovery dampened inflation fears and prompted buying.
 
Anemic Payroll Increase
 Bond prices spurted yesterday after the Labor Department's morning report that nonfarm payroll jobs increased by an anemic 13,000 in June, far below economists' expectations of as much as a 150,000 advance. The jobs survey had shown increases of more than 200,000 in each of the previous two months.
The Government also said the nation's unemployment rate edged up to 7 percent in June from 6.9 percent in May, and that manufacturing jobs declined for the fourth straight month.
The employment report led to particularly strong buying of short-term securities, whose value would be hurt the most by a central bank action.
The jobs report "raises questions about the durability of the job market expansion that we had seen recently," said Alan Levenson, money-market economist at UBS Securities Inc. "The general sentiment is that the Fed is on hold for the foreseeable future."
Mr. Levenson and other economists said the central bank would be hard pressed to raise interest rates in light of the June employment data, since higher rates can drag down growth.
But yesterday, another sharp advance in the Commodity Research Bureau index, considered a harbinger of inflation trends, prompted some selling of long-term bonds.
 
Wheat and Soybeans Soar
 The index rose 2.43 points, to 212.16, after a surge of 2.61 points on Thursday, amid rocketing prices of wheat and soybeans futures brought on by rain-damaged crops in the Midwest.
Long bonds were also hurt by concern that weakness in the economy might jeopardize President Clinton's deficit-reduction package, said William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
"Lower returns in the bond market have been predicated on effective deficit-cutting legislation," Mr. Sullivan said.
The market recovered most of its earlier gains, however, as traders squared up their trading strategies in the holiday-abbreviated session. The Treasury market closed at 2 P.M. in advance of the Fourth of July holiday.
Short-term Treasuries were up 1/8 point to 7/32 point and intermediate maturities rose 3/16 point to 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.35, to 1,309.32.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down to 2.99 percent as the discount dropped 0.04 percentage point, to 2.94 percent. Six-month yields were lower at 3.13 percent as the discount fell 0.05 point, to 3.05 percent. One-year yields were down to 3.31 percent as the discount fell 0.07 point, to 3.20 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 1029/16, up 1/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.72 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Trading And Gold Slips in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against most major foreign currencies yesterday, despite a disappointing report on job growth in June.
Gold prices fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with gold for August delivery closing $1.50 lower at $386.70 an ounce, after climbing $5.40, to $393.60, a level unseen since the Persian Gulf war in January 1991. 
 Ben Pugliesi, chief dealer and director of precious metals at the Swiss Bank in New York, attributed the move up to a follow-through on Thursday's strong gains and some technical factors.
 
Disappointment in Data
 Traders said the dollar's action was driven in early New York trading by the Government's June employment report, which showed that the jobless rate rose to 7 percent from 6.9 percent in May. Manufacturing jobs declined for the fourth straight month, the Government said, and the overall economy gained just 13,000 new jobs.
One trader said the market was looking for job growth of about 125,000.
"We had some impact from the number that we saw, the unemployment number showing almost no job growth," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
Many traders left their desks early to get a jump on the Fourth of July weekend, and trading volume was relatively light, said Lee Kassler, a senior trader at the National Westminster Bank USA in Jersey City. That exaggerated the dollar's movement, both up and down, he explained.
In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 107.93 yen, down 0.17 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, it rose to 108.70 yen. In New York, the dollar traded late at 108.55 yen, up from 107.38 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5080 from $1.5085. In New York, the pound traded late at $1.5075, down from $1.5150 late on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6965 German marks, up from 1.6950; 1.5115 Swiss francs, up from 1.5095; 5.7383 French francs, up from 5.7240; 1,540.00 Italian lire, down from 1,542.00, and 1.2873 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2874.

HEADLINE: A New Glimmer of Recovery For New Jersey Employment

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In a continuing improvement, the unemployment rate in New Jersey fell in June to 6.9 percent from 7.4 percent in May, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. June was the first month since January 1992 that New Jersey, one of the states hit hardest by the recession, posted a rate below the national figure.
The Federal report said that the unemployment rates in New York State and New York City remained worse in June than the nationwide rate, which rose to 7 percent from the 6.9 percent of May. 
 The rate for New York State rose to 7.8 percent in June from 7.5 percent in May. For New York City, the rate in June was 9.4 percent, down from 9.5 percent in May.
The rate for Connecticut was not available, because it is not among the 11 large industrial states for which the Federal Government releases monthly employment data at the same time it releases the national figures.
The improvement in New Jersey has been pronounced, considering the dismal levels reached early in the spring. In April, after three months of economic deterioration, the New Jersey rate was up to 9.1 percent, the highest that month for any of the 11 big industrial states.
The upturn may have political ramifications, with Gov. Jim Florio in a tight gubernatorial campaign against Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate. She has said Mr. Florio's economic policies have played a role in creating New Jersey's economic problems.
The lower rate reported yesterday "seems to offer proof that New Jersey may be on the right road to economic recovery," said Ray Bramucci, Commissioner of the state's Department of Labor. He added, however, that he and others in the Florio administration "continue to keep our enthusiasm under control."
"We still need a faster rate of growth nationally to accelerate the rate of job creation in New Jersey," he said.
New Jersey's unemployment rate for June put the state in a tie with Pennsylvania for fourth-best performance among the 11 industrial states. The states with lower unemployment for June were North Carolina (5.4 percent), Ohio (5.8 percent) and Massachusetts (6 percent).

Oil prices tumbled yesterday to the lowest level since before the Persian Gulf war 30 months ago as traders, reacting to comments by an American official, speculated that a ban on Iraqi crude oil exports might soon be lifted.
The August futures contract for domestic crude fell 50 cents, to $17.95 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after the United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, told reporters in Geneva that the United States would not object to a resumption of Iraqi exports if Iraq met United Nations conditions when Iraqi and United Nations officials meet on Wednesday.
 
A Long-Held U.S. Position
 Although her comments reflected a long-held American position and she said the oil proceeds could be used only for humanitarian purposes approved by the United Nations, traders speculated that a resumption of exports was imminent. They cited the fact that her comments came five days after American missiles severely damaged Saddam Hussein's military intelligence center in Baghdad. 
 Analysts said deteriorating health and economic conditions in Iraq, and widespread opposition among Arab leaders to the bombing attack on Sunday, might have prompted the Administration's reaffirmation of its policy. Iraq has also indicated that it will not retaliate for the bombings.
But an imminent resumption of Iraqi exports poses enormous troubles for the 12 nations in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The members are currently producing a total of 24.5 million barrels a day, or a million barrels more than the quotas set a month ago.
Iraq would add at least 500,000 barrels a day, and perhaps as much as 800,000 barrels at its current production capacity, under proposed United Nations terms. Those terms would limit its total revenue to $1.6 billion, regardless of price, over the next two years.
Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said those conditions put President Hussein in a position to punish his bitter enemies in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- and not harm Iraq -- by selling oil at any price.
"Kuwait will have to make room for its vanquished foe" by agreeing to reduce its oil output, "or it's going to pay a terrible economic price in lower oil revenues," Mr. Verleger said. "The dynamics look to be very bad. It's going to be very nasty."
He said that before "cooler heads prevail in OPEC," prices could drop to $10 a barrel this summer if the worst case developed, similar to a plunge to $9.75 in 1986.
Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Merrill Lynch, said OPEC would likely respond to a pact between the United Nations and Iraq with an emergency meeting to force lower production quotas on its members. But, he said, the organization lacks the discipline to hold to tighter limits.
Kuwait ignored OPEC pressure last month to scale back its rising output of 1.6 million barrels, and Saudi Arabia, which had claimed virtually all of Iraq's output of three million barrels a day after the Persian Gulf war, refused to cut its production below eight million barrels.
Like all OPEC members, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are desperate for revenue to finance spending programs. With no other producers likely to curb their output voluntarily, a pricing battle seems likely.
"Iraq's thinking is, even if they get $5 for their oil, that's $5 more than what they are getting now," Mr. Barakat said. "With that kind of thinking, no one can tell what is the bottom of this market." Iraq could expand its output if it has cash to buy equipment and expertise from willing suppliers in India, Mr. Verleger said.
Norman P. Higby, an energy forecaster in Menlo Park, Calif., said President Hussein might not agree to the United Nations terms to lift the crude export ban if the United Nations insisted on controlling all of the export revenues. Ms. Albright told reporters that the revenue would be used for humanitarian purposes.
"Saddam doesn't care about prices, or the number of barrels, he just cares about how much money he'll get -- for himself," Mr. Higby said. "His goal is to negotiate for some percentage of the revenues."

GRAIN AND SOYBEANS UP
 CHICAGO, July 3 (AP) -- Wheat and soybeans futures prices rose to new highs on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday amid reports of yet more rain in important growing areas. Corn futures also gained.
Wheat futures surged in heavy trading to two-month highs, amid talk that heavy overnight rain in Kansas would cause the mostly unharvested crop to be of low quality.
Soybeans futures prices also continued higher amid belief that the rain in the top two-producing states, Illinois and Iowa, would cause extensive damage and disease.
"Corn and wheat are trading higher on the emotions of soybeans' surge," said Mickey Luth, senior grains analyst with Merrill Lynch in Chicago. "But for the beans, there's still the issue of what can be planted if and when the rains ever stop, realizing that you're running out of time."
The optimal period for planting soybeans runs through the first week of July. The Agriculture Department said this week that about 11 percent of soybean acreage remained unplanted.

HEADLINE: Down on the Farm, With Russians

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 2

 BODY:
The average tourist driving through the Midwest might not notice neatly trimmed farmhouse lawns, but along with spotless cheese factories, high-tech tractors and standard pickup trucks, such details can be inspiring to Russian farmers.
The sights are the hallmarks of a life style that gives people a far larger personal stake in their homes and workplaces than residents of the collective farms in Russia have. And the American life style -- not incidentally -- tends to be far more productive and attentive to the little things, like the way a home looks. 
 "Life is just completely different here and the main explanation has to be private property," said Vasily Uzun, a senior researcher at the Russian Agrarian Institute. Mr. Uzun saw all this and more as a member of a group of 20 Russian farm managers and agricultural experts who have been getting a top-to-bottom view of American agribusiness in the past two weeks.
The practice of dazzling Russian visitors with the prowess of American agriculture has become more frequent since the media-drenched visit of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to an Iowa corn farm in 1959.
The latest tour, which concentrated on Minnesota and California, was arranged by the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector investment arm of the World Bank, which is managing a large Russian agricultural privatization program. Its goal is to stir up a missionary zeal for privatization among Russians whose farms and ministries will be on the front lines of the investment company's program to create model private agricultural enterprises in Russia.
"What's important is not that they see exactly how an auction or anything else works, but just to see that it works," said Alan Bigman, a field manager for the investment company, as the group viewed a cattle sale early last week at the Central Livestock Association stockyard in South St. Paul, Minn.
Universities, foundations and agribusinesses have sponsored numerous other visits over the years, often with funds from the United States Agency for International Development.
Unlike many visitors, this group has been knowledgeable enough to zero in on some of the more disquieting aspects of the American farm scene, like tensions over regulations and worries about the high failure rate of small farms. They have been asking unusually detailed questions about everything from price supports to treatments for root diseases that affect barley, according to their hosts.
Like those before them, though, the latest visitors have been enthralled by the scenes their American counterparts take for granted. In addition to modern factories, which they expected to see, the Russians delighted in finding 40-year-old machinery chugging away like new. They heard farmers like themselves talk of crop yields, in some cases double their own, saw the distribution systems that get products anywhere in the nation with negligible spoilage, and visited market exchanges where buyers bid against each other for farm products.
 
Dividends of Ownership
 The Russians also heard farmers explain how they had created private trade groups to represent their interests in Washington and cooperatives to expand their financial opportunities.
The result, as officials of the investment company had hoped, has been a heightened conviction that private ownership pays big financial and psychic dividends. "It will be easier to try to convince people to change because now I'm convinced myself," said Lubov Bubnova, the chief agronomist of Emelianova, a farm collective 50 miles northeast of the city of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky, in central Russia.
Like most other farms that are edging toward privatization, Emelianova has technically been converted from a state-owned collective into a venture owned by its employees and the residents of the villages on it. But with no workable regulations in place on the distribution of ownership to individuals, the farm still operates as a collective. And, lacking networks of private suppliers and product processors, it remains a cog in a Government-run agricultural apparatus that routinely loses to spoilage 20 percent or more of the output of various sectors.
 
Six Farms Chosen
 Mrs. Bubnova's farm is one of six that I.F.C. officials, who are based in Nizhny Novgorod, have picked as candidates to lead the way to privatization. The farms range from 4,000 to 15,000 acres and employ 100 to 500 administrators and laborers. The collectives are also the homes for hundreds of retirees, who will receive shares of any land distribution.
Officials of the investment company said the leadership of Nizhny Novgorod in privatizing small retail businesses and the trucking industry, coupled with the progressive attitudes of Boris Nemtsov, the 33-year-old provincial governor, make the region -- which is about the size of Ireland -- the best place to tackle the daunting problem of privatizing agriculture. "If it can't work in Nizhny, it isn't going to work anywhere," said Jeanne Segal, a spokeswoman for the I.F.C. in Washington.
Several of the visitors said they knew they were being shown the brighter side of American agriculture, but expressed confidence that what they had seen was representative of the benefits of giving farmers and private investors direct ownership in their operations.
 
Signs of Contrast
 The telltale signs, they said, were common roadside sights. The farmhouse lawns, they said, contrasted with the generally unkempt residential groups of the cooperative farms. And the large number of pickup trucks on dealer lots and in farmyards suggested that many people owned a class of individually oriented utility vehicles virtually unknown in Russia. Others commented on the lack of drunken workers or the guards who are employed to prevent the property thefts that plague the collectives.
The Russians rarely batted an eye at the technology deployed by the American farmers. They quickly understood a demonstration at the stockyard in St. Paul of a new electronic auction system that allowed hogs to be sold without shipping them to St. Paul or another association yard.
Several of the visitors accepted the invitation to use a keyboard to go through the motions of bidding. And they were more tickled than awed when invited to take top-of-the-line tractors and cultivators at the John Deere dealership in Elbow Lake, Minn., for test drives around the lot.
 
A Web of Cooperation
 What really impressed them was the intricacy of the web of cooperating and competing enterprises that drives the system and its insistent focus on marketing.
Several members of the group stared in fascination at the almost imperceptible bidding motions of buyers at the stockyard auction and wistfully compared it with being forced to sell all their cattle to the nearest state processor without bargaining over price. Worse still, they said, the processor would simply freeze the meat because there was no dependable way to distribute it while it is fresh.
Not everyone has derived the same lessons for Soviet privatization from such sights. Mikhail Goloshev, the deputy director of the Nizhny Novgorod Department of Agriculture, said he thought Russia should struggle less over questions of who owns enterprises and more on how to force them to compete.
 
Disagreement on Emphasis
 And even among those who believed the most vital step was to create private enterprises, there was widespread disagreement over whether what they had seen favored an emphasis on creating a few large farms out of each collective or many small enterprises that would give greater scope for individual initiative.
Those attuned to smaller-scale entrepeneurship were intrigued by their visit to Eichten's Hidden Acres Cheese Farm in Center City, Minn. The Eichtens sold their dairy herd during a Government buyout program in 1986 aimed at cutting milk production and had successfully branched into making specialty cheeses and raising bison for meat.
The debate over the size of the farms was serious and one of several that led to boisterous banter on the bus. But some Russians saw it as a disguised battle over the amount of power that would remain with the traditional administrators and bureaucrats.
But there was also plenty of high spirits and humor, much of it self-deprecating. "In Russia, you have a drink to celebrate any contract," laughed Yevgeny Mikheev, watching the tumult of wheat trades in the pits of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange last week. "These guys never stop."

HEADLINE: Jobs Data Stagnant for June

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
The unemployment rate ticked back up to 7 percent in June as job growth nearly vanished after two months of solid gains, the Labor Department reported today.
The rise in unemployment, from 6.9 percent in May, was accompanied by the disappearance of 53,000 manufacturing jobs. The figures were weaker than anticipated, even allowing for the steady procession of disappointing economic figures in the last few weeks. 
 While economists found a few nuggets of favorable news in the report, a common view was that the business recovery, officially now in its 28th month, has become so enfeebled that the Clinton Administration's budget plan, relying heavily on tax increases, might bring it to a halt.
 
Republican Criticisms
 Bob Dole of Kansas, the leader of the Senate's Republicans, seized on today's report to contend that "the President's massive tax increase continues to haunt working America -- employers are scared to death, so they're simply not hiring."
At the White House, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the top economic adviser to Mr. Clinton, acknowledged the option of what she called "adjusting some of the phasing" of the budget measure to changes in economic conditions. The bill is now before a Senate-House conference.
But Ms. Tyson, after noting that a Republican filibuster had killed a stimulus measure that she said would already be starting to take effect, insisted that the measure's main goals -- deficit reduction and associated low interest rates -- were still the right formula. And while the economic recovery is "modest," she added, nearly a million jobs have been created so far this year, including upward revisions announced today for April and May.
 
Weakness in Manufacturing
 The discouragement among most private economists focused largely on a meager rise of 13,000 in payroll jobs, well under predictions of an increase approaching 150,000 and down sharply from May's robust gain of 215,000. Moderate gains in business, health and educational services and in restaurants and bars were largely offset by the fourth straight sizable drop at factories and by declines in wholesale trade and in stores selling general merchandise.
"What worries me most is the erosion in manufacturing," said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley. "You don't want to take that lightly."
Nearly 190,000 factory jobs have disappeared since February, and 1.7 million since January 1989, the figures showed, even as factory output has recently reached new peaks. While this implies higher productivity -- though diminished by the fact that many companies now contract out various nonmanufacturing functions -- it also means a loss in the short run of hefty paychecks that workers could use to buy goods.
Much of the June decline was in transportation, electronic equipment and instruments, reflecting cutbacks in military spending, said William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics.
Factory hours and overtime also fell slightly in June, though remaining at relatively high levels
Construction jobs edged down 6,000, after posting gains of 36,000 and 55,000 in April and May, respectively, the report also showed.
 
Confirmed by Another Survey
 The department's survey of about 60,000 households -- from which the unemployment rate is derived -- also showed little of the early-spring vigor, though this survey's remarkable May job surge of 857,000 was sustained.
June employment declined by 54,000, a development that combined with a small reduction in the labor force to raise the ranks of the jobless by 50,000, to 8,908,000.
The unemployment rate itself edged up one-tenth of a point, an amount the department considers statistically insignificant. In fact, the reported rise occurred because the complete figure, 6.953, rounded to 7 percent; the unrounded May figure was 6.913. So, while the June increase was the first reported rise in the jobless rate in a year, the change was "really zero," a department official said.
The number of part-time workers who wanted to work full time eased 258,000 in June, to 6,322,000, but this group of "involuntary" part-timers remains extraordinarily large in light of a business expansion that has been under way for more than two years.
After other recessions, the ranks of these workers had generally diminished by 17 percent after 27 months, but this time -- since March 1991 -- there are actually 5 percent more of them.
The number of discouraged workers -- those who have given up looking for jobs because they think they will not find one -- rose 68,000, to 1,202,000, in the department's quarterly tabulation. Since the third quarter of 1991, however, this gauge has been essentially flat.
Among the 11 biggest states for which figures were published today, only Massachusetts, where the unemployment rate eased to 6 percent from 6.7 percent, showed a change of any significance. But a small decline for New Jersey, to 6.9 percent, and a small rise for New York, to 7.8 percent, pointed up a notable shift since April. In that month, New Jersey had a 9.1 percent jobless rate, highest of any large state and 2.1 points above New York's. In June, the New Jersey rate was a shade below the national average.
 
Regional Results Evenly Split
 Regionally, the department reported that the Northeast and Midwest posted declines of one-tenth of a point last month, to 7.1 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively. The rate rose, however, by two-tenths of a point in the South and the West, to 6.6 and 7.9 percent.
While today's results deepened the gloom of the more pessimistic analysts, some thought the data exaggerated the weakness in the economy. This group was inclined to wait for July figures before worrying about an aborted recovery, especially since there are distortions in the labor market at this time of year for which the seasonal adjustment process may not be adequate.
In addition, the department's survey week is always the one that includes the 12th of the month, which fell on a Saturday last month. That put this June's survey so early in the month that it probably failed to capture the movements into and out of the work force of most high school students and teachers.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Giuliani's Strategy: Don't Give Dinkins a Target

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
For weeks, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, has given speeches ringing with an image of a new New York City, a place transformed by tough decisions, major reforms and fundamental change.
"The next mayor of New York is going to have to smash up the way in which we practice politics and we do business in this city," he announced at the City Club in May. Absent that, he warned, "This city is going to continue to deteriorate economically. It's going to continue to deteriorate financially. It's going to continue to deteriorate morally." 
 Thus far Mr. Giuliani's r4inging rhetoric has not been backed up with many specifics on the issues that will define the mayoral campaign. The image of Mr. Giuliani sitting behind the mayor';s desk is tough but vvague. Quite intentionally his campaign guided by the campaign tactician David Garth has remained as far as it can from the tangles of issues that define the city's course or lack of it.
Instead, following a carefully constructed plan to associate his candidacy with a romantic portrait of New York City on a comeback trail, he has talked of harmony and economic growth while mostly avoiding specifics and stirring resentment against his opponent, Mayor David N. Dinkins.
By ducking the minutiae and sticking with broad brush strokes and good vibes, the campaign reasons, Mr. Giuliani can hit hard while never providing Mayor Dinkins with a target to strike back.
The Dinkins camp has tried to fight back. The Mayor recently described Mr. Giuliani as being in "the candidate protection program" and has tried to press him, and encourage reporters to press him, for specific stands. On one issue, rent control, the Giuliani campaign seemed to take a position, realized it was not particularly popular and quickly shifted ground.
Of course, it is hardly novel for a candidate to strive to avoid being pinned down on issues -- especially controversial ones -- a minute before he or she has to. What is more, the Giuliani camp had counted on a summerlong Democratic primary that would have kept attention focused on Mr. Dinkins and the rivals in his own party. But when City Council President Andrew J. Stein dropped out of the race, all eyes turned immediately to November.
 
Nothing Specific to Criticize
 The flap over rent control seemed to confirm the political wisdom of the Giuliani campaign's larger strategy of avoiding specifics as much as possible this early in the campaign. Taking positions on controversial and divisive issues like homelessness, taxes and the arcana of the budget would only give the press and the public, to say nothing of the Mayor, something specific to criticize.
Since Mr. Dinkins cannot sidestep positions, it leaves him vulnerable while Mr. Giuliani seeks to remain on the high road, speaking of harmony, economic growth and a new way of practicing politics.
In speech after speech, Mr. Giuliani tugs at the city's slow response to the disturbances in Crown Heights in August 1991, the "300,000 jobs lost" in a sustained recession, distressingly low reading and math scores in the schools, a bureaucracy "out of control" and out of proportion to New York's needs, and a catalogue of other ills that he easily recounts but has yet to offer specific ways to solve.
 
A Simple Message
 The message could not be simpler: vote for the "RUDY!" of those red and blue campaign banners and the city will breeze forward toward a future full of hope. Stay with the incumbent and watch the city bled of jobs, economic health, educational excellence, even morality.
Some New Yorkers have been charmed by this feel-good approach to a campaign. Others are already impatient. After one speech on the city's economics, several Wall Street financiers groused that he had mostly avoided specifics and that the few he did introduce were dusted off from his 1989 campaign and lacked sophistication.
But their reactions followed some of the few specifics Mr. Giuliani has offered: a promise to reduce the city's work force by across the board freezes. "Our goal," Mr. Giuliani said on May 20, is to reduce city personnel "by 3 to 5 percent per year for a three- to four-year period."
Other proposals were more vague. Asked about rent control, Mr. Giuliani that day first appeared to circle the issue by talking about the "correlation between the huge amount of property owned by New York City" and the physical condition of the city. He said he would sell some city property to bring about a healthier balance of private and public ownership.
 
'Too Emotional'
 Eventually, he went on to say that he favored removing rent regulations on luxury apartments and those that become vacant. Within a month he would do an about-face, telling reporters in Albany on June 21 that he opposed both. "The administrative burden and complexity of trying to administer a change like that in a fair way would far outweigh the tiny, small percentage of benefit that would be achieved," he said. Earlier he was quoted in Newsday as saying the whole issue was "too emotional" for the mayoral campaign.
His stand on taxes is quite general, too. Earlier this month, he vowed "a reduction of the tax burden on the people of New York City." In a pamphlet distributed by his office, Mr. Giuliani promises to "streamline and where possible, eliminate, the numerous and often capricious taxes, fines and regulations strangling city business."
Nowhere has he delineated, tax by tax, what would go, what would be reduced, what would stay, and how he would make up the lost revenue or what programs he would cut to make up the lost revenue.
He says he will "phase out the commercial rent tax and unincorporated business tax and reduce the hotel occupancy tax, too." But he does not say what programs would be trimmed by the resulting reduction in revenue.
 
Priorities for the Schools
 Schools, too, Mr. Giuliani says, would prosper under his administration. Under his administration, he said last month, the school system's budget of more than $7 billion would be poured into primary educational needs like textbooks and "decent places in which to learn, safe environments."
Sounds fine. But how? "In the trickle-down budgeting that occurs now," Mr. Giuliani said, "after the administrators and the administrators who administer the administrators, and the administrators who watch the administrators who do forms together and then talk about their forms and then make some more work for each other, after they get paid, a little bit of that trickles down to the classroom."
His solution: "first we take care of the needs of the students. Then we take care of the needs of the classroom teachers, and then whatever is left over, that goes to the less important part of the system. That's called setting priorities."
Several reporters have lately taken to calling Mr. Giuliani's run for City Hall a "stealth campaign," invisible but potentially deadly. The fact is, Mr. Giuliani has been out meeting voters for months. What is missing is not his presence, but his programs.
 
The Mayor Responds
 After Mr. Giuliani was caught twirling about on rent control last month, the Mayor finally took him to task.
"This man says to speak about rent regulation is 'too emotional' an issue," Mayor Dinkins said. "But to involve himself in Crown Heights at that rally, to be down at the police rally some time ago, that was all right. What is the thought process of this man who for three and half years couldn't be found, and even now is under a candidate protection program?"
Still, like Walter F. Mondale facing down Gary Hart in 1984, some voters are already starting to ask: "where's the beef?"
Mame Rosenberg, a sales representative for America Works, a for-profit program that tries to find work for people on the welfare rolls, was wearing a Women for Giuliani button June 16 at a gathering of the candidate's Women's Coalition. The button was only half true. She was a woman. But she was not sure that she was for Mr. Giuliani.
Ms. Rosenberg said she she went to the breakfast program simply to see what Mr. Giuliani had to say. Disgruntled with Mayor Dinkins, she had hoped to like the challenger. "I came so I could see for myself," she said. "So far, he hasn't really said anything."

HEADLINE: Grumbling Over GATT

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 2

 BODY:
For 45 years GATT has worked. The 96-page set of basic rules for international commerce designated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has bolstered a huge increase in international trade.
 At the same time, customs tariffs have been slashed to less than 10 percent in industrialized countries, from an average of 40 percent, encouraging ever- greater exchanges of goods. And the number of nations subscribing to GATT regulations has grown to 111 from 23. 
If the current talks are aimed at lowering tariffs again by about a third, and embracing whole new sectors like agriculture and textiles, why do governments keep balking even when they have repeatedly promised to reach what they themselves call a crucial agreement?
 As leaders of the leading industrial powers prepare to gather in Tokyo next week for what is now an almost ritualistic attempt to advance the Uruguay Round, as the current round of talks is known, these questions have become pressing. More people are questioning whether GATT may have outlived its usefulness.
 "GATT is facing a structural crisis and should simply be abolished," the Gaullist President of the French National Assembly, Philippe Seguin, declared last month. He heads the more nationalist wing of the governing Gaullist Party but is far from a wild extremist in the French political spectrum. Indeed, his views have been echoed in recent weeks -- in much milder form -- by President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, and other senior officials.
 They argue simply that the world has changed. Now that communication is almost instantaneous and technology can easily be shifted, developing countries with cheap labor, little social security and no expensive environmental regulations are sure to take markets and jobs from highly developed countries.
 But the more fundamental problem for GATT is that its most ambitious trade talks since 1948 have coincided with an economic downturn that inevitably fuels protectionist trends.
 A round of trade talks attempting, for the first time, to include services, intellectual property, agriculture and textiles within the basic GATT rules is taking place against a drumbeat of layoffs and slow or nonexistent growth in the developed world.
 In such circumstances, each opening to competition is easily equated with a lost job rather than with the potential lift to economic output -- estimated by economists at $200 billion over a decade.
 So, the argument goes, free trade is not enough. As one senior French official who will be in Tokyo put it, "We can't go on running if we are not running by the same rules."
 In fact, while developing countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, have been sharply increasing exports in recent years, they have not taken a greater share of the overall trade pie. But stagnation and recession in Europe, America and Japan have clearly changed the overall mood.
 "How do you stop people blaming outside causes for their present deep predicaments?" Etienne Davignon, the chairman of the Belgian conglomerate Societe Generale, asked in an interview. At a time of economic difficulty, he suggested, "we have to find some way between outrageous protectionism and absolute free trade."
 President Clinton has not put the issue quite the same way. But in the face of the economic problems at home, his campaign for open access to the Japanese market, to reduce Japan's trade surplus, amounts to an acknowledgment that free trade alone is not enough.
 
Sees Benefits of Competition
 GATT, however, was not fashioned for such middle ground. While its rules condone measures like quotas and subsidies in exceptional cases -- which until now have included agriculture and textiles -- the Geneva-based body stands squarely behind the view that open and multilateral trade is in the world's best interest.
 "I do not favor the Clinton approach of looking first at surpluses, even Japan's," said Peter Sutherland, the new Director General of GATT. "I believe in competition."
 But the benefits of securing a commitment from Japan to cut its surplus are also far more concrete than the promises of a new GATT agreement. As a result, some GATT officials perceive a worrying drift toward seeking bilateral or regional arrangements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement among Canada, Mexico and the United States, at the expense of the multilateral system.
 It is true that open trade can hurt. The European Community's steel industry is already suffering from cheap steel from the former Soviet bloc. If Ukraine, a breadbasket, gets organized, Western European agriculture could be a victim.
 
Giving and Getting
 A lesson of GATT's 45 years appears to be that the overall benefits outweigh the pain. "Look," said Willem Duisenberg, the governor of the Dutch central bank, "Holland used to be a great producer of textiles and shoes before the European Community was established. Both disappeared as a result of our borders' falling. But we learned new things: services, chemicals, metals. The lesson of open trade is you get something better than what you gave up."
 It is, however, a hard lesson for politicians to embrace at a time of recession. What you get comes after -- sometimes a long time after -- what you give up. That is why a GATT deal has proved elusive, and looks as if it will be again in Tokyo.
 The alternative to a GATT deal could indeed be grim. At GATT headquarters, one telling graphic is prominently displayed. It shows how, between the first and second world wars, international trade stagnated as countries turned inward.

Kemper Sets Insurer Sale To St. Paul

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES

 BODY:
The Kemper Corporation has agreed to sell its Economy Fire and Casualty Company to the St. Paul Companies for $420 million in cash and other assets as part of its plan to focus on its core financial services and life insurance operations.
About two-thirds of the transaction will be paid in cash and one-third in assets like stocks and bonds distributed from Economy Fire and Casualty's investment portfolio. The St. Paul Companies, a group of property and casualty insurance underwriting and insurance brokerage companies based in St. Paul, said it would finance the deal with internal funds. It also plans to replace the assets distributed from Economy Fire and Casualty's investment portfolio with an "appropriate amount" of assets. 
 After the announcement, which was made late on Thursday, Moody's Investors Service, one of the nation's largest credit and debt rating agencies, said it might lower the St. Paul's senior debt ratings and ratings on four of the company's property-casualty insurance units. About $273 million of debt could be affected, Moody's said.
Kemper, one of the nation's largest financial services companies, and St. Paul said they expect the sale to be closed by the end of the third quarter, pending approval by insurance regulators in Illinois. Kemper is based in Long Grove, Ill.
Economy Fire and Casualty, based in Freeport, Ill., is a large national auto and homeowner insurance underwriter, with $401 million in premiums written in 1992, assets of $733 million and about 1,200 employees. The company has operated through a network of 1,600 independent agents in 22 states.
Last November, Kemper put Economy Fire and Casualty and a small regional property-casualty unit, the Federal Kemper Insurance Company, up for sale, saying it wanted to concentrate on its core businesses, including its Kemper Securities Inc. brokerage, and asset management and life insurance businesses. Federal Kemper Insurance, based in Decatur, Ill., remains for sale, a Kemper spokeswoman said.
The property-casualty companies together had an operating profit of $34.5 million last year, compared with $26.2 million in 1991.
Shares of Kemper closed yesterday at $36.125, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of the St. Paul Companies closed at $80.75, up 12.5 cents, on the Big Board.

Corning Wins in Bidding for Lab Company

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 2

 BODY:
National Health Laboratories declined today to sweeten its takeover offer for the Damon Corporation, ending up the loser in a bidding contest with its rival, Corning Inc., which will strengthen its position in the blood-testing industry.
With National Health taking itself out of the competition, Corning said it would begin its $23-a-share offer in the next few days for 16.1 million Damon shares. Damon, based in Needham Heights, Mass., operates 12 labs in the United States and one in Mexico City. 
 Corning's offer is valued at $575 million, which includes assumption of Damon's $168 million in debt and $18 million in fees owed to National Health for terminating the deal.
 
Predicts Trend for Industry
 In an interview, Robert L. Rosen, Damon's chairman, predicted that the deal would be a forerunner of a wave of consolidations in the health-care industry, driven by a demand for lower costs from health-care providers and the Clinton Administration. "Combinations provide the economies of scale and better prices that the Administration wants," Mr. Rosen said. He declined to estimate the potential savings from the merger.
The deal came with a penalty for Mr. Rosen, Damon's largest individual shareholder, and two other directors. The three executives agreed to split their stock profits if National Health's $16-a-share offer, made on June 22, was outbid. As a consequence, Mr. Rosen; the company's treasurer, Donald T. Netter, and a director, John O'Bryan, will owe National Health $3.6 million.
Corning, best known for its glassworks, also operates 40 labs that provide clinical, pharmaceutical and environmental testing and had 1992 sales of $1 billion. A merger with Damon, which had $317 million in revenue, would solidify Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., as the nation's second-largest testing company behind SmithKline Beecham, which has revenue of $1.5 billion.
Corning and Damon labs overlap in 10 markets, and analysts expect most of Damon's operations will be closed within a year. Mr. Rosen, however, scoffed at the prospect of a huge consolidation, and Corning officials declined to comment on changes in operations after the merger.
"Corning didn't buy Damon to revive it," said Damon Brundage, a health-care analyst with Paine Webber. "Corning bought Damon to dismantle it."
Mr. Brundage said National Health could not improve its offer without hurting earnings. He said Allied Clinical Laboratories of Nashville might become a new takeover target for National Health, based in La Jolla, Calif. "Corning probably won't be around to compete," he said.
The profit-sharing pact was apparently part of an agreement between National Health and Mr. Rosen to smoke out a satisfactory offer from Corning, which had been holding talks with Damon for more than a year.

Bonneville, Citing Drought, Lifts Power Rate 15.6%

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 2

 BODY:
Announcing details of a rate increase that has been dreaded throughout the Pacific Northwest, the Bonneville Power Administration said today that it would raise rates by 15.6 percent on Oct. 1.
Earlier this spring, Randy Hardy, Bonneville's administrator, warned that the increase might be as high as 24 percent. 
 The agency, which supplies 170 utilities and large industrial companies in the Northwest, says it is facing a financial crisis because of a drought that has reduced output from its hydroelectric projects and cut sales. In addition, it faces expensive requirements to protect endangered fish and must cope with sluggish sales to industries that have suffered because of a poor regional economy.
Bonneville, a Federal agency, sells 50 percent of the power used in the region, which covers all of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and parts of other states.
Prodded by protests from rate payers, Mr. Hardy has slashed Bonneville's $2.4 billion budget by half a billion dollars, and he has also begun a program to close offices and reduce the 4,700-member work force. He is also hoping that normal rains return.
 
'Delivered on Our Promise'
 "We're playing the hand we've been dealt," Mr. Hardy said. "We've delivered on our promise to do what we could do to keep the increase as low as possible." The new rate for utilities is 2.68 cents a kilowatt-hour, up from 2.3 cents.
William Drummond, manager of the Public Power Council, which represents 113 utilities, says the rate is nearing the cost of alternative sources of electricity, threatening Bonneville's position as the region's low-cost power wholesaler.
Nine aluminum plants are among the customers hit hardest by the increase. The plants already pay 20 percent more for power than competitors worldwide and the new rate comes at a time when international prices are at record lows because Russian aluminum has been flooding the market.
"The increase will be very painful and will really hurt basic industry, said Steve Waddington, deputy director of Direct Service Industries. The group represents 11 energy-intensive aluminum and chemical plants that came to the region decades ago with low-cost power as the lure. "Some aluminum plants will cut production," he added
Alcoa said earlier this week that it would cut output nationally 25 percent. Bonneville's rate increase was factored into this decision, said Jack Speers, power manager for the company's plant in Wenatchee, Wash., which will trim production by 22,000 tons a year.
Mr. Hardy said Bonneville had taken on many programs at the request of utilities, but might no longer be able to do so. "People say Bonneville is a large punch bowl, and everybody from utilities to fish and wildlife agencies has a straw," he said. "Without change, they will suck us dry. We simply have to pull out the straws."
Ted Hallock, a member of the Northwest Power Planning Council, which plans for future energy needs and restoring fish, said: "It appears Bonneville may not be able to fully fund measures to rebuild salmon runs. We could see more fish populations pushed to the brink of extinction."

THE LAND WHERE THE BLUES BEGAN
By Alan Lomax.
Illustrated. 539 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $25. 
 IN the 1960's I occasionally postured at being Alan Lomax, not by journeying into the Deep South but by approaching Skip James, Mississippi John Hurt, Bukka White and other fabled bluesmen when I was an undergraduate with a tape recorder and a thousand questions. At one session, someone asked the often distracted but ingenious Skip James about the Delta blues singer Robert Johnson. James ruminated in his mournful, high-pitched voice that now that we mentioned it, he hadn't seen his old friend in about 26 or 27 years, leaving us with the jaw-dropping implication that he didn't know Johnson had died -- 26 or 27 years before. He then told us he had taught the younger Robert "32-20 Blues," and played it vigorously as if to confirm ownership.
Musicians like James, who spurred the country blues revival, seemed strangely foreign to many of us avidly credulous white Northerners, attracted chiefly to their music but also to the romantic existentialist myths of the black troubadour. They were representatives of an America we could scarcely imagine. In 1980 Peter Guralnick wrote a keenly observed novel, "Nighthawk Blues," about blues collectors of our generation who did travel south. But perhaps only one white man could tell what it was like combing the backwoods when Son House, David (Honeyboy) Edwards and Muddy Waters were robust young artists and not the patriarchal legends of a later day. Now he has.
Alan Lomax is a nearly ubiquitous figure in American folklore and music. Born in Texas in 1915, he was a protege of his father, the folklorist John A. Lomax, with whom he created the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress and brought to public attention the baronial giant of the 12-string guitar, Leadbelly. Generations have grown up with his Library of Congress recordings of Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and Jelly Roll Morton, as well as his book derived from the Morton sessions, "Mister Jelly Roll," one of the most influential and widely quoted books ever written about jazz. That remarkably disparate trio does not figure in "The Land Where the Blues Began," which is concerned primarily with Mr. Lomax's trips through the Mississippi Delta in the 1940's.
It is probably fair to say of Alan Lomax that he is too serious a man to write autobiography and not serious enough to write history. History requires the collation of everyone's research, and Mr. Lomax prefers to mine his own, enlarging on his experiences, as documented on disk or tape, with vivid recollections that dynamically establish the time and place of every encounter. This book makes clear (as his several others did not) that he can be a stunningly evocative writer, conveying the excitement that fueled his wanderings through Coahoma County more than half a century ago.
Mr. Lomax notes that one of his associates, a black folklorist named Lewis Jones -- who is one of the book's somewhat elliptical heroes -- characterized their research "in terms of the three main modes of transport" linking the Delta to the outside world: steamboats, railroads and highways. He then goes on to describe the first:
"Beating the brown belly of the mighty river to froth with their great paddles, filling the sky with black clouds from cathedral-like smokestacks, at night their furnaces breathing dragonlike flames across midnight waters, gliding through the semiwilderness of the Southwest like swift heavenly chariots, loaded down with well-dressed dudes, fancy women, double-jinted roustabouts and new cotton millionaires -- these floating palaces roused the awe of the Delta songsters."
Inevitably, Mr. Lomax provides a couplet by way of a musical amen: "The big Kate Adams headin' down the stream / With her sidewheel knockin' -- 'Good God, I been redeemed.' " Always his recollections lead to and from the musical examples he preserved on 15-minute acetate disks. He captured the call and response of
spirituals, whole sermons and conversations, and countless blues, play songs and work songs. Early on, he asks the reader to listen to some blues records before returning to the text.
At times, Mr. Lomax's adventures in bluesland read like an American version of "Dr. Livingstone, I presume," as when he makes his way through the "broomweed pastures" of Senatobia, Miss., and encounters Blind Sid Hemphill, a drum major with a fife-and-drum outfit whose style shows a direct African influence. Of course, he also encounters hostile natives -- all white, law officers and plantation bosses, one of whom ominously warns Mr. Lomax, "We've been told to be on the lookout for Jap agents," and then threatens to lock him up for prefacing Son House's name with the honorific "Mr." The whole book veers between musical commemoration and outrage at racist barbarism.
But "The Land Where the Blues Began" is also a journey into the folklorist's own heart of darkness. For as disinclined as he is to write about himself, Mr. Lomax is forced to acknowledge his arrogance as a young Government-sponsored missionary: he simply is not ready to handle the horrors of racism and the submissiveness he finds in its victims. After a Delta church service, he notes, "My heart had struck a depth of sorrow and hurt such as I had never imagined."
Mr. Lomax has always been a somewhat regressive defender of old ways and styles. He has mellowed enough to enjoy the accomplishments of such newfangled idioms as gospel, yet he regrets the loss of the improvised spiritual harmonies it displaced. Surprisingly, he finds sexist villainy at the root: "The age-old female religious collective was being replaced by a male-dominated hierarchy."
Mr. Lomax's reluctance to place his own research in the context of the larger historical canvas is more problematic. He does not attempt to trace the origins of songs beyond his own discovery of them (some were pop hits that Mr. Lomax, who disdains most commercial music, would have recognized had he spent more time in front of a radio), and he perpetuates myths long since discounted by other researchers -- including the familiar tale of Bessie Smith dying needlessly because she was refused admission to three hospitals, a story popularized in a play by Edward Albee that Mr. Lomax notes in his bibliography while omitting Chris Albertson's 1972 biography of Smith, which disproved it.
So "The Land Where the Blues Began" is not a comprehensive or always reliable history, but it is something no less valuable -- the firsthand account of a uniquely sympathetic and capable Boswell determined to preserve for all time not only the innovators of the blues but also the vanishing communities that produced them. Mr. Lomax gives us Muddy Waters before and after he traveled to Chicago and became a star; and, though he muses perhaps sentimentally that blacks alone know the secrets of life's pleasures, he gives us Big Bill Broonzy describing with articulate passion the economic and sociological privations of this loamy region where the blues began. In Alan Lomax's discerning reconstructions, such long-ago visits miraculously evade the blurring of time. They give life to a domain most of us can never know, and yet one that summons us with an oddly familiar sensation of reverence and dread.

Horror Stories

BYLINE: By Frank Rich

 BODY:
You may already have forgotten The Great Pepsi Scare of 1993. It raged out of control for less than a week, though it did leave whole states and several major news organizations terrorized in its wake.
The facts, if they can be called that, were these. On June 10, an elderly Tacoma, Wash., couple, Earl (Tex) and Mary Triplett, said a syringe had turned up in their can of Diet Pepsi. Within days, dozens of other syringe sightings were reported by Pepsi drinkers -- the very health-conscious drinkers of Diet Pepsi in particular -- in 23 states. Soon all three network evening news programs led with the crisis. Jay Leno's monologue likened President Clinton's inoculation program to "the Pepsi challenge" while Ted Koppel countered with a Pepsi "Nightline." A big-eyed 9-year-old boy in the Bronx who said his gum had been pricked by a hypodermic needle posed with the accused Pepsi bottle in The New York Post. USA Today published a front-page map showing the tainted Pepsi states in red, should readers wish to reroute their vacations. 
 Less than a week after Earl (Tex) and Mary had popped their lid, my local newscast was so obsessed with the story that it offered "team coverage" whose length and depth might persuade channel-hoppers wandering over from the Bulls-Suns game that they had stumbled into a new gulf war. One frantic anchor suggested that Pepsi drinkers search their unopened cans for needle punctures, never realizing that a perforated Pepsi can might be as empty as his head.
There was only one flaw in the frightening Pepsi scenario: the Food and Drug Administration could not confirm even a single report of Pepsi tampering. No one was sick. No one was injured. No one had a plausible theory of how syringes might find their way into soft-drink cans sealed at the rate of 2,000 per minute, let alone at bottling plants as scattered as the red states in the USA Today map. What's more, in a country where taxes are going up but the economy is flat, roughly half the population has a motive for shaking down a fat soft-drink manufacturer in a get-rich-quick hoax. Yet for 72 manic hours, even as one of the Pepsi alarmists was arrested on the Federal charge of making a false tampering claim, the mass media dangled syringes and needles before the public with ominous narration to match.
What drove this horror story? The only scare word left unspoken in the coverage was AIDS. But surely AIDS, with its doomsday specter of an unsanitary needle plunging into the bloodstream, lurked somewhere in the psyches of any copycat fantasists among those reporting the syringes. And surely AIDS was not far from the thoughts of those who flogged the fraud on the air and in print, hoping to titillate the public under the guise of informing it. As the Pepsi story unfolded, there were such bona fide AIDS stories as the publication of Arthur Ashe's memoirs, the death of the actor Ray Sharkey and the grim medical reports from the annual international AIDS conference. But after a decade of plague, the impact of such familiar events has been blunted by numbness and denial. The irrational Pepsi scare gave sensationalists a covert cue to whip up the old mass AIDS hysteria that still festers within America, however repressed, waiting to be tapped at any time. Would this patently bogus story have spun so far out of control if Earl (Tex) and Mary had found mere mouse droppings in their can?
THIS IS A SUMMER OF FEAR, BUT PEOPLE'S true fears rarely rise to the surface, where fake fears stay and can be enjoyed. The same week that the Pepsi scare toyed with what really scares America, the summer's official fount of fright, "Jurassic Park," broke box-office records, drawing crowds with its promise of monster-movie chills as executed by carnivorous DNA-spawned dinosaurs.
Reasonable people can disagree over whether "Jurassic Park" is a worthy successor to "Jaws," "E.T." and the transcendant "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." What is less debatable is Spielberg's genius for giving the public what it wants when it wants it. For all the supposed scariness of "Jurassic Park," it doesn't really scare anyone much except the very young who arrive under the mistaken impression (fostered by the film's long and greedy merchandising arm) that they are about to rendezvous with Barney. The only adults reported to be terrified are executives at Columbia Pictures, who invested zillions in "Last Action Hero," the Schwarzenegger romp that "Jurassic Park" devoured at the box office.
But it is precisely Spielberg's ability to deliver the aura of fright without any actual fright that makes "Jurassic Park" the right movie for the moment. People are panicked enough about real life right now, and they are not looking for movies that might confront them with, say, a lethal communicable virus. About born-again dinosaurs no one need seriously worry.
Forget about the technical brilliance that has gone into this movie's simulation of its Jurassic-age specimens. The real imagination has gone into keeping the dinosaurs' havoc carefree. If Spielberg really wanted to shock the audience, he would have had a T. rex eat an actor with top billing, as Alfred Hitchcock did away with Janet Leigh in the "Psycho" shower scene. But the victims in "Jurassic Park" are such secondary nonentities as a tubby villain (who would have died of a heart attack anyway), a chain smoker (who would have died of lung cancer anyway) and an arrogant, pricey lawyer (who deserves to die anyway). To make sure that no one in the audience will be upset by even the prospect of a major character failing to survive until the final credits, Spielberg cast stars who are less persuasively human than the dinosaurs. In lieu of Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer and Alec Guinness, he recruited semi-animated performers indistinguishable from the Audio-Animatronic robots who simulate dead Presidents at Disney theme parks.
As many have noted, "Jurassic Park" is itself a theme-park ride. Everyone who takes it knows where the jolts are in advance, and the fun of the experience is to yelp when the anticipated roller-coaster curve at last does arrive, especially since it is powered by the slickest technology a Japanese-owned movie studio can buy. Visible bloodshed is kept to a sanitized minimum, and a viewer never actually sees a dino incisor slice a vein. The predictable, escapist scariness unleashed by pseudo-scientists in "Jurassic Park" is the pause that refreshes for a country on pins and needles about rampaging monsters that so far remain beyond real science's grasp.

HEADLINE: FILM;
The Cinematic Law Firm of Greedy, Vain & Immoral

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
Comfortably ensconced atop his class at Harvard Law School, sexy and clever and cocky to boot, Mitch McDeere can go to any law firm he likes. Instead, seduced by a bloated salary, a shiny new Mercedes, a plush office, the taste of Memphis barbecue and a low-interest mortgage on a ranch house with a big backyard, he opts for the ritzy but obscure firm of Bendini, Lambert & Locke.
Had McDeere, played by Tom Cruise, followed the well-trodden path from Ivy League law school to a real-life law office like Hale & Dorr or Sullivan & Cromwell, he would have quickly been forgotten. In nearly a century of cinema, few film makers have seen movie material in these strait-laced, straitjacketed operations. But in joining the Bendini firm, McDeere joined something else -- the ever-lengthier list of lawyers in American movies. 
 His venue is "The Firm," the new Sydney Pollack film based on John Grisham's best-selling tale of a yuppie lawyer who finds that his place of employment is actually a front for the Mafia. (Another Grisham novel about lawyers, "The Pelican Brief," is in production in New Orleans with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, and filming will start soon, once again in Memphis, on Mr. Grisham's legal thriller "The Client.")
Something there is in the American psyche that is fascinated with lawyers, and, not surprisingly, that fascination has frequently found its way onto film. But if lawyers are a constant in American cinema, the character of those lawyers is not. The heroic type immortalized a generation ago by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in "To Kill a Mockingbird" has fallen victim to everything from the anti-authoritarianism of the Vietnam era to the lawyer-infested world of Watergate to America's diminished standing in the world economy (for which Dan Quayle blamed the bar) to the growing ubiquitousness, and vulnerability, of lawyers themselves.
As public perceptions of lawyers have changed, so, too has Hollywood's. Indeed, film makers who once idealized lawyers have gleefully joined in the bar-bashing. "What do you call 500 lawyers at the bottom of the ocean?" Danny DeVito asks one of his clients in "The War of the Roses." "An excellent start," he says, answering his own question. "I used to resent jokes like that," Mr. DeVito continues. "Now, I see them as simple truths."
Attitudes like this explain why moviegoers, who once applauded lawyers immortalized by Mr. Peck, James Stewart and Spencer Tracy, now cheer when a Tyrannosaurus rex consumes a cowering lawyer in "Jurassic Park." It explains why Mitch McDeere, foolish and greedy and arrogant as he is, passes as a hero. It explains why California Lawyer magazine, in tracing the evolution of lawyer characters, entitled the article "Atticus Doesn't Live Here Anymore."
It is not hard to understand why lawyers have long been a fit subject for film. As professionals who often hover close to conflict, lawyers are rife with dramatic possibilities; in them, film makers have always found neatly encapsulated examples of nobility and corruption, cowardice and courage. For every valiant lawyer (like Mr. Peck in "To Kill a Mockingbird") there is one who is venal (Walter Matthau in "The Fortune Cookie") or vain (Ron Silver, the ersatz Alan Dershowitz in "Reversal of Fortune") or incompetent (the nameless defense lawyer in "Twelve Angry Men" whose sorry performance clears the way for Henry Fonda's heroics) or ineffectual (Smithers in "Desk Set").
Americans not only admire and loathe their lawyers, they also like laughing at them. Thus, we also find lawyers who are nitpicking or pompous, stuffy or nerdy. All types have been as liberally represented on the tube as on the screen, most particularly on "L.A. Law" but also on recent shows like "Matlock" "Law and Order" "Civil Wars" and "Reasonable Doubts." And, as television's lawyers have degenerated from Perry Mason to Arnie Becker, lawyers in movies have followed suit.
For a time, movie lawyers were largely indistinguishable ethnically, religiously and sexually. But, mirroring the changing demographics of the legal work force, they have gradually been differentiated as Irish (Paul Newman in "The Verdict"), Jewish (Kevin Pollack in "A Few Good Men") or women (Debra Winger in "Legal Eagles," Glenn Close in "Jagged Edge," Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in "Class Action," Demi Moore in "A Few Good Men").
Black lawyers are less common, though in politically correct Hollywood these days, they seem disproportionately represented on the bench. The bar is not only more diverse but younger, with Tom Cruise (also in "A Few Good Men"), Michael Douglas ("War of the Roses," "Fatal Attraction") and Harrison Ford ("Regarding Harry," "Presumed Innocent") replacing Spencer Tracy ("Judgment at Nuremberg," "Inherit the Wind," "Adam's Rib") as the modern archetype.
Lawyer movies of all eras tend to follow certain conventions. For one thing, they focus on trial lawyers who, though only a small percentage of the bar, offer more vivid possibilities than antitrust lawyers or probate specialists. They include plenty of law books, gavels, ceiling fans, hopelessly truncated and oversimplified trials and surprise witnesses. Opposing counsel -- from George C. Scott in "Anatomy of a Murder" to Joe Mantegna in "Body of Evidence" -- is obnoxious, dishonest or incompetent.
Lawyers at large firms are caricatures from a New Yorker cartoon, smug and porcine or downright sinister. The partners at "The Firm," most notably Oliver Lambert (Hal Holbrook), are positively creepy to everyone but McDeere but no more odious than Ed Concannon (James Mason), the high-priced lawyer battling Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) in "The Verdict." Concannon was Hollywood's image of a fat-cat corporate lawyer: elegant (usually denoted by a bow tie), coldblooded, slightly British, assisted by droves of dronelike underlings who could have been McDeere's Harvard classmates.
True, the movies have always had their share of bad lawyers. When Jack Benny played a loutish lawyer in the otherwise forgettable 1943 film "The Meanest Man in the World," five Connecticut lawyers sued. "There's got to be a law, even for lawyers!" Lana Turner tells Hume Cronyn, who is playing her attorney in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." In "Adam's Rib," the man living across the hall from the husband-and-wife legal team of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made the same point more amicably. "Lawyers should never marry other lawyers," he declares. "This is called inbreeding, from which comes idiot children and more lawyers." "You lawyers are all the same," one reluctant witness tells Mr. Newman in "The Verdict." "You don't care who you hurt as long as you make a buck. You're a bunch of whores."
But if America has always had a love-hate relationship with its lawyers, the focus, for a time, was on love. In "The Fortune Cookie," Walter Matthau may give short shrift to Lincoln as legal counsel -- "Great President, lousy lawyer," he huffs -- but in many of the finest lawyer movies, the heroes had a Lincolnesque cast: noble, earnest, handsome, plain-spoken, impeccably ethical. They are exemplified by Atticus Finch in "To Kill a Mockingbird" and Paul Biegler, played by James Stewart, in "Anatomy of a Murder." Both love the law so much they don't care if they're paid in collard greens or hickory nuts or not at all. Both represented the unpopular, and both were effective. Biegler got his client off, even though he was probably guilty; Finch lost, but only because he had to battle three centuries of Southern racism.
Both "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Anatomy of a Murder" date from the late 1950's to the mid-1960's -- the golden age of the genre, as Thomas J. Harris notes in his book "Courtroom's Finest Hour in American Cinema." Such classics as "Witness for the Prosecution," "Compulsion," "Inherit the Wind," "Cape Fear" and "Judgment at Nuremberg" also appeared. Another film buff, Anthony Chase of the Nova Law Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has explained this efflorescence: The crusading, idealistic lawyer, he contends, was a delayed reaction to the loss of civil liberties during McCarthyism.
Of course, the view of lawyers in these films was hopelessly naive. The lawyer-heroes of yore would no longer sell, and film makers stopped peddling them. Nothing better illustrates the change than the two versions of "Cape Fear," made 30 years apart. In the 1961 edition, Sam Bowden, the lawyer played by Mr. Peck, embodies all the usual virtues. He is Atticus Finch without Jem and Scout. But in Martin Scorsese's 1991 remake, Bowden, now played by Nick Nolte, is unfaithful, unethical and unsympathetic. As if to underline the point, the now-aged Peck once more portrays a lawyer -- this time, a slick, sanctimonious windbag.
Recent films have offered more subtle, complex figures like Mr. Newman's character in "The Verdict," perhaps the most convincing lawyer ever portrayed on film. Lesser examples include Glenn Close in "Jagged Edge" and Willem Dafoe in "Body of Evidence" -- dedicated defense lawyers with an unfortunate propensity to sleep with their sexy clients.
Ron Silver's Alan Dershowitz does not go to bed with Jeremy Iron's Claus von Bulow or commit any other ethical faux pas. "I gotta feel there's some moral or constitutional issue at stake," he says in "Reversal of Fortune." But in his film incarnation, Mr. Dershowitz comes across as arrogant, self-righteous, angry and perpetually overcaffeinated -- due, no doubt, to the coffee mug he nurses in almost every scene. He may be a great lawyer, but he is not a mensch.
Characters like McDeere represent a new wave of lawyer characters, children of the Reagan era, the first generation of young lawyers to be fought over by megafirms promising buckets of money. These lawyers are better educated than their predecessors; both McDeere and Michael Douglas's Oliver Rose in "War of the Roses" went to Harvard Law School. They have forsaken the country for the city, the perilous life of the single practitioner for large hierarchical enterprises, three-piece suits for suspenders and power collars, poor clients for wealthy ones, simple honest pleasures for amoral materialism.
For them, the law is less a calling than a fast track to affluence, and we don't see them practicing much of it. They spend less time in court than they do flattering senior partners or huddled over law books and yellow legal pads, working on matters of little interest to them and even less to moviegoers. Of much greater interest is the toll their work takes on them and their families.
Oliver Rose does not cheat on his wife in "War of the Roses," but given his workaholism, his obsequiousness to clients and superiors, his self-centeredness and soullessness, his marriage founders anyway. "My fee's going up!" he chortles to his long-suffering wife, played by Kathleen Turner, after landing a new client. "Better get me while you can afford me!" So repulsive does he become that when he is hospitalized with what he thinks is a heart attack -- in fact, it is a hernia, suffered while further flattering the coveted client -- she does not bother seeing him. "When I watch you eat, when I see you asleep, when I look at you recently, I just want to smash your face in," Ms. Turner later tells him. And things go downhill from there.
Mitch McDeere's wife, played by Jean Tripplehorn, has nearly as many grievances, and in much shorter a time. Though she is a mere schoolteacher rather than a cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School, she instantly senses that something is wrong with a law firm that monitors its lawyers' marriages and encourages them to procreate. "I don't mind square," she says. "Weird, I mind." But sucked in by the wages, McDeere pours himself into the firm, leaving his wife to cook meals for herself. The plot allows him to muster whatever courage and character he possesses simply to dig himself out of the hole his greed landed him in.
These are lawyer movies only because their characters happen to be lawyers. But as vehicles for demonstrating the hollowness of the 1980's, Mitch McDeere and Oliver Rose need not have been lawyers at all. Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox did it just as well in "Wall Street," and he, for one, didn't have a law degree.

HEADLINE: U.S. Parks Retrench After Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.; JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
IT was one of the busiest days of the year at one of the busiest national parks in the country, but the sign at our planned campground declared: Closed. Because of budget cuts, rangers explained, the camp is not open this year.
We had hoped to establish a comfortable base at the Mathews Arm Campground in Shenandoah National Park, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, for a Memorial Day weekend of hiking. Instead, with every open campground in the park full, we had to park at the edge of the park's spectacular Skyline Drive and haul our gear deeper than we had planned into the woods to strike a camp. 
 This was hardly a major inconvenience, but under park rules our back-country bivouac could have no campfire, and our distance from the car made it a bit harder to reach the trails we had picked for our daily excursions along the Appalachian Trail and its many tributaries.
On the trails, we encountered maintenance workers still clearing away trees that had fallen under the weight of ice that had long since melted, and at the Dickey Ridge Visitor Center at the park's northern end there were none of the usual offerings of ranger-led educational programs.
The campground closings, maintenance backlogs and cuts in the highly instructive interpretive programs that we found are symptomatic of a budget squeeze that is hitting the National Park Service hard from coast to coast this year.
The Wilderness Society, after conducting an extensive survey of conditions in many parks, issued a survey in May that reported: "A record number of people are expected to visit the national park system, and while they can look forward to rewarding experiences, they may come back home troubled by what they have seen."
The parks budget was tight to begin with, and has recently become even tighter, say officials of the National Park Service. The defeat in Congress of President Clinton's economic stimulus program cut off an anticipated increase in financing -- and cost many seasonal employees their summer jobs. Bad weather this spring reduced the park coffers further, as did a few unusually expensive rescue efforts.
The net effect is that parks around the country are cutting back on their offerings, and visitors -- whose numbers grew to 273 million in 1992, an increase of 6 million over 1991 -- must pay special attention to planning throughout the summer. That will become even more important in the autumn, because after Labor Day there will be further cutbacks at many parks.
"We ain't getting better," said Duncan Morrow, a spokesman in Washington for the park service.
The Wilderness Society, in its survey of major parks, found dozens of campgrounds closed all summer, visitor center hours cut back, fewer rangers on patrol to protect and assist visitors, fewer lifeguards, fewer guided nature walks, less maintenance of trails, buildings and vehicles, and, in many parks, cuts in scientific research.
At the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, for example, there will be only 150 guided programs a week instead of the usual 250, the Wilderness Society found. At the Canadian border of Glacier National Park in Montana, tours have been eliminated and racks of brochures are offered instead. At Olympic National Park in Washington, where 7 percent of the budget goes to interpretive programs, an amphitheater program that used to draw 120 people nightly will be offered only on weekends.
The National Park Service said at the start of the year that its budget was $34 million short of the $986 million needed to maintain last year's level of service. President Clinton's economic stimulus program would have added $253 million to the budget this year, but it was defeated. Many parks raised their entry and camping fees early this year, usually by a dollar or two, but steeper increases that were sought by the parks have not been approved by Congress.
And at about 50 parks, shortages of rangers have resulted in entrance stations' being unstaffed for part of the day, meaning that many visitors enter without paying, further decreasing park income. Park managers say that can't be helped, since rangers cannot be diverted from safety duties.
On top of the budget woes came bad weather. Spring storms cost the park system $6 million; at Shenandoah, it cost $250,000 just to clear the downed trees from Skyline Drive, the winding road that runs along the ridge line, its views of the famous Shenandoah Valley drawing millions to the park.
Search and rescue costs soared, as well. Several dozen students from a boarding school near Detroit were stranded in Great Smoky Mountains National Park during a March blizzard, and the air and ground search cost $100,000. Other incidents cost hundreds of thousands more, and rescue operations this year are already more than 10 times as high as last year's total.
Yosemite National Park in California, with its four million visitors a year, is a good example of a park that is not able to keep up with demand.
Two campgrounds at the park, at Bridalveil Creek and Yosemite Creek, are closed this summer. They contain nearly 10 percent of the 1,900 family campsites in the park. Another campground, at Hodgdon Meadow, which usually operates all year, did not open until this month.
Heavy snow and budget cuts delayed the clearing of Tioga Road in the park, forcing more visitors into the overburdened Yosemite Valley. As a result, for the first time ever, the park had to shut its gates to traffic for hours at a time on May 22 and 23 and again on Memorial Day, said Bob Clopine, a park spokesman at Yosemite.
While events like these stand out, it is the day-to-day decline in services that is affecting more people.
Across the park system, there have been reductions in the hiring of seasonal employees, including rangers, and that has meant cuts in the interpretive programs that educate visitors to the parks about the natural resources they are seeing.
Law enforcement has also suffered. At Big Bend, a park the size of Rhode Island along the Rio Grande in Texas, there are only eight law-enforcement rangers, and there have been incidents of sniping along the river, perhaps related to drug traffic, the Wilderness Society said. Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, linking Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, has no overnight patrols, and arson has been reported during those hours, the society said.
Although visitors' safety is among the highest priorities, park service officials said some safety measures have been sacrificed. At many locations, like Cape Hatteras National Seashore, lifeguards cannot be provided at all of the beaches. Park visitors are not always well informed about potential dangers; if a ranger doesn't tell you that a black-tailed deer, even one used to humans on its territory, may lash out with its deadly hooves, you might approach too close.
At Glacier National Park, with its considerable population of grizzly bears, some trails have had to be closed because inadequate maintenance poses a danger. "Bears are most likely to take on humans when they are surprised," the Wilderness Society explained in its May report, "and poorly maintained trails generally limit visibility and thus increase the likelihood that a hiker will suddenly encounter a grizzly."

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
Jean Dubuffet, Giving Pleasure Despite Himself

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
From beginning to end, the Jean Dubuffet exhibition here at the Hirshhorn Museum is a pleasure to see. Has any other artist strived so hard to seem rude and irascible and yet spread so much pleasure?
It was the central paradox of Dubuffet's career that he both debunked the art establishment more vigorously and received more encomiums from it than probably any European artist of his generation. He made his debut in Paris to fanfare in 1944, his wit and mischievousness apparently proving to be just what that enervated city needed after years of deprivation and humiliation. From then until his death in 1985, at the age of 83, Dubuffet enjoyed the kind of recognition artists mostly dream of. 
 With clocklike regularity, major museums presented exhibitions of his work, beginning in 1960 in Paris and thereafter in New York (1962), Venice (1964), London (1966), Montreal (1969), Chicago (1970), Paris and New York (1973), Berlin (1980), Paris and New York once more (1981). The man whose paintings were often said to represent the very antithesis of the School of Paris became that city's most esteemed artist. When a renovated Jeu de Paume opened there two years ago as a center for contemporary art, it sought to establish its own stature by basking in Dubuffet's, dedicating its inaugural exhibition to his late work.
And now there is this show at the Hirshhorn, through Sept. 12 (it does not travel). With nearly 100 works, it is the most extensive Dubuffet exhibition in the United States in 20 years. Organized by the museum's director, James T. Demetrion, it concentrates on the period from 1943 to 1963, the most fruitful of Dubuffet's artistic life, just before he settled into "L'Hourloupe," the series of paintings and sculptures that was his attempt at a universal kind of public art. He succeeded almost too well. For years, Dubuffet produced the mostly cheerful jigsaw compositions that defined the series, until his art came to seem almost as ubiquitous and predictable as McDonald's. The self-declared anti-establishment man became something of a big business.
But before then, during the years on which this exhibition concentrates, he applied his contentious energy to the creation of one series after another of still surprising audacity.
He was born in 1901 in Le Havre, a port city that had nourished many artists, including Boudin and Braque, but Dubuffet always claimed that the tradition of high art they upheld meant nothing to him. His dream, he once announced with characteristic provocation, was to eliminate all the libraries and museums and erect in the center of every town a statue commemorating Oblivion. "Let us abolish the past and all that comes with it!" he declared.
Dubuffet was hardly the first to say so. But when he said it, he had the momentum of history behind him. It was not coincidental that his career took off at the same time that the writings of Sartre, Camus and Orwell gained widespread attention and that Francis Bacon, Alberto Burri and Lucio Fontana began to make their own marks on the European artistic scene.
Twice Dubuffet made aborted stabs at art; the third try stuck. In 1942 he abandoned his career as a wine merchant to take up painting. Ever the dutiful businessman, and ironist, he sent notes to clients informing them of his "new line of business, pictures." Within months he had completed the first works in this exhibition.
Little wonder they astonished the critics when they were publicly exhibited shortly thereafter. For one thing, Dubuffet's sources, he insisted, were not the reigning masters, like Picasso, but the madmen, derelicts, prisoners, children and marginal figures whose art he had come to admire and began to collect. He called their work Art Brut. For another, his images -- brightly colored and scrawled in an artfully uncouth hand -- were peopled by characters who seemed possessed of a goofy delirium perversely out of place in wartime Paris.
They were gangly pink cows with a caught-in-the-headlights expression, effervescent subway passengers, mustachioed bicyclists and sticklike flaneurs, all with arms akimbo as if dancing some collective jig. They were also smug politicians, like "Le President," and jazz musicians of a magnificent and very endearing silliness.
And they were businessmen at lunch, each in bow tie, each with thick mustache and eyebrows, lined up like understudies for the Last Supper. Dubuffet's gift was to capture the essence of these types, their mores and peccadilloes, with a shrewdness disconcertingly at odds with his deadpan, pseudo-folkish style.
HE WAS CERTAINLY NO genuine naif. A peripatetic intellect,
he numbered among his friends some of the most gifted writers of the day -- Georges Limbour, the poet and critic; Raymond Queneau, the novelist; Armand Salacrou, the playwright -- who often became subjects of his portraits. He undertook a series of such portraits in 1946, fittingly titled "Plus beaux qu'ils croient" ("Handsomer Than They Think").
The paintings, hysterical and amusing and at the same time sharply observed, made use of the sort of materials that soon became a hallmark of Dubuffet's iconoclastic art: pebbles and sand defining eyes, teeth and hair, embedded in gelatinous globs of paint that had the look and consistency of wet concrete. Eventually he came to use concrete itself -- and slag and string and sponges and silver foil and driftwood and, most remarkably, butterfly wings. No artist of the time had a more venturesome and sophisticated approach to materials.
His portraits, and his subsequent series of paintings of female nudes, the "Corps de Dame," were meant to be shocking in their disdain for Western ideals of verisimilitude and beauty. The corpulent and lethargic nudes especially looked as if they had been squashed by steamrollers; they suggest a degree of violence and anger on the part of Dubuffet that is ideal grist for feminist analysis.
But Dubuffet was never as shocking or as radical as he pretended -- and was at first said -- to be. Not only did his art, in fact, build on the achievements of Klee and Miro and other enrollees in the pantheon of high art. It also betrayed a degree of refinement that, particularly with the hindsight of several decades, links it inextricably with those School of Paris artists he professed to abhor.
You can see this in his use of color -- at the time derided as crude and now so clearly the reverse, as in the sparkling hues that seem to bubble up from beneath the muddy surface of "Jazz Band," in the subtly pinkish flesh of "Beautiful Woman With Heavy Breasts" and in the bleeding colors of "The Extravagant Lady." It's also clear in the effulgent color of the "Paris Circus" paintings, which laid the groundwork for "L'Hourloupe" in their dense, compartmentalized compositions and seem suffused with the French capital's exuberance in the economic boom years of the early 1960's.
Dubuffet's refinement can also be sensed in the elegant spareness of the so-called Texturology paintings of 1958, total abstractions that surely owed a debt to the New York School (in 1951, he came to the United States, where his work was immediately embraced). And what could be more fastidious and delicate than his images of figures made out of those butterfly wings?
It takes nothing away from the authenticity of Dubuffet's art to point out that his incendiary rhetoric was one thing and his work another. He may have aspired to the condition of Art Brut, but he remained a Parisian intellectual. This is especially clear when one compares Dubuffet's work with actual Art Brut, or "outsider" art, as it now is called, which has once again become fashionable in this politicized climate of insiders and outsiders. Interest in the work of outsiders lends to this fine Dubuffet show a timeliness. But it needs no such excuse.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Federal Subsidies;
Fresh Money Cranks Up an Aid Program

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A COUPLE named Vivian and Louis Hunter bought a vacant four-family house on Crotona Avenue in the South Bronx at a city auction in 1988. They planned to renovate it, live in it with their daughter and her children, and rent out what they didn't use themselves. But they could never get the project financed.
They have held it ever since, regularly making payments of $634 a month on the $78,750 purchase price, hoping the situation would change. This year it has. 
 The Hunters are among those who will benefit from a new flow of Federal subsidies known by yet another housing catchword, and an odd misnomer, HOME. It was coined from the term Home Investment Partnerships Program, which suggests that it has something to do with home-ownership assistance.
But in fact it is merely a pot of money usable under the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 to provide housing aid for low-income people. Subject to certain restrictions, the money can be applied to construction or reconstruction of houses or rentals.
In New York City, it has supplemented the city's own assistance to a variety of programs. In at least one case it has revived a program that was stalled for lack of adequate subsidy assistance.
This is the housing agency's Small Homes Program, intended to help people renovate small privately owned buildings, sometimes bought at city auctions, in low-income neighborhoods. These projects were once financed by the Federal Section 312 program, a victim of 80's budget cuts. Of $75 million in HOME funds committed so far in New York, $2.9 million has gone to the Small Homes Program.
In Brooklyn, Leonard and Frank Baratta will be able to renovate a five-unit building as low-income rentals at 112 Baltic Street, at Hicks Street, in Cobble Hill. And in Crown Heights, Peter J. M. Moore, a Manhattan architect, and his partner Ralph Lewis, a Brooklyn contractor, will be able to start their long-delayed renovation of 255 Albany Avenue, at Sterling Place. They are planning 12 apartments with a ground-floor store.
The Small Homes Program is only a modest user of HOME funds in the many-faceted activities of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. But all of the benefiting programs have in common a direction toward low- or very-low income people. At least 90 percent of the HOME money used for rentals must assist families with incomes under 60 percent of the areawide median. The median income for a family of four is now $41,700 a year.
This restriction deprives the city of the flexibility it would prefer in using Federal funds to supplement housing efforts. The income limits make it difficult to use the subsidy for mixed-income housing -- the preference in new construction and rehabilitation as well where market conditions would support somewhat higher rents.
IN New York City the preferred income mix in new construction of larger buildings is two-thirds moderate or middle income and one-third low income.
Another shortcoming for New York is that the Federal money cannot be used to finance the social services that are necessary in certain construction projects for residents with special needs. Nor can the money be used to set up a fund for operating assistance to guarantee sufficient income over time if costs rise faster than rent levels. These are perennial problems in high-cost areas with Federal housing programs that are directed to very-low-income people only.
In any event, the HOME money, after a drought in Federal housing funds through most of the 80's, has brought chunks of money to various activities: $19.3 million for building improvements in city-managed tax-foreclosed buildings; $24.4 million for the same in tax-foreclosed buildings under alternate, or noncity, management; $19.4 million to tax-credit low-income housing produced by the Enterprise Foundation and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation; $5.3 million to the small-home rehabilitation projects of the Mutual Housing Association of New York and $3.8 million to the single-room-occupancy loan program.
With more Federal money having been awarded last spring, the city expects to have committed a total of $213 million in HOME funds by the end of fiscal 1994. These funds supplement other Federal housing aid, which is running at about a third the pace of the late 70's and early 80's, when annual budget authorizations were running at $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year. Most of this money is tied to long-term Section 8 or public housing contracts.
THE effects of the Small Home Program are vivid because it brings back to useful life buildings that have been local eyesores, sometimes for 10 to 20 years. And it brings them back at a low enough rent level to provide greater confidence of survival through an economic downturn.
"With H.P.D. financing we can set rents a few dollars lower than if we were calling the shots ourselves," said Mr. Lewis, the East Flatbush contractor who will do the recontruction of 255 Albany Avenue.
With Mr. Moore, the Manhattan architect, he bought five vacant buildings in the 80's and renovated three of them. Mr. Moore said that debt service costs in one eight-family building came to about $25,000 a year. Rents had to average about $600 a month. Although the building's nominal income was $60,000 a year, only 70 percent of rent collections could be depended upon.
"LEGAL expenses were way out of proportion," Mr. Moore said, as efforts were made to evict nonpaying tenants. This is usually a lengthy litigious task in a housing court less sympathetic with an owner's plight than a tenant's.
Under the Small Homes Program, with 1 percent mortgage money from the city, rents will average about $400 a month for a one-bedroom, $500 for a two-bedroom and $600 for a three-bedroom. The builder will try to hold construction costs down to a level that will leave money for a reserve fund after construction. "It should be a $50,000 reserve but it will probably be $25,000," Mr. Moore said.
In fiscal 1993, which ended last Wednesday , 22 loans were committed under the Small Homes Program, to produce 138 housing units at a cost of $7.4 million. About half the properties had been purchased at city auctions, said Carol Corden, the program director, and the rest had been privately held.
In the latter category is the Baratta family's vacant building in Cobble Hill. Anthony Baratta, a lawyer, said his father, Leonard, an accountant, and his brother, Frank, an electrician, bought the building from an owner who had inherited it from an aunt who had lived in it as a one-family house. Bank financing for rehabilitation was unavailable.
UNDER the Small Homes Program the building has obtained $150,000 from the city in a 1 percent loan and a $200,000 Federal grant, repayable after 15 years. City inspectors and engineers decided on the level of reconstruction needed.
And in the Bronx Mrs. Hunter, a home-care attendant, is looking forward to being able to rehabilitate the four-family house at 2026 Crotona Avenue that she has been holding since her 1988 auction purchase. Two daughters and the two young children of one of them live with her and her husband, who works for Coca-Cola Bottling, in a rental on Decatur Avenue.
"We're not rich people," she said. "All these years we've been paying the bills on that house. I'm hoping the city will give us the money to fix it up. But we haven't got a closing date on the loan yet." The housing agency says the closing will come this summer.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Rowayton

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
ROWAYTON residents liken their neighborhood to a Norman Rockwell painting and to towns along the Maine coast. Everyone in the community, which has 500 boat slips, 200 moorings and 4 marinas, seems to know everyone else.
"In Rowayton no one minds if you're fancy or if you're not fancy," said Grace W. Lichtenstein, chairman of the three-member elected commission of Norwalk's Sixth Taxing District, which was set up in 1921 by the Connecticut Legislature to allow Rowayton residents to tax themselves to supply services not provided by Norwalk. Those taxes -- the figure was $555,000 last year -- are applied to the parks, beach and library that help give the community a sense of its own identity, as well as to garbage collection and other services. 
 Wendell Livingston considered it a compromise between Maine and New York when she and her husband, Tom, moved into a 1930's Cape Cod six years ago. "There are small yards, but there's so much going on," said Ms. Livingston, who now has a five-year-old son and two-year-old daughter. "It's a wonderful place to raise children."
"A typical lot is 0.3 acres and a half-acre is considered large," said Gail Van Slyck of Van Slyck & LeMoult Realtors.
Its 1,515 houses are a jumble of cottages, Victorians, colonials and Capes. Members of its three housing associations -- Bell Island, Pine Point and Rowayton Beach -- pay dues for extras such as private beaches and roads.
But no house is more than five minutes from Bayley Beach, which all residents can use, free.
Frank E. Raymond's ancestors moved in 10 generations ago. Mr. Raymond, who remembers skating out of Five Mile River onto Long Island Sound during the freeze of 1934, wrote a history, "Rowayton on the Half Shell," published in 1990 for the Historical Society of Rowayton.
A variant of its name -- Rooaton -- appeared in the deed between Chief Runckinheague of the Siwanoy Indians and settlers in 1651, when only a few sustenance farmers and fishermen lived in the area.
Within 20 years Rowayton became part of Middlesex Parish (Darien) and by the start of the 18th century blacksmiths, shoemakers, carpenters and weavers were contributing to its economy. Oystering was important by the 1860's but oysters succumbed early in this century to overharvesting and pollution.
By then, though, Rowayton had become a summer resort. Its drawing card, Roton Point Park, attracted thousands of daytrippers from New York. Over the years they came to hear and see Rudy Vallee, Alice Faye, Glenn Miller and others and to ride the airplane swing and Big Dipper roller coaster. The park closed in 1942.
In 1910, James A. Farrell, who became president of United States Steel Corporation, built an Elizabethan-style mansion, which burned down three years later and was rebuilt in granite. The building now houses Hewitt Associates, actuaries. Since 1966 the Farrell family stables have been the community center and the library, which has 29,261 books, including 500 on boating.
Though waterfront houses go for over a million dollars and flood insurance is expensive, the waterfront is coveted.
"You can sell land along the water by the square inch," said Douglas A. Bora Sr., a retired local realtor, whose backyard is the river facing Darien.
A renovated four-bedroom 1887 Victorian on 0.11 acre on Rocky Point Road has an octagonal tower overlooking the Sound; it is priced at $1.175 million. Inland, a marble-floored three-bedroom 1890 farmhouse on .32 acres along Oakleigh Court is selling for $409,000. A binder was recently put on a 17-year-old three-bedroom raised-ranch on 0.2 acre along Dean Court, near the railway station, which listed for $179,900.
Rowayton's only condominium is a four-unit converted schoolhouse on Thomas Place, a development that also has detached colonial one-families. Except for Hilltop Homes, which has 24 one- and two-bedroom units for the elderly and disabled, there are few rentals.
"Rowayton has the the best of both worlds," said Ralph Sloan, superintendent of Norwalk Public Schools. "It's a charming village and has the diversity of the Norwalk school system with 40 percent minority enrollment."
BRIEN McMAHON HIGH SCHOOL, with an enrollment of 1,042, attracts students from 10 other towns to its Center for Japanese Study Abroad, which sent 51 of its 53 students to Tokyo in May.
The school also offers nine advanced-placement classes for college credit and at least 80 percent of its graduates go on to higher education.
Roton Middle School, with 370 students, focuses on team teaching, and eight eighth-graders from its new Japanese class joined the high school trip to Japan. Its Robert Oliver Planetarium is being renovated. The k-5 Rowayton Elementary School is undergoing a nearly $3 million upgrading and expansion.
"It's a caring, extended family," said Leslie Pattengill, its principal, alluding to parent participation. The school has a fine-arts and performing-arts core curriculum for its 330 pupils and about 200 to 300 parents come in regularly to help out. They also run the annual Rowayton School Carnival to raise funds.
Children also go to private schools in nearby towns. Preschoolers can take advantage of the local Community Cooperative, Five Mile River and United Church Nursery Schools, as well as the Parents Exchange, in which parents take turns watching one another's children. There is also youth soccer and Little League.
Along with having story hours for children 3 and up and lectures for adults, the library doubles as a mini-town hall. Residents buy permits there for the local tennis and paddle tennis associations, apply for Bayley Beach stickers and buy commuter parking lot permits.
During the annual one-day Trash Bash, a rigorous rite of spring, residents clean up the village. The Memorial Day Parade ended this year with a speech by Mr. Bora urging residents to do something about an eyesore -- Winthrop House, a dilapidated single-room-occupany house on Rowayton Avenue. As usual, hot dogs and soda were given away afterward behind the fire station, which houses the 50-member volunteer Rowayton Hose Co. No. 1, and homemade strawberry shortcake was sold in Pinkney Park, where the annual art show was being held.
Pinkney Park, 2.3 acres along the river, is also the site of the Historical Society in Seeley-Dibble-Pinkney House, and other events such as the River Ramble, featuring canoe races, auctions and 25 pairs of lobsters to be raffled-off on July 17. Laid-back summer evenings can be spent on the lawn there, where 10 Sunday concerts are held during the Summer Arts Festivalthrough Labor Day Weekend.
Bayley Beach bustles with summer activity -- basketball and volleyball games, as well as events like tonight's July Fourth bash with a rock band. In August there will be a lobster bake.
There are also three private clubs: Roton Point, Wee Burn (a beach and tennis annex of the Darien country club) and the Rowayton Yacht Club at Hickory Bluff.
The block-long commercial strip along Rowayton Avenue has such conveniences as a barber shop, a hardware store, a grocery, a drugstore and the post office.
ALTHOUGH there are no local movie theaters, residents can choose from many within a 10-minute drive in Norwalk or a 15-minute drive in Westport or New Canaan. Major shopping is done at a Grand Union in Darien and supermarkets along the Post Road in Norwalk.
Fresh fish is available at Rowayton Seafood, which has four tanks holding up to 5,000 pounds of lobster. Its owners want to open a seafood restaurant in an adjacent building, but have met with some opposition over a lack of parking.
Upper Crust Deli, which has homemade specialties, is a popular meeting place for young mothers. Singles tend to hang out at the bar of the 5 Mile River Grille, known for its new American cuisine. And the Rowayton Arts Center is getting ready to open The Back Porch, where free iced tea and cookies will be served two afternoons a week overlooking the Five Mile River.

Disclosure Now a Key Home-Sales Issue

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
DISCLOSURE is becoming the home-sales issue to reckon with in the 90's. For verification of a property's condition and of the fealty of the broker are increasingly considered vital safeguards against unpleasant surprises following the most important purchase of a lifetime.
Not only buyers and sellers, but a decimated real estate industry find such safeguards desirable. "Competition and litigation are rising while the number of licensed agents has dropped from 36,000 in 1988 to 19,800 today, and inventories are humongous," said Kenneth Smith, coordinator of the University of Connecticut's real estate licensing courses. 
 Unrevealed defects in a house can be dealt with in court, or by local real estate boards, where buyers can file complaints. If after a hearing an agent is found to have violated the National Association of Realtors' code of ethics he can be expelled, losing access to the multiple listings.
"Should the case be forwarded to the state Real Estate Commission he may lose his license," said Chip Kunde, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Realtors in Hartford.
In the absence of state regulations, real estate firms and boards are creating a plethora of individual disclosure forms to deal with today's buyers, who are very different from their free-spending 80's counterparts.
"People are asking more questions," said Adorna Carroll, a New Britain realtor who feels penalties should be imposed for failure to disclose known defects.
"Connecticut has been laissez-faire about disclosure legislation compared with other states," said Dorothy Nowell, director of human resources for William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford. She is organizing a task force of Pitt agents to draw up disclosure policy for the company.
In the legislative session that ended in June a bill to create a standard disclosure form listing all known defects was defeated. It required that sellers and buyers, but not agents, check off the list and sign it. "It's pretty meaningless for a seller to pay an agent a considerable sum and not require him to share some of the responsibility," said Trudy Bird, deputy commissioner of the state's Department of Consumer Protection.
Buyers should be entitled to know everything that the seller and broker know about the condition of a house for sale, including when problems appeared, what repairs were made, what repairs are still necessary, and who is to be held accountable if the furnace blows, the water heater expires, the second-story insulation is missing, or the roof leaks shortly after they move in.
Disclosure, according to Ms. Bird, should also include fee disbursements. "Checks are passed across the table at closings face down to hide how commissions are allocated," she said. "The buyer and seller have the right to see that the commissions they agreed to pay are indeed the commissions paid at the closing."
Laurence Hannafin, director of the consumer agency's real estate division, described how the recession has turned up some misuses of client's funds. For example, a buyer placed a deposit on a house. The agent removed the deposit from an account he kept to pay overdue bills. But the deal fell through and rather than face the consequences of the shortage, the agent disappeared.
Many professionals think that a 1991 regulation requiring that brokers disclose in writing whether they are working for the buyer, seller, or both, should be strengthened by executing the document at the first substantive meeting between broker and buyer, rather than any time before a contract is signed.
Dual agents working for both buyer and seller are controversial but legal, as long as they disclose their position. "When representing both," said Marie Bacoli, a lawyer with the Hartford firm of Robinson & Cole, "you have fiduciary duties to each and you immediately see the conflict when you negotiate price."
INDEPENDENT buyer brokers as opposed to those working within traditional companies are few in numbers. "We are forming a Connecticut Association of Buyer Agents with about 20 members," said Rick Dressler, an education specialist with Westledge Real Estate in Avon. Buyer brokers handle fully 25 percent of the agency's transactions.
Diane Nash, head of the firm, believes that "they are in a better position to advise clients how to structure an offer and negotiate terms that meet his needs -- advice that a seller's broker cannot give, nor can he reveal that the seller would accept a lower price."
Buyer brokers customarily get a retainer of a few hundred dollars that becomes part of the purchase price, and they prefer purchasers who are pre-approved by a lender.
Home inspections are the only tool for unearthing a property's problems, and they are usually paid for by the buyer. But William Raveis, president of the real estate company that bears his name, encourages sellers to pay about $225 for a basic pre-inspection, leaving the report at the house for buyers to see.
"We insist on professional inspection," said Mr. Raveis, "even though the results may be serious enough for the deal to fall through. Buyers can't rely on agents as experts. Most agents don't know copper wire from bx cable." He said he felt that legislated disclosure forms would be helpful in creating a standard for the state's realtors.
"Basic inspections," said Ron Passaro, head of Res-i-tec, a 20- year-old national inspection company in Bethel, "cover interior and exterior construction, utilities and appliances, but not testing of septics and wells, termites, radon and lead testing, buried oil tanks and other specifics."
Hiring one of the 165 home inspection companies in Connecticut can cost from $200 to $1,000, depending on the house and the menu. "The worst kind is the brand new house," said Mr. Passaro. "Older homes show their faults, but you have to look carefully in a new house. There was a lot of shoddy construction in the 80's."
Most reliable companies exceed the minimal standards set by the American Society of Home Inspectors, the industry's professional organization in Washington. "We encourage buyers to walk the house with us," said John Ghent, president of Goldring Home Inspections in Trumbull, "and it's best if the seller is not at home."

HEADLINE: Another Opinion On School Budgets

 BODY:
Regarding the Q. & A. column of June 6, which quoted from an interview with Janet S. Walker, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, I am deeply disappointed that you gave so much space to a paid lobbyist with vested interests in maintaining the stutus quo in terms of school budgets. I formed a group in White Plains working to get the vote on the school budget here and in the other 56 small cities in New York State.
In White Plains, we face a 13 percent increase in school taxes after a 10 percent increase last year and a 13 percent increase the year before. Our school taxes are consistently higher than our city taxes. We average a $15,500 per student yearly expenditure when the state average is $7,500 and the national average is $4,000. We have an overpaid, underworked group of teachers who instead of giving extra time for tutoring or counseling negotiate these functions as well as hall duty out of their contracts, and then blame the poor performance of their students in terms of standardized tests and ranking with their peer groups on the diversity of the student population. 
 We have dozens of administrators in the high school who see their main function as disciplinarians instead of mentors or role models. Since I have a thorough knowledge of statistics and possess some plain common sense, I know the state study was not flawed. I applaud the state and Governor Cuomo in their efforts to monitor the excesses in the bureaucracy that Ms. Katz is paid to defend.
I suggest that all people in Westchester concerned with the high cost of educating our youngsters read the report "Nation at Risk" and the Merritt Lindsey Report. The need to defend raising taxes by such school teacher verbiage as micro, macro, mini-macro is nonsense.
The bottom line is that the product you are turning out is not competitive in the real world because the school establishment doesn't live in the real world. Get real -- this is no longer a farm economy -- children need more than 185 days of school and who says throwing good money after bad will provide "quality" education?

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Two Scripts for Talking in Tokyo

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE Japanese love meetings. Just ask anyone who has worked in a Japanese-run office. And they are particularly fond of precisely managed meetings designed to come to a preordained result, which is why they usually thrive at summits.
So months ago they roughed out a script for the Tokyo summit meeting that opens here Tuesday: President Clinton would be welcomed by the unshakable leaders of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which came to power four decades ago as the symbol of the American alliance. After some tough talk with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa about the trade surplus (some things cannot be avoided), the two would emerge with a "framework" for the next several years of trade talks. There would be talk of progress on the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, and of more aid to Russia. They would agree to call each other Bill and Kiichi. And Japan would go on to serve as host to the rest of the Group of Seven, using the moment (discreetly, of course) to make its case for a permanent seat on the Security Council. 
 But even the Japanese, it turns out, can muck up a good business plan.
Just days before the meeting, the framework had yet to come together, efforts to jump-start the global trade talks had largely failed, and Washington's plan to create a $4 billion fund to privatize Russian business had been shrinking ever since Japan's Foreign Minister called the amount preposterous.
But most important, Bill's new friend Kiichi seemed bound to be out of power in two weeks -- along with the party that always knew better than to jeopardize America's relationship with Japan.
Indeed, because endemic corruption is finally an issue that may unseat Japan's power brokers, Mr. Clinton will be landing in the midst of the wildest election here since Gen. Douglas MacArthur left town at the end of the postwar occupation. Sound trucks will be cruising the streets below his hotel room, candidates blaring their names and waving to a wary electorate -- hardly a dignified backdrop for a summit. "It is a little like the Japanese showing up in Washington to rebuild the relationship a week before a Presidential election," one frustrated summit aide said the other day. "No one would know they were there."
But it will be hard to miss Mr. Clinton -- partly because he is, in a very real way, an undeclared candidate in the July 18 elections here. For years now a key element of American trade strategy toward Japan has been to push the country toward consumers instead of manufacturers, toward imports instead of home-grown goods, toward better housing and shorter working hours. And while no one said it publicly, the same ruling party that America once hailed, and covertly financed, as the party of anti-Communism also became the party of economic protectionism.
Over time the Liberal Democrats represented so many interest groups that the political scene here seemed frozen in the 1950's. Policy was designed to keep prices in Japan high so that companies had the money to attack foreign markets; farmers still wield great clout, even though most are weekend rice-growers whose big harvests are Corollas and computers.
Mr. Clinton's advisers clearly see the elections as a chance to break out of that trap. "I think that the changes now going on in Japan, over the long run, they're going to be good for the Japanese people and good for the American people," Mr. Clinton said Friday. And while professing neutrality in the election, his advisers are making sure he is seen spending some time with men like Ichiro Ozawa, a one-time political fixer for some of Japan's most corrupt politicians who led the defections from the ruling party.
 
A Familiar Platform
 In a new book he conveniently published this week, Mr. Ozawa sometimes sounds like his platform was written on Pennsylvania Avenue. " 'Japanese-style democracy' is no longer able to respond adequately to the changes taking place at home and abroad," he complains. "We can no longer enjoy the luxury of devoting ourselves exclusively to our own economic development as we did during the cold war era." He even speaks of new freedoms for the Japanese, including "freedom from the company," "freedom from overwork" and "freedom from regulation."
Sounds great, but there are reasons to wonder how sincere it all is. Mr. Ozawa and his friends spent decades in the L.D.P. vineyards; he only bolted the party and talked openly about remaking the lives of ordinary Japanese after his mentor was caught with $50 million in political payoffs.
Even if such reform leaders can be taken at face value, in the short run America's troubles with Japan seem bound to worsen. The weakness of politicians here is an invitation for bureaucrats to dig in, protecting big-business constituents. Some think that is why the pre-summit trade talks failed. "In the absence of a strong political vision for the country, each of the bureaucracies will just strengthen its domain," said Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation.
Japan, of course, has had a vision-thing problem for a long time. The political culture has never encouraged the expression of a national mission or broad ideals; instead, officials here talk about building "relationships" with their most vital allies.
One reason that the Clinton White House and the Japanese have done so much talking past each other is that they have such widely differing agendas. Beneath the argument over how to come up with ways to measure the success of trade agreements, for example, is a Japanese fear that Washington ultimately sees relations only as figures on a balance sheet.
So for Mr. Clinton this week, the object will be how to speed the forces of reform without appearing to take sides in the election. For the Liberal Democrats, the object will be to speed through the summit and bundle Mr. Clinton out of town before he turns their nightmare into something worse.
In fact, the meeting itself seem far from the minds of men like Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese Finance Minister. Rather than focus on the summit, he admitted Friday, he spent most of last week twisting the arms of banks and insurance companies, which his ministry regulates, for campaign donations. He seemed a bit shocked when people suggested this was just the kind of ethical lapse that got the Liberal Democrats into such trouble. "Is their any problem in my making such requests to those people?" he asked Japanese reporters. "I am a politician before I am a finance minister."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Why Uncle Sam Isn't A Better Landlord

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR anyone trying to get a grip on the dimensions of the Federal Government's property-management problems, two related and disturbing events of last month are especially instructive.
In the first, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proved to be to urban development roughly what Dutch elm disease is to elms. Trying, shotgun-style, to boost housing construction, the agency guaranteed private loans for apartment complexes nationwide, then forgot to monitor its investment. The economy soured, the complexes went bust, drug addicts moved in and buildings started to fall apart. Last month HUD said it may hold the bag on $11.9 billion in bad loans. Taxpayers, of course, will foot the bill. 
 That is the first disturbing development. The second is that hardly anyone noticed.
People are used to this sort of thing. Granted, the trackless Federal bureaucracy does some things well, even heroically, with little notice. But on many basic management issues, from offices to parks to military bases to forests, it often seems to have entrusted trillions of dollars in land and assets to civil servants named Moe, Larry and Shemp.
As the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission completed its recommendations last week on closing 31 military posts, Defense Secretary Les Aspin noted that the Pentagon has been under orders for years to shut down 42 other bases, but so far has gotten around to 13. "There are literally thousands of separate actions" required to close a base, he said, "and all too often these actions have not been done concurrently."
At the Interior Department, officials have deferred $2.1 billion in parks maintenance, even though they have hardly begun to tap an obvious revenue source: park users. Visitors' fees cover barely a quarter of the cost of services, and staff shortages leave some fee-collection booths vacant.
At the Resolution Trust Corporation, steward of bankrupt savings-and-loans and their assets, managers decided last year to cut costs by canceling insurance on property seized from thrifts. That was just before Hurricane Andrew roared through Miami and carried away a good chunk of seized property.
The agency has won better reviews lately for its handling of the S & L crisis. But early on it was assailed for letting speculators pick up the better thrifts for mere pocket change, while taxpayers paid for the dogs. Why can't the Government run things right? Two Hoover commissions tried to find out for Truman and Eisenhower in the 1940's and 1950's. Ronald Reagan focused the Grace and Packard commissions on the issue in the 1980's. Now President Clinton has ordered a "national performance review," headed by the Vice President and plowing much the same ground -- but more deeply, of course. Mr. Clinton says this study will not gather dust in some warehouse like past ones.
But the basic question does not really demand such deep thought. In government, as in most areas of endeavor, there is a certain level of ineptitude. The worst Federal mismanagement, however, is not personal but systemic. Ours is a bureaucracy where priorities are determined by the peculiar logic of politics; where the rewards for parsimonious management are a budget or staff cut, not higher profits or a promotion; where success is measured, if it's measured at all, in dollars spent.
Conservatives think government would run better if it were managed like a business. But it isn't a business; it's a monopoly.
"The reason that in the private sector we get spanking new shopping centers and so on, and in the public sector you get HUD, is that the private sector makes a pile of money when everything goes right," said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "In government, that's not supposed to happen. And if it did, everyone would be screaming because it would be unfair competition."
Reformers want to improve government by ending favoritism. But favors are the essence of politics, and they are unlikely to vanish. "Do we lease government lands for cattle grazing at costs below what the private sector would charge? Of course we do," said Paul R. Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, an environmental think-tank. "Do we know the reason? Sure: soon as we try to raise it up to market levels, senators and congressmen raise the roof."
 
Jobs and Plunder
 Indeed, Mr. Clinton tried this year to raise the dirt-cheap grazing fees and was immediately slapped down by Western Democratic senators.
Similar examples abound. The Interior Department lets miners extract huge amounts of ore from public lands without paying a penny in compensation. Congress could change the 121-year-old law that allows such plunder, but chooses not to.
Similarly, the Forest Service loses scores of millions of dollars annually by selling public timber at prices well below the Government's cost; some in Congress complain, but nothing is done because the practice creates jobs. Last week, Mr. Clinton ordered reduced tree-cutting on Forest Service lands in the Northwest, but only after he also agreed to pony up $1.2 billion in economic aid for the logging region, which includes the home district of the Speaker of the House.
Finally, up-in-arms taxpayers want to root out incompetence. But much of it is generic to a government that exists to serve, not to prosper.
"Federal programs by and large suffer from some very common, fundamental flaws," said a Federal official. "They don't have defined objectives. And where they do have defined objectives, they're input objectives, not outcome."
What's the difference? Take the HUD fiasco, in which managers blindly measured success by inputs -- the number of guaranteed loans issued and the number of apartments built -- instead of by the outcome, whether the apartments were occupied and livable.
The temptation to despair over such regular and profound lapses is great. The Government controls a third of the nation's land area, 1.4 billion acres of ocean floor, 12,000 miles of waterways and enough office space -- 400,000 buildings -- to supplant all the office towers in the country's 10 largest cities. The potential for mismanagement stretches from sea to shining sea.
But while there is certainly room for improvement, no amount of fulmination is likely to produce a clockwork government. The built-in irrationalities will never change, Mr. Portney says. "The real key," he says, "is to weed out the discretionary incompetence."

HEADLINE: Overview of the Term;
The Court's Counterrevolution Comes in Fits and Starts

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMONG the flood of opinions that ended the Supreme Court's term last week, two in particular underscored the complex and contradictory personality of a Court poised on the threshold of change.
On the one hand, the Court strode with surprising unanimity across a new constitutional frontier in a case about Government seizure of assets, announcing a new constitutional right grounded in the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines. Having only once before even examined the excessive fines clause, the Court turned it into a potentially powerful brake on the Government's aggressive use of its authority under the drug forfeiture laws. 
 Simultaneously, a decision in a voting rights case plowed familiar and painful ground for the Court, revealing the persistence of deep divisions over how to interpret the constitutional guarantee of equal protection in the context of racial distinctions made for assertedly benign reasons. Five Justices said the Court's precedents made presumptively unconstitutional any oddly shaped legislative district drawn for the sole purpose of increasing minority representation, while the four others drew the opposite conclusion from the same precedents.
Often united -- the Court was unanimous, in result if not always in the rationale, in nearly half its cases this term, far more than in recent years -- the Court nonetheless remains sharply divided in such important areas as religion and civil rights.
Often tentative and incremental in its approach, the Court took some unexpectedly decisive steps this term, as in Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's opinion upholding state laws that provide longer sentences for crimes motivated by bias. The decision was unanimous.
Rulings in two civil rights cases, the voting rights case and a decision making a category of cases under the Federal law against employment discrimination harder for employees to win, showed dramatically the impact of the Justices named to the Court by Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Four of those Justices -- Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- joined Chief Justice Rehnquist to provide 5-to-4 majorities in the two cases, which would almost certainly have been decided differently only a few years ago. Justice Thomas's votes were particularly notable because there is no doubt that Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom Justice Thomas succeeded in 1991, would have been on the other side.
But another decision demonstrated the limits of the Court's counterrevolution. The Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment can make it unconstitutional to confine a nonsmoking prisoner in a cell with a chain-smoker. The decision rejected the Bush Administration's view that this "novel Eighth Amendment claim" was "without merit."
Justice Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion that took issue with 17 years of Supreme Court precedents on unconstitutional prison conditions, arguing that all were based on a broad view of the Eighth Amendment at variance with the framers' original intent. Only Justice Scalia joined the dissent. The vote in the case was 7 to 2.
As Justice Thomas maintained a predictable alliance with Justice Scalia -- the two voted together in more than 80 percent of the non-unanimous cases -- Justice David H. Souter emerged this term as perhaps the Court's least predictable member.
Justice Souter, who like Justice Thomas was named to the Court by President Bush, dissented in the two civil rights cases as well as in a series of criminal-law rulings in which the conservative majority prevailed. Notable among these was a decision refusing to permit a Texas death-row inmate, Leonel Herrera, to bring a belated claim of innocence into Federal court through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The vote was 6 to 3, with Justice Souter joining Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens in dissent.
Justice Souter also dissented from a 5-to-4 decision in a double jeopardy case, in which the majority overturned a three-year-old precedent that had broadened the double jeopardy defense. His allies in dissent were Justices Blackmun, Stevens and Byron R. White. And in a church-state case, he dissented from the Chief Justice's 5-to-4 opinion that found no constitutional objection to the government paying for a sign-language interpreter for a deaf parochial school student.
These developments do not necessarily mean that the conservative New Hampshire judge suddenly emerged this year as a liberal; "liberal" has been a highly relative term at the Supreme Court since the retirements of Justice Marshall and Justice William J. Brennan Jr., whom Justice Souter succeeded in 1990.
Rather, Justice Souter's hallmark is a willingness to confront some of the Court's murkiest doctrinal areas, working his way through the contradictions to try at the same time both to make sense of the precedents that apply and to steer clear of those that do not. Through this process, he appears this term to have found a personal voice almost completely free of ideological identity.
For example, in his dissenting opinion in the voting rights case, Justice Souter identified the flaw in Justice O'Connor's majority opinion as a confusion of categories. The majority drew on precedents in the affirmative action and public contracting area; in light of those precedents, it was not hard to deem the bizarre-looking North Carolina Congressional District an unjustifiable racial preference.
Without commenting directly on the affirmative action cases -- on which he may well agree with the conservative majority -- Justice Souter said the analogy was inapt. Unlike the workplace, where a job or contract for one person may leave someone else empty-handed, redistricting does not confer a zero-sum benefit, he said. Everyone can still vote, no matter where the district lines are; the Constitution is offended only by some further action such as an effort to use district lines to dilute a racial group's political power.
Justice Souter's independence made him a frequent dissenter. He dissented in 12 of the 17 cases that were decided by 5-to-4 votes. In 40 cases in which Justice Scalia and Justice Blackmun were on opposite sides, he voted with Justice Scalia in 56 percent and with Justice Blackmun in 44 percent.
The least frequent dissenter was Justice Kennedy, who dissented in only four of the 5-to-4 decision and in five out of 107 decisions over all. The term found Justice Kennedy anchored in the Court's mainstream. For example, he dissented only twice in 30 criminal law decisions.
Presumably the center of gravity will shift with Justice White's retirement and the all but certain confirmation of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the first Supreme Court nominee by a Democratic President in 26 years. How great the shift will be is not yet clear; Justice White was in dissent in the civil rights decisions, for example, so his departure does not open those rulings to challenge even assuming Judge Ginsburg shares his displeasure. In other areas in which the Court is often closely divided, including free speech, religion and abortion, Judge Ginsburg is likely to be substantially more liberal than Justice White.
With characteristic wryness, Justice White ended his 31-year Supreme Court career on Monday by expressing the hope that the Court's future opinions would be "clear, crisp" and easy for lower court judges to understand and apply. Whatever new departures are now in store for the Court, fulfilling Justice White's wish is not likely to be one of them.
Following are summaries of some of the Court's major rulings of the term, which began Oct. 5 and ended June 28.
 
Criminal Law
Restrictions on Seizing A Suspect's Property And on Death Penalty Appeals
 For the first time, the Court set a constitutional limit on the Government's power to seize the homes, businesses and other property of criminals and suspects, invoking the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against "excessive fines" clause to hold that a forfeiture can be excessive.
The 9-to-0 ruling in Austin v. U.S., No. 92-6073, left to the lower courts the application of that general principle to specific cases. In this case, a North Dakota man lost his business and mobile home after selling two grams of cocaine to an undercover agent.
An earlier forfeiture case this term, involving a statute rather than the Constitution, had indicated the Court's growing skepticism toward the Government's aggressive use of forfeiture as a tool in the war on drugs. The Court interpreted a Federal drug forfeiture law to provide an exception for "innocent owners" that was considerably broader than the Government's view of that defense. The 6-to-3 vote in U.S. v. A Parcel of Land, No. 91-781, permitted a woman to defend her house against forfeiture on the ground that she did not know the money used to buy the house came from her boyfriend's drug dealing.
In the second Eighth Amendment case, the Court ruled by a vote of 7 to 2 that it may be cruel and unusual punishment to confine a nonsmoking prisoner in a cell with a chain-smoking cellmate. The Eighth Amendment applies to future as well as current harm to prisoners, the Court ruled in Helling v. McKinney, No. 91-1958.
Prisoners fared less well outside the Eighth Amendment area; the Court continued to take a restrictive view of the right of state inmates to seek Federal court review of their convictions or sentences through petitions for writs of habeas corpus. In a Texas death penalty case, the Court ruled 6 to 3 that a belated claim of innocence does not ordinarily entitle a death-row inmate to a new Federal court hearing before being executed.
The inmate, Leonel Herrera, had tried to reopen his case with new evidence 10 years after his conviction for murder. The Supreme Court rejected his argument that the 30-day limit for seeking a new trial under Texas law is unconstitutional. He was executed several months after the Court's ruling in Herrera v. Collins, No. 91-7328. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, with Justices Blackmun, Stevens and Souter dissenting.
In another significant habeas corpus defeat for prisoners, the Court ruled 5 to 4 that Federal courts may not overturn a state conviction on the basis of constitutional error unless the prisoner can show that he suffered "actual prejudice" from the error. The decision, Brecht v. Abrahamson, No. 91-7358, had the effect of shifting the burden of proof from the state to the prisoner, because the state previously had the burden of proving that any constitutional error was "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the decision, with Justices White, O'Connor, Souter and Blackmun dissenting.
The one habeas corpus decision that was a victory for prisoners did not actually change the law, but rather preserved the status quo. Voting 5 to 4, the Court refused to close off Federal court access for prisoners seeking to challenge their convictions on the ground that they had been interrogated by the police without first receiving their Miranda warning of the right to remain silent.
Justice Souter's majority opinion rejected the view, pressed by the Bush Administration, that prisoners who had already received one "full and fair opportunity" to make a Miranda argument in a state-court appeal should not be able to reargue the question in Federal court. Chief Justice Rehnquist along with Justice Scalia, O'Connor and Thomas dissented in Withrow v. Williams, No. 91-1030.
Overturning a three-year-old precedent that had broadened the definition of double jeopardy, the Court ruled 5 to 4 that a man could be prosecuted for trying to kill his wife after having already been held in criminal contempt for violating a court order not to assault her. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in U.S. v. Dixon, No. 91-1231, with Justices Souter, White, Stevens and Blackmun dissenting.
The Court ruled unanimously that the police do not need a warrant to seize narcotics that were recognizable by "plain feel" while frisking a suspect for concealed weapons. The decision, Minnesota v. Dickerson, No. 91-2019, created a tactile analogue to the "plain view" doctrine, under which police do not need a warrant to seize clearly visible items.
The Court ruled unanimously that regardless of the evidence, a criminal conviction is invalid if the judge did not instruct the jury properly on finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Such a mistake can never be "harmless error," the Court said in Sullivan v. Louisiana, No. 92-5129.
 
Civil Rights
New Hurdles for Black Majority Districts And Job Bias Suits
 With two 5-to-4 decisions, one interpreting the Constitution and the other the Federal law against employment discrimination, the Court forcefully re-entered the civil rights debate.
The Court ruled that legislative districts drawn in "bizarre" shapes and designed to increased black representation can violate the constitutional rights of white voters to equal protection of the law.
The district in question was the 12th Congressional District of North Carolina, a narrow 160-mile long ribbon running through 10 counties along Interstate 85. In her majority opinion in Shaw v. Reno, No. 92-357, Justice O'Connor said the district "resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past" and that the state must demonstrate a "compelling interest" for having drawn it in disregard of traditional redistricting criteria favoring compact and contiguous districts.
While the decision cast doubt on the fate of a number of new black-majority districts, its full impact is unclear because the Court did not distinguish a "bizarre" district from the merely unusual.
In the employment discrimination case, the Court placed a new legal burden on workers who show that an employer gave a dishonest courtroom explanation for an apparently discriminatory action. In the view of most courts, at that point the worker was entitled to a favorable judgment, even if there was no direct evidence of discrimination.
But the Court ruled in St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, No. 92-602, that the worker may still be required to present direct evidence of the employer's discriminatory intent or to refute theoretical explanations other than the one the employer offered. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion.
In both cases, the dissenters were the same: Justices White, Stevens, Blackmun and Souter.
 
Free Speech
A Hate-Crime Statute With Increased Sentences Is Finally Upheld
 The most important free-speech question of the term was the validity of state hate-crime laws that provide increased sentences for violent crimes motivated by bias. The Court unanimously upheld a Wisconsin law that is similar to those on the books in half the states. Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Wisconsin v. Mitchell, No. 92-515, said that the law was aimed at "conduct unprotected by the First Amendment" rather than the defendant's thoughts or expression.
In a significant ruling on commercial speech, the Court reaffirmed its view that advertising is protected by the First Amendment and held that a city could not automatically bar advertising brochures from newspaper vending machines on public property. Justice Stevens wrote the 6-to-3 opinion in Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, No. 91-1200; the dissenters were Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Thomas.
In a case raising a question under the Freedom of Information Act rather than the Constitution, the Court unanimously rejected the Justice Department's sweeping assertion that all sources supplying information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a criminal investigation should be treated as "confidential" and exempt from disclosure. (U.S. v. Landano, No. 91-2054).
 
Abortion
Two Laws Banned, One Stays And Operation Rescue Triumphs Over Federal Judges
 The Court displayed no interest in revisiting or elaborating on its 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey that reaffirmed a constitutional right to abortion. The Justices refused to hear appeals from Louisiana and the territory of Guam, where laws banning most abortion had been declared unconstitutional by lower Federal courts. At the same time, the Court refused to hear a challenge by abortion-rights advocates to a Mississippi law with a 24-hour waiting period, similar to Pennsylvania's waiting period that the Justices upheld in the Casey decision.
By a 6-to-3 vote, the Court removed a tool that judges around the country had used to protect abortion clinics against disruptive protests by Operation Rescue and other anti-abortion groups. The Court ruled in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, No. 90-985, that a Reconstruction-era civil rights law enacted to protect blacks from the Ku Klux Klan did not give Federal judges jurisdiction to issue injunctions against the blockades and mass protests.
Justice Scalia wrote the opinion, from which Justices Stevens, O'Connor and Blackmun dissented. In its next term, the Court will decide whether abortion clinics can sue the organizers of the demonstrations under the Federal racketeering law.
 
Government
The U.S. May Intercept Fleeing Haitians at Sea And Deny Them Asylum
 The Court upheld the Senate's shortcut procedure for conducting impeachment trials of Federal judges, ruling 9 to 0 that the Senate's choice of how to discharge its constitutional duty to "try all impeachments" is not subject to judicial review.
The decision, Nixon v. U.S., No. 91-740, effectively upheld the recent removal of two impeached Federal judges, Walter L. Nixon and Alcee L. Hastings, who is now a Congressman from Florida. For their trials, a special committee of 12 Senators heard witnesses and compiled evidence, tasks that the judges argued had to be done by the Senate as a whole and could not be delegated.
The Court upheld the Bush and Clinton Administrations' policy of intercepting fleeing Haitians at sea and returning them to Haiti without asylum hearings. The 8-to-1 decision, written by Justice Stevens with Justice Blackmun dissenting, rejected arguments that the policy violated Federal immigration law and an international treaty on refugees. (Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, No. 92-344).
 
Courts
When Science Experts Knock, Judges Will Be The Gatekeepers
 In its first ruling on the place of scientific evidence in Federal courtrooms, the Court placed judges firmly in charge of keeping bad science out and letting good science in. The 7-to-2 decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow, No. 92-102, held that while an expert witness's actual conclusions need not be "generally accepted" in the scientific community, the "methods and procedures" used in reaching those results must be valid. The judge should limit the jury's consideration to testimony or evidence that is "not only relevant, but reliable," Justice Blackmun said for the Court.
The Court had been widely expected to set a new constitutional limit on punitive damages this term. But it declined to do so, instead upholding a $10-million punitive damage award for a $19,000 injury, in a 6-to-3 decision that made little new law. The Court found that the award, while "certainly large," bore enough relationship to the economic stakes involved in the commercial dispute over rights to a West Virginia oil field as not to violate the losing side's right to due process of law. (TXO Production v. Alliance Resources, No. 92-479).
 
Religion
The Standoff Between Church and State Eases at School
 Despite three church-state cases on its docket, the Court made little new law in this area. It ruled 9 to 0 that a Hialeah, Fla. ordinance banning ritual animal sacrifice violated the free-exercise rights of adherents of the Santeria religion, in which animal sacrifice has a central role. The Court found that the ordinance, which was drafted to allow such practices as recreational hunting and kosher slaughter to continue, had the unconstitutional purpose of suppressing religious observance. (Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, No. 91-948)
In another 9-to-0 decision, the Court ruled that public school systems that open their schools to after-hours use by community groups must permit religious groups to use the buildings on the same terms. The Court held in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School District, No. 91-2024, that a religious viewpoint could not constitutionally be excluded from a public forum open to other viewpoints.
The Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Constitution permits using government money to pay for a sign-language interpreter to accompany a deaf child to a parochial school. The child would have been entitled to the interpreter in public school under a Federal law that requires appropriate services for handicapped schoolchildren. The question in Zobrest v. Catalina School District, No. 92-94, was whether providing the service in a parochial school amounted to an unconstitutional establishment of religion.
Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion said that the interpreter was a permissible service aimed at helping the child and not the school. Justices Blackmun, Souter, O'Connor and Stevens dissented.
 
Taxes, Business
Moonlighters' Alert: Deductions for Home Offices Take a Hit
 The Court made it harder than ever for taxpayers to take deductions for the spare rooms they use at home to handle the administrative aspects their businesses.
By an 8-to-1 vote, the Court backed the Internal Revenue Service's view that the question is not whether a home office is legitimate or even necessary, but whether it is the place where the taxpayer's most important professional activities take place. The decision, Commissioner v. Soliman, No. 91-998, refused a deduction claimed by an anesthesiologist who used his home as his only office, while practicing his profession in hospital operating rooms.
The Court redefined its rules on retroactivity, making a four-year-old tax ruling retroactive in a decision that may require 16 states to pay huge refunds to retired Federal workers who did not get a tax break that the states made available to their own retired workers. The Court had ruled in 1989 that the disparity violated a Federal law barring state tax discrimination against Federal employees. As much as $2 billion is at stake in the 7-to-2 decision, Harper v. Virginia, No. 91-794.
The Court ruled that accountants, lawyers and other outside advisers to corrupt companies cannot be sued under the Federal racketeering law unless they actually participated in the operation or management of the client organization. The 7-to-2 ruling, Reves v. Ernst & Young, No. 91-886, shields outside professionals, whose deep pockets make them attractive targets for shareholder lawsuits in securities cases, from the threat of triple damages liability.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Two Scripts for Talking in Tokyo

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JAPAN'S Ambassador to the United States, Takakazu Kuriyama, was at the White House recently to talk about the Clinton Administration's emerging Japan policy. The Clinton team had to be patient in dealing with Japan on trade problems, said the ambassador. The Clintonites responded in effect with two words: "Trade imbalance." Washington should not forget the importance of security and political cooperation with Japan, said the ambassador. The Clintonites responded: "Trade imbalance."
It went on that way for an hour, as the American side tried to hammer home to the Japanese the shift in Japan policy being undertaken by the Clinton Administration. Since World War II United States-Japan policy has been like a three-legged stool: the security relationship, focused on cooperation against the Soviet Union, the political relationship, focused on cooperation to promote democracy around the globe, and the economic relationship, with all of the frictions over trade. 
 For 40 years the solidity of the first two legs tended to compensate for troubles with the economic leg, and kept the relationship balanced. But since the end of the cold war, the political and security legs have lost some strength, and can no longer compensate for the fact that the economic leg is more wobbly than ever: Japan, at $49 billion a year, has run up a total trade surplus with the United States of nearly $500 billion over the last decade. The key question raised by the Clinton approach to Japan is this: Can the relationship really tolerate any longer the pain that might be required to balance the economic leg?
"The basic change," said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, "is that we are putting an urgent focus on the economic dimension -- not because it is the only dimension we care about, but because it is the one that needs fixing now. We have to focus on it both for its own sake and because, if it is not fixed, over time it could infect the other dimensions of the relationship."
 
A Different Atmosphere
 The culture of Japan policy-making in the Clinton Administration contrasts sharply with the Reagan-Bush years. Reagan-Bush trade negotiators were as tough as any, but the overall tone of that Administration was often milder. In part this was because whenever the trade negotiators wanted to really play hardball, the Pentagon and State Department would try to soften the blows, arguing that Japan's cooperation was needed against Moscow. President Bush, himself, had little interest in the making of Japan policy. Given a choice between discussing arcana like the homologation of auto parts with Tokyo and negotiating arms control with the Soviets, he always chose the latter.
Mr. Clinton, by contrast, is far more interested in discussing the balance of trade than the balance of power, and he looks at Japan not like some giant American aircraft carrier in the Pacific that needs careful tending, but more as an extension of America's domestic economic difficulties that must be confronted. Mr. Clinton's economic advisers do not tell war stories about how they cooperated with the Japanese, shoulder to shoulder, to confront the Soviets in Asia. The scars they show off are from confrontations with Japan in the global marketplace.
"In the old days, an American President would talk to the Japanese and say, 'Here are the security issues, here are the political issues, and, oops, we ran out of time to talk about the economic issues,' " said a top Clinton economic adviser. "No more."
Beyond the new tone, and their quiet effort to devalue the dollar against the yen, the Clinton Administration's Japan policy is focused on opening Japan's markets in a way that can be measured by increases in Japanese imports of foreign manufactured goods. This includes autos, parts, insurance, banking services and general Japanese Government procurements. The United States also wants Japan to reduce its world trade surplus ($107.1 billion last year) from the current 3.3 percent of its gross national product to between 1.5 and 2 percent of G.N.P. In return, Mr. Clinton is promising that America will keep its own markets open to Japan and get its own economic house in order.
So far the talks have gone nowhere, hopes of a deal before this week's economic summit meeting in Tokyo have been dashed, and Japanese diplomats are warning their American counterparts to back off. As one put it: "If the President does not care about the political-security side of the relationship, it will have an adverse effect on the economic relations."
Clinton advisers don't buy that. Said one top trade negotiator: "We're not asking the Japanese to do anything against the interests of their consumers, who will benefit from lower import prices. They think they can wait us out, and they are wrong. Our market is more important to them than theirs is to us. Furthermore, I really don't think that from a security point of view the Japanese are ready to take a lot of risks in their relationship with us. The leverage is on our side; it is just a question of deploying it."
What worries some analysts of the Clinton approach is that it somehow assumes that the trade imbalance with Japan can be repaired by negotiated decisions. Most experts are convinced that the biggest factors affecting the trade imbalance are things like relative saving rates, quality standards and productivity rates that are beyond the control of governments and tend to be based on deep cultural traditions. Japan must lower its trade barriers, to be sure, but even if it removed them all it would still have a huge trade surplus with the United States.
So even under the best of circumstances any change will be incremental and long-term. The trick for Mr. Clinton will be to put enough pressure on the Japanese to open markets where there are real barriers, without generating so much pressure that unrealistic expectations -- or a Japanese backlash -- develop.
Washington has to be careful not to push the Japanese to accelerate their growing links with China and the rest of Asia, leaving the United States more isolated and Japan more independent. The Japanese could also play hardball, and tell Americans in effect: "You want measurable targets? Well, so do we. You bring down your high-school dropout rate, which we think hinders your export capacity, and we will bring down our savings rate."
What we have here is two nations in flux, playing a game of chicken -- with neither one quite sure any more at just which point the other will veer away.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Good Old Bad Old South Africa

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
AMERICA will be extending more than a token of its admiration when it awards Nelson Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk the Liberty Medal this afternoon in a ceremony at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The medal is intended as an inducement to both men to continue on course toward democracy for South Africa. Put more crudely, the award will be the latest demonstration of America's incurable compulsion to meddle in this country's affairs.
For Americans, South Africa has been the one enduring object of fascination on a continent that rarely commands their attention. From disinvestment and cultural boycotts to "constructive engagement" to the current sugar-lump diplomacy, something about South Africa brings out Americans' missionary impulse. 
 And now that the old South Africa, the last outpost of white supremacy, is giving way to something amazingly ordinary, there is even a whiff of nostalgia in the American reaction.
America's interest here was only in small part self-interest. The policy mills have ground out countless papers assessing South Africa's importance as the guardian of the Cape sea lane, a bulwark against Communism, a source of strategic metals and, now that the country is reopening, a land of business opportunity.
But for most Americans, the lure of South Africa had nothing to do with stopping the Red menace or assuring ample platinum for catalytic converters.
 
Moral Clarity
 It was, literally and figuratively, a black-and-white issue. Here, Americans could refight their own racial battles with a moral clarity America itself did not offer, not in this era of the underclass and affirmative action.
Some Americans looked at South Africa and felt smug, that at least someplace on the planet botched its race relations worse than they did. Others saw an opportunity to make amends for America's own racial history.
"South Africa isn't a country for Americans; it's a metaphor," says John Matisonn, a South African journalist who has worked for the past seven years in American public broadcasting.
America has usually approached South Africa with an exaggerated sense of its own influence.
Andrew Young came here in 1977 as the Carter Administration's delegate to the United Nations convinced that America could push Pretoria into enfranchising blacks. Prime Minister John Vorster called an election six months later and won a landslide victory by campaigning against the meddling of the Carter Administration.
Next up, the Reagan Administration argued that by "constructive engagement" America could make useful allies of the apartheid government without in any sense condoning their practices. Indeed, the Reaganites argued, in some companionable way American values would rub off.
At the same time, Congress, responding to public pressure, preferred the theory that South Africa could be starved or shamed into doing the right thing by the application of trade sanctions.
Academics will debate for decades how much difference these carrots and sticks made, but few dispute that apartheid failed above all from its own stupidity. The notion was that 5 million whites could make 30 million blacks live forever in wretched, make-believe homelands and commute to white South Africa to sell their labor cheap. Mr. Mandela, early on, and Mr. de Klerk, in time, recognized that this defied the laws of demographics, economics and human nature, which is one reason the two men are in Philadelphia today.
As South Africa becomes more normal, so does America's relationship with it. Instead of moralistic scoldings, America now offers helpful hints from the Federalist Papers to help the new constitution-writers. Scores of Americans who might once have shown their disapproval by picketing the South African Embassy are now here serving as peace monitors and voter education specialists.
Andrew Young, now an executive of an Atlanta engineering firm, comes to scout investment opportunities now that sanctions are soon to be abolished. Mr. Mandela is hopping from fund-raising dinner to fund-raising dinner, squeezing corporate fat cats for campaign contributions and touting his country's business climate.
It is enough to make some Americans wistful, this spectacle of South Africa's liberation hero soliciting not their moral indignation, but their cash and tips on organizing focus groups.
One escape is to simply disbelieve the changes that have occurred here, and to deny that Mr. de Klerk is any different from villains preceding him.
Martin Meyerson, the university don who heads the Liberty Medal selection commission, said the award has drawn protests from black clergy, black Pennsylvania legislators and others who denounce Mr. de Klerk as a "fascist" and "murderer."
"They are still fighting the last war," Mr. Meyerson said. "There have not been many battles where good and evil were so clearly delineated."
In Washington, a few lobbyists want to replace economic sanctions with some new form of moral supervision -- a code of conduct, for example, requiring American companies to prove that they will promote blacks and respect labor unions and so on when they open shop in South Africa.
Leaders of the African National Congress find this kind of proposal condescending.
"We don't need a gatekeeper anymore," said Trevor Manuel, chief of the congress's economics department. "The rights and responsibilities of foreign investors are a matter to be codified by a democratic government of South Africa. But I understand the feeling of groups that have made South Africa their life's work."
It is hard to let go, he meant. The old South Africa was such a lovely place to loathe.

HEADLINE: Lorenzo's New Flight of Non-Fancy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
HE'S fit, he's rested and he's back. Yes, Frank Lorenzo -- hero to bargain-hunting travelers, Darth Vader to organized labor -- is again launching an airline.
With the major carriers losing pots of money and the unions baying for his blood, conventional wisdom suggests that the man who flew Continental and Eastern Airlines into bankruptcy will not keep his planes aloft for long. 
 But ATX, the working name for the East Coast start-up, is not intended to be a conventional airline. And Mr. Lorenzo is hardly a conventional airline executive.
"Frank loves low fares," explains Alfred Kahn, the Carter Administration economist who presided over the deregulation of the airline industry. What's more, says Mr. Kahn, "Frank hates to lose."
Applications to start airlines are ordinarily rubber-stamped by the Department of Transportation after the applicant shows the wherewithal to pay the bills. But prodded by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., 150 members of Congress signed a letter urging the department to keep Frank Lorenzo grounded. And 15 members of the House, led by Mac Collins of Georgia, are sponsoring "two-time loser" legislation that would bar an owner of two bankrupt airlines from making a third attempt.
The union's case against Mr. Lorenzo does not impress free marketeers. "If he's going to lose his shirt," argues Severin Borenstein, an economist at the University of California at Davis, "that's his problem." And since President Clinton has publicly lamented the attenuation of airline competition, the betting now is that Mr. Lorenzo will get his certificate of operation after a little ritual hazing.
This first hurdle, which Mr. Lorenzo hopes to clear by the fall, is hardly the last. Grand old airlines including Pan Am, Braniff and Eastern have fallen by the wayside. Several others are in bankruptcy or on the edge. Even the Big Three -- American, United and Delta -- have hunkered down for losses. How could little ATX expect to thrive?
The answer, in a phrase: by imitating Southwest Airlines.
The big carriers all operate "hub-and-spoke" route structures, shuttling passengers through central airports for connections to third cities. This has proven amazingly efficient, allowing people to fly almost anywhere and back the same day. But at a price: the systems are burdened by logistic and marketing overhead.
Southwest exploits this. It offers one-class, low-frills service on short, densely trafficked routes, often where airplanes are competing with cars. There are no hot meals or even preassigned seats. But by setting fares far below what hub-and-spoke carriers can afford to charge, Southwest is filling planes and making money.
In fact, many economists say Southwest has kept flying affordable for Westerners. The San Diego-San Francisco route is roughly as long and serves the same size population as the Boston-Washington route. But last year, the airlines on the Western route carried almost twice as many passengers at an average fare of $53 as their Eastern counterparts charged an average of $129.
Mr. Lorenzo plans to start small, serving only Boston and Atlanta from the Baltimore-Washington airport. Most likely USAir and Delta, which now serve these routes respectively, will respond by matching ATX's fares for some seats. But by charging just one-third their unrestricted fares, Mr. Lorenzo expects to create an avalanche of traffic that allows ATX to fill several flights a day without cannibalizing the markets of the majors.
 
Frills Gone

 Competitors on these routes might undercut ATX's fares and increase frequency of service until ATX leaves the market. But Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, thinks that is unlikely in light of the Administration's new vigilance against predatory practices. When Northwest Airlines threatened start-up Reno Air on the Minneapolis-Reno route this spring, antitrusters jawboned Northwest into retreat.
Of course, costs matter as well as revenues. One reason why no one has tried to transplant the Southwest model to the East is that operating costs -- notably labor -- are widely believed to be in a different league. But Bob McAdoo, an analyst for Prudential Securities and the former chief financial officer of Newark-based People Express, offers a comforting perspective.
Southwest pays only slightly lower wages than the industry average, he says; its advantage largely comes from getting more work out of planes and people on their point-to-point route structure.
"When you sit down and really look at the numbers," he concludes, "costs on the East Coast aren't that much higher."
Indeed, Mr. Lorenzo will enjoy one clear cost advantage over Southwest. With airlines mothballing hundreds of planes, the venerable DC-9's and 737's that ATX needs can be leased at Wal-Mart prices.
Plenty could still could go wrong. Labor may convince the public that ATX will inherit Eastern Airlines' maintenance problems. A fumbling start -- late flights, overbooking -- could alienate passengers. ATX may be unable to recreate the image of no-nonsense informality that allows Southwest to keep travelers content with minimal creature comforts.
Whatever his limitations, Mr. Lorenzo is well aware that any airline associated with his name must try harder. And his optimism is infectious: "We will make a very nice Christmas present for the East," he predicts.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
After $166 Million Was Paid for 10 Free-Agent Pitchers, One Stands Out

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Last winter, nine clubs committed a total of $166 million over 37 years for 10 free-agent starting pitchers. Halfway through the pitchers' first season with their new teams, only Jimmy Key has made his signing economically and artistically worthwhile.
Threatening to put together the kind of season he long has seemed capable of producing, Key has compiled a 10-2 record and a major league-low 2.30 earned run average. The nine other members of the most expensive collection of pitcher signings in the history of free agency have a combined 44-56 record and a 4.26 e.r.a. 
 Some of the pitchers have decent earned run averages -- Greg Maddux 2.88, Doug Drabek 3.29, for example -- and Chris Bosio of Seattle (3.19) pitched a no-hitter. But the won-lost records of the nine range from mediocre to awful.
Drabek (6-8) and Greg Swindell (6-7) of Houston, John Smiley (3-9) of Cincinnati, David Cone (5-8) of Kansas City and Bosio (2-3) are under .500; Maddux (7-7) of Atlanta, Dave Stewart (3-3) of Toronto and Mike Moore (5-5) of Detroit are at .500, and Jose Guzman (7-6) of the Chicago Cubs is just above .500.
From Maddux, Bosio and Drabek, the earned run averages rise rapidly: Cone 3.43, Guzman 4.38, Swindell 4.67, Stewart 4.88, Smiley 5.62 and Moore, 6.63.
 
Changes and Struggles
 "I can't explain it," Key said, discussing the disparity between his performance and that of the others. "Some changed leagues; maybe they're struggling with the change."
For the most part, though, the pitchers have remained in the same leagues in which they finished last season. But if changing leagues were a factor, Key was asked, who has the advantage -- the pitcher who doesn't know the hitters or the hitters who don't know the pitcher?
"It can work both ways," he said. "I think the pitcher has an advantage when he and the hitter don't know each other. The pitcher knows what he's going to throw."
The pitcher among the nine others who has not had a chance to establish himself this season is Bosio. He pitched a no-hitter in his fourth start for the Mariners, then broke his collarbone in his next start. He missed five weeks, then reinjured the collarbone during a fight in his second start back.
 
'It's a Long Season'
 As for the others, Key said, "I know some are struggling, but it's a long season and they could turn it around."
Key already has turned around the 13-13 season he had for Toronto last year. He didn't incur his first loss until his eighth start, his e.r.a. didn't reach 2.00 until his 10th start, and he has six victories and no losses in his last seven starts, suffering his last loss on May 23.
This is the best first half Key has had in his 10 seasons in the majors. With the Blue Jays in the first half of the 1991 season, he had a 10-4 record. He would not, however, like to duplicate the second half of that season. That year he struggled to a 6-8 record in the second 81 games, finishing a disappointing 16-12.
"The Yankees showed confidence in giving me that money," the 32-year-old left-hander said, referring to his four-year, $17 million contract. "I want to repay that confidence."
 
Two Is Not Three
 All right, so the Mets finally won two consecutive games, a feat they had been unable to accomplish for two and a half months. But they still haven't won three in a row at any time this season. Every one of the 27 other teams has won three consecutive games at least once. Combined, the 27 others have had 135 winning streaks of three or more games.
Philadelphia owns 12 of those streaks, followed by Houston with eight and the Yankees, San Francisco, Montreal and Pittsburgh with seven each. As they are in won-lost records, both expansion teams are ahead of the Mets in such winning streaks, Florida with three and Colorado with two. The Mets' immediate goal is to win three in a row and tie the Milwaukee Brewers, who have but one three-game winning streak.
In the time the Mets could not win even two in a row, the 27 other teams did it 431 times. San Francisco was the most adept at putting together consecutive victories in that period, doing it 29 times. The Phillies accomplished it 28 times, the Blue Jays 27. The Rockies won consecutive games the least number of times, but they did it six times.
 
Cardinals on a Roll
 In contrast to the Mets' plight, St. Louis had not lost two games in a row in the month preceding last night's game in Houston.
"It's been a steady progression," Bob Tewksbury, the Cardinals' No. 1 starting pitcher, said about the way the Cardinals have dramatically slashed the Phillies' huge lead. "I don't even know where it started. We just started taking two out of three and three out of four and sweeping teams. We're just trying to win every series."
In the three-week period leading to this weekend, the Cardinals won three of four from the Expos, three of three from the Pirates, three of four from the Cubs, two of three from the Marlins, three of three from the Mets and three of four from the Phillies, a total of 17 victories and 4 defeats. In even less time, the last 16 games of that stretch, the Cardinals reduced the Phillies' lead over them from 11 1/2 games to 5 1/2.
Within that three-week span, Lee Smith recorded saves 13 times in 15 St. Louis victories.
"Talk about mental imagery," Tewksbury said. "It seems like every night we're out on the field shaking hands, saying didn't we do this last night. We feel we're supposed to win now. The Phillies were playing unbelievable ball, but when we started winning, we stopped watching the scoreboard. We're taking care of our own house."
One of the major reasons the Cardinals have been winning is the hitting of Gregg Jefferies, who could have been doing this for the Mets if his supposedly more mature teammates had treated him decently. At the end of May Jefferies was hitting .261. Since then, he has batted .461 (53 for 115), raising his season average to .340, just ahead of teammate Bernard Gilkey's .331.
"I don't know if they feed off each other," Tewksbury said, "but Jefferies has been unconscious the past month and Gilkey is a better hitter now. He used to swing at a lot of first pitches and get himself out. He's a lot more disciplined at the plate, a much tougher out. He's putting the ball into play to all fields."
Now that the Cardinals have created a race in the division, Tewksbury feels the next week will be critical.
"If we can stay where we are or gain a couple games before the break, we're in good position," he said. "We don't want to fall back and have to gain eight or nine games in the second half."
The best time of the season, the pitcher added, could come the final weekend. "We play the last three games of the season at home against Philadelphia," he said.
 
Post-Holiday Signs
 Once upon a time, the standings after games of July 4 were used as a barometer for determining the pennant winners. Teams in first place that day generally seemed to wind up in first at the end of the season. The barometer has broken in recent years.
In the past 11 years, since the strike-split season of 1981, 21 of the 44 teams, almost half, in first place on July 4 did not win division championships. In the last two years, half of the eight teams did not maintain their division leads. A year ago tonight, Toronto, Minnesota, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati were in first place, but only Toronto and Pittsburgh advanced to the playoffs.
Recent developments, in fact, indicate that the Braves have the San Francisco Giants right where they want them. The Braves were three games behind the Reds last year and eight and a half behind Los Angeles two years ago but won the National League West championship both times. They entered last night's games trailing the Giants by eight games.
 
Butler Takes 'Lead'
 On the same evening last week, Wade Boggs won a game for the Yankees and Ken Lofton powered the Cleveland Indians to their fifth successive victory. They did it with home runs, the first of the season for each. Boggs hit his first on his 272d at-bat, Lofton his first on his 279th.
Brett Butler of Los Angeles leads the race for batting the most times without hitting a home run. Entering yesterday's games, he was zero for 301 at-bats. He was followed by Chuck Knoblauch of Minnesota at 282, Lance Johnson of the Chicago White Sox at 279 and Jose Offerman of Los Angeles at 278.
 
Yankee Losses Rectified
 One of the most impressive aspects of the Yankees' presence in the American League East race, other than George Steinbrenner's public silence, is the way the team was able to withstand disabling injuries to Don Mattingly, Danny Tartabull and Bernie Williams.
"That's one of the big benefits of why we are where we are," Wade Boggs said. "The guys who filled in have done a good job. When you lose players from the middle of your lineup, you tend to lose ground. We didn't. That gives us much more confidence. The guys who filled in know they can contribute in September."
The last time the Yankees were in a division race was five years ago. Like last week, the 1988 Yankees had a big three-game series with Detroit the last week of June. The only player in the Yankees' lineup for both series was Mattingly. Among those who were in the lineup then but not now were Dave Winfield, Rickey Henderson, Jack Clark, Willie Randolph and Mike Pagliarulo.

HEADLINE: WORLD UNIVERSITY GAMES;
Buffalo Flips Over Games, Hopes for No Flops

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO

 BODY:
The largest athletic event of its kind in the world except for the Olympics starts on Thursday with opening ceremonies featuring Kenny Rogers and Natalie Cole, but anxiety and civic pride are fencing for predominance as the World University Games shifts from four years of intensive planning to 11 days of reality.
Standing in line in a cavernous accreditation and operations center to enlist as a volunteer pizza shuttler, Don Naughton confessed he was there because "a lot of people don't want this to flop." 
 Standing nearby, Rose Marie Boraciak, another one of the 19,000 volunteers for the Games, said: "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing." A bit defensively, but wearing a smile, she added: "We have a very good image of ourselves."
Perhaps Buffalo's defensiveness derives from its image as the world's snow capital, the Johnny Carson jokes, the devastating loss of the steel industry, or the Buffalo Bills' three consecutive Super Bowl defeats.
The last major global event held here, the 1901 Pan American Exposition, saw the assassination of President William McKinley.
 
'Confidence Is Lacking'
 "Our confidence is lacking and we're a little unsure of ourselves," said Dennis Gorski, the Eric County Executive. "We're just a blue collar town on Lake Erie. But having this kind of event will not only establish our confidence, but we can take pride that we beat bigger cities to do this."
Backers of the World University Games Buffalo '93 portray the 11-day event as a local feel-good extravaganza to expand Buffalo's image to the world, where the Games are esteemed as the next best thing to an Olympics.
Gretchen Sorensen, marketing director of the Games, said: "There's a real hope that this will be a catalyst to take Buffalo into the 21st Century."
Whether a flood of tourism, trade or events sparked by the World Games will come Buffalo's way is impossible to measure now.
"I'd like to think this will mean more than one event," said Paul Morris, a vice president of Fleet Bank. "But a year from now tourists may not know the World Games were here."
 
Buffalo's Misfortune
 It may be Buffalo's misfortune to be host for an event known virtually everywhere but in the United States, where the Olympics, Goodwill Games, Olympic Festivals and Pan American Games are much better known. In New York, the Empire State Games, the statewide Olympics, retain a higher profile.
"I've been promoting it," said Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly. "I've done some commercials. I did a poster. But it's not easy."
In addition, some of the athletes may be past Olympians or future Olympians, but none carry the cachet of a Carl Lewis or a Dream Teamer.
Those managing the massive event, which will bring 7,000 athletes from 137 countries to western New York for the first World Games in the United States, are wrestling with the logistics of staging the games at venues from downtown to Canada and the task of merely breaking even on its $32 million budget.
No one anticipates anything like the $18 million lost by the city of Sheffield, England, in the 1991 World Games. The local group incurred no facility-building costs as Sheffield's did -- a track and field stadium at the University of Buffalo and a natatorium at Erie Community College were government funded -- but there are fears that a small loss may taint the image-building event.
"If they fall short, how will they cover the loss?" asked Stanton Lipsey, publisher of The Buffalo News. "It became a municipal liability in Sheffield, but the state has made it clear it won't pick up the deficit."
Kathy Scanlon, the executive director of the World University Games Buffalo '93, said its board of directors "wants to make every vendor whole." There is no plan for how to pay any debts. Scanlon, the chief operating officer of the 1990 Goodwill Games, added: "We have a shot at breaking even."
 
$50 Million Budget
 When Scanlon came last August, the budget had bloated to $50 million, corporate sponsorship money was lagging and no television deals had been made. "As recently as March of 1992, people were asking me whether we should cancel the Games," said Gorski, the county executive.
Much of that heavy pessimism has faded. Scanlon pared the budget mainly by reducing inflated expectations for sponsorship and television revenues, which her predecessor had budgeted at nearly $30 million. A dribble of corporate money, which accelerated in recent months, will add up to $12.5 million. But there is no television cash; the Buffalo group paid $350,000 to buy six hours of time on ESPN.
Getting up to $12.5 million in sponsorship has not been easy, and took until a week before opening ceremonies. Reasons abound: No major national corporations are based in Buffalo; the World Games are a cipher in the United States so companies frequently had to be briefed about the World Games were before they committed thousands of dollars, and the recession limited spending.
"We just committed $100,000," said Bob Rich, whose family food company owns the Buffalo Bisons baseball team. "One-time event marketing is difficult when it's something people haven't seen. It lends itself to a lot of second-guessing. But they've been making great strides."
New York Telephone's $1 million contribution demonstrated some doubt about the organizers' fundraising skills when it was announced last year. The cash was meted out in three installments to push organizers to raise the last $7.5 million from sponsors.
 
Financial Dispute
 Oddly, within weeks of that goal being met, the Brussels-based governing body of the World University Games run by Primo Nebiolo, threatened to sue the Buffalo group if it didn't share half the marketing and television revenues. Organizers say the governing group is entitled only to one-third of television revenues.
"They're not entitled to that," said Robert Fine, counsel to the games. "There is no signed agreement."
The threat demonstrates an apparent power play by Nebiolo's group and a lack of knowledge of the Buffalo finances.
Financial trouble for the Buffalo organizers will now be measured in ticket sales. The current local obsession is whether 65,000 seats available in Rich Stadium, the home of the Bills, will be sold for the opening ceremonies.
With 30,000 seats unsold, the goal of raising $2.3 million (out of $6 million for tickets to all events) is far away. The Buffalo News has quoted grumblers who insist that the ticket-selling has been executed badly, that 65,000 is an impossible dream and that Rogers is overpaid at $150,000.
Sorensen and Scanlon insist with a preternatural calm that with sales picking up at a rate of 2,500 to 3,000 tickets a day, more outlets selling tickets, and more phone lines being installed, the goal is attainable.
"Buffalo is a late town," said Sorensen, a Seattle native, "and everyone waits until the last minute."
What they will see is a show including Rogers, Cole, the Buffalo Philharmonic, a 110-member local choir, 400 local children, Native American dancers and a dozen sky jumpers landing in Rich Stadium.
"A lot of people are very much for the games," said the producer, Ricky Kirshner, who has produced the Tony Awards and two United States Olympics festivals. "Some are against them for reasons I don't know. They should just shut up."
They won't, of course, should the games lose money. But one facet of the games that cannot be argued with is the physical legacy. Without the games, the much needed $25 million field house (site of the natatorium) and the $23 million track and field/ football university stadium would not have been built.
"It took 13 years to get the facility," said Sharon West, chairwoman of Erie Community College's board of trustees. "It was in nobody's budget. Along came the games and both the state and county governments came along. If we didn't get it now, we'd probably have to go to court."
The 16,500 grass-surface stadium will allow the university's football taem to step up to Division I-AA for the 1993 season. "And one day," said Gorski, "we expect to be in Division I-A playing Penn State."

Fragile Recovery Is Britain's Strongest Suit

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Unlike the other European members of the Group of Seven, Britain seems to be pulling out of a recession. British officials hope the signs of recovery will bolster the credibility of Prime Minister John Major as he argues for steps to restore growth in the global economy.
At the same time, opinion polls suggest that Mr. Major is the least popular leader Britain has had in decades. And while the Prime Minister clearly relishes the opportunity to play the role of statesman, senior officials in London say he does not believe the meeting will yield any agreement of substance, especially now that Germany has preempted some of the pressure to speed up its interest-rate reductions. 
 As the leader of a nation that depends heavily on exports, Mr. Major has pushed for progress at the summit meeting in opening up world trade, saying that failure to maintain momentum on the issue could doom the GATT negotiations. He has tried to help the United States and the European Community bridge their differences on trade, and he may find himself in that role again in Tokyo.
But with the United States at loggerheads with both France and Japan over trade issues, Mr. Major's influence seems likely to remain marginal.

France and Its Farmers Are in No Mood for Compromise

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
GATT has become a four-letter word in France, where any world trade agreement is widely viewed as threatening the livelihood of farmers, exporting jobs to developing countries where labor is cheaper, and caving to pressure from the United States.
With more than three million unemployed, the economy in recession and further job losses expected this year, the three-month-old conservative Government of Edouard Balladur is acutely aware that any trade concessions could be politically costly. France therefore opposes even a limited agreement in Tokyo. 
 The Government wants world leaders to give more attention to exchange-rate issues. It contends that French export industries are penalized because the dollar is undervalued by at least 20 percent against the French franc and the German mark.
With a big and technologically advanced nuclear industry, France would like firm agreements on eliminating dangerous nuclear reactors in the former East bloc. Its goal is not limited to nuclear safety;, lucrative contracts could follow. As for aid to Mr. Yeltsin, France wants him to bring Russia's free-spending central bank to heel before the money flows.
Like other Western European countries, France sees Japan's trade surplus as excessive. But it believes that pressure on this issue is useless because of political uncertainty in Tokyo.

Dodging Trade Criticism, a Wobbly Tokyo Plays Host

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

 BODY:
With the economy in recession and the Government in danger of being ousted by voters this month, the Japanese would in some ways prefer a stalemate to a summit meeting that ends in firm agreements. What they would like is a meeting with lots of understanding rather than accords that would corner them into taking tough economic steps.
For months, bureaucrats in Tokyo have been growing edgy over demands by other countries that Japan lift its economy out of recession and boost its imports with a big stimulus package to encourage spending. The United States has even asked Tokyo to commit itself to specific targets for reducing its huge trade surpluses. 
 If the Group of Seven nations finally agree on terms for a new pact to liberalize the world trading system, Japan would probably be forced to open its rice market, a difficult step given the political clout of farmers.
Japan is also wary that an agreement on providing additional financial aid to Russia could put pressure on Tokyo to make a big new contribution. Japan resists such payments, in part because it wants Russia first to return four islands seized during World War II and in part because it feels the chaos in Russia insures that most of the assistance would be wasted.
Eager to lower expectations, Japanese officials have said that they hope the meeting will simply provide a forum in which the Group of Seven leaders can consult in a quiet environment.

A Chance for Clinton to Press for Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
More than anything else, President Clinton wants the Group of Seven to agree at its summit meeting on a strategy to speed global economic growth. Faster growth abroad means more American exports -- and more American jobs -- and the United States is pressing Japan to do its part for world growth by stimulating its own economy and pledging to reduce its giant trade surplus.
Washington is taking a gentler attitude toward Germany, urging it to cut its budget deficit and give its powerful central bank more leeway to lower interest rates so other rate cuts will follow throughout Western Europe. Germany is cooperating. 
 The United States is pushing for progress on a world trade pact, but other nations insist that Washington has gummed up the works by clinging to its own trade barriers.
Mr. Clinton also wants to speed aid to Russia to help the nation through its transition to a market economy, knowing that an expensive new cold war could result if President Boris N. Yeltsin fails.
One big risk is that after all the jawboning of the Group of Seven, Mr. Clinton will come home emptyhanded; with his popularity low at home, he is eager to show he can stand tall on the summit stage.
 Yet it may be easier for the United States to put pressure other nations this time than it was in recent years. Other nations have often refused to listen to Washington until it got its own house in order; now many agree that Mr. Clinton is finally doing that by getting serious about cutting the budget deficit.

A Battle Over Securities-Fraud Cases

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
Slurping and grunting noises are rising from both piggish parties engaged in a heated debate over securities-fraud class actions.
In one pen, meet the hogs who pull such shenanigans as filing class actions against corporate managements within hours of a stock drop, sometimes on scant evidence that any fraud was committed. This group of lawyers and investors has resorted to paying bounties to stockbrokers who can supply names of investors harmed in such cases. The investors frequently settle for pennies on the dollar, raising the question of whether they were simply holding up management on a meritless case. A good case, some lawyers believe, would be taken farther and demand a higher settlement. 
 In the other pen, meet the have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too swine -- an assembly of corporate executives. Pass laws that would help stop the flood of securities-fraud litigation that hurts us, they argue, but don't mess with civil laws that can work on our behalf. Frivolous lawsuits -- when companies file them against each other, for instance -- are a "cost of doing business." But the cost becomes distasteful when investors are the plaintiffs.
A bill that would change the rules governing securities-fraud suits was introduced by Representative Billy Tauzin, Democrat of Louisiana, in January; in recent weeks, a Senate panel heard arguments on the sweeping changes suggested in the bill.
Pushing hard to make the bill popular is the Coalition to Eliminate Abusive Securities Suits, an unlikely combination of 430 members comprising the most upstanding citizens of Corporate America and some of its most notorious rogues. Indeed, the roster of Ceass (as in cease, get it?) arguably is a reflection of the merits of these fraud cases generally: It includes some fine outfits, ultimately exonerated in court, and at least as many who perhaps weren't sued enough.
To hear Ceass advocates tell it in the recent Senate hearings, the whims of ruthless investors and their lawyers are causing business to grind to a halt, as managements devote nearly all their time to addressing lawsuits. Making matters worse is what the lawsuit craze is doing to the capital-raising process, they say. The bill itself asserts that the suits are causing investment bankers to shy away from working with small companies trying to gain access to the public markets -- a curious claim at a time when initial public offerings are at a high.
In addition, the bill says, "such securities lawsuits impose additional costs on publicly traded companies, often force them into bankruptcy and create job losses within the economy." Asked to give an example of a publicly held company forced into bankruptcy in this way, one of Mr. Tauzin's staffers gave an answer that told much of what's wrong with the "abusive suit" debate -- citing Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting firm that went out of business.
That's curious on a couple of counts, not the least of which is that Laventhol wasn't a public company, but a private partnership. What's more, accounting firms are the constituency that's trying to frame the issues in the fraud suit debate. Key among items in HR417 -- the Tauzin bill -- is a radical proposal that would eliminate the legal notion of "joint and several" liability in class action cases that allege securities fraud. Currently, when a company loses a securities fraud case, "joint and several" liability mandates that the damages be absorbed by whatever defendants have not yet acquired a phony passport and absconded to a South Pacific island.
The reality of that is that large professional institutions like accounting firms that expect to be sticking around frequently pay a greater percentage of the damage freight than they may have been responsible for. Hard-liners respond that that's the way the law was deliberately framed, giving priority to the needs of plaintiffs who were wronged. A cost of doing business, as it were.
Accounting firms say the law should be changed so they only pay for the portion of the damages attributed to them. The current system "is not forcing accountability by people who screw up," said Mark Gittenstein, a lawyer who represents Ceass.
But the current debate isn't focusing on the problem, either. Joel Seligman, a law and securities professor at the University of Michigan Law School, called the current proposal a "foolish overkill resolution" that doesn't properly address the real problem: that a "totally innocent corporation can spend a fair amount of time producing documents" in the discovery process.
While the coalition of companies would say that all the bill's proposals in some way cut down on discovery by discouraging "abusive" suits, the "joint and several" issue is getting the most play from accounting industry advocates, who raised $12 million in March for lobbying efforts on the issue.
Mr. Seligman suggested that the problem of frivolous lawsuits can be addressed more aggressively by using existing laws. Indeed, judges already are sanctioning class-action lawyers under two civil rules that address abusive cases. As for the onerous cost of the discovery process, "I don't think it's solely a securities-fraud case issue," Mr. Seligman said. Better to pursue the crippling time and money spent on discovery in all civil cases than to focus on the fraud cases brought by investors, he said.
That proposal doesn't sit well with Mr. Tauzin, who said in an interview last week that this subset of lawsuits is having "a very negative kind of impact" on corporate entities while lawyers and investors exploit the bounty fees and other perks of class actions.
Mr. Tauzin, for one, should know a little about bounties and perks, according to an analysis published June 21 in Accounting Today. Having received $50,000 in political contributions from accounting firms last year, he was the single biggest recipient in Congress of the industry's largesse.

HEADLINE: Finding a Lifeboat in a Flood of Asbestos Litigation

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: GRANVILLE, Ohio

 BODY:
WHEN a company faces tens of thousands of lawsuits, nurturing innovative ways to control legal costs can be as crucial to survival as creating new products. Recognizing that, the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, a defendant in about 85,000 asbestos cases, has become a pacesetter among the many businesses moving to limit legal expenses.
From their base at the company's research and development campus here, some 30 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, Owens-Corning's asbestos litigation managers have pared the number of outside defense firms they use to just 7, from 60 in 1988. That gives the company increased leverage in price negotiations because each firm now has a bigger share of the business and more incentive to do what Owens wants to keep it. 
 The company has also demanded that law firms shift work from expensive partners and associates to paralegals who operate under the firms' names but are trained and managed by Owens-Corning. Most strikingly, it has instituted a work order system that takes out of the hands of its litigators many decisions about when and how to prepare for trials. Instead, the decisions fall to those issuing the work orders, who in routine matters are the paralegals.
The problem with the old way of doing business, according to Owens executives, is that lawyers do too much work on cases that are likely to be settled and often do it so early in the process that files must be reviewed and updated later, adding unnecessary costs.
The new system is "responsive to the needs and desires of the client rather than the instincts of lawyers," said Louis F. (Ted) Rodewig, the former Booz-Allen management consultant Owens-Corning retained in 1990 to study the asbestos issue. Last year, only months after Glen H. Hiner took over as Owens-Corning's chief executive, Mr. Hiner recruited Mr. Rodewig to move here and run the system that Mr. Rodewig helped design.
The new rules of the game often call to mind the rise of managed care plans in medicine that have been chipping away at the professional freedom and income of many doctors. Just as physicians are bristling at the restrictions of managed care, some lawyers say that limits on their freedom can backfire.
Still, given the nationwide drive by business to control legal costs of all sorts, the Owens-Corning program could be adapted by many corporate law departments. While the asbestos quagmire is an extreme case, legal experts say there are plenty of other corners of the law where companies deal repeatedly with complaints that have a great deal in common. For instance, they say, car manufacturers, oil companies and others with large chains of dealers often wind up in court in contractual disputes that follow predictable patterns.
Owens-Corning executives are betting that their litigation management strategy should keep the company from ending up among the scores of asbestos manufacturers that have followed the former Johns-Manville Corporation, the industry leader, into bankruptcy. Owens's litigation costs are currently covered by the company's insurance, which stood at $675 million at the end of last year. Behind that is a $950 million reserve fund the company has set aside from earnings.
A manufacturer of glass-fiber insulation and construction materials, Owens-Corning had net income last year of $73 million on sales of $2.88 billion. Its asbestos problems stem from insulation products it sold from 1953 to 1974.
Owens believes the new system has helped reduce the amount it pays on plaintiffs' claims, which were resolved at an average of under $10,000 last year, down from more than $12,000 in the mid-1980's. But Owens points out that future plaintiffs could benefit from the company's effort to avoid bankruptcy, which will preserve the company's ability to deal with their claims.
Owens added tens of millions of dollars annually to its legal expenses over the past five years to set up the new system. Total spending related to asbestos peaked at $175 million in 1991. This year, with its heavy computer and research investments behind it, Owens has budgeted just $55 million for expenses and expects actual costs to be even lower, said William W. Colville, the company's corporate counsel.
THESE costs do not include payments to plaintiffs whose claims of injury from exposure to the company's asbestos products have been resolved. Owens had resolved more than 101,000 cases by the end of last year and had 85,000 pending. Although cases continue to be filed at an accelerating rate, Owens has been able to dispose of them even faster, reducing the overall caseload.
There is no longer any dispute that asbestos can cause cancer and lung disease. Instead, the suits turn on the questions of whether a particular plaintiff's illness or death was actually caused by asbestos and which company's products the plaintiff was exposed to.
Owens-Corning's take-charge posture stems from its conclusion that a decade of experience with asbestos litigation has left it in a pretty good position to judge which cases are likely to end up in the small group that actually go to trial and how much it is willing to invest in preparing the rest for settlement. When a case is headed for trial, the company strives to make sure that detailed evidence on subjects like the claimant's medical condition is assembled close enough to the trial date that the job is done only once.
MR. COLVILLE said that the innovations are mostly the common sense results of stripping away the shroud of mystery that lawyers tend to wrap around their work and simply analyzing the tasks involved, much the same way that an airline would break down the elements of baggage handling. He likens the result to just-in-time manufacturing.
In the Owens-Corning system, paralegals at seven regional centers are trained to prepare responses to most pretrial motions, which they send to local attorneys for filing. The company's team of trial lawyers may learn only a few days in advance which cases they will be trying the following week and sometimes see the particular files only the day before. Owens-Corning lawyers liken the litigators' role to that of a top heart surgeon who has others do most of the preparations and may not even meet the patient until shortly before the surgery is to begin.
There are risks. Relying on paralegals to screen new filings, for example, may occasionally lead to missing out on a chance to bring a co-defendant into the case or to present an unusual defense, said Jack B. Manning, whose Houston-based firm of Bean & Manning is Owens-Corning's regional coordinator for eight Southwestern states. He recalled one instance in 1991 in which a change in schedule was not noted in the centralized electronic files that all lawyers involved in the cases use. That led to a failure to issue a work order for sending a list of witnesses to a plaintiff by the required date. Barred by the lapse from presenting most of its case, Owens paid a premium to settle.
On balance, though, Mr. Colville has been so pleased with the changes that some of them, like work orders, are being applied to other legal problems Owens faces. "We want to be able to specify what's to be done and who's to do it," he said.
Plenty of other asbestos defendants have also made huge strides in case management. The Center for Claims Resolution, which coordinates the defense efforts in 60,000 cases involving 20 companies, says it has reduced the number of law firms it deals with to 22, from 60, and cut spending 50 percent since 1988. Companies assisted by the center, which is based in Princeton, N.J., range from small contractors to major defendants like the GAF Corporation and Armstrong World Industries.
The Keene Corporation, an asbestos defendant that used to be a member of the center but now operates on its own, says it cut costs by 40 percent from mid-1990 through the end of last year. This year, it says, it is on track to lop off another 30 percent.
"When we looked at it in 1990, 30 to 40 percent of the work took too long or was being done by someone too qualified," said Stuart Rickerson, general counsel for Keene, which is based in New York. "Now, we are under 2 percent in both categories."
These other defendants do not use work orders, nor do they rely as heavily on trained paralegals as Owens-Corning. But the directives they have laid down and the strict, frequently re-evaluated budgets they develop with outside firms have a similar impact.
SIMILAR trends are occurring outside the asbestos field. The General Electric Company, for example, has imposed a strict budgeting process on any outside legal job likely to cost $25,000 or more, requiring agreement on the tasks to be done and how they will be staffed.
"I can't recall a single case in the two years we have been doing it where the company has been hurt by vetoing something a law firm wanted to do," said Sally King, manager of litigation services at G.E. "We almost always end up in complete agreement on what to do after negotiating. There has to be an open line of communication."
In practice, even Owens-Corning's relationships with its lawyers are less regimented than they sound. Attorneys in the field and litigators do make recommendations about what pretrial work should be done, how long it should take and how much it should cost. Once Owens sets policy in weekly review meetings coordinated here or in special conferences, it relies heavily on its regional law firms to execute it. Not surprisingly, firms that have adapted to the system speak highly of it.
"THIS is the wave of the future," said Robert E. Wagner, a partner at the Detroit firm of Kitch, Saubier, Drutchas, Wagner & Kenney. "You can expand your law practice by showing other clients you can do this."
Still, the declining deference to the judgment of outside lawyers is more likely to be grudgingly accepted than enthusiastically embraced by most lawyers. The end of the go-go 1980's left corporate law firms around the nation scrambling for new work.
"Law firms are going along because they have no choice," said Douglas Young, a partner at the Economic Analysis Group Ltd., a Washington-based firm that conducts an annual survey of cost-containment measures employed by corporate legal departments.
Even some leading corporate lawyers are skeptical about the trend. "The very best lawyers are not going to put up with attempts to control their professional service," said Harry Pearce, general counsel for the General Motors Corporation. "We are not going to manage law firms, because we want them to be creative."
G.M. has sought to reduce its costs by paring the number of outside law firms it uses from nearly 800 in the late 1980's to just over 300. It also installed a computer system to monitor how each firm spends its time and money, and it lets each of them know how it stacks up against the competition, without revealing names.
"We tell them that those who get the best results the most efficiently will get the most work," said Mr. Pearce, a former litigator. "I've never found a more powerful motivator and we don't end up spending so much administrative time managing budgets."
Yet even Mr. Pearce concedes that there can be good reasons for companies like Owens-Corning to go to unusual lengths to tailor outside legal work to their business needs.
"There is a tendency for lawyers to be myopic," he said. "God knows there need to be some limits."
 
 
200,000 CASES AND COUNTING
 ASBESTOS is among the most versatile of all minerals, combining insulation value, flame resistance, flexibility and durability. Manufacturers built thousands of products as diverse as brake linings, movie theater curtains, toasters and pipe insulation from it. But tens of thousands of workers who inhaled tiny asbestos fibers, and in some cases those who handled their clothes or were otherwise exposed, have developed cancers and lung diseases.
The health risks were suspected for decades but it was not until the mid-1960's that public scientific studies began to accumulate, in part because asbestos diseases often take decades to develop.
Lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers and installers mushroomed during the 1980's. The cases involved not just personal injuries but also the declining value of buildings containing asbestos and the costs of removal. Few people have been as heavily exposed as World War II shipyard workers, who were the majority of the early claimants. About half of the more than 200,000 claims to date have been resolved. Experts say hundreds of thousands of new claims are likely to be filed in the years to come.
The most dramatic legal development in the asbestos saga was the 1982 bankruptcy filing of the Johns-Manville Company, the industry pioneer and giant. The filing put a stop to new suits involving the company while it was in Chapter 11. (Now that it has emerged, plaintiffs still can't sue the company, now known as the Manville Corporation, but can bring claims against two funds set up during the bankruptcy reorganization.)
The 1982 filing set off a mad rush among plaintiffs' attorneys to find other "deep pocket" defendants.
"It's amazing how many people suddenly remembered that they had worked with Kaylo," said William W. Colville, Owens-Corning's general counsel, referring to his company's branded asbestos product, which it stopped selling in 1974.

HEADLINE: Czechs Gear Up to Resume Weapons Exports

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
REVERSING a policy of Vaclav Havel to end arms exports, the Czech Government has announced that it will reactivate its industry and sell weapons abroad.
Mr. Havel's pledge, made when he became President after the collapse of Communism in 1989, was described by officials here as naive and costly at a time of economic difficulties. "Other countries are trying to fill our former markets and we have factory capacity that is not being fully used," said Pavel Slejskal, director of engineering in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. "Western countries as well as other Central European countries are taking our place in the market." 
 The move comes as several countries in Eastern Europe discover that converting big weapons factories into other kinds of production is prohibitively expensive. This is especially so because financial assistance for conversion that was expected to come from the West has not materialized.
When Mr. Havel made his promise, he was President of Czechoslovakia. In January, the country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Much of the heavy weaponry, like the tanks and missiles that are of most concern to Washington, was made in Slovak factories. Those factories have have suffered a far steeper decline than the Czech plants, which also produce some heavy-duty weaponry but are launching a counteroffensive.
The State Department, knowing the Czechs were contemplating reviving their arms industry, sent a delegation here in March to tell the Czechs what countries are on Washington's arms-export-embargo list. When members of the American delegation talked with the Czechs they were satisfied that the Prague Government, unlike others in Eastern Europe, was in reasonable control of decisions on where arms would be exported, American officials said.
They said the Czechs would probably even pass the eligibility requirements for receiving some American military-technology assistance in upgrading their weaponry. In order to receive this help, the Czechs will have to pledge not to export the technology or weapons made from it to countries unfriendly to Washington. So far, the Czechs have not formally applied for the technological assistance, an American official said.
WASHINGTON did not absolutely discourage the Czech plans from reactivating the arms industry, American officials said. This was partly because the Czech Republic wants to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Czech argument that it must make the army's weaponry compatible with NATO's was considered valid, the officials said.
But at the same time, there were concerns, they said, that the Czechs might find it hard to keep their promise not to sell to countries under embargo. The Czechs have already had preliminary contacts with Iran, one American official said. And the arms companies, eager for business, could sell arms to Serbs
Mr. Havel, whose political profile has been overshadowed by that of his Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, has made no public statements on the change in policy.
American officials said the decision to reverse the policy was made by the cabinet. They pointed out that since the split of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Havel has become a figurehead statesman, with no power to make policy.
More than a dozen Czech weapons producers announced on June 11 that they would form a consortium, the RDP Group, to design, produce and market Czech military-industry products. The head of the group, which is expected to grow to 30 companies, is Lubomir Soudek, general director of Skoda Pilsen, one of the republic's biggest arms manufacturers.
"President Havel is a man of high moral principles," he said. "But the world is not moral. If it were moral, there would be neither arming nor re-arming."
THE Minister of Trade and Industry, Vladimir Dlouhy, was quoted here last month as saying that Mr. Havel's arms policies were "naive" and that they had been pushed upon the country by hypocritical Western powers. "They preached to us to drink water while they themselves were drinking wine," Mr. Dlouhy said. "Armaments are a commodity and Czech weapons have a good reputation worldwide."
The first focus of the new consortium will be improvements for the Soviet-designed T-72 tank, which in its current pre-1989 version is obsolete, Czech officials said. The new consortium will fit the tanks now in stock with a modernized engine, transmission and night-vision capability, making the machine more competitive on the international market.
The industry minister said he was drafting a new law regulating Czech arms exports to be presented to Parliament before the end of the year. It stipulates that the Industry Ministry will be in charge of licensing arms for export and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Defense would have a right of veto, he said.
Mr. Dlouhy said he wanted a senior Government official to sit on the board of the new arms consortium. The new regulations, he added, would make it easier for the companies to sell weapons legitimately.

THE ECONOMY
 
One Swallow Can Be Ignored; a Flock of Them Can't 

Yes, month-to-month figures mean little -- any number of odd events can jostle them. Yes, it's the long term that counts. But when the arrows head relentlessly downward, they just can't be ignored. And last week it was down, down and down again. Here's just a sampling: even with bargain-basement mortgage rates, new-home sales took their biggest plunge in 13 years, erasing a big April gain. And if the ever-fickle consumer can be believed, there's worse to come, as consumer confidence, which soared in the post-election months, dropped perilously close to its feeble October level. What's to blame? Uncertainty has to be a factor. Tax increases and health care reform are on everyone's lips, but no one knows how the script will play out after the folks in Washington finish their horse-trading. When people feel uneasy, they snap their wallets shut. And the economy stalls.

No Comfort in the Job Numbers
 
Last week's job data provided no exception to the gloomy economic news, as June unemployment climbed right back to 7 percent after a brief visit at 6.9. And the underlying figures were discouraging -- a loss of 53,000 manufacturing jobs and a scant 13,000 rise in payroll jobs. Bob Dole, as usual, couldn't wait to make political hay from this scorched field, saying that with tax increases looming, "employers are scared to death, so they're simply not hiring." But the White House, in the person of Laura D'Andrea Tyson, economic adviser, countered that the job-stimulus bill the Republicans hacked to death would have been felt by now. And in any case, she said, nearly a million new jobs have been created this year.
 
Tim-ber! Watch for Falling Jobs!
 
What's most important -- jobs, trees or owls? The answer isn't easy. Typically, Bill Clinton is trying to serve all three masters, and he has everyone angry. Environmentalists want to protect ancient forests in the Northwest, and the northern spotted owls that live there, while loggers warn that if trees aren't being lopped off, their livelihoods will be. So last week Mr. Clinton proposed a compromise, with limits on logging balanced by $1.2 billion for economic development and helping displaced loggers. But the timber industry said the cuts were too deep -- they do represent a drastic change in the way public forests are managed -- while environmentalists said loopholes would allow too much cutting. At press time, the owls had yet to comment.
 
'Violent Content'? Bring It On
 
"Due to some violent content, parental discretion advised." What do those eight little words say to a 10-year-old grazing across the channels? Simple. They say, Drop your Nintendo, forget your homework, get your buddies, and watch this! A watchful parent should switch off the set? Right. Mom's stuck at the office, Dad's doing the laundry, the coast is clear. But that warning is what the four commercial broadcast networks came up with last week to try to head off criticism of the increasing violence on television. Some critics want more -- curbs on the violence, ratings, perhaps a way to block out some shows. Not likely; lobbyists are out in force. "We cannot allow broadcast television to become barren of dramatic excitement," the networks said. Farewell, subtlety. There used to be drama in a raised eyebrow, a piercing look. Now, it seems, it can be found only in a raised knife, a piercing bullet.
 
He Caressed the Modem . . .
 
Humans have eight years left: In 2001, computers complete their takeover, rendering us obsolete. Don't believe it? Listen to this. Last week, a steamy novel came out that was written partly by a computer named Hal -- surely a cousin of the "2001" star. It seems that Scott French, Hal's "co-author," delved into Jacqueline Susann's masterworks, broke the digital code that dictates exactly when hearts leap and pants drop, and programmed Hal to churn out a hot romance. It took eight years, but he and Hal did it, calling the book "Just This Once." And the Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly (yes, there is such a publication) decreed that it had just the right mix: "money, sleaze, disease, death, oral sex, tragedy and the good girl gone bad." Surely, by 2001, Hal can perfect his (her? its?) craft, and discard the mortal co-author, stripping humans of one of the last things they can do better than machines. Time to pack it in.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Germany Meets Critics Halfway
 
Germany tried to keep interest rates high to ward off demon inflation, but outsiders were impatient. Typical were remarks by President Clinton, who called for lower rates "so that all of us together can expand this economy." But Germany has been giving in -- gradually, giving out crumbs of rate cuts every month or so. Last week, perhaps to head off criticism at this week's meeting of leading nations, it dropped rates again, to 6.75 percent for its discount rate and 8.25 percent for the Lombard rate -- a move one German economist called "more of a middle policy."
 
Setback for the Trade Pact
 
When the United States, Canada and Mexico came up with their North American Free Trade Agreement, environmentalists said: Wait a second! What about air and water pollution in border areas if industry flocks to Mexico? What about pesticides in imported food? Unsatisfied with the answers, three environmental groups took this lament to court, and last week a Federal judge said they had a point. The judge ordered the Government to prepare an environmental impact statement -- which could take six months -- probably delaying and maybe even killing the pact. This setback for the Administration may have a silver lining, though, because Congressional support for the pact was shaky anyway, and President Clinton may thus avoid another nasty battle.
 
Learning the Rules in Japan
 
In the board room, east isn't meeting west quite yet. American pension funds, feeling their oats after pushing some directors around back home, tried their stuff in Japan. But the Japanese do things their way: they have their annual meetings all at once, making it impossible for a troublemaker to attend more than one, and they brook little dissent. It's a clubby affair, with a lot of reciprocal back-scratching. Enter Calpers, the mighty California retirement system, which has about $5 billion worth of Japanese stock. Wanting to have a say, Calpers cast a number of "nay" votes last week, but when the votes were counted, management resolutions somehow passed unanimously.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Where's the Bottom at Empire?
 
At some point things have to hit bottom at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, where, amazingly, each wave of news is worse than the last. Last week would be hard to top, though: at a Senate hearing, the insurer's chief auditor testified that she couldn't get straight answers from the chief financial officer about discrepancies in the books -- even as the ousted chairman, Albert Cardone, testified that there never were two sets of books. But there was a ray of hope, when Empire picked a new chairman and chief, Philip Briggs, formerly of Metropolitan Life. Mr. Briggs brought understatement to new heights by describing Empire as "a little disorganized," but, for a change, he has experience at a for-profit insurer. That can't hurt.
 
A Kinder Refrigerator
 
Here's one way to get companies to make things that are kinder to the planet: drop the stick, try something more edible. In a contest referred to as "the golden carrot," a group of utilities offered $30 million for the best refrigerator design that saves both energy and the ozone layer. This is no small matter, for refrigerators account for fully 20 percent of household electric bills, and their CFC's eat away at the ozone. The carrot worked, for Whirlpool came up with a model that uses 25 percent less energy and has no CFC's, and last week it took the prize. And because the prize money will offset some startup costs, the new refrigerators, due early next year, will cost about the same as current models.
 
Benefits for Gays at HBO
 
Gay workers edged closer to the mainstream last week when HBO, joining a growing list of companies, offered health benefits to same-sex partners. But it's not true equality; the I.R.S. doesn't recognize such couples, so part of what HBO gives, the taxperson takes away.
 
Outsider to Run Westinghouse
 
Again, the corporate ladder is not as orderly as it used to be, as newly bold directors cast their net far and wide to pick a boss. After Paul Lego resigned at Westinghouse, Gary Clark filled in as acting chief executive, but directors kept searching outside. Only last week, nearly half a year later, did they find their man: Michael H. Jordan, with a long stint at Pepsico on his resume.
 
Now It's Murdoch vs. the Unions
 
The choice was coming down to this: a New York Post owned by Rupert Murdoch, or no New York Post. No one else seemed willing to pour millions into this especially leaky bucket -- at least no one who didn't appall the Post staff (or have you forgotten Abe Hirschfeld?) -- and Mr. Murdoch was about to pull the plug. So last week the F.C.C. granted Mr. Murdoch a waiver to let him own a newspaper and television station in a single market. The F.C.C. insisted it was setting no precedent. It's a one-time-only bow to "the overwhelming body of responsible public opinion," said James H. Quello, the acting chairman. But before he can make the purchase, Mr. Murdoch must still get union opinion on his side -- and that'll be tough. His latest threat: if there's no contract by July 9, no more Post.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
First-Half Buoyancy From Japan

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The hottest sector in mutual funds so far this year may be gold -- up 63.1 percent after a decade in which the group lost money -- but funds that invest in Japanese stocks have shown new life, rising to second place in performance in the first six months of 1993.
As the first half came to a close last week, the six Japanese funds were up 39.1 percent, despite a recent drop of 3 percentage points in the week after the nation's Prime Minister received a no-confidence vote in Parliament. In third place was a group of funds that invest in the Pacific Rim that rose 25.6 percent. That group, including the Japan funds and others with interests in the Japanese market, obviously got a boost from the Tokyo gains. 
 Overall in the latest quarter, United States stock funds rose 3.4 percent, on average, as the stock market kept chugging along. For the first six months, the gain was 4.8 percent.
Indeed, almost all of the Nasdaq-listed stock fund categories traced by Morningstar Inc. produced positive returns in the first half. According to the mutual fund researchers in Chicago, the only exception was a group funds that invest in health-and-biotechnology issues, which dropped 8.1 percent.
The funds that invest in Japanese equities have long been due for a comeback. They lost 4.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended June 1993, compared with an 11.9 percent annual gain for domestic stock funds. Going back five years, the Japan group rose just 2.6 percent a year, compared with 12.9 percent for domestic funds.
What happened? The Japanese Government, which keeps a firm hand on its economy, stopped the huge liquidity-driven bull market of the mid-1980's by raising interest rates at the end of 1989, after the benchmark Nikkei index reached nearly 40,000. That burst the huge bubble in asset prices.
The Nikkei began a decline that touched bottom last August at 14,300. Then, in April, Tokyo's 13.2 trillion-yen fiscal stimulus package gave a lift to the Tokyo stock market, said Rika Yoshida, managing editor of the Morningstar Japan newsletter.
This year's Japan fund gains were augmented by the rise of the yen, a climb that managers do not expect to continue. Even so, most say that Japanese issues are cheaper on a valuation basis than comparable United States stocks, "so it makes sense to invest some money in Japan, probably with not as high expectations in the second half of the year as in the first half," said John R. Hickling, who manages the $200 million Fidelity Japan Fund, which was started in September 1992. Its cyclical plays include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which is heavily involved in capital spending, and Toyota Motor.
Chris D. Alderson, who co-manages the $95 million T. Rowe Price Japan Fund, says he is cautiously optimistic. "We're now at the point where economic levels must catch up with valuations, which will happen slowly over the next 12 months," he said. He likes companies that may benefit from an economic recovery, especially Nippon Kompo, a transportation and trucking company, and Toshiba Tungaloy, an industrial tool maker.
The combination of a strong yen and political uncertainty caused the market to fall back once the Nikkei index reached a technical ceiling of nearly 22,000 in the spring, said Elizabeth J. Allan, manager of the $535 million Japan Fund. The market will have to digest these factors, but that process should be complete in six months to a year, she said. In addition, "the economy is at a cyclical bottom and the recovery is all in front of us," she said.
Among the fund's biggest holdings are the Nichiei Company, which makes loans to small businesses; the Secom Company, Japan's largest producer of electronic security systems, and the Kyocera Corporation, an electronics manufacturer.
Christian Wignall, chief investment officer of G.T. Capital Management in San Francisco and the original manager of the $111 million G.T. Japan Growth Fund, is the group's biggest bear. "We're quite cautious about the Japanese stock market, even though it's rallied. We don't think the rise is justified by the fundamentals," he said.
The fund is positioned defensively, with nearly one-quarter stashed in bonds. Among stocks, it likes Takeda Chemical Industries, a large chemical and pharmaceutical company, and Daiichi Seiyaku, a medium-sized pharmaceutical company. Another favorite: the Seven-Eleven Japan Company, which owns a chain of 7-Eleven stores.
The other two Japan funds are more limited. The DFA Japanese Small Company Fund, in Santa Monica, Calif., is available only to institutional investors and clients of investment advisers. Capstone Nikko Japan is a $2.2 million fund based in Houston and available only in 25 states. (It is also the only one of the six Japan funds that is not listed by Nasdaq, which means it does not appear in newspaper listings.)
Another route to Japan is through the funds that invest in the Pacific Rim countries. Among the biggest plays are Merrill Lynch Pacific, which is three-quarters invested in Japan, and Nomura Pacific Basin, nearly two-thirds invested there. An even larger Japanese investment, 85 percent, is found in the Vanguard International Equity Index Fund: Pacific Portfolio. It was a high scorer among Pacific Basin funds so far this year, up 37.3 percent.

HEADLINE: HAITIAN MILITARY AND ARISTIDE SIGN PACT TO END CRISIS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
Ending a week of uncertainty and bitter recriminations, Haiti's exiled President and the army commander who ousted him signed an accord yesterday providing for the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to power and for democracy to be restored to the country by Oct. 30.
After Father Aristide signed the accord last night on Governors Island in New York Harbor, he made a brief statement, saying: "To all of the international community, peace and love. Peace and love to the Haitian people." 
 The United Nations mediator, Dante Caputo, speaking later, thanked President Aristide for his flexibility. Mr. Caputo also said there were "no side letters and no hidden agenda."
The separate signings by Father Aristide and Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras came on a day of high tension in which it sometimes appeared that the deposed President would reject the agreement. Father Aristide was angered that the settlement did not provide for the quick retirement of the army high command, aides said.
Diplomats said he yielded after repeated assurances that the international community would see to it that the accords would be respected. Even then, an adviser to Father Aristide said, the Haitian President was "not at all comfortable," but diplomats said little pressure was required.
 
21 Months After Army Coup
 Father Aristide finally signed the accord shortly before 11 P.M. yesterday, roughly 21 months after the military coup that plunged Haiti into crippling economic isolation and led to a frantic boat exodus of tens of thousands.
At 10:40 P.M., Father Aristide and several aides entered the room where General Cedras had earlier signed the agreement. The exiled President then exchanged signatures and broad grins with United Nations mediators amid applause.
Father Aristide's representative in Washington, Jean Casimir, in a brief statement after the signing, said that the "coup leaders' departure, and the President's immediate return, have been the most sensitive concerns of the negotiations," but that the results were "a great day in the history of the entire hemisphere and of Haiti."
The accord, which General Cedras had signed about 11:30 in the morning, opens the way for a political conference this week in which President Aristide's aides and Haitian political parties will begin work on forming a Government and preparing for his return.
 
A Week of Uncertainty
 A leftist Roman Catholic priest, Father Aristide was elected with an overwhelming mandate in Haiti's first democratic presidential elections in December 1990. He has been in exile since he was overthrown in a military coup on Sept. 30, 1991.
The delay in Father Aristide's signing was in keeping with the uncertainty, frustration and sudden reversals that characterized the six days of negotiations on Governors Island. Late yesterday morning, shortly before General Cedras entered the brick Officers' Club to sign the pact, diplomats said grimly that they expected Father Aristide to reject the settlement.
On Friday, his objections to the settlement centered mainly on the timetable for his return to power. After 21 months of exile, he chafed at the prospect of waiting almost four more months to be restored to office.
 
Issue of Officers' Fate
 But the major sticking point to the agreement yesterday was disappointment on the President's team that members of the Haitian high command would not necessarily be removed from the armed forces for their role in the coup, but could be simply reassigned by a new commander who is to be chosen by Father Aristide shortly before his return in October.
"That was a shock to us," said one member of Father Aristide's delegation, who expressed anger that General Cedras could not be asked to delay his departure for more negotiations on this point. The commander left New York on a flight for Haiti after signing the agreement yesterday morning.
Father Aristide was worried that the commander and other senior officers who took part in the September 1991 coup could resort to violence or intimidation to frustrate his return, diplomats and aides said. Human rights experts estimate that anywhere from 500 to 3,000 people have been killed by the military since the 1991 coup.
 
Mediator's Exasperation
 This morning General Cedras was ushered out of the signing room at one point while Mr. Caputo, the United Nations mediator and a former Argentine Foreign Minister, held a series of last-minute telephone conversations with one of Father Aristide's top advisers, Michael D. Barnes.
 
Caputo 'Fed Up'
 Minutes earlier, alluding to Father Aristide's objections, Mr. Caputo whispered to a reporter: "He will have to answer to history. I am fed up."
Throughout months of negotiations, diplomats have said, Father Aristide has often changed tack, shifting from a mood of patient deliberation to adamant rejection of concessions.
By holding out until the last minute, Father Aristide grated on the nerves of many diplomats. But the delay helped the exiled President to obtain assurances that his most bitter enemies among army leaders would "either resign or leave the country," as one person involved in the negotiations said.
"The way we have left it is that they have conveyed to Caputo and Caputo conveyed to us that they will leave the high command or they will leave the country," a senior adviser to Father Aristide said of the military leadership.
The transition outlined in the settlement also called for Father Aristide to propose a new Prime Minister who would require the approval of Haiti's parliament before forming a new Government. Once the choice of prime minister is ratified by parliament, diplomats said, international aid will resume and countries will suspend sanctions against Haiti, including an oil embargo imposed last month by the United Nations.
 
Sanctions Hinge on Transition
 If Father Aristide is not restored by Oct. 30, diplomats said, the sanctions will automatically be reimposed. If the transition is successful, the penalties will be revoked by the Secretary General of the United Nations.
After Father Aristide has chosen a new prime minister, a selection that could come as early as this week, and his choice is ratified, a "$1 billion plus" aid program to Haiti will begin almost immediately, diplomats said.
Diplomats said the aid program for the desperately impoverished country would be vast, encompassing virtually all areas of society, from the separation of the police from the army and reforms in both institutions to technical help in building a new and professional civil service. Almost immediately, officials planning the aid said, officials will focus on creating thousands of new jobs to help revive an economy near collapse.
Lawrence E. Pezzullo, President Clinton's special adviser for Haitian affairs, said the package, to be provided by the United States and several other international donors, represented "a big commitment of money into a society to make it viable."
 
'A Long Journey'
 "It's been a long journey," Mr. Pezzullo said as he left the Officers' Club. "I feel good."
First, however, the Haitian political parties meeting with representatives of Father Aristide are to decide on a plan to purge the current Parliament of lawmakers who were elected last January in a vote that the United Nations and many others have denounced as illegitimate.
To do so, the parties represented in Parliament would be required to agree on what to do with the empty seats. Immediately afterward, diplomats said, attention will turn to ratifying the President's choice of a new prime minister, who is expected to be a independent political figure.
Asked what would happen if the Haitians could not agree among themselves, as has often been the case in the recent past, one diplomat said, "If they dicker away their time, that is their responsibility." Meanwhile, sanctions will remain in effect.
"This is, as far as I know, certainly the first time in the Western Hemisphere, that a sitting President who has been expelled has then been restored to power through international pressure," said Robert White, a senior member of Father Aristide's negotiating team.
"It is a tremendous success for all of the parties, Haiti, Caputo, the United States, certainly. Aristide showed that he has flexibility and that he is able to take decisions even when people in his movement are concerned."
A Haitian member of Father Aristide's delegation, Jean Dominique, expressing satisfaction with the accord, said: "No one can despair for the future of democracy in Haiti because for 21 months of dictatorship we have had a people that has never hung its head. That's the bottom line."

HEADLINE: 7 Rich Nations Expecting Little At Tokyo Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 3

 BODY:
Struggling with slow economic growth, high unemployment and bitter trade disputes, the leaders of the world's seven wealthiest nations will gather here for their annual summit meeting next week amid widespread doubts that they will make much progress in setting the global economy on a more prosperous course.
Negotiations on resolving the remaining differences among the so-called Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- are continuing and may yet produce modest agreements on liberalizing the world trading system, pumping new life into the industrial economies and providing financial assistance to Russia. 
 But some economists and government officials say there may be a deeper message in the contentious discussions leading up to this year's gathering, which opens Wednesday in the lavish Akasaka Palace.
 
Group's Unity Is Weakened
 The ambitious form that these annual economic conferences have taken, they say, may have been better suited to the more prosperous and confident 1980's than the current era of economic insecurity. The group's unity of purpose has been frayed by tough domestic problems in each country and politically weakened leaders.
"The tone, the atmosphere, the ideas that are discussed may be far more important than anything specific that comes out of the communique," President Clinton told a group of reporters on Friday, in an apparent attempt to lower expectations. "It is what direction are we going to take the world."
Horst Kohler, a senior German Finance Ministry official involved in preparing the conference, said, "The outlook is sobering."
 
Clinton to Be Scrutinized
 President Clinton's performance will be watched closely, in part because this will be his first summit meeting and in part because he had campaigned on a promise that he would focus more on domestic issues.
His hand will be strengthened by his recent success in advancing his budget deficit-reduction program in Congress, since that is what the other countries have been demanding of the United States for several years. But the tough issues here will present Mr. Clinton with a difficult test in his first overseas trip as President.
Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary during the four summit meetings under President George Bush, said some past conferences received more credit than they deserved. The gatherings, he said, can help prevent looming disasters and provide a good forum for an exchange of ideas. But they usually cannot do more than give added impetus to developments that are already taking place, like exchange-rate movements.
"If the stars are already lined up, you can push things ahead in a direction they were already pointed. But if you aren't that lucky, there is a limit to what you can do," Mr. Brady said.
Those limits have been accentuated this year by domestic concerns in each of the seven countries. The industrialized world's economies will expand by just 1.2 percent this year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the third year of sub-par growth.
 
Strained Relations
 Unemployment remains at a stubbornly high 8.5 percent for the 24 countries that are members of the organization, and it is expected to rise to 8.6 percent next year, a total of 36 million people out of work.
Relations between the countries have also been strained. Japan and the United States have been engaged in bitter negotiations, not over substantive trade problems, but simply over the framework for future trade talks. The European Community is finding its vision of unity tested by the economic problems of its members.
Germany, Europe's economic locomotive, is expected to see its economy contract by 2 percent this year, and is facing continuing violence against immigrants. Indeed, tight national budgets and unemployment are creating social problems in many Group of Seven countries.
In addition, President Clinton and Prime Minister John Major of Britain are struggling against low approval ratings at home that have limited their ability to fashion compromises. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan, who lost a no-confidence motion in Parliament last month, and appears likely to be forced from office after elections in two weeks. As chairman of the summit meeting, he is thus likely to have even less ability than usual to force the parties to reach agreements.
"There are seven ships out at sea, and usually the head of each state remains on the bridge setting their course," said Makoto Utsumi, an economics professor and former top Japanese Finance Ministry official who has been involved in several summit meetings. "But at the moment the captains are all down in the engine rooms."
 
Some Meetings Make History
 The Presidents and Prime Ministers of the leading industrial countries have met each year since 1974 to share ideas, set the global agenda and tackle world economic problems. Some meetings have made history, like the one on July 18, 1991, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev, then President of the Soviet Union, joined the group's leaders in London and asked for financial assistance. Others, like the Paris conference of 1989, which focused on stemming trade in narcotics and the laundering of illegal drug profits, made less of an impact.
This year, the leaders need to conclude negotiations on the long-stalled guidelines for a more open world trading system, to stimulate their faltering economies and to help finance Russia's transformation into a market economy. There is also likely to be some agreement on a plan to reduce the debt of the world's poorest developing nations, officials said.
There will also be discussion of critical political issues. The conference will try to achieve a common position on halting the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on whether to condemn Iran over accusations that it supporting terrorism, commits human rights abuses and is trying to build arsenals of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
But the signs of discord on the economic issues have been conspicuous. For instance, France has said it will refuse to free its agriculture markets as long as the United States threatens to increase duties on steel imports. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur called last-ditch attempts to work out a trade deal "rather stupid," and added, "There will be no accord on market access in Tokyo."
 
GATT Talks Threatened
 This attitude threatens completion of what is called the Uruguay Round of negotiations to rejuvenate the trading system under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Each of the past three summit meetings promised that the talks would be concluded by the end of the years in which they were held.
Japan has rebuffed calls that it cut taxes and increase Government spending to stimulate its anemic economy, which is expected to grow only about 1 percent in 1993. A stronger economy would reduce Japan's huge trade surplus -- expected to reach $160 billion this year -- and lift other economies.
Japanese officials have refused to take such steps, saying the two stimulus packages they have announced in the last year are enough.

HEADLINE: Boom in Boating Crowds the Summer Sea

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POINT PLEASANT, N.J., July 3

 BODY:
It was high noon last Saturday and weekend drivers who only hours before had jammed the New Jersey Turnpike or Garden State Parkway were hopping out of cars and into boats.
"They operate their vessels the way they drive their cars, only with less knowledge and skill," said Michael Yannuzzi, the New Jersey Marine Police officer at the helm of a 40-foot patrol boat cutting slowly along the Manasquan River near Point Pleasant. 
 Ahead loomed an armada of pleasure craft. Fat ocean-going cabin cruisers plowed up a huge wake, leaving crabbers in 12-foot boats fighting to keep from capsizing. Two high-performance craft with bows like knives engaged in the waterborne equivalent of a drag race as sailboat skippers -- with terror and anger on their faces -- angled out of their paths.
 
Many Potential Dangers
 All the while Jet Skis, Waverunners and other high-powered personal watercraft darted about.
"The wonder of it all is why more people aren't killed," muttered Sgt. Erich Herkloz, a state trooper who commands a Marine Police station. It is a comment shared across the region and the nation as America's 20 million pleasure craft take to waters that are increasingly congested.
But despite the potential dangers, pleasure boating is largely an unregulated pastime that invites freedom from the cares of landlocked lives. No states require licenses for adults to operate boats and only some states require children to have boating safety certificates. In many states, law enforcement is fragmented between several agencies with only a handful of marine officers assigned to patrol long stretches of water.
Prosperity in the 1980's helped increase the number of powerful boats once considered too costly for most Americans. Summer weekends bring the boats out in undisciplined swarms along the Jersey Shore, Long Island Sound and other waterways, raising concerns about safety and noise.
In New Jersey, as in most states, no boat speed limits are imposed unless posted to reduce wakes at marinas or in very narrow channels. High-powered racing boats thunder across shallow rivers and bays at speeds not tolerated for automobiles on land.
"There are very few quiet places near the water," said Nelson Potter, director of the marine and recreational vehicle department of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
But safety is the main issue that worries Mr. Potter and other experts who say that most of the region's recreational boaters have had no formal training in boat operation and many do not possess even rudimentary information on safety rules.
 
Number of Deaths Is Low
 Yet despite the growing congestion, the number of deaths from pleasure boating is low, compared to the number of highway deaths. In fact boating deaths have declined steadily for a quarter-century, dropping from 1,418 in 1970 to 1,360 in 1980 and 816 in 1992, a period in which the Coast Guard estimates that the number of pleasure boats jumped from 7.4 million to 20 million. But the drop is mostly in the category of drownings after falls off boats or sinkings.
A category that has climbed is the number of deaths and serious injuries from vessel collisions, according to the Coast Guard. In 1970 boats ramming one another caused 55 deaths and 232 injuries requiring hospitalization; by last year the figures were 79 and 1,369.
Connecticut just became the first state in the nation to pass a law requiring a certain level of boating proficiency. Under the law, by 1997 all operators of motor boats must demonstrate knowledge of boat operation by taking a safety course or a test. Delaware, Maryland and Vermont recently passed similar laws, but they are not as far reaching.
 
Public Support for Licensing
 Some states, like New Jersey and New York, require minors to be certified to operate power boats, but Mr. Potter and other safety experts said lobbyists for boat manufacturers have blocked bills seeking to make adult education mandatory.
And although studies have shown that the public supports licensing of recreational boaters it faces resistance nearly everywhere, said William Gossard, program manager for recreational boating safety in the National Transportation and Safety Board.
"We see licensing coming but it is being fought by 30 percent of the boaters who want no rules at all and the groups that are owned by the boating industry," Mr. Gossard said.
"Licensing is a nasty word to many people," said Capt. William Gronikowsky, supervisor of New Jersey's Marine Police. "There is an outcry for us to take more action against reckless individuals who say no one can tell them how to run their own boats. But it's very frustrating that we don't have the enforcement tools, like the threat of suspending an operating license."
 
Personal Craft Popular
 But even responsible boat owners resist further regulation.
"We strongly support programs to phase in mandatory boating education for all owners and operators," said Michael Sciulla, vice president of governmental affairs for BOAT/U.S., an association of 450,000 boat owners. "But we do not believe that paying the state for a license is going to significantly improve a rather remarkable safety record."
Drownings in bathtubs and pools claimed nearly as many lives last year as boating accidents did, Mr. Sciulla said.
One category that causes particular concern among boating safety experts is personal watercraft, like Jet Skis, which represented 25 percent of all power boat sales in 1992 and now number more than 350,000.
"They're a lot of fun, like motorcycles, but out on the water if you wipe out you don't get hurt," said Thomas Riley, 25, a truck driver from Philadelphia who rented a Jet Ski for three hours at Seaside Heights.
Not all landings are soft. While personal watercraft represent only 1 of every 60 power craft in America, they are involved in one-third of all collisions that result in serious injury.
Another concern of boating experts is the fragmented responsibility for law enforcement. New Jersey is the only state in the region that has a State Police bureau responsible for boat safety and enforcement. In New York the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation regulates policy through the Department of Environmental Protection, with conservation officers sharing enforcement with local authorities like the Harbor Patrol of the New York City Police Department, the Marine Bureau of the Nassau County Police Department and the police in towns on Long Island.
 
A Push for Boating Standards
 This spring, the National Transportation Safety Board urged the states to enact uniform pleasure-boating standards to reduce the number and severity of accidents. It recommended the mandatory use of life jackets or similar equipment for children, tougher laws on alcohol consumption while operating a boat and adult boat safety education.
The extent of alcohol use in recreational boating "cannot be adequately documented," the safety board said, because states vary on the compilation of information. In a study of fatalities the board estimated that "at least 37 percent" of boat operators involved in fatal accidents have some alcohol in their systems.
The issue attracted widespread attention three months ago when two Cleveland Indians pitchers, Steve Olin and Tim Crews, were killed when their 18-foot boat hit a dock on a lake near Orlando, Fla. Investigators later determined that Mr. Crews, the driver, was legally intoxicated.
New Jersey and Connecticut have no requirements about life jackets for children; New York requires children under 12 to wear them on boats less than 26 feet long. New York recently joined New Jersey in adopting a requirement that boat operators consent to alcohol impairment tests or face loss of boating privileges. Connecticut has no such requirement.
But no matter what laws are in place, officials say that resources for enforcement are so small that violations usually go unnoticed. The Coast Guard, whose chief mission is search and rescue, works closely with the states within the three-mile continental limits and tidal areas, and Federal money augments state patrol expenditures in lean economic times.
In New Jersey, budget constraints have cut the Marine Police to 150 officers, who patrol the state's lakes and waterways, including 127 miles of Atlantic coastline and 1,750 miles of interior tidal shoreline. The officers are also responsible for pollution control and anti-narcotics policing. "We just don't have the manpower to cover our beat," said Sergeant Herkloz.
 
Few Patrols
 Federal money earmarked for overtime pay will help beef up patrols this summer, said Captain Gronikowsky, the Marine Police supervisor in Trenton. But last weekend, on a beautiful day that produced heavy boat traffic, only one 20-foot patrol boat with two officers was on duty between Shark River in Monmouth County and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County.
The same goes for some areas of New York State, Mr. Potter said. "Whole stretches of the Hudson River are not covered," he said.

HEADLINE: A Roof for All, Made of Rulings and Red Tape

SERIES: Search for Shelter -- New York and Its Homeless/First of three articles.

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
They shout out sad stories in rush-hour subways. They beg for money outside bank machines. They dig through the trash. They talk to the air.
The homeless remain an indelible fact of New York City life. Thousands still live on the streets. And since Mayor David N. Dinkins took office four years ago, the number of homeless families in city shelters has swelled from 3,700 to 5,600. Mr. Dinkins himself faces contempt of court charges for leaving hundreds of these families to sleep for days at a time on chairs in dingy, smoky city offices, where gaunt men with AIDS huddle next to squalling babies and exhausted mothers. 
 Some of the current crisis is of the Dinkins administration's own making, researchers and advocates for the homeless say, but its ability to swiftly change the city's troubled shelter system, which dwarfs that of any other American city in its scale, expense and comprehensiveness, has also been limited by decisions made years before Mr. Dinkins became Mayor.
The tale of the city's response to homelessness -- which now costs over a half a billion dollars a year -- began more than a decade ago when a young lawyer who had never even tried a case sued the city for the right to shelter.
The outcome of that suit, and others like it filed on behalf of women and families, set off a dizzying shelter buildup and entangled the city in a confounding problem as difficult to control as wildfire and as hard to predict as human nature.
When Mr. Dinkins took office four years ago, he spoke of lofty goals, promising sweeping changes in the city's treatment of the homeless. But in trying to remake the city's shelter system he had to grapple with a number of immovables. The past haunts the present in the unconditional right to shelter enshrined in legal agreements, state regulation and ingrained bureaucratic practice -- a right more far-reaching than that offered by any other American city.
There are no limits on how long people live in the system, nor can they be required to do chores or to join self-help programs. Even a resident who sets a fire, attacks someone or uses drugs in a shelter can only be suspended for a week, city officials say.
For years, the city has relied on large, institutional buildings and commercial hotels for shelters, places often condemned as costly warehouses. But providing something more humane is no easy thing. The city is often boxed in by not-in-my-backyard resistance to new, improved shelters.
It also must contend with the state's longstanding practice of emptying its mental hospitals without creating enough group homes, which has left thousands of disturbed people to fend for themselves on the streets and in the shelters.
Leading state legislators are now pushing for a landmark bill requiring that most of the savings from reducing hospitalization be reinvested in community services, but Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, faced with budget pressures, has not agreed to the proposal.
The plight of the mentally ill is just one aspect of homelessness that the Mayor cannot control.
"It's not simple," he said recently.
The city's vast shelter system of more than 100 hospitals, armories, schools, prisons, factories, hotels and apartments is a unique jerry-built contraption that grew helter-skelter over the last decade, shaped by legal battles, flawed compromises, grass roots fears of the homeless, political expedience and quirky twists of fate.
It has taken New York more than a decade to build its behemoth of a shelter system. All say it will take years more to send it lumbering in a new direction that helps the homeless attain self-sufficiency.
 
The Policy
 1979 Lawsuit Opened Doors
 Since the inception of New York's remarkable open-door policy, spending on homeless programs has exploded from less than $10 million in the early 1980's to more than $500 million this year. On average the city spends $36,000 a year to shelter a family. The Federal Government pays half the cost and the state and city split the rest. The city and state share the cost of shelter for a single person -- $15,000 a year. That is what it costs to run the shelters, including paying for staff, supplies, utilities and building maintenance.
Most cities refused to create an entitlement and instead relied on charitable and nonprofit groups to provide shelter on a catch-as-catch can basis. "When I was doing my field work and said I was from New York," said Diane Baillargeon, who is completing a book on homeless policies in 10 American cities, "people raised their eyebrows and told me, 'We don't want to make those mistakes.' "
Even cities that had similarly open-ended policies pulled back by decade's end. In Washington D.C., voters repealed the right to shelter. In Philadelphia, advocates for the homeless themselves abandoned the battle for shelter. What the homeless really need, said Stephen Gold, a lawyer who represented the homeless there, is housing and treatment for alcoholism, addiction and mental illness.
"Shelters stink," Mr. Gold said. "You don't want a right to stuff that stinks."
But New York City has not backed away from the right to shelter because of the city's strong liberal tradition and the shrewd band of young advocates whose legal battle for shelter has never let up.
 
No Challenge Planned
 No one in city government is talking about challenging the right to shelter, though city lawyers say it has never been definitively established under the state constitution. If the city decided to back away from the obligation, it would have to go back to court to set aside a 1981 consent decree for single men and it would have to litigate the issue for families, city lawyers say.
It was a young, green Wall Street lawyer who started it all in 1979 when he sued the city for the right to shelter for men. Robert Hayes, just 26 years old, had begged time from his firm and burrowed into the library stacks, looking for leverage to improve the lot of panhandlers he met on the streets. He found a passage in the state constitution that called for "the aid, care and support of the needy." New York is one of just a handful of states with such a broadly worded social commitment in its constitution.
He also found a ready audience in a state Supreme Court Judge, Richard Wallach, elected to the bench from the Upper West Side. Mr. Wallach recalled reading George Orwell's "Down and Out in Paris and London" from his Harvard College days. The image of Depression-era hobos tramping through England stayed with him. He felt no civilized society should allow such misery.
He pressured the city to settle. Mr. Hayes wanted small shelters and housing. But Mayor Edward I. Koch resisted providing more than basic shelter in large settings.
"I believe there are minimums below which nobody should be permitted to fall," Mr. Koch said recently. "But after that, this country is so big, so wonderful and filled with opportunities, after that you have to earn it."
In August 1981, the city and Mr. Hayes signed a consent decree, called "Callahan" after one of its plaintiffs, a hard-drinking, out-of-work short-order cook, that made New York the first city in the nation to guarantee each homeless man the bare necessities of shelter: a mattress, a pillow, clean sheets, soap, a roof over his head.
Koch regards his approval of the decree as one of his biggest mistakes. He handed the advocates a club they used to beat up on the city in court and in the press, he said.
Judge Wallach, who keeps a sketch of Mr. Hayes arguing before him hanging behind his desk, said of the decree: "It was uncharted sea. Of course it wasn't the ideal approach. But ideals and what's practically available are not the same. You've got to see it in light of the limited powers of the judiciary."
And Mr. Hayes, who helped found the Coalition for the Homeless, acknowledges its mixed results. "Have the shelters bred dependency?" he asked. "Absolutely. Have shelters saved lives? Definitely."
 
The Shelters
 Vast Armories And Seedy Hotels
 The suit -- which Mr. Koch addressed by sending thousands of homeless into barracks-style shelters and hotels -- created a huge bureaucracy and began a massive build-up that has proved difficult to undo.
The Dinkins Administration has made progress in opening more apartment-style shelters for families, but not enough to end use of hotels. Nor has it been able to close down the armories and other large shelters for individuals, though some of them have fewer residents.
The city faces one constant practical problem: no one wants a shelter in their neighborhood. The Koch Administration got around this by turning armories into shelters in the dead of night, busing in as many as 1,000 men to sleep on one vast drill floor.
With homeless families it chose a different tack, sending many into seedy, garish parts of midtown, where landlords willingly accepted troubled families in exchange for $2,000 -- about seven times the state's rental grant -- or more a month for a single dilapidated room.
The decision about the kind of shelter to offer was not made only out of political expedience. Mr. Koch believed the homeless were only entitled to minimal quarters, not better quarters than the working poor trying to make it without government aid.
Advocates continued to press for shelter as part of a calculated strategy that expanded the very system they so often condemned. Mr. Hayes believed the terrible conditions in shelters would embarrass the city into giving the homeless permanent apartments. To win public sympathy, advocates oversimplified homelessness.
"There was a discussion that went on among us all," said Marsha A. Martin, who served on the board of the Coalition for the Homeless. "Do you market it as a problem of shelter, or do you tell people about alcoholism, drug addiction, mental illness, concerns about child abuse?"
The problem was "marketed" as soluble with the simple provision of housing. In one television report, Mr. Hayes walked through Harlem saying the solution to homelessness was simple: "In three words, housing, housing, housing."
Meanwhile, the whirlwind of economic and social problems that caused so many to seek shelter only gained strength. Poverty deepened. The mentally ill went untended. Cocaine, as cheap rocks of crack, moved into the ghetto. AIDS was not far behind.
The number of people sheltered by the city has grown from 2,000 in 1980 to 24,000 now, the population of a small town.
 
The Regulations
 Further Demands But No Solutions
 As new shelters proliferated, so too did state regulations about how they should be run. City policy has been driven not so much by a coherent strategy for combatting homelessness as by the drive to open more beds and satisfy the rules, say city officials past and present.
The 1983 regulation that has most bedeviled the Dinkins administration says shelter "be provided immediately" to families.
It is no small irony that the state social services commissioner who approved that regulation is now a city official who faces contempt of court charges for failing to carry it out. Cesar Perales, Deputy Mayor for Human Services, has found his own orders impossible to follow.
Mr. Perales now says he did not mean to penalize the city for failing to place someone who applied for shelter at 11 P.M. by 8 the next morning. Instead, he said, he was thinking of other counties that had callouslyrefused to shelter people promptly.
His explanations only inflame former Mayor Koch. "Now, of course, he doesn't want any of these rules," Mr. Koch said. "That is why I have a minimum regard for Cesar Perales. When he was in the catbird seat he made our lives miserable."
City officials say they are also haunted by state policies that have fueled the homeless problem. The state has released tens of thousands of mental patients from hospitals in recent decades because of the advent of mood-leveling drugs and patient's rights suits, but never developed anywhere nearly enough group homes to care for them in communities. Many of these disturbed people have ended up on city streets.
And the state has only raised the monthly rental grant for families on welfare twice since 1975, making it hard for many to keep or get housing on their own. Governor Cuomo says the state cannot afford to increase the grant -- $286 a month for a family of three -- even though he has admitted it is not enough to pay for a garage, much less an apartment, in the city.
 
The Quandary
 Some See Lure To Enter Shelters
 When Mr. Dinkins came into office the city had already started providing permanent housing -- mostly rehabilitated apartments -- to homeless families, under the largest program of its kind in the country.
The program has given the city a way to get tens of thousands of families out of shelters, but Mr. Dinkins now believes it has had a pushmi-pullyu effect, also drawing many doubled-up families into the shelters as they looked for better housing.
The tricky job of balancing the number of people who come into shelter and the number who leave will be at the heart of any mayor's efforts to control the size of the shelter system.
Oddly, the city's housing effort, started in the mid-1980's, was not the result of some grand visionary plan. To the contrary, the city's effort to develop and rehabilitate thousands of permanent apartments for homeless families -- ultimately spending hundreds of millions of dollars -- was set in motion by an accident of fate: Wayne A. Stanton was watching television on a Sunday evening in 1986.
Mr. Stanton, soon to be the Reagan Administration official in charge of welfare programs, was sitting in his favorite leather chair in his living room when he tuned into 60 Minutes.
The episode, "Heartbreak Hotel," was about New York City "paying luxury rates for squalid, vermin-infested rooms in hotels." A tearful mother displayed her filthy room. (Mayor Koch remarked sarcastically, "We don't pay for maid service.)
But what really got Mr. Stanton's attention was this: the Federal Government had for years paid half the city's tab for putting thousands of families in the hotels -- about $70 million a year.
"I was horrified," he said recently. "I thought, 'My God, my department is paying for that?' "
 
30-Day Limit
 The next year, Mr. Stanton announced that the Government would stop paying for hotel stays of more than 30 days, even though many families had lived in these places a year or more. Congress delayed the cutoff, but the threat remained.
Mr. Koch said he felt he had no choice but to get families out of the hotels -- and the only way he could see to do it was to move them into permanent apartments. He personally thought that giving the homeless priority for housing was bad city policy.
And he warned that the city's ill-housed residents would pour into shelters in search of a permanent home. "If you build them, they will come," he said.
Despite his reservations, Mr. Koch felt compelled to mobilize the city's fractured bureaucracies to come up with thousands of apartments. With more homeless entering the shelter system, the city could not afford to lose the Federal millions, he said.
By the time, he left office the city had more than halved the number of families in welfare hotels, to about 1,500. But as Mr. Koch predicted, the housing did not end the crisis -- and still has not.
Koch visited a formerly homeless family in 1988 and described how well they lived in an op-ed piece for The New York Times. The mother and her children watched a large TV, with remote control and VCR, in a "tastefully furnished" living room.
 
Picking and Choosing
 He asked the woman why her family had spent years in welfare hotels. She told him she had turned down 19 apartments the city offered her until she found one to her liking. It galled Koch that she had been finicky when working poor families never had a chance at those apartments.
"Something has gone wrong," he wrote, "when people on public assistance have more choices than people who are making it on their own."
The advocates rolled their eyes at the hard-hearted Mayor. But two years later, when they came to power with Mr. Dinkins, they ran headlong into the same cul-de-sacs as their despised adversary.
Next: The Dinkins administration's path from idealism to pragmatism.

HEADLINE: Muted Reaction in District That Court Opposed

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C. July 2

 BODY:
From its vantage point, the Supreme Court defined the racial politics of North Carolina's 12th District, redrawn to elect a black member of Congress, in dire terms, likening it to "political apartheid." But those who live and work in the long and skinny district in the Carolina Piedmont view the issue in far more muted terms.
From the pungent-smelling tobacco warehouses to the rusty textile mills, people of both races joke about their amoeba-shaped district, which follows Interstate 85 linking predominantly black neighborhoods of Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Greensboro and Durham. What is termed "racial gerrymandering" in Washington, they call "the ketchup spill" here. 
 "Times have changed," said Renee Jarrett, a freshman at Johnson C. Smith University, a black college in Charlotte. "Whites are more likely to vote for blacks now, although the new district makes it less likely minorities will sit on their butts and not vote."
In an unscientific series of interviews with more than 30 citizens around the district, the fault lines seemed fluid or ambivalent. Some blacks broke with civil rights advocates by expressing discomfort with the concept of drawing political boundaries along racial lines.
 
Some Urban Unity
 And many whites, who make up more than 40 percent of the district, said they felt well served by their representative, Melvin Watt, a 47-year-old Democrat who is the first black to represent the region in Congress in this century. A few said that Mr. Watt actually reflected their views better than their former white representatives, who were attuned to rural areas.
Autrey Van Pelt, a 61-year-old clerk in the Gastonia city hall, who voted against Mr. Watt last November, said she was distressed by the notion of rezoning to favor blacks. Nevertheless, she said, "I don't feel like I'm less represented." Saying she had come to see the freshman Congressman in a new light, she added, "I can still vote and voice the way I feel."
But such reactions here may not be typical of those in more than a dozen other districts around the country, where minority representatives potentially face similar challenges from white voters claiming discrimination.
The textile centers of the North Carolina Piedmont have long been an oasis of relative racial harmony. Settled by Scottish and Irish farmers, the Piedmont was a Republican area that opposed secession during the Civil War. Many neighborhoods are integrated, and Charlotte twice elected a black mayor in the 1980's even though a majority of its population is white.
 
No Pressing Concern
 Though the High Court's ruling promises to be in court for months, there has yet to be any audible protest.
"It's not a matter of life and death," said Herbert L. White, managing editor of The Charlotte Post, an influential black newspaper. "There has been no discernible increase in racial tension."
The Post, a weekly, postponed for a week an article on the legal issues of the case, preferring to devote the immediate issue to opportunities for black businessmen if Charlotte attracts a professional football franchise.
Mr. White's editorial decision reflects a widely expressed attitude that seems to place a higher priority on economic issues than on racial considerations in the district.
To be sure, many blacks say they are proud of Mr. Watt, 47, who grew up in a tin-roofed shack without electricity. A few said they were more likely to turn to a black than a white Congressman for help. Still, some blacks say they still need an advantage at the ballot box to assure the election of representatives who share their concerns.
Linda Ramsey, a 41-year-old nurse's assistant, said, "I'm not a racist but I personally relate better to blacks." Visiting Mr. Watt's Charlotte office in appreciation for his help in seeking a Navy transfer closer to home for her son, she added, "We do need a black man to represent us because he knows where we're coming from."
 
Some Voice Complaints
 Some whites expressed misgivings that their choice at the ballot box now appears to be narrowed to only black candidates.
At the Carolina Steel Plant in Greensboro, where groups of blacks and whites sit at separate tables in the sweltering cinderblock mess hall, Gene Hurley called the reapportioned district "a lot of bunk."
The 55-year-old crane operator, munching potato chips on his dinner break, added: "It's violating the white voters' rights. That's democracy: you do it to them before they do it to you."
While getting a shave at the Spindle Center barber shop in Gastonia early Thursday morning, Charles Henderson, a 63-year-old retired telephone installer who is white, said: "There's a Dad Jim drunk that laid out the district because of the way it's shaped and what they tried to accomplish. As an old country boy, I say we had a pretty good system before this."
Virtually all residents of both races appear aware of the Supreme Court decision, which requires a lower court to reassess the complaints of five white litigants who claim the district's linking of otherwise distinct communities constitutes a racial quota system.
 
Contrast of Tones
 But few expressions of concern here, even by the harshest critics of the district's odd appearance or the Supreme Court's decision, echoed the sharp words in the Court's 5-to-4 decision.
In her majority opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor thundered against "political apartheid," and suggested that "the North Carolina plan resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past."
In response, Mr. Watt called the decision "intellectually dishonest." He added, "The notion that a black Representative can't represent white folks is ridiculous."
The 12th district was created in 1991 because North Carolina had not had a black Representative since 1900. After the North Carolina Legislature created one minority district, the Justice Department ordered that a second be created to offer blacks representation in proportion to their 22 percent of the state population.
The case now goes to a special panel at Federal District Court in Raleigh. The state is expected to argue that there is a "compelling state interest" underlying the strange shape of the district: that urban dwellers as well as blacks deserve representation of their own in predominantly rural North Carolina.
Whatever the lower court's decision, the matter is likely to go back to the Supreme Court.
But more often than not, blacks and whites in this overwhelmingly Democratic district expressed their opinions about Mr. Watt and redistricting in economic, not racial terms.
If Mr. Watt's district is redrawn and he suddenly faces a serious challenge at the polls, he should think about taking up smoking. He is roundly unpopular at the sprawling R. J. Reynolds cigarette plant dotted with little plaques that say, "Thank you for smoking."
Inside the factory, speaking over the din of forklifts transporting freshly packed Winstons, Steven Floyd, a 39-year-old black machinist, said Mr. Watt would have to join other North Carolina representatives in fighting proposals to increase cigarette taxes to gain his support in the next election.
"I can live with the new district," he added, "but I wish they didn't have to create a district to have a black representative."

HEADLINE: Vermont Debates Value of Saving a Rural Image

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHREWSBURY, Vt.

 BODY:
Marjorie Pierce sat on the porch of her 158-year-old general store, gazing upon her garden of blue lupines, the lush meadow and the Green Mountains against the evening sky.
"It doesn't look endangered from here," said Miss Pierce, a former high school French teacher who celebrated her 90th birthday in May at the Town Hall with several hundred neighbors, including Senator James M. Jeffords. 
 But the view from Miss Pierce's hilltop store in Shrewsbury (population 1,800) is not the only window into Vermont. In June, the National Trust for Historic Preservation designated the state as one of America's 11 most "endangered historic places," the first time an entire state made the list.
The distinction -- although a symbolic one with no legal weight -- has fueled the debate over a fundamental question here: should Vermont be quaint forever? Or should it open the way to unpredictable development?
Can Vermont allow Wal-Mart to cross its borders and still be the mythic Vermont of small towns and gentle mountains? For now, Vermont, Hawaii and Alaska are the only states without a branch of the discount chain from Bentonville, Ark.
 
State With Identity Crisis
 To meander from the Vermont Book Shop in Middlebury to the old red brick City Hall in Rutland to the W. E. Pierce Country Store in Shrewsbury is to see a state with an identity crisis. To many people here, Vermont has been under siege for years, and these days, more cows can be found on T-shirts than in the pastures.
Miss Pierce sees the changes every time she gets into her 1966 Volkswagen and drives to Rutland (population 18,000), 10 miles away, to buy groceries at the Price Chopper. "They're talking about putting a mall just outside Rutland," she said. "I'm worried that there's too much development coming in, and that will bring a change in our life style."
That mall, along with Wal-Mart's plans to build two huge stores in Vermont, had much to do with the preservation group's decision to put this state on its list.
 
Change of Character
 "It clearly could change the nature and character of Vermont if they succeed in putting in these malls," said Richard Moe, the president of the nonprofit trust, adding that he had fallen in love with Vermont as a student at Williams College, just across the border in Massachusetts.
But character has not been paying the bills in Rutland. Mayor Jeffrey Wennberg says he appreciates the small-town charm of Vermont as much as any out-of-towner, or flatlander as they are called here. "I got married in Woodstock because the backgrounds are great," he said. "Woodstock is Hollywood's image of Vermont."
And it sells. Woodstock has a manicured village green, a covered bridge, antiques stores and $100-a-night bed and breakfasts where New Yorkers dream on four-poster beds with Laura Ashley sheets. Tourism is the state's third-largest revenue producer, after manufacturing and services.
Still, Woodstock is not Rutland.
Rutland is the shuttered stores of a once-vibrant downtown, and the General Electric jet-engine-parts plant, which has cut 500 of its 1,600 jobs since 1991. Rutland is people who buy Wilcox ice cream because it is cheaper than the Ben & Jerry's made in Waterbury by two millionaires from New York, and it is people who have to drive 55 miles to Glen Falls, N.Y., to buy a washing machine at Sears.
After a six-year battle with environmentalists, Mayor Wennberg hopes ground will be broken this summer on a $40 million shopping mall in Rutland that will include Sears, Kmart, J. C. Penney's and perhaps a Gap. "Even Vermonters need to shop," said the Mayor, a Republican who was recently elected to his fourth term.
More important, he said, the mall will mean 800 jobs, though they will be mostly part-time and will not pay anywhere near the $15 an hour General Electric pays.
 
Environmental Vanguard
 A lot of people were surprised that one of the country's most environmentally progressive states -- it was the first to ban billboards and the second to enact a bottle-deposit law -- ended up on the trust's 1993 list.
With a flair for the dramatic, Mr. Wennberg one day in June unrolled a 50-foot-long computer printout across the lawn of City Hall. It detailed the maze of state environmental regulations that the developer had to negotiate to win approval for its mall.
"Our regulations are beyond Byzantine," he said. Although he acknowledged that those regulations have helped keep Vermont relatively unspoiled, he and others say economic growth has been severely inhibited.
Miss Pierce, for one, misses the money she and her 79-year-old brother, Gordon, used to make pumping gas. The red pump their father put in at the general store around 1923 became a museum piece three years ago when state inspectors ruled that the gas tank had to be replaced by an environmentally correct, double-lined model. "We estimated it would have cost more than $15,000," she said. "And neither of us is going to live long enough to make that back."
Coincidental to the preservation group's ominous report, a poll made public in June by the Becker Institute of Massachusetts, a market-research organization in Sudbury, Mass., showed a drastic shift in Vermonters' attitudes toward the environment, with 54 percent of those surveyed ranking economic development as their top priority, while 40 percent put the environment first. Several years ago, the poll found that 58 percent of Vermonters listed strict environmental protection as their top priority, with only 35 percent listing economic development as a "very high" priority.
 
Preservation Too Costly
 "We can't afford to turn this into a social game preserve for the elite," Mayor Wennberg said, talking of the competition for economic development with states like New Hampshire.
But New Hampshire, with its condominium explosion, is just what many people here do not want Vermont to become. Noel Perrin, a writer who commutes by electric car from his home in Thetford Center, Vt., to his job as a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., remarked, "New Hampshire is not on the endangered list because New Hampshire's already gone."
Still, Vermont is not a museum. Things change. Dike Blair plans to sell the legendary 45-year-old Vermont Book Shop in Middlebury, which Mr. Blair's friend, Robert Frost, patronized. The buyer, Mr. Blair said, is a lawyer from New Jersey "who has decided he wants to live in Vermont."
And in Woodstock, 88-year-old Larry Angwin was auctioning off the contents of his three-bedroom house: the beds, the china plates with painted roses -- and the Aug. 19, 1950 cover of the Saturday Evening Post, a Norman Rockwell illustration of a man in bed smoking a cigar and playing solitaire.
It was a picture of Larry Angwin 43 years ago. "I posed for him," said Mr. Angwin. "He paid me $5 by check. I never should have cashed it." This time around, the auctioneer bought the cover for $5.
The image of Vermont has a way of swallowing the reality. Across the brook from Mr. Angwin's house is a Victorian inn where a harpist plays during cocktails. And in May, when Mr. Angwin moved to a senior-citizen residence in Woodstock, the urban refugees who own the inn bought his house.

HEADLINE: China's Peasantry Takes Measure of Its Prosperity

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PAN SHI, China

 BODY:
Ignoring a light drizzle, the women emerged from their houses carrying small plates of potatoes, goose livers and pickled cucumbers, and placed them on tables clustered outside a shiny white three-story house.
The focus of attention was a tiny boy bundled up like a bushy red ball and cradled in the arms of his new mother. He had just turned one month old, a magic age in the hardscrabble Chinese countryside, traditionally signifying that a baby is likely to survive, and nearly a hundred peasants had come with gifts of little red packets bulging with money. 
 "He's the first son," said Mai Shunjing, the scrawny grandfather, as he let out a smile filled with broken teeth and big aspirations. "This is an important day for our family."
Half a dozen years ago, there would have been a similar celebration, but without the food, the money or the wine. Life has overwhelmingly improved over the last six years, even the last six months, for the 440 people in Pan Shi, a village in a land of rich, rolling rice paddies in southern China's Guangdong Province.
 
Well Off and Typical
 Pan Shi (pronounced pahn sher) is a bit wealthier than the average Chinese village, but customs and conditions here are still fairly indicative of how China's 900 million peasants -- three-quarters of the nation's population and nearly 17 percent of the world's -- go through life.
The great issues that absorb residents of Beijing, and through them catch the attention of the West, are of subdued interest here. The peasants seem little interested in challenging the Government on freedom of expression, for instance, preferring to put their energies into defying Government limits on having children.
They do not seem intrigued by macroeconomic questions, like whether China's economy now trails only that of the United States and Japan, but rather by such mundane matters as whether they will be able to afford running water instead of having to fetch water from a well.
Yet even here, the peasants feel vulnerable to what happens 1,000 miles away in the capital. The Communist Party's policies may change tomorrow. Or some official may arbitrarily decide to ruin one family or another.
"Our life is so much better now than before, but in China, you never can tell what the Government will do," said a young entrepreneur who runs a factory in another village. "I don't know how long this economic policy will last. So whenever I get the chance, I'm going abroad. Life is stable in America."
 
Knowing When to Clam Up
 While they may not know much about politics, the peasants here in Pan Shi know enough to clam up when the topic comes up. As the festivities for his grandson continued over a 10-dish banquet by the porch, Mr. Mai turned sheepish when asked what he thought about the growing gaps between the rich and the poor.
He managed a faint smile before mumbling something about there being no gaps at all. Immediately, however, his son came to his rescue, and Mr. Mai slipped away.
"We don't talk politics in this house," said Jinsheng, his 29-year-old elder son. "My father has suffered too much in his life, from the Cultural Revolution, from this and that movement.
"He is old and afraid. I don't want anything to happen to him again because of politics. I have to protect my father. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here today."
 
Politics Is Passive
 For most villagers, politics is not an interactive process but a passive one. A new political movement means that they must change the slogans on the village walls, or -- worse yet -- attend silly meetings instead of working the fields.
To be sure, the Government now holds elections for village chief, but only one person runs. That is partly because villagers cannot quite imagine a political race, and partly because it is no longer a very attractive position.
"Most people don't want to do that kind of work," said Chen Qiumei, a 33-year-old woman with two children, both boys. "The Government wants you to do a lot of work that offends other people."
A few others echoed her view. In a place where much of life is lived outside, there are few secrets. The village leaders often have take sides with one villager over another.
 
Spying for Family Planning
 The worst part is reporting on mothers who get pregnant for a second, third or fourth time. The village chief risks being regarded as a traitor for turning in his friends.
Mai Ruiqian, a 46-year-old sturdy fellow with a rounding stomach, became the new Mayor this year. He is a member of the Mai clan that dominates the village: nearly all men are named Mai, and only their wives, who came from other villages, have other surnames. It is common in China for a village to be made up of a single clan, and many villages are known only by the surname of the people who live there: the Mai Village, the Wu Village, and so on.
One sign that the job is not as enviable as it was in the past is that the last chief declined to run for a second term. Still, Mayor Mai says he has found a way around the difficulty of picking on his neighbors: He leaves the troublesome tasks to his superiors in the township government a few miles away.
"The township sends its family planning people here," Mr. Mai said, expressing relief that he does not have to worry much about it. "They have the family planning rosters."
 
A Phone but No One to Call
 Mr. Mai enjoys a few perks, like lunching in the township with officials nearly every day. But there are problems: arranging for water for crops and for more electricity to meet the growing demands of modernization. In a small triumph, the village also got a public phone recently; the only problem is that since few peasants have a phone, there is no one to call.
The phone, however, is a sign that the peasants are pretty well off in Pan Shi. Indeed, in addition to the public phone, two families have their own phones -- not including the Mayor.
Being moderately well off, in Pan Shi's case, means that peasants here earn an average of about $175 per person per year, instead of the national average for peasants of about $125. The figure may be a bit misleading because the peasants grow most of their food themselves and have few expenses.
Another reason they are doing well is that people throughout this region called Taishan have many relatives in Hong Kong, the United States and Canada. Taishanese is still a common dialect in Chinatowns in the United States, although in the last few decades it has been partly eclipsed by Cantonese and, more recently, Mandarin.
The gates to Pan Shi itself are a reminder of the overseas connection, having been built with money sent home from migrants abroad and carrying a tablet with the names of dozens of contributors.
 
Plastic for the Crops
 Still, it was only when someone here introduced a new farming technique -- protecting the vegetable crops with plastic covers -- that life for everyone seemed to get better. The plastic serves to keep moisture in the soil and protect the vegetables from freezing, and the practice has since become widespread throughout China.
Mai Caidong, 26, is among the new entrepreneurs who are branching in new directions. Not content simply to spend her days wading in the rice paddies or bending over the cabbages, she is taking advantage of opportunities to go into business.
Up at 3:30 A.M., she and her husband roar off on their motorcycle to the Taishan city center every day to sell fruit and vegetables, a business that brings them about $2,600 a year. Last year, they saved $1,700 of that in the bank, although Ms. Mai recently diversified her assets by investing some of that in a gold necklace from Hong Kong and other jewelry.
"They let us go into private enterprise, and most people don't feel bad if they stay behind in the village," said Ms. Mai, sitting in her clean, spacious living room. "Of course, my husband wants to go to Guangzhou and set up a rice shop."

HEADLINE: 3 More Victims of Serial Killer Are Identified

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGDALE, L.I., July 3

 BODY:
Two women who have been missing since 1991 and a third whose body was found on Monday were identified today by state police here as victims of a serial killer who the police say confessed to slaying 17 women.
The women came from varied backgrounds, with police saying that one was a methadone user who frequented Allen Street in Manhattan, a common haunt for prostitutes, while another was an unemployed accountant who lived at home with her family in Suffolk County. 
 But all of them, the police believe, were strangled over the last two years by Joel Rifkin, 34, an unemployed landscaper who appears to be the most prolific serial killer in New York history.
Mr. Rifkin, of East Meadow, was arrested on Monday morning after New York State Police discovered a woman's body in the back of his truck. Later that day, the police said he confessed to killing 17 women and dumping their bodies throughout the region, from Putnam County to the eastern tip of Long Island. Since then, law-enforcement officials have been trying to check his claims.
 
Link to 13 Killings
 This evening, the police said, they had identified the woman whose body was found in the back of Mr. Rifkin's truck as Tiffany Bresciani, 22, of Manhattan. She apparently was last seen on Allen Street around June 24. Several women there earlier in the week said she was a fixture on the street and was well-liked by the other women there.
The bodies of the other women, Lorraine Orvieto, 29, of Stony Brook, L.I., and Mary Ellen DeLuca, 22, of Valley Stream, L.I., were discovered more than a year ago in Brooklyn and Orange County, respectively. But they remained unidentified until this week. With today's announcement, troopers here in the State Police Barracks L said they had linked Mr. Rifkin to 13 killings and identified seven victims.
Both Ms. Orvieto's and Ms. DeLuca's families had reported to police that their daughters were missing almost two years ago.
"Why did it take this long to find out?" asked Florence Orvieto, Lorraine's mother, in a telephone interview this afternoon, choking back tears. For the last two years, she said, she had been saving Christmas presents for her daughter, who disappeared in December 1991. "I was waiting for her to come home," she said.
On Friday, the police called Mrs. Orvieto and told her that her daughter's body was found last July 11 in a 55-gallon oil drum in Coney Island Creek near Cropsey Avenue in Brooklyn. A cause of death has yet to be determined, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner.
Also on Friday, the police notified the DeLuca family that their daughter's body had been found in Cornwall, in Orange County, in October 1991, one month after she had been reported missing. The cause of death was not available today.
According to the police, the identities of both women were confirmed through dental records.
The police said that Lorraine Orvieto was petite, like many of the other victims, just under 5 feet tall and about 100 pounds. And as with the others whom Mr. Rifkin is accused of killing, a memento found in his room -- in this case, a driver's license -- helped police to discover the apparent connection to Ms. Ovierto's death.

HEADLINE: Base Closings Less Painful Than Feared

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
It was a disaster waiting to happen. For a region already mired deep in recession, the Government's plan to aggressively shut down military bases seemed certain to shower more economic distress on New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
But by Friday, when President Clinton said he would support the recommendations of a Presidential commission to close 35 major bases across the nation, and sharply scale back others, some of the gloom in the New York region had begun to lift. 
 Compared with several states -- particularly California, Florida and Virginia -- job losses from the base closings in the New York region would be modest. And where the region's military installations are to close, on Staten Island and near New York's border with Canada, experts say there are promising alternatives in private development and business activity.
To be sure, the political storm has yet to subside. In a region whose three states routinely engage in fierce competition for jobs, New York has emerged a clear loser.
In New York City, Mayor David N. Dinkins condemned the base closing recommendations as an example of "homestate favoritism." He charged that New York State bases were unfairly targeted in favor of those in New Jersey because of the influence of James A. Courter, the former New Jersey congressman who presided over the panel, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
Others in New York may feel the heat of political embarrassment. One is Representative Susan Molinari, the Congresswoman from Staten Island, which is losing one of the Navy's most modern installations. Another is Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who angered many last week by blaming the state's losses on bickering between local officials in Plattsburgh and Rome, where Air Force bases are to close or to be scaled back.
But amid the exchange of recriminations, many people say the region fared better than they expected.
"The mood here has been awfully bad for a long time, but maybe now things are turning around," said Mark Wolman, a building contractor in Waterford, Conn., one of the thousands of business people across the region whose prosperity is closely tied to the military.
His company is situated near one of the biggest, and most unexpected winners -- the Navy submarine base at New London. The plan backed by President Clinton not only reverses the Pentagon's recommendation to close the base, it expands base operations with additional training facilities and $100 million in construction by civilian contractors.
 
Mix of Gains and Losses
 Elsewhere in the region, there is a mix of gains and losses. McGuire Air Force Base in central New Jersey had been among the Pentagon's targets for closing; instead, under the President's plan, it would be expanded.
Some of the bad news was as much of a surprise as the good. In northern New York State, Plattsburgh Air Force Base, recommended as a survivor by the Pentagon, is to close under the commission plan, eliminating 2,850 jobs. Operations at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome are to be sharply cut back.
But experts say that, in contrast to many bases elsewhere -- isolated outposts in deserts and remote rural areas -- those in the New York region have long been considered attractive locations for nonmilitary development. And some business people and economists maintain that "defense conversion" may as well get started now instead of later in the decade.
"We have a realistic opportunity to come out bigger and better and stronger," said Mark Barie, a business consultant and president of the Chamber of Commerce in Plattsburgh. The reason: Plattsurgh is close to the Canadian border, and might, like other cities nearby, attract several Canadian companies to the offices, distribution facilities and real estate to be vacated by the Air Force.
 
'Plenty of Negotiating Room'
 In Rome, officials say they might try to lure European aircraft manufacturers to the vacated areas of Griffiss Air Force Base.
"We are left with a tremendous amount of industrial capacity, and plenty of negotiating room," said Fred Tillman, a stockbroker in Rome, where the Griffiss work force, now 6,400 people, is to be reduced to 1,500.
The base closure commission's plan calls for the B-52 bombers now stationed at Griffiss to be sent elsewhere. All that would remain of the base is the Rome Laboratories, an intelligence research center.
Mr. Tillman, a retired Air Force colonel and former commander of the base, said the plan leaves ample opportunity for converting the vast B-52 hangars on the base, its maintenance shops and other facilities to civilian use.
"We can market these facilities around the world," he said, adding that potential buyers include commercial aircraft manufacturers in Europe who are seeking a United States base of operations.
 
Moving the Coast Guard
 In New York City, where the Navy's Staten Island Homeport is to close, the economic advisors to Mayor Dinkins say they might try to persuade the Coast Guard to move to the abandoned installation from Governors Island, freeing that strikingly scenic piece of New York Harbor real estate for a park, new housing or other development.
The idea was raised at a news conference last week by Representative Molinari, the Staten Island Republican, who said that a group would try to meet with the Transportation Secretary, Federico F. Pena, later this month. The Coast Guard is part of the Transportation Department, and the plan would involve moving nine cutters and 2,800 Coast Guard and civilian employees.
Another suggestion, from Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat whose district includes Governors Island, would make the Homeport part of a larger container shipping port on Staten Island and in Brooklyn.
 
Connecticut Benefits Most
 It is Connecticut that stands to benefit most, not only by the commission's recommendation to retain and expand the New London submarine facility, but by other welcome reversals in its huge aerospace and military industries in recent weeks.
"We know that defense is a declining industry, and it will continue to decline," said William A. McEachern, an economist at the University of Connecticut. "But it is refreshing to have some good news to talk about."
Federal studies show that 6.5 percent of Connecticut's civilian work force depends on defense contracts for its livelihood. By that measure, the state follows only Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia in its economic ties to the military.
In late June, the state was spared huge cuts by one of its largest aerospace concerns, Pratt & Whitney, which is shifting the focus of its jet engine manufacturing from the military to commercial aircraft.
With a promise of huge tax incentives from the state, Pratt & Whitney on June 23 won deep wage and work rule concessions from its biggest union and agreed not to shut down its biggest jet engine plant, in East Hartford. The agreement averted the loss of 2,000 jobs, which the company had said it would move to other plants in Maine and Georgia.
 
Good News in Groton
 Another corporate centerpiece in Connecticut, still reliant on military spending, is the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics Corporation, which manufactures submarines for the Navy in Groton. The company has cut its work force deeply over the last five years.
But over the last month, strong evidence has surfaced in Washington that the company's submarine yards in Groton will not be abandoned by the Navy. Electric Boat officials said last week that they had been informed by the Pentagon that their company was the leading contender for a contract to assemble the only new submarine the Navy plans to acquire in the next five years.
If the contract is won by General Dynamics, it would mean that the company would be well positioned to bid on a future generation of Navy submarines, which the Pentagon plans to begin ordering in 1998.
Even amid the good news for Connecticut, analysts cautioned that the state's reliance on military contracts will continue to make it vulnerable to economic setbacks, because further reductions in defense spending are expected for a decade or more. Indeed, Congress will required to review the nation's inventory of bases again in 1995 and make more cuts.
The recommendations endorsed by the President "are a plus" for the region, said Gary L. Ciminero, chief economist for the Fleet Financial Group, a bank holding company with operations in New York and Connecticut.
"But we are swimming upstream," he added. "The question remains how long it will take for the basic minuses of our dependence on the military to catch up with us, and we see more shrinkage."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The article contributed (perhaps unwittingly) to the feelings of hostility and resentment on the part of white males against African-Americans, women and other groups whose economic opportunities have been historically limited because of racism, sexism and other isms that seek to legitimize hatred and bigotry. 
 The article states in part: "Efforts by companies to hire more minorities and women, often at the expense of white males . . . " (emphasis added). This characterization of societal attempts at ensuring equal opportunities is in itself a perpetuation of damaging stereotypes. It presupposes that whatever job or career opportunities exist are the province of white males and that anyone else who is placed in these jobs is encroaching on a property right of white males.

HEADLINE: When Getting There Isn't Half the Fun

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER

 BODY:
MORE vacationers will be traveling on Connecticut's highways and back roads this summer than last, but with construction scheduled or already in progress on most of the state's major highways, how will motorists get from one place to another?
 "Very slowly. Cautiously," said an engineer with the State Transportation Department, Thomas Mangan. 
Automobile travel, which will account for 82 percent of all summer vacation trips nationwide, is expected to increase 6 percent from last year, according to the American Automobile Association. And Connecticut will undoubtedly reflect the national trend, said a spokeswoman for the Connecticut club, Annette Cormany.
 
Not Merely a Place to Pass Through
 Now that Connecticut is being promoted as a destination for tourists --rather than merely a place to pass through on the way to Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- groups like the Mystic Coast and Country Travel and Leisure Council have been meeting with transportation officials and legislators to stress the need to keep highways open during peak travel times and to schedule construction during the off season, said the council's director, Lou Camerota.
 The Transportation Department has assured the council that whenever possible, road work will be done outside rush hours and other periods of heavy traffic.
 "It's an educational issue that we're facing now," Mr. Camerota said. "Granted there are job contracts let out that we had no influence over. But for the future, we just want to sensitize the department to work with tourism. Whenever possible, the department has to be responsible to the economy." The Transportation Department notifies newspapers and radio stations before construction jobs are begun so that drivers can plan alternate routes, Mr. Mangan said.
 The list of improvements being undertaken this summer on both Interstate highways and state roads is lengthy. On Interstate 95 between Greenwich and Branford, for example, about 25 projects -- from bridge replacement to installation of lighting and noise barriers -- will be going on through November, said a department engineer, Paul Breen.
 The new Baldwin Bridge in Old Saybrook, which was opened in late May, should relieve weekend traffic along the shoreline. But additional work -- removal of sections of temporary roadway -- may cause minor disruptions throughout the summer, said a supervising engineer, Nicholas Rutherford.
 Work on the Gold Star Memorial Bridge over the Thames River in New London is expected to cause some weekend congestion, Mr. Rutherford added. "Based on what we have seen in the past, I would envision on Friday nights and Sunday nights some backups in New London because of the reduction in lanes on the bridge."
 Two projects involving resurfacing and safety improvements are planned on Interstate 395 between Exit 87, near Plainfield, and the Massachusetts state line. While the work is not expected to affect weekend travel, Mr. Rutherford said, there may be only one lane open in each direction for as much as a mile on weekdays. Interstate 395 is used to bypass New London on the way to Boston, Maine and northern shore points in Massachusetts.
 Most of Route 8 and Interstate 84 will be under repair, said another engineer, Peter Curcio. Travelers from New York State frequently take Interstate 84 to Boston or the Rhode Island beaches, and Route 8 is a major north-south road that extends from Bridgeport into Massachusetts.
 
Back Roads Vs. Highways
 Motorists who shun the major highways in favor of the more scenic back roads may meet up with construction on any of 28 to 30 bridges in towns from Ansonia and Avon to Canaan and Kent. Seven of the projects are on Route 7, which originates in Norwalk and extends north into Massachusetts and Vermont.
 "I have worked for the state for 31 years. We built a lot of roads but didn't do much to repair what was there. It has got to be done. Unfortunately, everything is being done at one time now," Mr. Curcio said.
 Officials of the Transportation Department listed other projects as well.
 * In Hartford, work on the interchange south of Interstate 91 and Interstate 84 near Founders Bridge. The project involves lowering the southbound lanes of Interstate 91 and rebuilding the bridge, which spans the Connecticut River.
 * Rebuilding the interchange at Interstate 91 and Route 3.
 * Building an interchange at Interstate 84 and Route 291 in the Manchester area.
 * Building a platform over Interstate 84 between Trumbull and Main Streets in downtown Hartford.
 * Repairing and resurfacing on Interstate 84 from Tolland to Union.
 * Repairing and resurfacing on Interstate 384 from East Hartford to Bolton.
 * Repairing roads and bridges on Interstate 91 from the south end of Hartford to Wethersfield.
 In addition, pavement markings, generally one- or two-day jobs in each location, will be done on most of the state's roads.
 Mr. Mangan said the Transportation Department tries to send out notice of road projects two weeks before the starting date. "That has softened a lot of the complaints," he said.
 Travel counselors in the Connecticut motor club's office in Branford said they, too, are given information about construction sites on the state roads and mark those places on the routes they map out for their clients. They also try not to send traffic through small towns, said Constance Chieppo, the office manager. "There are little-town folks who don't want 90 million people going through their town."
 
Three-Day Trips
 Mrs. Chieppo said people are staying at home and taking two- or three-day tours rather than longer trips. "We're going to see a lot more motor traffic than last year."
 Whether to sit in a line of traffic at a construction site or head for one of the back roads is a matter of choice, Mrs. Chieppo added, and travel counselors leave the final decision up to their clients. "Some people don't mind sitting in traffic. Sometimes you're better off doing that than going on a two-lane highway where the traffic is stop-and-go."
 Edward Dombroskas, director of the tourism division of the State Department of Economic Development, said his office has worked out a communications system with transportation officials and local groups promoting tourism so that problems concerning travel are resolved quickly. Some road work will be done at night rather than during the day and, depending on the type of project, work hours may be split to keep roads open during heavy traffic.
 Meanwhile, Mrs. Hoffman said Mystic will attract tourists in spite of the orange cones and Jersey barriers on the highway. "We will wind up with the same number of visitors. They just might be more frazzled."

Transforming a Rundown Lake Shoreline

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
HIGH-TECH and research companies are transforming a neglected industrial area on the southern shores of a 6,718-acre lake a mile north of the downtown into a desirable workplace.
One of them, the fast-growing ZymoGenetics, planning to expand its biomedical research, is spending $25 million to restore the landmark Lake Union Steam Plant, Seattle City Light's first powerhouse, which produced electricity until 1983. 
 Bruce Carter, the company's president, said he had chosen the Lake Union area so he could collaborate easily with scientists at the University of Washington and the downtown medical community.
ZymoGenetics was founded in 1981 by university faculty members. Its parent company, Novo Nordisk, the Copenhagen pharmaceutical giant, depends on its subsidiary for research that will lead to developing such products as genetically engineered insulin.
"We have someone from the university in our facilities every day," said Dr. Carter. "It's important that we be close by."
The university, homes and houseboats line Lake Union's northern shore and Portage Bay, part of the lake's seven-mile perimeter. A few blocks east is Interstate 5; to the west, mansions and condominiums perch high above the shoreline on the steep slopes of Queen Anne Hill. Just beyond the lake's west shore the landmark Space Needle caps the skyline overlooking ferries plying Puget Sound.
Until recently, locating on the southern shore of Lake Union would have been unthinkable. The lake view was blocked by large moored ships. Factories sprawled along the water, among them a large cement plant that sent plumes of dust into the air and dumped slurry into the water. In the early 80's dilapidated buildings were everywhere.
"The place was a mess," said Richard Wagner, an architect who was one of the first to see the lake's potential. "The old-time businesses, including an asphalt plant and glass factory, were dying or outgrowing the area."
But in the mid-80's the ships began finding other moorings, factories pulled up stakes and developers moved in, tearing down dilapidated buildings.
Mr. Wagner has since built the Center for Wooden Boats, which rents turn-of-the-century wooden sailing boats to tourists.
Restaurants were among the first wave of new businesses to come in in the last 10 years. Bill Schwartz, president of Schwartz Brothers Restaurants, has opened three, including two in Chandlers Cove, a retail development that now occupies the cement factory land.
"We own 16 restaurants and I think Lake Union is our best location in Seattle today," he said. "It's close to the downtown, parking and the freeway."
Inn Ventures Inc. of Seattle was attracted by the restaurants and in 1991 opened a Marriott Residence Inn. "Building a residential hotel on a lake is like having a mini-resort in the middle of the downtown," said Denise Books, regional manager for Inn Ventures.
ZymoGenetics, now in the university district about four blocks northeast of Lake Union, was one of the companies Marriott was targeting. "We go after the high-tech companies because visiting scientists will need a place to stay while working on projects for two to three months," Mrs. Books said.
Companies then started to expand by the lake. Cellular One opened its headquarters nearby and a Seattle software company, Walker Richer & Quinn, is moving in soon.
MR. CARTER was searching for a Lake Union site when a developer, William Justen, of the local Koll Company, took him to see the powerhouse, which Mr. Justen had bought in 1991 and had planned to convert into a $21-million condominium. A lack of financing forced him to abandon that plan.
Mr. Carter was immediately interested. "It was desolate, with its ornate windows broken out," he said. "Yet with its interior support columns it looked like a European cathedral at the end of World War II. I saw that it could be transformed."
The 90-foot-long, 316-foot-wide building is a designated landmark, so architectural restoration, by Daly & Associates of Seattle, will follow guidelines of the Seattle Landmark Preservation Board. Koll, which still owns the land, is directing the development.
Interior design, by NBBJ Architects of Seattle, will put lab areas and offices for scientists along the lakeside walls of the building to take advantage of sweeping water views. When work is completed in 1994, the five-story building will have 113,000 square feet of usable space, plus basement parking for 190 cars.
Another reason for the interest of ZymoGenetics in the site was that the $83-million, 300,000-square-foot Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center was being built just down the block by a joint venture of Koll Construction and Baugh Construction of Seattle; the first phase is complete and it eventually will occupy 10 acres embracing 42 separate parcels that Mr. Justen had amassed for Koll.
The cancer center was growing rapidly and occupied 12 scattered buildings, most in a medical-complex area on the eastern edge of downtown. Karen Lane, the senior vice president of development for the cancer center, said, "We have close connections with Swedish Hospital downtown and the university and wanted a place in between. Our researchers needed to be in one building where they can interact."
City Councilman Jim Street, who played a key role in helping ZymoGenetics get the zoning changed from industrial to industrial/ commercial -- to provide for research and development -- said he believed that it and Fred Hutchison would be the anchors to attract other biotech companies to the south lake area. Selling industrial expansion in the south lake area to local residents was not easy. But after several public meetings -- and ZymoGenetic's promise to build a floating public walkway and dock suitable for kayaks and canoes -- opposition abated and the project moved forward.
On a recent "wharf rat's boat tour" of the lake, Paul Marlow, an associate at the Wooden Boat Center, said it was apparent that marinas were popping up as part of the new development.
"New moorage is important to many people who do not want to see traditional marine business disappear," said Mr. Marlow. The restaurants and new property owners are adding berths for yachts to the ends of their properties to defray costs and to provide badly needed space for boats.
SOME traditional uses will continue, too. The Lake Union Dry Dock, next to ZymoGenetics's property, still repairs ships. Nearby, large fishing vessels are at anchor, waiting for the season to resume in mid-July. And a fleet of ancient mothballed tugs -- whose owner, worried that they'll be used by a competitor, won't sell -- is berthed there.
Another proposed development, Seattle Commons, now in the conceptual stage, is sparking interest in the area. The Commons, to be built by the city, would be an 85-acre greenbelt stretching the dozen blocks between Lake Union and the northern end of the downtown in a three-block-wide swath. A community plan is in the works that would flank the park with residential, office and commercial projects to be built by many developers.
Joel Horn, the project director, said the idea was "to create an urban village where people could live, play and walk or bicycle to work and not need cars." Many of the companies are expected to be biomedical and high-tech.
Parking lots occupy about 45 percent of this space today and low-rise warehouses and stores account for the rest. The Commons is starting to acquire parcels through a $20-million "seed money" loan from Paul Allen, one of the founders of Microsoft, based in nearby Redmond, that will be repaid by the city. Says Mr. Horn, "we've been buying up land like crazy at low prices."

HEADLINE: New Rochelle's Fear: Sidetracked by Amtrak

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
AS Amtrak proceeds with plans to develop its Northeast Corridor for high-speed service between New York City and Boston, officials here fear that plans to revitalize the city's struggling downtown may get sidetracked in the name of progress.
For Amtrak, the stop at the busy station here, which it shares with Metro-North Commuter Railroad, has become a scheduling nightmare, a bottleneck at which trains meet frequent delays and Amtrak engineers often have to negotiate complicated track crossovers with Metro-North before continuing to the next destination. 
 Amtrak -- a private corporation that gets about 20 percent of its budget from the Federal Government and is under a Congressional mandate to operate the country's intercity rail passenger service -- wants to build a new station at Nardozzi Place, about two miles away in the southwest section of the city.
 
Trip of Under Three Hours Sought
 The railroad hopes to triple the number of trains it runs between New York and Boston and shorten the time for the express run. Its eventual goal is to reduce the express trip from four hours to less than three, and it hopes to achieve the time reduction with a series of measures.
Those measures include electrifying the system from New Haven to Boston and reconfiguring tracks in New Haven and New Rochelle. That would in turn allow the use of high-speed trains.
An important element of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor High-Speed Rail Improvement Project for its New York-to-Boston run is shaving time off the stop at New Rochelle.
The railroad's plans, however, may not be in the city's best interests, at least the way Mayor Timothy C. Idoni sees it. "Amtrak may be trying to save two or three minutes," he said, "but we're trying to save a city."
The proposal to reroute Amtrak traffic would divert travelers and therefore spending power -- what some city planners call "a critical mass of bodies" -- away from the downtown business district.
A city that has lost several large department stores -- Macy's last year and Bloomingdale's and Arnold Constable in the 1970's -- and has seen its major business district fall into decline as a result, must now call a halt to the exodus of "revenue-generating enterprises," the Mayor said.
The Appropriations Committee of the United States House of Representatives last week directed Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, to find a way to update the current station to meet its growing needs rather than move elsewhere.
Representative Nita M. Lowey, a member of the Appropriations Committee and a Democrat from New York's 18th District, which includes New Rochelle, said: "If they move, it's going to be another blow for New Rochelle. We're not asking Amtrak to do the impossible. We're just saying, slow down and think this through."
Planners here have described New Rochelle as a typical "Main Street, U.S.A.," a downtown area of city streets with small and medium-size retail stores that lost out in recent years to the development of larger regional shopping centers.
 
Business Siphoned Off
 "What cities faced across the country, especially during the recession, happened in New Rochelle also," said Joseph G. Madonna, the city's Commissioner of Development. "Now we're trying hard to make a comeback."
In Westchester, a number of major department stores have located in White Plains, where plans are underway to expand several shopping malls and bring in yet more department stores. Also, many discount outlets and smaller chain stores are situated in strip malls along Central Park Avenue, which cuts a north-to-south swath through the center of the county from White Plains to Yonkers. Both types of shopping areas have drawn business away from older city centers.
In New Rochelle, at the downtown mall where Macy's was the key anchor, the number of retail stores has dropped from 64 to 50 since Macy's left last summer, and the merchants who are still there "are struggling along" to stay in business, Mayor Idoni said.
Now a proposal by a developer to build a multiplex movie theater and an ice-skating rink there and bring in a Bradlee's department store where Macy's once was could turn that around, the Mayor said.
 
Haven From Terrorists
 Also, the city is negotiating with Unicef to place its headquarters on Huguenot Street, also in the downtown area. If New Rochelle's proposal is accepted, the United Nations would build a 440,000-square-foot office building for Unicef. There has been discussion, too, of plans to locate an international conference center and other United Nations agencies here.
In light of the discovery last month of terrorist plans to bomb United Nations headquarters in New York, along with other buildings, Mayor Idoni suggested that a new high-security building outside of Manhattan, but still within a 25-minute train commute, would be an advantage to the agency. Unicef is expected to choose between plans offered by New Rochelle and New York City by late summer.
Also, city officials said that a New York City developer is considering a two-acre parcel of land near the proposed Unicef site for an apartment building that could house United Nations workers.
Mr. Madonna explained that city leaders here are attempting to put together a number of revitalization projects for this city of 67,265 residents. "Hopefully," the Commissioner said, "we're on the verge of some major development breakthroughs."
 
Convenience a Factor
 Anticipating increased parking needs, the city has proposed building a 1,000-space garage next to the Depot Place station with spaces set aside for Amtrak riders. Construction of the garage would be paid for with a combination of Federal, private and local funds. A bus depot and centralized taxi stand would be situated there also, making the Depot Place location what planners call an "intermodal station."
In addition to the city, Metro-North representatives say they, too, have a vested interest in keeping Amtrak where it is.
"The whole idea is to make everything as convenient as possible for the traveler," said Daniel Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North, which is a division of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a public corporation run by the state. "We call it seamless mass transportation. It keeps passengers using trains and thinking trains because everything is accessible and interconnected."
But Amtrak officials are frustrated by the current setup at the train station here, explaining that two of its tracks from Pennsylvania Station converge with four Metro-North tracks from Grand Central Terminal, and Amtrak trains are restricted to a speed limit of 15 miles an hour at the interlocking point. Also, Amtrak trains bound for New York must cross three sets of Metro-North tracks before getting on their southbound line.
 
Planning for the Year 2030
 Amtrak, which operates passenger service in 45 states and covers 25,000 route miles, wants to build its own station on land it owns on Nardozzi Place and increase the number of its trains that travel through New Rochelle each day from 30 to 68. It also hopes to more than double the number of riders getting on or off at New Rochelle on the New York-to-Boston run to 170,000 from 80,000.
"We're not just looking at the year 2010," said David J. Carol, project director for Amtrak's high-speed rail improvement program. "We're trying to plan for the year 2030 and beyond."
The program calls for construction of a $60 million flyover, a bridge that would elevate Amtrak's tracks above Metro-North's in New Rochelle and allow passengers to board and disembark at the Nardozzi Place station.
For those 500 Amtrak passengers a day who are projected to get on or off at Nardozzi Place, the rail company cites the convenience of shopping at the new location, where the Home Depot -- a building supply and home-improvement chain -- intends to build a 164,000-square-foot retail outlet and garden center and where a shoppers'-club store may be locating.
 
'Very Little Interchange'
 But New Rochelle leaders, among them Mr. Madonna, dispute that argument. "Who would take the train to buy a sink or lumber?" he said. "That's the kind of store one drives to."
Opponents of Amtrak's plan also say that Westchester travelers bound for Washington or Philadelphia would no longer have the convenience of boarding a Metro-North train in Rye, for example, and switching to an Amtrak train in New Rochelle. They would have to take the Metro-North train to Grand Central Terminal and then take the subway or a bus or a taxi to Pennsylvania Station to pick up an Amtrak train.
But R. Clifford Black, director of public affairs for Amtrak, said that New Rochelle is considered an area of "very little interchange," with only 1 percent of the 80,000 passengers a year who get on or off the Amtrak line at that stop actually transferring to other trains.
Upgrading the current station at Depot Place would entail separating some tracks and constructing a center island to be shared by Metro-North and Amtrak.
Both plans, upgrading Depot Place or building a new station, would cost $66 million, Amtrak officials estimated.
Ms. Lowey said that the Appropriations Committee has directed Amtrak and Metro-North "to work together to find a solution that meets New Rochelle's needs while expanding Amtrak's service."
Amtrak and Metro-North have agreed to report back to the Appropriations Committee in August on their conclusions about using the present station.

HEADLINE: Broad Strokes Revive Interest in Whales

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
SPERM whales made New London famous 150 years ago. Sailing vessels returned to the southeastern Connecticut port on a regular basis, their holds filled with oil that had been rendered from the behemoths of the sea. Now, city officials are hoping that sperm whales will make the city famous again, but in a different way.
 The environmental artist known simply as Wyland will be in New London from Tuesday to next Monday to paint a mural on the 220-by-25-foot-wall of a building that faces Eugene O'Neill Drive. The stop in New London is part of his four-month tour of the East Coast to paint whaling walls, as these depictions of cetaceans are known. His tour will take in 17 cities in 16 states. Florida will be the only state to get two of the walls, one in Sarasota and one in Key West. 
The artist's whaling walls -- there will be 50 around the world by the time the summer's tour is finished -- show various species of whales and dolphins painted life-size with an airbrush. Wyland works from 8 A.M. until dusk, and finishes them in a week.
 
'Like a Science Project'
 "By painting them life size, you really get your audience to appreciate them," Wyland said. "The kids go up and measure themselves against the whales, and really get them into perspective. It's like a science project for a lot of these kids."
 In every city where he paints, children congregate around his project, peppering him with questions about marine mammals and his painting techniques. People are often amazed he can finish his murals, which always take up thousands of square feet, because he takes time out to answer the youngsters' questions.
 "They know so much about marine sciences already, it's amazing," Wyland said. "And that's what we need, to encourage that kind of study, because the better they understand the oceans the more they're going to be committed to saving them."
 In New London Wyland will paint his life-size mural on the wall of the American Discount Store, at the corner of Eugene O'Neill Drive and State Street, one of the busiest intersections in the city.
 
Official State Animal
 "It's not the largest wall on the tour, but it's large enough to do some sperm whales, which is appropriate since it's the official state animal," said Wyland, who 36 years ago was born Robert Thomas Wyland, but had his name legally changed to just Wyland.
 Ezra E. Shalam, one of the principals of American Discount Stores, said he was a bit wary when he was approached by city officials about allowing someone to paint an environmental art mural on his building. Then he saw a video of Wyland's work, and a folder of his paintings. "After I saw that, I was convinced. His work is outstanding, incredible," Mr. Shalam said. "We believe in downtown New London, and we're delighted to be part of this."
 Wyland said he chose New London at the request of Dr. Robbins Barstow of Wethersfield, director emeritus of the Cetacean Society International. Dr. Barstow was one of the chief lobbyists to name the sperm whale as the state animal in 1972, despite an early lead by advocates of the white-tailed deer.
 Dr. Barstow said he and his wife were in Hawaii in 1988 and saw a humpback whale mural Wyland had done. "At that time, it was the largest mural in the world," Dr. Barstow said. "We were tremendously impressed."
 
Symbol of Transition
 Dr. Barstow said in 1989, while attending the meeting of the International Whaling Commission in San Diego, he ran into Wyland again. The artist was part of a crowd of protestors outside the meeting, and Dr. Barstow asked him to come to Connecticut. When he found out about the East Coast tour he called New London officials and put into motion plans to get the mural painted in that city. "We're trying to symbolize the transition from whale killing to whale watching and whale conservation," Dr. Barstow said.
 "New London used to be known as the whaling city," he said. "More ships went out of New London in the 1840s looking for whales than any other port except New Bedford. And there were more whaling millionaires in New London than in any other city in the country."
 
Maritime Theme Festival
 New London officials are pleased that Wyland has chosen that city for one of his murals, particularly because Wyland's visit will take place the same time as Sail Fest, the city's annual maritime theme festival.
 The economic development coordinator for New London, Philip N. Biondo, said that as many as 250,000 people visit the city during Sail Fest, and he hopes the number will increase this year because of the mural. "It can't be anything but positive in terms of bringing people to New London," he said, "and hopefully, they'll come to see the whaling wall and stay to see the rest of the city. We need to do more to emphasize our maritime heritage,"
 New London public works crews will clean the wall, and apply some sealer and primer donated by local companies. The Holiday Inn, Radisson and Lighthouse Inn in New London have all offered rooms to Wyland and his entourage. Other businesses are offering anything else the crew will need. "A lot of the downtown merchants are very excited about it," Mr. Biondo said. "It'll help bring people in, but it will also make the downtown more beautiful, and it will foster more environmental awareness."
 
'New Artistic Dimension'
 "It's going to add a whole new artistic dimension to the downtown, and extend what the city is trying to do in terms of promoting New London's maritime heritage," said Michael H. Lamperelli, director of the Marine Commerce and Development Commission, which works to promote New London.
 During Sail Fest the city will also have a 62-foot painting of Prince William Sound on loan from the Governor of Alaska, and other environmental and maritime art, Mr. Lamperelli said. But the whaling mural will be the centerpiece of the display, he noted, and it should last for many years -- one of ocean waves painted a few hundred feet away has lasted since the mid-1970s, he said.
 "More than anything it's going to create an uplifted image for the downtown," Mr. Lamperelli said. "It's beginning to look more like a historic port, with the work the city has done like putting the utilities underground and installing some old-fashioned street lamps, and this is going to advance that."
 Mr. Lamperelli said also during Sail Fest, the city will have a living history program including a whaling sailor from Mystic Seaport, at the Nathan Hale Schoolhouse, which is on State Street within sight of where the wall will be painted.
 
Today's Thinking
 "Things change," Mr. Lamperelli said. "The whaling trade in New London was never intended to hurt the whales. People thought the supply was endless. Our area has been very environmentally conscious, doing what it can to clean up the Thames River and clean up Long Island Sound. I think having the whaling wall in New London is very much in line with today's thinking."
 Wyland agreed that there is no irony in the fact that one of his walls, which are dedicated to preservation and protection of whales, will be in a city once renowned for killing whales.
 "The present is different," Wyland said. "People are interested in saving the whales today. At that time there was a lot of whaling, because they were seen as a product. Today they're a thing of beauty that is worthy of protection."
 Wyland noted that he did four whaling walls in Japan, where boats are still whaling in the name of research. His first wall there was in 1987 on a wall visible from Tokyo Bay, and now boats are embarking from the bay on whale-watching excursions, and people are starting to talk about eliminating whaling.
 "It's a small movement, but it's happening," Wyland said. "If we just keep reinforcing that the whales are important as living creatures, even the older people will get it."
 "There's probably more money now in whale watching than there ever was in whaling," he added.
 Wyland said his first view of whales came in 1971, when he saw them migrating off California. Wyland attended art classes at Motown's Center for Creative Studies from 1975 to 1979, and found his niche in the early 1980s when he began painting the animals that so impressed him.
 Today Wyland and his galleries employ 200 people, and his paintings can sell for more than $100,000. But he gives the murals to the cities where he paints them, and many people say they are his finest work. People who have seen his walls often comment on how lifelike the creatures look, particularly their eyes, which seem to have the depth and soul of real whales.
 
Capturing the Spirit
 "I try to capture the spirit of the animal," Wyland said. "If people see the beauty in nature, they'll work hard to preserve it."
 Wyland said while Dr. Barstow encouraged him to choose New London for his Connecticut mural, his first meeting with New London officials convinced him that it should be there.
 "There's extraordinary support wherever I go, and it keeps me real pumped up," Wyland said. "But there's no other city on the tour that's more enthusiastic than New London. If I have that kind of support and commitment, I'm going to do it."

HEADLINE: Traveling Close, Very Close, to Home

BYLINE: By SUZANNE BERNE; SUZANNE BERNE writes often about travel.

 BODY:
THE first time I realized that it was possible to travel at home, I was 6 years old and standing in the linen closet of a rented house on Cape Cod. It was an old drafty house by a bay, full of camphor-smelling eaves and corners and unexpected doorways, and one foggy afternoon I slunk about the shadowy upstairs picturing myself in the Black Forest. My grandfather had been to the Black Forest, and from his description I envisioned a mossy, Grimm's-fairy-tale sort of place, not so different from the dark upper hall with its peeling fern-colored wallpaper. That afternoon it had taken me an hour to reach the linen closet, which served as a remote Bavarian castle, and by the time I finally arrived after hiking through the hallway I was worn out. When my mother found me recovering by the pillowcases a few minutes later she asked what I'd been doing, and I told her: "Traveling." She seemed to accept this statement at face value and, from that moment on, so did I.
What I discovered from those foggy afternoons was that home can be a wide and varied place, and that a person may be a seasoned traveler without necessarily leaving the backyard. While some believe traveling means going far away -- imagining that a trip to Bangkok is travel while a trip to the park is not -- others recognize that travel, like relaxation, is mostly a state of mind. The wanderer wanders wherever he is. Naturally, the inverse must also be true. Just as some people can't relax, some cannot travel, no matter where they find themselves. Look at the commuter who drives 75 miles a day, then says he hasn't gone anywhere in months. Or the business person who flies to Rome and then never leaves her hotel. And what about the delicate soul who ventures forth only when the weather is clement, the accommodations posh, the sights acclaimed -- is this travel, or resting away from home? 
 Travel, in my opinion, is one part locomotion and three parts the desire for discovery. It should set the mind going. Which is why a stroll around the block can be as invigorating a journey for the determined discoverer as a junket around the globe. To know one place well is to travel deeply, continuously. To know one place altogether is impossible; it can take a lifetime, after all, to navigate an acre if you proceed inch by inch. Not that most of us will ever roam that closely, but the opportunity is there. Consider Emily Dickinson, who rarely left her house and yet traveled so extensively inside of it that critics are still retracing her footsteps. A poem about one of her adventures begins:
 
 I started early, took my dog,
 And visited the sea;
 The mermaids in the basement
 Came out to look at me.
Dickinson is, perhaps, an extremist, the domestic equivalent of Marco Polo. Yet one doesn't have to be a recluse to voyage at home. While he lived at Walden Pond, Henry David Thoreau treated his visits to nearby Concord Village as if they were brief sojourns on the Continent. "It was very pleasant," he notes, "when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor . . . for my snug harbor in the woods." He called the scatter of ponds around Concord "my lake country," and there he wandered, viewing the flora and fauna, keeping a record of strange sights, his Grand Tour on the banks of Walden. One afternoon he might watch ants battle by his woodpile, emerging as shaken and excited as any foreign war correspondent; the next he might sit by the railroad tracks, sniffing the cinder-struck air, musing on the vagaries of international commerce based on a whiff of salt fish. "I have traveled much in Concord," he observed, and it's hard to think of anyone who has ventured farther.
Some of the most stirring travel accounts I've ever read, in fact, have been written by people who stayed right at home. Aldo Leopold's "A Sand County Almanac," his description of 12 months on a Wisconsin sand farm, treats each season as its own location, with its own particular attractions, citizenry and customs. He pays special attention to the trees he encounters on his rambles, and reports the startling news that, "There is much small-talk and neighborhood gossip among pines," surely as intriguing a bit of information as anything in Frommer's.
A quarter of a century later, Annie Dillard describes her exploration of one "rather tamed valley" in Virginia with a gusto that makes Lewis and Clark seem timid. "It's all a matter of keeping my eyes open," she writes in "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek." And so she turns a morning's saunter into a trek, with starlings, frogs and praying mantis egg cases crowding her rural landscape like so many exotic acquaintances. "I would like to know grasses and sedges -- and care," reflects Dillard. "Then my least journey into the world would be a field trip." Once while crouching on a log she became so bedazzled by a spot of Tinker Creek that she fell in.
Keeping one's eyes open, occasionally falling in astonishment into a creek or a gutter, obliges one to recall that adventure happens in small places as well as large. "I explore the neighborhood," declares Annie Dillard, with the same passion Columbus must have felt when coming upon the New World. At heart, an expedition is no more than a trip undertaken to see or do something -- and what that something is usually matters less than the spirit in which the trip is made. Which is not to say that journeys to France and Peru and the Grand Canyon aren't wonderful, or that everyone should stay at home all the time. Only that where one lives should be treated with the same inquisitiveness as anywhere one might go.
IN my own case, although I no longer travel by way of linen closets, I do wander locally for most of my excitement. This has a bit to do with economic considerations, but even more to do with my conviction that if a second look reveals more than the first, then a daily look will reveal something new every time. So I take the same route on my afternoon walks, examining the houses I pass with clinical interest, noting a new garage door here, a bed of pansies there, admiring a weathervane, trying my best to comprehend the inhabitants through their domiciles much as de Tocqueville sought to comprehend America through its politics. To hear another language, I traipse down to the Armenian markets not far from my house and listen to the clerks yell over vat-sized bowls of olives. When I am feeling especially venturesome, I climb into the car and drive to a nearby meadow that has a few wild animals, a sketchy stream and a cool fringe of oak forest. These are places I have come to love partly because they are familiar, but mostly because I've learned to see them in detail.
Of course, noting detail enlivens travel afar as well as at home. Last summer, I visited friends on Deer Isle, a chip of an island off the coast of northern Maine. Half swallowed by pine trees, their cottage perched on a rocky spur overlooking a scatter of smaller islands and beyond, the sea. At night we sat on their porch, watching the sun set over the water, feeling those black pines close in behind us, admiring and dreading the moment when the sun slipped past the brim of the world and left us alone in the dark. On those nights I couldn't help thinking of earlier residents in this lonely place, especially the fishermen's wives. So often solitary, an ocean at their doorsteps, trees at their backs, those women must have braced for the evenings, watching the same light vanishing. How far they must have traveled. Because it seems to me, finally, that travel truly lies in yearning, the outward gaze that lends one the hope that anything may still happen, that there is so much yet to see.

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley is a professor of American history at Columbia University. He is the author, most recently, of "The Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People."

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON'S political fortunes have fluctuated as wildly and rapidly as those of any President in recent history. In the 1992 Presidential campaign, he seemed one of the most impressive politicians of his time. By the end of his first four months in office, he was being widely dismissed as an inept and rudderless leader. Now, after weeks of careful repositioning, he appears slowly to be regaining the public's ear. How do we explain such radical swings in public perception? Is the President himself responsible for the roller-coaster-like character of his Presidency so far? Or has he been the victim -- and at times beneficiary -- of events beyond his control?
The new Administration has, to be sure, made its share of early mistakes. But the speed with which many of them seem to have been forgotten suggests that they received more attention than they deserved -- and more attention than the similar early missteps of most of Clinton's predecessors. What has made the President's first months so rocky has been less his own performance, which includes real achievements as well as failures, than the character of the contemporary political environment. 
 Perhaps no President of the 20th century has entered office facing a more difficult combination of pressures. On the one hand, Clinton carries an exceptional burden of diverse and incompatible expectations. He is the first Democratic President in a dozen years, the first President since Lyndon Johnson committed to a significant expansion of Government's social and economic responsibilities. Liberal Democrats have greeted him with a rapture born of 12 (many would say 25) years in the political wilderness. African Americans, feminists, gay men and lesbians, environmentalists, intellectuals and artists and many other groups who considered the Reagan and Bush Administrations their enemy expect something close to a millennial change now that a sympathetic Democrat is in office. Centrist and conservative Democrats expect Clinton to rescue the party from its liberal wing and recast it in their own image.
Virtually everyone expects solutions to the problems of the economy, health care, the welfare system and many other troubled areas of American life; but there is no consensus, even among Democrats, on what those solutions should be -- or even on whether any solutions are available. Clinton may have increased the burden of these contradictory expectations with his lavish campaign promises and his well-known eagerness to please everyone. But there is no way he could have escaped it altogether.
At the same time, Clinton has entered office with extraordinary political weaknesses, which have made it almost inevitable that he will fail at much of what he set out to do. He was elected with 43 percent of the popular vote, the smallest winning percentage in 80 years -- a frail mandate indeed for the bold programs he has promised. In the absence of the cold war, there are no evident foreign policy issues around which he can easily rally popular support and derive political strength -- as his abortive Bosnia initiative demonstrated. He must, instead, fight it out on the domestic front, where consensus is much more difficult to create.
That means, among other things, fighting it out with Congress, which does not seem to be in a cooperative mood. Clinton has encountered an unusually implacable Republican opposition. His economic program attracted not a single Republican vote in the House. Senate Republicans unanimously supported the filibuster that killed Clinton's modest economic stimulus package. Bob Dole now talks of the filibuster as if it were a normal tool of minority party opposition, and he has made it clear that he plans to use it often. In fact, a filibuster orchestrated by party leadership (as opposed to mavericks or regional minorities) is virtually unprecedented.
Without any likely Republican support on the most important elements of his agenda, Clinton must rely on virtual unanimity among Congressional Democrats, who are themselves deeply divided. The Democratic majorities in both houses are small and -- in the Senate -- diminishing. Members with moderate to conservative views hold the balance of power, as the President's excruciatingly narrow Senate victory on his budget bill last month makes clear. Nor can Clinton expect much help from his party's Congressional leaders, who are so accustomed to being in opposition that they seem to have lost the will -- and the means -- to help him succeed. Clinton's much-vaunted "move to the center" is not, in other words, simply a public relations gambit. It is at least in part a recognition of the realities of Congressional politics.
There is a larger obstacle to Clinton's hopes as well: the legacy of nearly three decades of social, economic and ideological disappointment, a legacy of political frustration and popular cynicism symbolized for the moment by the irritatingly persistent popularity of Ross Perot. The last liberal President with an activist agenda comparable to Clinton's was Lyndon Johnson, who entered office before the height of the Vietnam War, before the racial climate soured, before Watergate, before the energy crisis, before the erosion of the economy -- before all the events that have left the public and -- of more immediate importance, perhaps -- the news media with a skeptical, adversarial view of politics in general and the Presidency in particular. That Clinton is himself a representative of the "60's generation," the generation most decisively affected by these events (and the generation currently dominating the media), has exaggerated both the expectations he has generated and the disappointment he creates when he seems not to fulfill them.
Mistakes and miscalculations that would have attracted little attention 30 years ago -- the travel office imbroglio, the California haircut, even the Lani Guinier embarrassment -- now become major issues, seized upon by journalists as evidence of Clinton's indecisiveness. One can understand the frustration among those in the White House who see what they consider their most important initiatives consistently obscured by fleeting controversies. But while the news media are certainly to blame for some of the President's political problems, they did not create and cannot alone dispel the popular cynicism that is their real basis. Clinton's complaining about the nature of the press in this skeptical, post-modern age is, as Fred Barnes wrote recently in The New Republic, "like someone complaining about the weather. He's railing against the way the world works."
Many of Clinton's admirers hoped and expected that he would become a domestic dynamo who would break through the gridlock and fulfill the dreams of a generation. He would be a Franklin D. Roosevelt or a Lyndon Johnson, the kind of President the political scientist Clinton Rossiter celebrated nearly 40 years ago in his book "The American Presidency" as "a kind of magnificent lion, who can roam freely and do great deeds so long as he does not try to break loose from his broad reservation. . . . There is virtually no limit to what the President can do if he does it for democratic ends and through democratic means."
But the political world in which Clinton must live has very little in common with those F.D.R. and L.B.J. inhabited. A more appropriate analogy for this President would be Harry Truman, whose tenuous popularity and fragile (or nonexistent) Democratic majorities in Congress frustrated almost all his important domestic initiatives; or John F. Kennedy, who like Clinton received less than 50 percent of the vote in 1960, who like Clinton had no reliable Congressional majorities and who through most of his brief Presidency had consistently to trim or abandon his most expansive domestic goals. Clinton may, in other words, face the kind of world that the British writer Godfrey Hodgson described in his 1980 book "All Things to All Men: The False Promise of the Modern American Presidency" when he wrote: "Never has any one office had so much power as the President of the United States possesses. Never has so powerful a leader been so impotent to do what he wants to do, what he is pledged to do, what he is expected to do and what he knows he must do."
Great Presidents are products not just of their own talents and ambitions, but of the circumstances they inherit. Theodore Roosevelt complained frequently that his times had denied him the greatness to which he aspired and of which he considered himself capable. "A man has to take advantage of his opportunities," he said in 1910 after leaving office, "but the opportunities have to come. If there is not the war, you don't get the great general; if there is not the great occasion, you don't get the great statesman; if Lincoln had lived in times of peace, no one would know his name now." The great disappointment of Roosevelt's life was that World War I came after he had left office, that, as he saw it, Woodrow Wilson and not he had the real opportunity for greatness.
Bill Clinton may some day have a similar lament, not presumably about the absence of a war but about the absence of great political opportunities. And yet Presidents also have at least some capacity to change the circumstances in which they govern -- to alter the public conversation to permit discussion of ideas that were once impermissible, to build a mandate where none exists, to persuade wavering legislators (and wavering voters) that small steps forward are better than none -- and that small steps now can lead to bigger ones later on. That was one of Theodore Roosevelt's most important achievements, even if it was one he did not himself always fully recognize; it was also, in the end, the principal legacy of John F. Kennedy. It is an opportunity that remains open to President Clinton. He probably cannot do all he and his most exuberant supporters had hoped. But if he manages to restore at least some realism to national fiscal policy (as he has already begun to do), to construct even a modest program of national health insurance and to revive a modicum of popular confidence in the ability of Government to perform, he will deserve credit for some historic achievements.
To succeed, he will need to adjust to things as they are without giving up patient efforts to change them. He will also need those who wish him well to give him a chance.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
A Me-First Scramble To Find Screen Gems

BYLINE: By Anne Thompson; Anne Thompson is a Los Angeles-based writer.

 BODY:
A cadre of young, globe-trotting movie executives charged with knowing every nonstudio film being made around the world is transforming the way these movies are bought for distribution.
No longer are these executives waiting for Cannes or Berlin or Toronto or other major film festivals to screen the best of international cinema at the same time as all the other independent distributors, then making their offers in their own time. In today's cutthroat global film economy, where financing dollars are scarce and releasing costs astronomical -- and where only a handful of independent releases succeed in North America each year -- getting to the right movie first has become the key to survival. 
 "By the time I got to Cannes, I'd already seen 25 movies," said Mark Ordesky, vice president of acquisition and co-production at New Line Cinema ("Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"). And by the time he got to Cannes in May, his company had already acquired the Taviani brothers' "Fiorile" in Rome. Fine Line Features, a New Line division, announced the acquisition at Cannes even as more cautious competitors were still waiting to see how it would fare with critics.
New Line's toughest competitor right now is Miramax Films, which not only released "The Crying Game," with an American box-office gross of more than $62 million to date, but also the recent art-house hits "Enchanted April" and "Like Water for Chocolate." The co-chairmen of Miramax, the brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein, are paying higher prices for more screen gems than any of their rivals.
Before Cannes this year, Miramax, which was purchased by Disney in the spring, had already landed both eventual winners of the coveted Palme D'Or: "The Piano," a New Zealand period drama starring Holly Hunter, Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel, and the lush Chinese epic "Farewell to My Concubine."
To get "The Piano," Harvey Weinstein used his connections to arrange a screening in Paris in the winter. Miramax promptly bought the film for more than $3 million.
"Everyone went ballistic" at being shut out of the process, said Bingham Ray, a partner at October Films ("Un Coeur en Hiver"). "That's what you deal with. Everyone tries to jockey for position. Good relationships can pay off with an early screening ahead of the competition."
Marcie Bloom, co-president at Sony Classics ("Howards End," "Orlando"), agreed: "The business is all about relationships. You have to stay alert and attentive to anything that might be helpful in any way. You have to be open to possibilities when films are emerging from literally anywhere on the globe."
And, said Bobby Rock, senior vice president of acquisitions for Triton Pictures ("American Heart"), "You have to have a good back and a good pair of arms to carry your bags, and be able to watch a movie on six hours of sleep."
Like most of his colleagues, Mr. Rock screens 7 to 10 movies or videotapes a week and attends seven or eight film festivals a year, during which he sees three to five movies a day. But it's getting riskier for the smaller companies like Triton that lack lavish travel budgets to wait to see a movie at a huge festival like Cannes: The film may not be available by the time they get there.
"More films are bought earlier, so there is less completed product available," said Betsy Stanbock, director of acquisitions for the Samuel Goldwyn Company. "We have to hustle that much harder."
Still, "Cannes is the triple triathlon for acquisitions executives," said Zanne Devine, vice president of Universal Pictures, who seeks films for the studio as well as for the new independent distributor Gramercy Pictures, which is owned by Universal and Polygram. "I'm looking for lightning in a bottle: a movie that will light my hair on fire."
Staying alive in this pack isn't easy. After seeing "Tous les Matins du Monde," starring Gerard Depardieu, at the Berlin Film Festival last year, Jeff Lipsky of October Films wanted to buy it. So his partner, Mr. Ray, had to screen it right away. He flew to Montreal, where the film was playing without English subtitles, and persuaded a local friend to translate. The next day, the partners made their offer, and "Tous les Matins" has grossed more than $3 million in the United States, a sizable sum for a foreign-language film.
While getting there first is the acquisitions executive's priority, even more important is judging market value. Although Howard Cohen, vice president of acquisitions for Goldwyn, flew to Hong Kong to see "Farewell to My Concubine" before anyone else, Goldwyn ultimately passed in favor of another Asian film, "The Wedding Banquet," which it bought after the Berlin Film Festival.
It remains to be seen whether he or Miramax made the right call.
Many potential hits are not obvious. While sex has usually been an easy sell, many distributors have overlooked the strong appeal of food in films. "Tampopo," "Babette's Feast," "My Dinner with Andre" and "Eating" have been joined by "Like Water for Chocolate," which created very little heat at Cannes last year but is now a hit.
Everyone saw "Like Water for Chocolate" in the same screening room, says Trea Hoving, senior vice president of acquisitions of Miramax. But Miramax saw in it some of the same elements as in its Oscar-winning Italian hit "Cinema Paradiso," the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the last decade. And Miramax was willing to work with the director, Alfonso Arau, to recut the film for the American market, shortening it by 10 minutes. The movie has grossed more than $10 million in the United States.
"You're always trying to stay a jump ahead of the taste of the public," Ms. Stanbock of Goldwyn said. "You just have to listen to your heart."

HEADLINE: Foreigners Frame America

GRAPHIC: Photos: For another perspective on the Independence Day weekend, the Op-Ed page asked six foreign photographers to comment on one of their images that expresses a telling aspect of America. Bastienne Schmidt, a German, lives in Brooklyn. Ana Aslan is a New York correspondent for a newspaper in her native Argentina. Tomas Muscionico, a Swiss, covered the Clinton campaign and is now working in Bosnia. Kent Klich, a Swede who studied photograpy in New York, is the author of "The Book of Beth," about a drug-addicted Danish woman. Eniac Martinez, a Mexican, has been following the migration of Mixtec Indians to Mexico City and California in pursuit of better economic conditions and their return to their native Oaxaca. Pierre Perrin, who is French, has documented the lives of people living near the Mississippi River.
 -- FRED RITCHIN, co-editor of "Mexico Through Foreign Eyes."
The only guns I ever saw while growing up were in Wild West movies. Coming to America, I see that the Wild West has moved from the movie theater to the front page: A 6-year-old carries a gun in the classroom, a Japanese teen-ager dies because a man asks him to "freeze" and the boy does not understand. Perhaps the 6-year-old saw too many movies and the Japanese teen-ager saw too few.
 -- Bastienne Schmidt. Left: Teen-age girls from West Virginia at a rifle competition. Camp Perry, Ohio, 1992.
American society is a battleground. Everybody feels they have the right to be themselves, but all the time they have to assert that they have that right. Sometimes, happy occasions, such as a New Year celebration, give the impression that a war has taken place, while watching a war on television can be a cause for celebration.
-- Ana Aslan. Left: Chinese New Year, Chinatown, New York City, 1991.
There is no other country where people so cherish the ability to look like famous people. I could spend the rest of my life photographing look-alike contests as well as ugly baby contests, conventions of twins. Although these are fascinating events, there is a sense of desperation and emptiness in a society that places such a high regard on looking like someone else.
-- Tomas Muscionico. Left: Ernest Hemingway look-alike festival, Key West, Fla., July 1991.
The guards and the inmates were talking to each other about my taking this picture, and I was amazed to hear how similar their attitudes were. Living in the same world, they use the same words -- heavy with desperation and violence, very much on edge. There are places in the U.S. that do not seem to change very much.
-- Pierre Perrin. Left: Prisoners and guard at Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola, La., May 1992.
 I have always been fascinated by World War II. My father was a concentration camp survivor. The Americans helped liberate a Europe that was slaughtering itself. Once again, this time in Bosnia, Europe cannot handle its own problems and is waiting for the U.S. to act. Nothing seems to have changed.
 -- Kent Klich. Above: Veterans Day, New York City, 1981.
 Emigration affects young people differently than it does parents. The Mixtec children in the U.S. are more familiar with Halloween than with the Day of the Dead as celebrated in Mexico. Rituals quickly disappear or are mixed with newer customs.

HEADLINE: New Budget Looks a Lot Like 1990's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 2, 1990, editorial on the 1990 budget deal stated: "The budget agreement between Congressional leaders and the Bush Administration cuts defense too little. It increases energy taxes too little. It taxes rich families too little. Even so, the coarse compromise would cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars in five years. . . . The best part of the package is what it will not do. It won't throw the economy into recession." 
 I can only imagine the additional increase in the deficit (it rose more than $700 billion) and the depth of the 1990-91 recession if the 1990 budget deal raised taxes to your satisfaction.
The October 1990 Wall Street Journal editorial pages predicted the explosion in the deficit, as well as the recession, as they are doing again.
"Demagoguery on Taxes" (editorial, June 25) again denounces the Reagan years. Why not admit that the defense budgets by the end of the Reagan Administration were not at historically high levels, and the 1983 and 1986 "deficit reduction" bills he signed, which represented huge tax increases, did not curtail the appetite of Congress for growing spending on nondefense appropriations?
Is it not true that the Federal budget deficit declined in real, as well as nominal terms, during President Reagan's second term? Did Federal revenue not increase despite lower tax rates? Didn't median family net worth and incomes rise through 1989?
Can you produce an analysis pointing to empirical data that supports your contention that a repeat of the 1990 budget deal will reduce our deficit and avoid another recession?
The architects of the 1993 tax bill are the identical players to those of the 1990 budget. The members of Congress simply blamed President Bush for a tax and spend bill they drafted.
Now they, and you, repeat the process and the self-congratulation. Who will the Democrats in Congress point to in the 1994-95 recession? Will you lament that the "rich" weren't taxed enough?

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Making Gains Among Hispanic Voters

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 1

 BODY:
The photographs of Robert F. Kennedy posing with Cesar Chavez during a hunger strike three decades ago are no longer living room fixtures in the barrios here. "Viva Bush" placards were popular last year. Now, some Hispanic households proudly display photos of Richard Riordan, this city's new Republican Mayor, who won a surprisingly large portion of the Hispanic vote.
Hispanic voters have historically been in the Democratic camp, and most still are. But they are not the reliable Democrats they once were. They are increasingly less willing to cast votes for an all-Democratic ticket. Hispanic support for Republican candidates in recent elections here and in Texas suggest that some of these voters are slowly, yet unmistakably, changing sides. 
 The Hispanic population in the United States is relatively young and makes up one of the largest pools of potential voters. So the Republican Party is aggressively courting middle-class Hispanic Americans with a message of family values, law and order and opposition to abortion.
 
Lapse by Democrats
 "They're getting a bigger share of the vote and I'm extremely concerned," said Domingo A. Garcia, the Mayor pro tem of Dallas, who heads the Democratic National Committee's Hispanic caucus. "The Democratic Party has not done a good job of reaching out to the growing Latino population in the United States. The Republicans are filling the vacuum and are building coalitions, appealing to issues like family values that have wide appeal in our community."
By seeking alliances with Hispanic voters, Republicans hope to gain an edge in close races and are threatening the Democratic Party's tradition of building powerful ethnic coalitions.
While Cuban-Americans, spurred by strong sentiments against Fidel Castro and Communism, have long tended to vote Republican, an interest in Republican politics is spreading to other Hispanic voters who had been considered part of the Democratic constituency.
In contrast, blacks continue to vote overwhelmingly Democratic and show no signs of switching parties. Asian-Americans are not quite as lock step in their support for Democrats, but they generally vote with that party. And in large pivotal states, Hispanic residents make up a far larger percentage of the pool of prospective voters than do Asians.
In the mayoral race in New York this year, Republicans are running highly visible voter-registration drives in some Hispanic neighborhoods. Herman Badillo, the city's first Puerto Rican-born member of Congress, dropped out of the mayoral race to run for comptroller on a ticket with Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is challenging Mayor David N. Dinkins, under the Republican and Liberal Party labels. Mr. Giuliani is seeking to attract support from the Hispanic and Jewish voters who voted for the Democratic Mayor in 1989.
The most recent example of Republican appeal to Hispanic voters was the election last month of Mayor Riordan. Though he did not win a majority of the Hispanic vote, Mr. Riordan made significant inroads, drawing 43 percent, as against 57 percent for his Democratic opponent, Michael Woo, according to a Los Angeles Times poll. By contrast, Mr. Riordan's share of the black vote was only 14 percent.
"Woo should have gotten 70 percent," said Richard Martinez, regional director of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. "It was his to lose. He didn't talk to the Latino community. Most campaign managers don't see the growth of Latino voters; they believe that the Latino vote is apathetic. They're nuts. We outregistered Anglos and blacks last year."
In Texas, three days before the election in Los Angeles, Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Republican candidate, was elected Senator in a landslide in which she carried heavily Hispanic South Texas, 60 percent to 40 percent. While the Democratic incumbent, Bob Krueger, still carried most of the Hispanic vote statewide, Mrs. Hutchison's support demonstrates the potential for what Texas Republican leaders contend is a new winning coalition of urban Republicans, rural conservatives and Hispanic Americans.
Although Democrats still won a majority of the Hispanic vote in the Texas and Los Angeles races, Republican support from those voters was significant. It at least partly reflected that Republicans were far more aggressive than Democrats in running Spanish-language advertising campaigns and phone banks to get Hispanic voters to the polls.
"We're not the enemy like we used to be 20 years ago," said Tirso del Junco, a Cuban-American who heads the California Republican Party. "The Hispanic community identified with Mr. Riordan on jobs and economics and family. There is a notion out there that Hispanics are interested in social issues and that's it. I suggest that's not the case."
Even as more Hispanics voters back Republican candidates, Hispanic politics is still dominated by Democrats. But that, too, shows signs of shifting.
"Latinos are no longer to be taken for granted as being in one corner or another," said Gaddi H. Vasquez, the Republican Supervisor of heavily conservative Orange County south of Los Angeles, whom his party is grooming for statewide office.
Texas has been the most successful breeding ground recently for Hispanic Republicans. Pete Nieto, who was recently elected a Texas State Representative as a Democrat, announced last month that he was switching to the Republican Party. In a statement, he said the lessons of his parents of "hard work, self reliance and family values" were shared by Republicans.
 
For the Next Election
 With Mr. Nieto when he made the announcement was Representative Henry Bonilla of San Antonio, who last year became the first Hispanic Republican elected to Congress from Texas.
In many states, Republicans are hoping to make even greater inroads next year in state and local elections by recruiting Hispanic candidates and getting Hispanic voters to the polls. Looking ahead to the 1996 Presidential race, several important battlegrounds, including California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas, have large numbers of Hispanic residents.
In Los Angeles, the potential Hispanic political clout is clearly illustrated on a wall map at the offices of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in East Los Angeles. In bright orange and yellow colors, the map dispels the notion that Hispanic residents are concentrated only in East Los Angeles, and shows they are spread throughout five neighboring counties, including the San Fernando Valley and the Republican bastion of Orange County.
"That's where the voters are," said Harry P. Pachon, the national director of the group, pointing to the map. "If you're in the Republican Party hierarchy, you ask yourself: 'Will the blacks vote for us?' "
 
'Not Set in Concrete'
 Though Mr. Pachon said the Republicans had largely given up on the black vote, he said they know that "the Latino vote is not set in concrete."
Indeed, a 1992 poll by the Southwest Voter Research Institute showed that in Texas the Republicans have made sharp inroads among Hispanic voters. In California, the poll found that increasing numbers of Hispanic voters are dropping party affiliations and identifying themselves as independents -- but, as the recent mayoral election shows, are willing to vote Republican.
By the end of 1994, more than three million former illegal immigrants, mostly natives of Mexico, will complete a five-year waiting period to be eligible for naturalization. More than half of these people live in California. The Republican Party has recognized the potential faster than the Democrats, and usually dispatches party representatives to naturalization ceremonies.
Although the Republicans have concentrated on well-to-do Hispanic business owners, the party has also sought to portray itself to minorities as inclusive and progressive.
To tap the full potential of the Hispanic vote, both parties have to reverse the low turnouts by Hispanic voters. In the Los Angeles mayoral race, Hispanic voters accounted for only 10 percent of the total.
Peter Skerry, a political scientist and author of "Mexican Americans: The Ambivalent Minority" (The Free Press, 1993), is skeptical of the prospects for a significant shifts in Hispanic voting pattern. Fundamentally, he said, the Hispanic electorate is a "working, lower-middle class kind of vote that's interested in the same economic issues as Democrats."
And Mr. Skerry said Cuban-Americans, who among Hispanics have been the most ardent Republicans, had discouraged others.
"There's intense animosity between Mexican-Americans and the Cuban-Republicans, who got there first and contributed a lot of money to the party," he said. "They're not eager to open the ranks to what they call Johnny-come-latelys."
But Mr. Garcia, the head of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus, said he was so worried about the Republicans that he took his concerns to David Wilhelm, the chairman of Democratic National Committee, and officials at the White House. "So far," he said, "the pleas have fallen on deaf ears. An organized strategy still has not been developed."
But Mr. Wilhelm said he was confident that the Democrats could hold on to the 62 percent of Hispanic voters who said they backed Bill Clinton last year.
"The key with Hispanic voters is the same as it is with voters generally," he said. "If we deliver on economic change, if we pass health-care reform, we will have spoken to those Hispanic voters in a very clear and compelling way."

HEADLINE: Restoring Stability to Haiti Is Seen as the Next Big Test

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 4

 BODY:
Now that an agreement has finally been signed to restore Haiti's first elected President to power on Oct. 30, diplomats say they face a more critical test: building a viable economy and political stability in a desperately poor country with virtually no tradition of compromise.
The tortuous talks in New York that culminated in the signing of the accord on Saturday by the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the military leader who overthrew him in September 1991, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, exposed the fractious nature of Haiti's politics and the skills and limits of its foreign partners. 
 Equally difficult hurdles will emerge as early as next week, when representatives of Father Aristide are to meet with political parties represented in the Haitian Parliament, perhaps in Washington, for political consultations aimed at forming a new government of the President's choosing.
Father Aristide, a liberal priest elected in December 1990 with strong support from Haiti's poor, was overthrown by the army after what many analysts viewed as an unnecessary fight with his own natural allies in the Parliament. That power struggle left him with few friends beyond a government of untested intimates and a population thirsty for the redemption he had promised.
 
A Test of Skills
 Beginning next week, Father Aristide must test his skills of consultation and coalition building in selecting a prime minister who must be perceived by the nation not as a crony, but as an independent personality who can reassure all Haitians that the country can overcome its divisiveness.
Speculation has centered on Robert Malval, a Haitian businessman who told a reporter several weeks ago that he could not support Father Aristide as President if he retained the chaotic and insular pattern of governing of his first seven months in office. Last week Mr. Malval was a leading member of Father Aristide's negotiating team in New York.
But before Father Aristide can install a new Government, the country's political parties must come up with a formula for purging the Parliament of members who won office in an election on Jan. 18 denounced by many governments and by most Haitians as a sham.
To maintain the pressure for those two actions, the settlement crafted by United Nations mediators calls for maintaining an international oil embargo against Haiti and a freeze on the assets of supporters of the 1991 coup against Father Aristide.
 
An Accord With Teeth
 "We assume they will all be pulling in the same direction," a senior diplomat involved in the settlement said of the Haitian parties who are to take part in the coming talks.
Dante Caputo, the United Nations mediator who has shuttled for months between Father Aristide and General Cedras, emphasized that the accord was intended to have teeth.
"We are not going through all the trouble we've been through for one day of victory," Mr. Caputo said last week during the arduous talks at Governors Island in New York harbor. "To be considered a success, this has to be something lasting."
Father Aristide signed the settlement just before 11 P.M. Saturday, nearly 12 hours after General Cedras did so. One of the snags that delayed the President's signing was his request for United Nations assurances that his supporters and others would enjoy freedom of expression in Haiti during the consultations leading to his return.
Aides to Father Aristide have asked for television coverage in Haiti of any political meetings held during this period.
 
Vast Economic Program
 The selection of a new government by Father Aristide, once ratified by the Parliament, will also set in motion a huge program for economic recovery that diplomats say is of vital political importance as well.
The international package, valued at more than $1 billion by President Clinton, will focus on the quick creation of 30,000 or more jobs in areas like sanitation, road building and well digging to improve conditions in a country that was already the hemisphere's poorest when it began its 21-month crisis. International sanctions have only made conditions more wretched.
Since February, teams of international experts coordinated by the United Nations Development Program have repeatedly visited the Haitian capital and countryside to study Haiti's needs and lay the ground for a quick start in the event that a settlement is reached.
When Father Aristide's Government took office in February 1991 it enjoyed strong popular support and had the good will of international donors, who pledged $350 million in aid. But ultimately it managed to get almost no development programs.
 
Infusion of Foreign Experts
 To help Father Aristide avoid repeating that destabilizing debacle, the emerging economic strategy involves a strong infusion of foreign experts who are to pass along expertise to a renovated civil service and help speed up its work.
The military is also scheduled for major change. The accords, like Haiti's 1986 Constitution, call for the separation of the police from the armed forces. To help accomplish this, the United Nations will send hundreds of experts with expertise in police work and military affairs to Haiti, most of them drawn from French-speaking countries.
Senior Clinton Administration officials say the United States would prefer to allow other nations to fulfill that role, but will send troops to Haiti, if requested, to help support the process.
In the meantime, American military involvement is expected to be limited to experts from groups like the Army Corps of Engineers, which can help the Haitian military, now concentrated in and around the capital, move to new bases to be sprinkled throughout the countryside.
A major element of the country's reconstruction plan hinges on permanently removing soldiers from politics and involving them in rebuilding and in long-neglected, traditional duties like border patrols.
The international police and military cooperation with Haiti, a strategy contested at various points in the negotiations by supporters of the President and by army officers, must be discussed and approved by Haiti's political parties and Parliament.
The accords call for the President to name a new army commander shortly before his return who would replace General Cedras. Father Aristide said in a recent interview that the commander would be chosen according to military rules of promotion. That commander will then name a new staff to replace the military high command that the President holds responsible for the coup and the violence that followed.
One of the reasons for the delay in Father Aristide's signature on Saturday was dismay and confusion among his aides over the meaning of the required "retirement" of those officers under the terms of the settlement.
Father Aristide's delegation had wanted those officers to be banished from the army altogether, but the final agreement allows for their reassignment to positions outside the high command. Diplomats say General Cedras himself will leave the army.
The reversal of fortunes for General Cedras completes a circle in his relations with Father Aristide. On the morning of his inauguration in 1991, the new President surprised many by dismissing much of the senior officer corps and naming General Cedras, who had overseen the country's peaceful elections, as the new commander.
A critical turn in Haiti's fortunes came with the swearing-in of President Clinton in January. Embarrassed by his own inaugural about-face on a campaign promise to change the way Haitian refugees were treated after being intercepted on the high seas, Mr. Clinton set out to press for the restoration of Haitian democracy and return the country's leftist young leader to power.
The linchpin of the strategy, devised soon after Mr. Clinton took office, was a partnership with the United Nations. After dispelling doubts that lingered from the Bush Administration about the strength of Washington's commitment to the goal of restoring democracy in Haiti, the United Nations mediator for that country became a regular sight in Washington.
The diplomatic triumph on Saturday, in which General Cedras and Father Aristide each signed an agreement that promised to restore the President by Oct. 30, was a victory for both men.
But in the deliberate pattern that has held throughout the six-month partnership between Washington and the United Nations mediator, it was Mr. Caputo, a former Argentine Foreign Minister, who emerged from the shadows of diplomacy as the visible actor.
Their intention, carefully respected, was that American muscle be held in reserve -- always visible, but deployed as little as possible to make a United Nations diplomatic offensive successful. This was necessary for two reasons, diplomats said: Haiti's long psychological ties to Washington, reinforced by American intervention, had become destructive; and with crises sprouting around the world, Washington was anxious to develop effective joint strategies for dealing with them.

International
The U.S. and Japan will resume negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement, brightening the outlook for President Clinton's meeting this week with Prime Minister Miyazawa. Officials said the Clinton Administration had decided that a Japanese compromise proposal, delivered to Washington on Friday, was substantive enough to merit further discussion. It is still unclear whether an agreement on the so-called economic framework can be reached this week, the original deadline. [Page 37.]
The Group of Seven summit meeting in Tokyo is becoming something of a giant campaign-time annoyance for Japanese leaders. An election two weeks from today seems certain to end nearly four decades of rule by the Liberal Democrats. And the President, as he prepared to leave Washington, made it clear that he hoped the political turmoil would produce a Japanese Government more willing to open its markets. [1.] 
 The Administration is planning to use the economic meeting to announce the successful conclusion of talks among European allies and Japan on providing aid to Russia for economic reforms. [4.]
 
The Economy
Americans are hitting the road again after putting off trips during the economic doldrums of recent years. Gasoline is cheap and plentiful and is expected to stay that way. [37.]
Nowhere are the immediate costs of a smaller military more stark and the knotty issues of converting from a military-based economy more daunting than in Charleston, S.C. [7.]
In five months as Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich has found that theorizing is the easy part. [7.]
A triangle of land on the Miami Beach peninsula is a real estate developer's dream. But the business and personal dealings of its would-be German developer have many people wondering if he has the money and dedication to complete the project. [37.]
 
Companies
American Airlines has been awarded the Philadelphia-London route that USAir gave up after linking with British Airways. [39.]

Markets
Japanese stocks outpaced the returns from most of the world's leading markets in the last quarter. Currency losses aggravated weak performances by most European markets, but the best returns among the 24 largest markets came in Italy. [37.]
Most mutual funds had dull returns in the second quarter. But funds that invested in gold and Japanese stocks, and some aggressive growth funds that guessed right, did very well. [38.]

The Media Business
The written word is thriving in new places like CD-ROM players and computer-mail networks, and many digital revolutionaries are noticing that reading is still fashionable. In fact, some say text may be trendy enough to be called an interactive medium. [37.]
There is strong evidence that network series are less violent than they have been in decades, despite the criticism of broadcast networks heard in Congressional hearings and the campaigns of interest groups to censor programming deemed violent. [41.]

HEADLINE: Security Official Guides U.S. Aims at Conference

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Every Wednesday, three men gather around the conference table in a spacious corner office in the West Wing of the White House to share sandwiches and talk. Their conversation is anything but casual, for they are the backbone of President Clinton's foreign policy team.
W. Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, Les Aspin, the Secretary of Defense, and Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, are the people who have drafted the President's speeches and policy statements as Mr. Clinton prepares to go to Tokyo this week to meet with the leaders of the world's wealthiest nations. They have spent weeks in close negotiations with representatives from the other countries, trying to resolve differences over economic policies and aid to Russia. 
 Mr. Lake will be at the President's side as he travels to Tokyo for his most extensive foray to date on the world stage. And when the leaders of the so-called Group of Seven issue their communiques in Tokyo, much of the direction will have been determined in advance by Mr. Lake and a staff of strategists and technocrats.
The advisers place a premium on collegiality, secrecy, efficiency and finding a Clinton-like consensus on every issue. In planning for the economic conference in Tokyo, Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen has also taken part, as have Robert E. Rubin, the head of the new National Economic Council, and his deputy, W. Bowman Cutter.
 
Lake Spearheads Asia Trip
 But because Mr. Rubin has a significantly smaller staff and a mandate that focuses on domestic issues, Mr. Lake's shop has driven much of the preparations for the Asia trip.
"As we look at this week, we have a new President going to Asia -- a new Asia. It really becomes increasingly clear that we ought to use this as an opportunity to talk more broadly about the United States as a Pacific power and the emerging economic and security relationships with the United States and Asia," said a national security official, who insisted on anonymity.
The summit meeting will inevitably push Mr. Lake closer to the public view. But the national security adviser and his own team, members of the White House national security staff, generally leave the public stage to Cabinet members like Mr. Aspin and Mr. Christopher, in part to avoid the sort of turf warfare that has often marred foreign-policy making.
"I really wanted to avoid becoming the guard-all shield between the President and the rest of the foreign policy community, but at the same time make sure he wasn't being buried in all kinds of different memos and meetings," Mr. Lake said in an interview. "That's not what the President wants in any case."
The feuds between William P. Rogers and Henry A. Kissinger under Richard Nixon, and Zbigniew Brzezinski and Cyrus R. Vance under Jimmy Carter are now remembered almost as much as the achievements. Even James A. Baker 3d and Brent Scowcroft, who worked as Secretary of State and national security adviser for George Bush, had their tense moments.
 
Determined to Avoid Tension
 "I think Tony and I and Les are determined that we'll not have a repeat of the tensions that existed in previous administrations," said Mr. Christopher, who worked with Mr. Lake at the State Department during the Carter years.
"If that falls apart," another adviser added, "you get the Vance-Brzezinski, the Kissinger-Rogers vehemence, and everybody loses."
Some of Mr. Lake's supporters, concerned that like some of his predecessors he is ceding the political credit for American policy advances to Mr. Christopher, have begun quietly campaigning to raise his visibility just a bit. But Mr. Lake has generally eschewed television and most other opportunities to publicize his role.
"The more you do, especially in a job like this, outside, the more the others are going to start feel you're threatening them," said a White House official. "And it actually diminishes your power, and it actually undercuts the President."
 
Mixed View on Growing Pains
 When the national security advisers boast at all, it is to point out that -- in their view, at least -- the President's foreign policy operation has suffered few of the growing pains that have occurred on the domestic and communications side of the White House.
This ignores the Administration's biggest foreign policy stumble to date, its abortive effort to force allied action in Bosnia. Mr. Lake, officials concede, has been at the center of that crisis as well.
And critics say the foreign policy brain trust also mirrors some of Mr. Clinton's own weaknesses. To some members of Congress and people in the foreign policy community, the collegiality of the President's advisers comes across as mushiness, their secrecy as stubbornness and their passion for efficiency as a maddening inability to see the forest for the trees.
 
Praise and Criticism for Lake
 Mr. Lake is the most frequent target for both the praise and the complaints that emerge about the President's foreign policy office. Low-key, bespectacled and possessed of a dry wit, he does not fit the mold of previous national security advisers, most of whom have been drawn from the military. A career Foreign Service officer who served in Vietnam and later opposed the war, Mr. Lake's appearance suggests an academic background and he has indeed been a professor at Mount Holyoke College.
The White House foreign policy team is so circumspect that even members of Congress with security clearance have trouble forming opinions about its efficiency.
"I suspect he's very much overworked," Representative Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said of Mr. Lake. "That means it's tough for him to get to an issue unless it's urgent."
Harsher critics suggest that the President's foreign policy advisers are too reactive and have not taken on enough of an advocacy role.
"I'm being careful," said Representative Dave McCurdy, a Democrat from Oklahoma and member of the Armed Services Committee, who was asked to assess the early work of the President's policy advisers. "A lot of it depends on State and Defense and how forceful they are in the kinds of roles they hold."
 
'A Very Low-Key Manager'
 Of Mr. Lake, he added: "I haven't figured out what kind of role he has. If he's a manager, he's a very low-key manager."
But Mr. Lake's low profile has cost him in credibility in a political environment where invisibility is often equated with powerlessness.
"What I think they miss is his toughness," said George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President. "I think it's too easy to think: Vietnam, professor, laid-back and funny equals not tough. And that's just flat-out wrong."
Administration officials said that before last weekend's missile strike against Iraq, Mr. Lake urged the President to take aggressive action after concluding that Iraq was responsible for hatching an assassination plot aimed at President Bush. Mr. Lake's handprints, they said, were also to be found in Mr. Clinton's aggressive defense of aid for Russia before and since the Vancouver summit meeting.
The downside of that analysis, of course, is that Mr. Lake has also been central in forming the failed Administration policy on Bosnia. Mr. Clinton's oratory seemed muscular during the election campaign, but Washington's policy has appeared feckless after European allies rejected Mr. Christopher's pitch to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and consider limited air strikes against Serbian nationalists.
But if it is true that Mr. Lake is the man at Mr. Clinton's elbow when it comes to setting foreign policy, what of Warren Christopher, the courtly Secretary of State?
Although he insists he is not a gatekeeper, Mr. Lake has designed a system that makes him the hub of the wheel.
 
More Than One Voice
 "The principal spokesman for foreign policy should be the Secretary of State," one White House official said. "It gets confusing when there is more than one voice out there. But there's no question who's driving foreign policy in terms of the decision-making process." That would be Mr. Lake.
"There's more than enough room," Mr. Christopher said in an interview. "A properly functioning national security adviser only enhances the position of the Secretary of State."
When all of the President's foreign policy advisers gathered around the long table in the Roosevelt Room at the White House for a series of briefings for the Tokyo summit conference last week, Mr. Lake led the discussions.
But as the President sets out his vision of Asia policy this week, some say it will have come not a moment too soon.
"We have been lax in setting out goals for the international community," said Michael Mandlebaum, a former Clinton foreign policy adviser who directs the East-West Project of the Council on Foreign Relations. "But just setting them out would not mean we could achieve them. Because there are problems that no other American President has had to deal with that Bill Clinton will have to deal with."

HEADLINE: Mandela and de Klerk Receive Liberty Medal in Philadelphia

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 4

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela and President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa joined President Clinton at the birthplace of American democracy today, capping a day of pointed remarks on the distance each nation must travel to guarantee the fruits of freedom to all their citizens.
Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, were given the Liberty Medal in a ceremony at Independence Hall. 
 Mr. Mandela shook hands cordially with Mr. de Klerk, yet recalled the observation of Frederick Douglass in marking the holiday 141 years ago during the era of slavery that, "This Fourth of July is yours, not mine."
Quoting from Langston Hughes's poem, "Harlem," Mr. Mandela said that for millions in the United States and elsewhere, amid problems of drug abuse, homelessness and violence, the promise of liberty was "but a dream deferred."
 
Sharing Justice and Prosperity
 As South Africans negotiate a transition into rule by the black majority, he said, the great challenge would be to insure "that no one in our country shall in the future complain that justice and prosperity are not shared by them."
Mr. Clinton, Mr. de Klerk and the leader of the African National Congress spoke in front of more than 2,000 invited guests and thousands of others who jammed the mall in which sits the pavilion that houses the Liberty Bell.
Amid controversy over the appropriateness of awarding the medal to Mr. de Klerk, he and Mr. Mandela had a sharp exchange at a news conference preceding the ceremony in which the anti-apartheid leader stated, "We don't regard Mr. de Klerk as the President of South Africa." Mr. Mandela said that people of color, 85 percent of the nation's population, had no say in the election of Mr. de Klerk.
 
Protest Against de Klerk
 The crowd included several hundred protesters who chanted during Mr. Mandela's speech, "Mandela yes, de Klerk, no." But they were some 300 yards from the podium and caused minimal disruption, and Mr. de Klerk's speech was applauded politely.
The awards, conferred by the civic group We the People 2000, carried a $100,000 cash prize that the two leaders split. The Liberty Medal and the cash award were established by Philadelphia-area business and civic leaders in 1988 to heighten recognition of the nation's founding principles.
 
Money Raised for A.N.C.
 During an earlier appearance at a North Philadelphia church, Mr. Mandela got more than $30,000 in pledges for his organization in what became an impromptu telethon headed by former Representative William H. Gray 3d, the church's pastor.
"It would seem strange to some people that . . . we who have been fighters for liberation are together with the captains of apartheid," Mr. Mandela said.
But it would also strike many as strange that America's Founding Fathers "permitted the institution of slavery to continue."
 
'I Tremble for My Country
 Mr. Clinton, warmly received on his nation's birthday, said, "Even after 217 years, no one can say we've gotten it all right yet." He recalled how Thomas Jefferson, referring to slavery, wrote: "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just."
Mr. Clinton promised United States economic and technical assistance as South Africa continues it democratization process. He said he would raise the topic of international assistance at next week's economic summit in Tokyo.
Earlier Sunday, at the news conference, Mr. de Klerk took exception to comments made the past few days by Mr. Mandela that the South African President was "irrelevant" to the timing to the lifting of sanctions.
 
Call for End to Sanctions
 "Nothing and nobody is irrelevant when it comes to the issue of sanctions," Mr. de Klerk said.
Mr. Mandela said he was worried about Mr. de Klerk's assurances in view of a recent controversy in South Africa over the President's decision to override an independent panel and place some of his own choices on the board that controls South African television and radio.
Noting that the prerequisite for the lifting of sanctions was the successful creation of an interim governing council, Mr. Mandela said: "We want to make sure that before we lift sanctions, nobody, including Mr. de Klerk, will have the authority to change the members of that council."

HEADLINE: Results of Study on Pesticide Encourage Effort to Cut Use

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
With the release last week of a five-year study of agricultural chemicals and how they affect children, it appears that there is momentum for a major change in Federal policy on pesticides.
Just before the release of the report, from the National Academy of Sciences, came the announcement by three Federal agencies, which in the past had often clashed on the subject, that they would now work together to try to reduce the use of pesticides. That, in turn, came a few months after the Supreme Court strictly interpreted a law on food additives, forcing Congress to act on pesticide policy. 
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and head of the Agriculture Committee, said a few days ago that "the whole atmosphere is worlds different than when I requested the report" five years ago. "It comes at a time when we may actually be able to enact some of the changes suggested."
 
Regulating Pesticides
 The study released last week detailed how the Government should regulate pesticides. It also faulted the Government's method of calculating the level of pesticides on food that is safe. And it found that other sources of pesticide contamination -- for instance, chemicals used on lawns -- have not been considered when total pesticide exposure is calculated.
The study found that infants and young children might be uniquely sensitive to pesticides on food. They consume more than 60 times the amount of fruits as adults for their body weight, and so tend to get higher doses of the pesticides used on fruits early in life.
Senator Leahy said the Clinton Administration was ready to reverse the policy of recent decades and try to reduce the amount of pesticides used by American farmers whenever possible. Alternative ways to control pests, like using beneficial insects to control them or enriching the soil to makes plants more resistant to pests, may become Federal policy.
 
In a Year, Perhaps a Law
 Because of the President's support, the Senator said, Congress might pass a bill within the next year or so, something he and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, have tried to do without success for several years. With the threat of a Presidential veto gone, he said, lawmakers "will be willing to negotiate."
The report said the three Federal agencies that control the amount of pesticides that is permitted on food -- the Agriculture Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration -- had outmoded policies that make it possible for children to get the same pesticide from several different sources and end up eating amounts of it that are unsafe.
The Government now considers the amount of a pesticide "average persons" might ingest. William Jordan, deputy director of policy for the E.P.A. Pesticide Office, said the agency had looked at the diets of several groups, classified by age, race or geography.
But the academy said that computer data now made it possible to do things like look at children's pesticide consumption in their first five years.
The report also said that each new pesticide was tested before it is approved by the Government for use in foods. But these risk calculations have not taken into account the fact that people may get pesticides from many sources besides food, like contaminated drinking water or golf courses treated with chemicals.
Thus, said Dr. Philip Landrigan, chairman of the committee that wrote the pesticide report, "Pesticides applied in legal amounts on the farm, and present in legal amounts on food, can still lead to unsafe amounts."
Both Government and industry had years ago allowed some products on the market if they had what was called "negligible" amounts of carcinogens. That could mean, for example, that a person would not run a risk of cancer higher than one in a million over an entire lifetime.
 
Ending the Risk
 Two bills in Congress, one offered by Democrats and one by Republicans, have one thing in common, something industry has sought for years. Both bills would require the E.P.A. to calculate risks and permit pesticides and other additives on the market if they pose only a "negligible risk."
In the Democratic offering, the Kennedy-Waxman bill, an acceptable "negligible risk" would cover a pesticide that would cause a person no more than a one in a million chance of suffering a harmful effect over the course of a lifetime. Thus, a trace amount of a carcinogen might not force a chemical off the market.
The two bills differ in that the Republican bill asks the E.P.A. to weigh the economic benefit of having a pesticide on the market against its health risks.

HEADLINE: High School Lasts Longer Than 4 Years for Many Students

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN

 BODY:
Judith Aguilar is 18 years old and graduated from high school after only four years. In her midtown Manhattan school, Park West High, that achievement alone places her among the elite.
Veronica Lopez is 17 and desperate to complete her senior year. Just over a week ago she marched with her class to the strains of "Pomp and Circumstance," but when the graduates picked up their diplomas last Monday, Miss Lopez stayed home. To graduate, she still must pass three courses, including an economics class she has already failed twice. 
 Victor Osbourne, 22, has been a high school graduate for one week. He does not like to talk much about his high school years, except to say this: "For anybody who wants to achieve their goal, the impossible is possible."
 
Huge Obstacles
 Possible, maybe, but for a large portion of New York City students, getting through high school is a daunting task. Besieged by family demands, burdened by the need to work, discouraged or simply disinterested, thousands of students came years late to their graduation ceremonies, if at all. Many of those who graduated did so despite huge handicaps and were driven by the desire to build better lives for themselves.
"I'm having a tough time now and if I don't go to college, it's going to keep on for the rest of my life," Miss Lopez said. "With a high school diploma you don't do anything. You got to go to college."
In many ways, Park West on West 50th Street reflects the face of the New York City school system as the academic year ends. Less than 32 percent of the ninth graders who entered in 1988 had graduated by 1992, a little worse than the citywide average of 38.7 percent.
Nearly 16 percent were listed as having dropped out -- matching the citywide average -- while 37 percent remained in school. Some, like Mr. Osbourne, will take six or seven years to graduate.
"Some people will make the statement that 'Look how horrible it is they are spending all that time in high school,' " said the Park West Principal, Richard A. Ross. "Would we rather that they spend four years and drop out? Our job is to help them have a better life."
 
An Array of Student Problems
 Despite the statements that departing Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez has made recently about the declining dropout rate, Park West and its students offer a vivid explanation of why, across the city, only 57 percent of the students receive a diploma, even after seven years.
Park West's student body is predominantly Hispanic, increasingly immigrant and largely poor. The school's five counselors and one social worker contend with an array of student problems, from pregnancy to housing, from drug abuse to violence.
Many students, discouraged by poverty and tempted by the world outside the classroom that seems to offer more immediate rewards, do not value academic success, said Renee Pollack, an assistant principal.
"In many instances it has no relation to what they need to do in their life or to what they do during the day," she said. "Very often I see kids once or twice a month when they come in to get a bus pass. Then I'm not going to see them for another month."
 
Conflicting Demands
 Even students who value education and want desperately to graduate can get sidetracked by the demands of family and work. Three-quarters of Park West's students live below the poverty level. For many, working is not an option, it is a necessity.
The students say that too much work means they fall behind in class. Falling behind in class means they fail and must retake the class.
Several Park West students said they had reached their senior year only to find out they lacked enough credits in some subjects and were oversupplied in others. The problem seems to be acute among students who transferred from other countries and who say they were never told what they needed to graduate.
Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a group that advocates improvements in public education from the student's point of view, said such bewilderment is not uncommon. Ms. Connell said her group had been urging the school system to send yearly reports to parents showing the student's progress toward graduation.
"It is especially important to empower the parent, so that the parent knows even if the kid doesn't care," she said.
Ms. Pollack said students are given the graduation requirements during school orientation and meet frequently with grade advisers.
"I tell kids all the time, 'You need this, this and this,' and they still say, 'You never told me,' " Ms. Pollack said. "It's part of their being kids."
 
'Not Going to Just Give Up'
 Some students said they had no trouble finding out which credits they needed to graduate. Judith Aguilar plotted her high school career like a chess match, and won in four years.
"Instinct, it was all instinct," she said. "I made sure I got to see the grade adviser. I made sure I completed my credits and got through. I made sure I was going to pass."
Voted most intelligent and most likely to succeed by her classmates, Miss Aguilar will enroll at Hunter College in Manhattan this fall.
"I don't know what I will study, but I will do it successfully," she said. "I'm not going to just give up."
 
Four Years of Drifting
 It never occurred to Victor Osbourne to give up, either, not through more than six years of high school. He drifted through the first four, cutting classes in an attempt to fit in, often failing and still not finding many friends, he said. "I tried to be just like everybody else," he said.
He dropped out once, after a fight with another student, but after a few months found his way back to Park West. He wandered away again this spring while helping his family pack for a move to Florida. At one point his parents were called in to discuss the possibility of Mr. Osbourne working toward a general equivalency diploma. But his parents would have none of it, and neither would Mr. Osbourne.
"Oh no, they wanted the diploma," said his favorite teacher, Grace Walsh. "He wanted it."
On Monday he went back to Park West to pick up his diploma and thank Ms. Walsh for her help. "She stuck by me," he said. "She inspired me to read more. She's my hero."
 
Hopes for Better Future
 Veronica Lopez has dreamed of college and a better life since she and her mother came to New York from the Dominican Republic. They get by on the money Miss Lopez makes at a fast-food restaurant, and the money her mother earns as a sample-maker for a factory.
Miss Lopez used to work at a convenience store from 3 P.M. until midnight, five days a week, for $165 take-home pay. When she realized she would not graduate on time and the strain became too much, she quit.
This summer Miss Lopez will take two math classes and an economics class in an effort to get her diploma. She has twice failed the economics class, but hopes that with a different teacher, she will do better.
If all goes well this summer, she plans to apply to La Guardia Community College for the January term. Eventually she hopes to go into the travel and tourism business.
"I cannot be like this, working for $4.25 an hour for the rest of my life," she said. "I want to be somebody."

HEADLINE: Ready to Put Theories Into Action, Secretary Finds Ideas Are Not Allies

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Not many Cabinet secretaries arrive in town with a billing like that of Robert B. Reich when he showed up to take over the Department of Labor.
A friend of the President for 25 years, author of many Clinton campaign promises and a force behind some of the liveliest economic policy debates of the last decade, Mr. Reich (pronounced reish) was leaving Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, where he taught political economics, to come into Government and do nothing less than reorganize labor and industry using the theories he conceived in academia. 
But after five months he has found that theorizing is the easy part.
 
Assembling Committees
 Mr. Reich is still pursuing his big ideas: remaking the American workplace, ending the hostility between workers and management and producing millions of better-skilled workers for new high-paying jobs.
In the manner of an academic, he is assembling committees to work on these things. He has created a Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, with 8 of its 10 members from universities and a chairman, 78-year-old John T. Dunlop, Secretary of Labor under President Gerald R. Ford, with a long record of settling labor-management disputes.
And any day now, his aides say, he will announce the formation of a new agency, the Office of the American Workplace, which, like the commission, will focus on ways to encourage cooperation between workers and management.
But some people say Mr. Reich may not fully grasp the realities of Government.
"What a disaster!" said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist who is a director of Manpower, the big temporary-help company. "What does the Secretary of Labor have to do with how individual companies deal with their workers? Really!"
 
Fallen Campaign Promises
 Certainly, Mr. Reich's impact on policy has so far been less than his advance billing suggested. His ideas have collided with the reality of a budget deficit, skeptics in Congress, special interests and the slow-turning wheels of bureaucracy.
Already, the ground is littered with fallen campaign promises, including one to require Federal contractors to give young poor people after-school and summer jobs and another to require businesses to spend 1.5 percent of their payrolls on training. The promise to raise the $4.25 minimum wage has been postponed for at least a year.
The Clinton Administration's $16.3 billion economic stimulus plan, written in part by Mr. Reich, was rejected by Congress; the only piece that survived that vote was an extension of unemployment benefits.
Mr. Reich's other big proposal in the stimulus plan, a $1 billion expansion of this year's Federal summer jobs program, has been chopped to $220 million.
And as the 1994 budget makes its way through Congress, Mr. Reich seems unlikely to get more than a third of the $1.5 billion he sought for job training for those who permanently lose jobs in shrinking industries, a program near to his heart because it is intended to put people on pathways to his "high performance" workplace.
 
'Keeping Himself Focused'
 To pay for a richer job training program Mr. Reich faced the same difficult choices other secretaries do. He proposed to cut back the number of investigators enforcing the child labor, anti-discrimination, mine safety and minimum wage laws. He promptly ran into flak from Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa who has a big voice in the Labor Department budget.
Mr. Reich, 47, can hardly be stuck with all the blame for his early stumbles. Throughout the Administration, many bright ideas have withered while the White House, to wring a budget out of Congress, has reduced its proposed tax increases and cut more spending. And reviving the economy and creating good jobs are not simple tasks.
"People are more in the attack mode on him than seems justified," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, who as president of the National Association of Manufacturers is often at odds with Mr. Reich. "He's done a pretty good job dealing with conflicting crosscurrents. He's keeping himself focused in an unfocused Administration."
In his own workplace, the Department of Labor, Mr. Reich has been trying out his ideas. As part of Vice President Al Gore's Administration-wide program to shrink bureaucracy, he has established a "reinventing Government" team of union officers, top career staff members and political appointees to review the department's budget and its promotion, training and purchasing policies.
Mr. Reich has made numerous crowd-pleasing gestures. He invited the whole Washington staff to his swearing-in, closed the lush executive dining room and ordered that the intimidating double doors to his second-floor suite be kept open.
Mr. Reich has clearly lifted the spirits of the department's 17,900 workers. "It's a very different day here," said Linda Copening, head of the local of the American Federation of Government Employees that represents Labor Department workers in Washington. "He seems to be practicing what he's preaching."
Mr. Reich is also popular with the press, making light of his scholarship ("My books, once you put them down, you can't pick them up") and his 4-foot-11-inch height ("See. They've already cut me off at the knees"). His agenda for a week in May shows he logged six-and-one-half hours talking to reporters, a half-hour more than he spent with business people, labor leaders and members of Congress combined.
In the struggle over the budget, Mr. Reich has lost some internal disputes with the Administration's more rigorous deficit-cutters, particularly the budget director, Leon E. Panetta. But more than any of his predecessors, Mr. Reich is extending his reach far beyond the confines of his own department.
Mr. Reich's relationship with the labor unions, traditionally an important ally for Democratic administrations, is still being tested.
He has pleased unions by loading his senior staff with at least 10 recruits from organized labor. But unions are miffed by his retreat on the minimum wage and his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. And they doubt that he will lobby hard to keep an expected Senate Republican filibuster from stopping legislation to prevent companies from, in effect, dismissing workers who go on strike.
The biggest conflict with unions is still brewing. A large faction opposes Mr. Reich's notion of labor-management cooperation, an idea at the center of his philosophy. Through his workplace commission, Mr. Reich hopes to rewrite labor laws to encourage formation of labor-management committees.
At some companies, such committees are already at work without Federal goading. "I told him these things are happening because labor and management understand they have to happen, not because of any Government-run thing," said Representative Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania. He said the Government should not mandate something that was happening voluntarily.
 
'Workers Need a Voice'
 Many unions fear that Mr. Reich's committees could become a new avenue for industry to banish unions.
"The one danger I see with Reich," said Edward J. Carlough, president of the sheet metal workers union, "is that there may be a tendency to say, 'Let's establish labor-management cooperation committees all over the place.' But that can't happen in a nonunion atmosphere. It simply can't happen."
Mr. Reich expects his commission to modify the labor laws so unions could still have a place, though he said he would not require a role for them.
"The issue for me is worker voice," Mr. Reich said. "Workers need a voice at the workplace. I'm flexible about where that voice comes from or how it's expressed."
In the past, Mr. Reich has demonstrated that his grand ideas are not necessarily fixed ideas. A decade ago, Mr. Reich and a Rhodes-scholar classmate, Ira Magaziner, argued that the Government could help the economy grow by picking the companies and technologies most likely to thrive in world competition and favoring them with development aid.
Conservatives and moderate Democrats chafed at the notion of a Government that could outsmart the marketplace in selecting winners and losers among companies and industries. And when Mr. Reich saw his notions of industrial policy put to a real test, he reconsidered.
In "The Resurgent Liberal," a 1991 collection of essays, he criticized an ambitious economic development plan that Mr. Magaziner, now senior adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton on health care, devised for Rhode Island in 1983. But Rhode Island voters rejected it 4 to 1.
"Industrial policy is fine so long as it builds on current policies and institutions," Mr. Reich wrote. "But wrap it in an elaborate plan and assign it to a 'strategic commission' comprised of big shots, and you can stuff it."
As Labor Secretary, Mr. Reich has devised a variation on his old notion of industrial policy: Government, not the industries themselves, would pick the skills it believes people need for emerging industries in the marketplace and help train the workers for those industries.
World economic leadership, Mr. Reich wrote two years ago in his book "The Work of Nations," required crews of "symbolic analysts" -- scientists, engineers, lawyers, managers, physicians, writers and others who identify and solve problems, by, as he puts it in his academic jargon "manipulating symbols."
Some people think these theories are no more realistic than the old ones about picking winners in industry. How, they ask, can the Government presume to know what skills the as-yet unknown new industries will need?
"There's a real fallacy in some universities and some parts of government that 'we are knowledgeable and we know what's best for business.' " said Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, an association of 610,000 small businesses.
Mr. Reich says that once people have the right skills the demand for those skills will appear.
"There's no finite number of good jobs out there," he said. "Look at the history of economic development since the Industrial Revolution. Technological change does not reduce the number of jobs."

HEADLINE: Vacationing by Car Makes Its Comeback at Full Speed

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
With gasoline cheap and plentiful, and expected to stay that way through the summer, Americans who put off trips during the economic doldrums of the last few years are hitting the road again.
The American Automobile Association, based on a survey of 1,500 drivers, predicted last week that travel during the Fourth of July weekend would be up 4 percent from the holiday weekend in 1992, with 30 million Americans planning to make trips of 100 miles or more. 
 Most will pump their own gas at self-serve stations and hunt for bargains at motels. Few said they were worried about the prospect of a gas tax of 4 cents to 5 cents a gallon, which seems likely if the tax bill now before Congress is passed.
Indeed, driving is widely seen as economical, compared with flying. The discount fares offered by the airlines are not as steep as they were during a fare war last summer, when ticket prices were slashed by as much as 50 percent. As a result, the number of people traveling by airplane is expected to decline 8 percent from 1992, the survey said.
"There is a new breed of traveler," said Jerry Cheske, the director of public relations for the automobile association. "They shop for vacations much like they shop for a TV or stereo."
Among those who are opting to travel by car is Bill Gardner. He paused a couple of days ago with his wife, Trina, and their three children at a service area on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, while en route to Ocean City, N.J., for a family reunion. They live in Western Springs, Ill., a Chicago suburb.
"It's a lot cheaper than going by plane," he said of the two-day trip in his Plymouth Voyager. The cost of gas is lower than in past years, he has found, and there are bargains at many of the motel chains along the way -- several had rates of $38 for a room, breakfast included.
Perhaps as a result, the automobile association survey found that more people planned to stay in motels this year: 43 percent, up from 37 percent a year ago. Only a quarter said they planned to stay with relatives, down from a third last year.
Few drivers seemed worried about the growing dependence of the United States on foreign oil, which is at an all-time high. About half the oil consumed in the United States in recent months has been from foreign sources.
 
Use of Imported Oil Up

 
 The dependence on imported oil has jumped this year, with consumption of foreign oil up 7.2 percent in May over the corresponding month last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group based in Washington. Of total consumption of 17.1 million barrels a day, imports made up an average of 8.4 million barrels in May. Imports accounted for 49.1 percent of the oil consumed in May, up from 47.6 percent in May of last year.
Many motorists interviewed said that obeying the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit would be dangerous because the general flow of traffic is faster. Faster speeds mean greater gasoline consumption, and greater fuel costs.
Despite consuming extra gas at the faster speeds, motorists still look for bargains when they can find them. And bargains abound, enough of them to more than offset the costs of the proposed gasoline tax.
Nationally, the average price for self-serve regular unleaded gas was $1.12 a gallon last week, down 6.1 cents from a year ago, according to the automobile association. The average price of a gallon of gas in New York State was 5 cents less than it was a year ago, despite a 3-cent rise over the last two months because of high demand.
Prices are approaching the low levels that prevailed before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990. After that they took a huge jump. Recession and higher gas prices kept many travelers at home for the Fourth of July weekend in 1991.
One effect of lower gasoline prices seems to be a return to the free-wheeling speeds of earlier years. Mr. Gardner, like most motorists, said he no longer observed the 55 m.p.h. limit, even though there are reminders everywhere, like the signs in Pennsylvania that emphasize the speed limit is "still 55."
Mr. Gardner said the speed limit was unsafe because the general flow of traffic is 60 to 65 m.p.h. and there are the risks of being tailgated by impatient drivers.
Indeed, during a recent drive on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a steady stream of cars traveling 60 to 65 m.p.h. passed several speed traps without any offenders being stopped.
Tom Culpepper, the manager of safety for the automobile association, said most states had adopted a 65 m.p.h. limit on roads in rural areas, an option allowed by Congress, which adopted the 55 m.p.h. limit to conserve gas during the early 1970's.
A side effect of the lower speed limit was a drop in the rate and severity of collisions, resulting in a decline in highway deaths and injuries for a time. But as gas prices have fallen, the average speed has been rising. Most drivers travel about 65 to 70 m.p.h. on the Interstate highways, Mr. Culpepper said. He said studies have differed on whether the higher speeds had led to an increase in deaths and injuries.
"The motoring public has decided that 55 miles an hour is not a reasonable speed," Mr. Culpepper added. "Historically the public has always responded to unreasonable highway traffic control by simply ignoring it."
Many drivers also appeared to ignore the anticipated bite of the proposed gas tax. Trilby Lundberg, the publisher of the Lundberg Newsletter, which covers the gasoline industry, said the impact of the tax on gas may have little effect at the pump.
Indeed, most drivers said in interviews that they were not worried about the proposed tax. Adding a few cents to the tax, Ms. Lundberg said, would not prove very costly for most Americans -- about $30 to $40 a year for the average family.
 
Demand for Gasoline Up
 Demand for gasoline has risen as drivers in some parts of the country have begun to shake off the recession. Gas sales were up 2 percent last year from the year before, and in May sales were up 1.2 percent over May of last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
Drivers kept costs down during the recession by using cheaper, lower grades of gasoline and pumping it themselves. About 95 percent of the gas sold now is at self-serve pumps.
The effects of the recession, however, have kept some families cautious. At the Thomas A. Edison rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike a couple of days ago, Gerald Goodlin, an auto parts salesman from Bellmore, L.I., said his family would like to make a trip to Florida later this summer but were reluctant because of the cost.
Other drivers had planned their trips far ahead and were determined to make long trips anyway.
Frank McCormack, a Canadian whose motor home was packed with his wife, June, their three children and his mother-in-law, Bertha, had started a vacation from their home on Prince Edward Island and had stopped in New York. Their destination is Vancouver, British Columbia, but they had decided to go the long way around, by way of Nashville.
"We've always wanted to see the States," Mr. McCormack said while getting gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. He said he had been pleasantly surprised by the low gas prices in the United States compared with those in Canada -- which are roughly $2 a gallon -- especially since his mobile home got about 12 miles to the gallon.
Which route did they plan to follow after they visit Nashville? "We're just going to go down the highway," he said with a gleam in his eye.

HEADLINE: U.S. TO ANNOUNCE NEW RUSSIAN PLAN

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is planning to use the economic meeting in Tokyo this week to announce the successful conclusion of talks among European allies and Japan on providing new aid to Russia for economic reforms.
The $500 million that the allies have agreed to provide includes a $125 million commitment from the United States, $120 million from Japan and $80 million from Germany, Administration officials said. 
 Mr. Clinton has been personally telephoning world leaders in a last-ditch effort to assemble an aid package that could be announced this week. On Saturday morning, he won the German commitment after talking to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The balance of the contributions is expected to come from Britain, Italy, France and Canada, whose leaders will all be present at this week's meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations. With the addition of $1.5 billion in aid from the World Bank, officials hope the entire package will reach $2 billion.
 
Clinton Had Sought $4 Billion
 In April, President Clinton, who has been leading the charge for providing international financial help to support President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, asked for $4 billion in international assistance. The money was to be used to help Russia transfer state assets to private control and restructure businesses that had never functioned in a capitalist economy.
But the chances for obtaining that amount of aid faded late last month when Japanese leaders expressed doubts about the plan and Foreign Minister Kabun Muto dismissed such levels as "preposterous." Administration officials have also begun conceding that it is a difficult task to demand that leaders who are weak at home -- as is the case with most of those who will be at the Tokyo conference -- push for a rapid expansion of foreign aid.
"If a leader's popularity and political power falls below a certain threshold, you can't bring them to agree on the time of day," one White House official said.
Administration officials have already begun looking for a way to present the more modest amount as the best choice.
 
Measuring the Pace of Aid
 "Part of what we have to do here is strike a balance between quick and smart," said one senior official involved in the Russia aid plan. "If you push the money out there too fast, it's hard to monitor, hard to make sure it reaches the people it's intended to reach."
Mr. Clinton has been pushing hard for the aid to support Mr. Yeltsin's reform efforts and has demanded frequent updates from his staff on the pace with which the United States has been keeping the commitments it made to the Russian leader during a meeting in Vancouver in April.
When the plan was unveiled in April, the United States agreed to contribute $500 million if the other nations would contribute $1.5 billion and another $2 billion was forthcoming from other international lending agencies.
Even though that amount has now been scaled back sharply, Mr. Clinton is still prepared to present the agreement to provide $500 million as evidence that the United States is following through on its Vancouver commitment.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund approved a $1.5 billion loan to Russia for 1993 after Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen scolded the fund for being to slow to provide the money.

HEADLINE: When Saving Navy Money Costs Jobs

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
When Terry Melan ponders his prospects for surviving the military cuts that will cost him his job at the Charleston Naval Shipyard, he thinks of the last disaster to hit the South Carolina city. It does not brighten his mood.
"They talk about defense conversion, and I think about FEMA," said Mr. Melan, a 39-year-old boiler plate equipment mechanic, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's widely criticized performance after Hurricane Hugo tore Charleston apart in 1989. "My personal opinion is we've been sold down the river." 
 On Friday, President Clinton announced a $5 billion plan to help communities cope with the military's plan to close 129 bases, including 35 major bases like the one in Charleston, and expanding or shrinking 27 others. Mr. Clinton has approved the plan, and Congress is now considering it. Approval is expected because of the lure of saving an expected $3.1 billion in military spending annually after the year 2000.
Nowhere are the immediate costs of a smaller military more stark and the knotty issues of converting from a military-based economy more daunting than in Charleston, where the Navy employs five times as many people as the next largest employer.
 
When 1 in 5 Jobs Vanish
 When the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission voted to close the Charleston Naval Shipyard and Charleston Naval Station, it was a decision that local officials say will cost 26,380 direct military and civilian jobs and about an equal number of nonmilitary jobs that depend on the base. That accounts for about 1 in 5 jobs in the three-county Charleston area, a higher percentage than anyplace else in the United States.
The commission voted to spare Charleston's Naval Hospital and to expand the Naval Electronics Support Center, known as Navelex, adding 2,700 well-paying technology jobs to what will be a 6,000-worker research center.
The outcome will be an almost $2 billion blow to the local economy and the dismantling of what was the largest employer at one site in South Carolina. The state gained national attention last year by luring a new BMW automobile plant that could bring 10,000 jobs to Spartanburg, across the state. Officials estimate the losses in Charleston will be five times the gains from BMW.
"This is a staggering blow, because it's not simply this event in itself," said Kent Bosworth, president of the Bosworth Group, a Charleston marketing firm. "It's the aftermath of Hugo, a flat economy and now this. I think there is not a business that will be untouched."
 
Wounding the Working Class
 Still, the bulk of the impact will not be seen in the Charleston of pastel townhouses, horse-drawn carriages and cobblestone streets that lure tourists. Instead, it will be felt in the working-class neighborhoods of sprawling apartment complexes, trailer parks and neat cottages with weathered fishing boats out front in towns like North Charleston, Hanahan and Goose Creek that live and die with the 2,800-acre naval base, whose roots go back to 1901.
As much as the laid-off workers, the dozens of business that rely on the base will feel the blow of its closing.
"A lot of them won't survive; we know that," said John M. Settle, who this week took over as president of the Charleston Trident Chamber of Commerce. "But our primary short-term goal is to keep consumer confidence up and to show there are ways to help business and industry relocate in the area. We need to convince people this is not going to put us in a depression."
For business people near the base -- like Ron Coley, who runs North Area Transmission, which was started by his grandfather 45 years ago; Sammie Douan at B& S Gun Shop, or Johnny Thigpen at Johnny's restaurant and bar -- it will take some convincing.
"Our property values have dropped to the point where it's not even salable," Mr. Coley said. "At one time, this was the place to be. Now it's really worthless."
 
Good Plan, Bad Timing
 The mechanic, Mr. Melan, said that the President's proposals to cushion the blow were largely a step in the right direction, but that given the severity of the dislocation in Charleston he was skeptical how helpful they would be. And he said some of the recommendations, like a push to expedite base closings so communities could make use of the properties, could hurt workers by cutting down the time their jobs would continue. Charleston officials have already begun mobilizing along the lines of Mr. Clinton's proposal.
"It's good something is being done," Mr. Melan said. "But until we actually see whether it works, I'm not going to put much stock in it."
To some experts, the change in Charleston highlights the most vexing and dangerous byproduct of shrinking the military in a sluggish economy: it is taking away good-paying blue-collar industrial jobs at precisely the time the economy is failing to produce them. Officials say the $30,000-a-year, blue-collar jobs at the base pay about twice as much as the average job in the area.
"Given the end of the cold war, it would be foolish to maintain the military of the size we had, but I just question whether or not we can afford the peace," said J. Michael Morgan, chairman of the economics and finance department at the College of Charleston. "I just don't know where our shipyard workers, who are highly skilled, are going to find jobs."
Charleston officials are lobbying for other government jobs, seeking to have the shutdown stretched over as long a time as possible, lining up economic assistance and job-training programs and trying to woo new businesses.
 
Fishing for New Employers
 State and area leaders led by Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. and Mayor Joseph Riley of Charleston have set up a 37-member commission to coordinate economic development efforts. Mr. Riley said he had already been in contact with one group about a possible private shipbuilding and ship repair operation.
But industry officials say the American shipbuilding business is already facing a depression because of the military cuts and foreign competition subsidized by governments in places like Japan and South Korea.
Charleston officials say that shipbuilding is only one option and that the new high-tech Navelex jobs are more likely to be a central part of a redevelopment strategy in their city. And there is ample reason for long-range optimism about Charleston.
The area's growing tourism, retirement, medical and educational sectors have thus far cushioned the area from smaller, but still substantial, military reductions. Military and related jobs in Charleston have fallen by 9,723 or 21.4 percent since 1989, but total employment has grown by 6.7 percent.
With its combination of rich history, lovely architecture and deep-water industrial amenities, Charleston is hardly a dying town. In fact, the city, which has survived hurricanes, a major earthquake, the Civil War and the rise and fall of other industries, provides ample precedent for surviving hard times.
 
The Silver Lining?

 And most experts agree the current traumas will force the area, which once depended on the military for 60 percent of its economy, to diversify in a way it should have decades ago.
"Twenty years from now, we'll probably say this was the best thing that ever happened to us," said Mr. Settle, "but that won't help those who've lost their jobs in the meantime."
Some say it was a mistake not to plan years ago for a conversion to peacetime uses of military installations.
"Our union was talking about economic conversion 10 years ago, but the Reagan and Bush Administrations wouldn't hear of it; they didn't think we needed it," said Jim Davidson, a 49-year-old marine machinist at the naval shipyard. "Look what's happening now."
But both because of its losses and its strengths, Mr. Riley said, Charleston will be a good test of how traumatic the military cuts will be.
"This is a good, strong community," he said. "We're going to need some help, but we're committed to making this a positive thing. This is a good test market for us to show it can work."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Trade Talks To Resume

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 4

 BODY:
The United States and Japan will resume negotiations on a new comprehensive trade agreement, officials said today, brightening the outlook for President Clinton's meeting this week with the Prime Minister of Japan, Kiichi Miyazawa.
The Clinton Administration has decided that a Japanese compromise proposal, delivered to Washington on Friday, is substantive enough to merit further discussion, according to officials familiar with the negotiations. 
 American negotiators are expected to arrive in Tokyo late Monday night to resume talks that broke off last week in a deadlock. The sticking point was American insistence on setting numerical goals to measure Japan's progress in opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus.
It is still unclear whether an agreement on the so-called economic framework can be reached this week, the original deadline set by the President and the Prime Minister. Certainly, it will be difficult to forge an accord by Tuesday, when the two leaders will meet privately on the eve of the summit conference of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
 
 
Out of the Shadow
 Yet the revival of the negotiations removes a cloud that would have darkened the meeting of the heads of the world's two largest economies. At the very least, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Miyazawa will be able to announce that progress is being made.
There is some speculation in Tokyo that the two leaders may even be able to announce a bare-bones framework, with details to be worked out later. But an incomplete accord would seem to be against the wishes of Mr. Clinton, who has been pushing, aides have said, for a good agreement rather than a quick one.
When Mr. Clinton and Mr. Miyazawa met in Washington in April, they agreed to forge a new framework covering economic relations between the two countries by the time they met again in Tokyo for the Group of Seven conference, which begins on Wednesday. But last week, the United States-Japan talks here broke off when Japan refused to agree to trade benchmarks, saying such measures violate the principles of free trade.
 On Friday, Mr. Miyazawa sent a letter to Mr. Clinton proposing a compromise. The Prime Minister, having lost a no-confidence vote in Parliament last month that is likely to cost him his job, is eager to have a smooth meeting with Mr. Clinton.
As a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said on Friday, insisting on anonymity, "If the Prime Minister who agreed to set up the framework can't work out its details, then the next Prime Minister will find it even more difficult to do so."
By putting his personal stamp on the compromise, Mr. Miyazawa has raised the political ante, making it difficult for the American side to decline to come back to Tokyo for negotiations, even if only as a courtesy. But the resumption of talks does not necessarily mean the United States is enthusiastic about Japan's proposal, said a United States official in Washington, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In its compromise proposal, Japan said it would be willing to establish quantitative or qualitative indexes to measure progress in opening markets or changing its economic structure, although it still would not agree to set targets in advance. For instance, Japan might agree to measure the share of its market held by foreign products in a particular industry but would not set a goal for what that market share should be.
Depending on the exact wording, this proposal might help close the gap with the United States.
 
Refusal to Set Goals
 Japan also said it would agree to take steps to reduce its trade surplus, though it would refuse to set goals for this as well. This offer seems to fall well short of the American request that Japan agree to cut its current- account surplus to 1 and 2 percent of its economic output over the next three years or so, down from more than 3 percent now.
The two nations are seeking a framework that will cover more specific negotiations in the coming months and years.
These negotiations will aim at increasing Japan's markets for particular products, like automobile parts, and for bringing about structural changes in Japan's economy, like deregulating industries. Reduction of the United States budget deficit and American trade barriers are also expected to be subjects of discussion.
The framework is expected to require a consultative committee of officials from both countries to meet regularly to monitor progress. The framework will also call for periodic meetings of the President and the Prime Minister.

Bentsen Criticizes Japan
 WASHINGTON, July 4 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- Japanese officials who recently complained that the Clinton Administration practices managed trade are themselves masters of that trade policy, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said today.
His comments, made on the ABC News program "This Week With David Brinkley," came as he and President Clinton prepared to meet with officials of Japan and other industrial nations in the summit meeting, which begins in Tokyo on Wednesday.
"It's amazing for the Japanese, of all people, to talk about how they're against managed trade," Mr. Bentsen said. "They've done a very effective job of that."

HEADLINE: Giveaways a Cottage Industry in Maine

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me.

 BODY:
Arthur Leach is $11,000 poorer since he sponsored an unsuccessful contest last year to "give away" his waterfront house to the best essayist.
But that has not stopped him from starting another contest, only now he wants to give away the house for a song -- in fact, a jingle of 41 words or less. 
 In Maine, where a sluggish economy has undermined housing prices and driven would-be sellers to unconventional methods to retrieve the money invested in their homes, real estate giveaway contests are becoming almost as common as the tourists who enter them.
Unable to find buyers through more conventional methods, more and more property owners are sponsoring contests in which they try to collect their asking prices by amassing hundreds or thousands of individual entry fees, in some cases up to $250.
 
Innkeepers' Success Story
 The catalyst for the recent interest in contests was the success in May of two innkeepers, Bil and Susie Mosca of Center Lovell, Me., who gave away their country inn through an essay contest that cost $100 to enter. The Moscas' contest attracted 7,000 entrants, but since they were only asking $500,000 for the inn, they are returning the last 2,000 entries.
Since then, the Maine Attorney General's Office has received 3 to 10 calls a day from people interested in running similar contests, said Wayne Moss, an Assistant Attorney General. The contests are legal in Maine if they are "games of skill" rather than gambling.
Mr. Moss said he had discouraged people from sponsoring the contests, warning them of the potential expense and telling them about the Maine residents who had sponsored similar contests that failed.
 
A $31,000 Investment
 In his well-publicized contests, for example, Mr. Leach invested $31,000 in postage, advertising and a toll-free telephone number, which Mr. Leach and his wife, Shirley, staffed themselves. The winner was to be the essayist who wrote most eloquently about why it would be wonderful to live by the ocean in Kennebunkport. But the first contest, which cost $99 to enter, failed to attract half of the 3,500 entrants needed to cover Mr. Leach's investment of nearly $350,000 in the house.
Undaunted, Mr. Leach restructured the contest, giving back the entry fees of those who requested it and offering others the chance to enter a new contest in which the prize would be the cash left after he paid part of his expenses. Ultimately, he recovered $20,000 of his $31,000 investment and awarded a cash prize of $42,000 to a woman in Wellesley, Mass.
Now Mr. Leach is back in the contest business, riding around this oceanside resort town in a two-toned pickup truck with a sign advertising: "Win a Custom House." He still has faith that 7,000 people will send $50 and write a jingle for the chance to win his three-bedroom house. So far, 1,000 people have responded, sending in jingles on the topic: "Why I Would Love to Live on the Coast of Maine." The deadline is Oct. 1.
Noting that there were many second-time entrants, Mr. Leach said he believed that the first contest had helped build his credibility. Local professionals were the judges, as they will be for his current contest.
Joanne Skinner of Acton, Mass., a retired Congressional aide who participated in the Leaches' essay contest, is one of many who has an eye on their house. The two-story gray-shingle house is tucked away on a dead-end street a few miles from the summer home of former President George Bush. She recently returned to Kennebunkport to "gather material" for her jingle.
Mr. Leach, a real estate developer at a time when work is scarce, and his wife, a former bank manager who works at a boat repair shop, bought the house in 1988 as an investment. But like many other people who bought real estate in southern Maine in the late 1980's, the Leaches cannot hope to recoup their money on the conventional market.
Mr. Leach said he had bought the house "at the peak. I paid too much for it, and then the bottom fell out." He hopes that unloading the house through the contest will produce a smaller loss than selling in the current market.
But the couple has already had to dip into savings to pay off home equity loans and other debts, Mrs. Leach said. Noting that her parents had lost a pharmacy in the Depression, she said, "We should have heeded what our parents had known."
If all else fails, Mr. Leach said, he may make a business out of advising others on how to run giveaway contests.

HEADLINE: Ice Cream Brings Call Of Foul Play

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALLKILL, N.Y., July 2

 BODY:
What started out as a campaign gimmick -- the distribution of discount coupons for Dairy Queen treats -- has turned into a criminal investigation.
For some Democrats here, the episode, which has naturally been labeled "Ice Cream-Gate," is providing the sort of tasty summer fare the name connotes. For others, it's another setback in their party's efforts to gain strength in Republican-dominated Orange County. 
 Peter Panse, a 42-year-old high school art teacher who is running for Town Supervisor here, handed out campaign leaflets containing coupons for discounts on ice cream, frozen yogurt and soft drinks at a Dairy Queen in neighboring Middletown. Next to the coupons, a brief message trumpets Mr. Panse as the candidate of honest government, saying, "So help yourself to delicious savings from Dairy Queen -- and vote yourself a brighter future in the Democratic primary."
 
Inquiry by District Attorney
 The Orange County District Attorney, Francis D. Phillips, is investigating whether Mr. Panse offered the coupons in an attempt to induce voters to sign petitions for him.
Mr. Panse said he had given the coupons to everyone he approached, whether or not they signed.
If found guilty of violating the state election law, Mr. Panse could face up to a year in jail and a fine of $1,000, Mr. Phillips said. If some of Mr. Panse's petitions are invalidated, forms that Mr. Panse and supporters carried for seven other county and town candidates could also be thrown out, said David Flanagan, spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections.
Mr. Phillips said he expects his investigation to be completed around the July 15 filing deadline for the Sept. 14 primary.
One of Mr. Panse's opponents for the Democratic nomination, Nina DeSocio, wrote a letter of protest to the county Board of Elections, which forwarded the complaint to Mr. Phillips. "The Democrats have had a very hard time establishing the Democratic Party as a viable presence in Orange County," she wrote. "To have this destroyed cannot be allowed."
 
Still Seeking Signatures
 Shirley Jensen, the county's Republican election commissioner, said she has never heard of a complaint like this in her 13 years on the job. "I just wonder why a person running in one town would have coupons for a business in another town," she said.
Mr. Panse, who said he wanted to promote small businesses, said the Town of Wallkill and the city of Middletown are "linked economically and socially." His stepdaughter Claudine Rietsch, a graduate student at Baruch College and treasurer of the Orange County Democratic Party, has worked on and off at the Dairy Queen since high school.
Mr. Pansesaid the controversy has helped his campaign by giving him greater name recognition. He and his wife, Susan Rietsch-Panse, the chairwoman of the Wallkill Democratic Committee, have started a new quest for the 189 signatures necessary to get on the ballot. This time, they're leaving the coupons home.
"It's ridiculous that these people are really suggesting that signatures or votes could be purchased for as little as two dollars," Mr. Panse said.
 
'Mockery of Our Election'
 Joseph DeStefano, chairman of the Orange County Democratic Party, likened the coupons to the pens and combs that candidates hand out.
The difference, Ms. DeSocio said, a 44-year-old freelance accountant, is that the coupons have "a redeemable value."
"He's making a mockery of our election," she said.
The third Democratic candidate in the race is the incumbent, Bill Cummings, who has been Town Supervisor for two years. His view: Mr. Panse "should just say, 'Hey, I made a mistake,' and move on from there."
Mr. DeStefano said he is worried the inquiry will hurt the party's chances in November against the Republican candidate, Howard Mills. There are 4,360 registered Republicans and 3,726 Democrats in Wallkill, a town of roughly 23,000 people about 60 miles northeast of New York City.
"This is something that doesn't belong in a district attorney's office," Mr. DeStefano said. "There are so many problems in this county they should focus on, like drugs and crime, and let the politicians play politics."
 
All Smiles at Dairy Queen
 If the controversy has caused headaches for the county Democratic Party, it has been a bonanza for the Dairy Queen owner, Michael D'Ascheberg.
Mr. D'Ascheberg, who says he does not support Mr. Panse, has redeemed more than 100 coupons. He said that Mr. Panse had paid the cost of printing the coupons and that the store had supplied the ice cream.
"I've had orders from as far away as Tuxedo and Greenwood Lake," he said. "People call up and say: 'We didn't realize there's a Dairy Queen in the area. We're going to buy our cakes from you from now on.'
"If people think this will put a candidate over the top, tell President Clinton, Ross Perot and the Republican challenger to come to Middletown and see me."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Uproar on TV Violence Frustrates the Networks

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Despite the criticism of broadcast networks heard in Congressional hearings during the last several weeks, and the campaigns by interest groups to censor programming deemed too violent for young viewers, there is strong evidence that network series are less violent now than in decades.
Executives of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox Broadcasting say the shows that people are most upset about are not even on the networks but on cable or independent stations. Still, the executives realize that they are the ones on the political hot seat, and they are concerned that their business will be significantly hurt. 
 Several network executives called the Congressional hearings into violence on television ill-informed, unsophisticated and motivated by the chance to make political gains against an easy target, network television.
Specifically, they emphasized that singling out network programming as excessively violent was unfair. "It is completely frustrating because there has been such a significant reduction in violence on network shows," said Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment. "There hasn't been this little violence on the network in decades."
 
Fewer Crime Dramas
 The evidence suggests that Mr. Littlefield is right. Ten years ago, the prime-time schedules of ABC, CBS and NBC -- Fox did not exist then -- included at least 16 shows that could be labeled "crime dramas." Among the shows heavy on gunplay and fisticuffs were "T. J. Hooker," "Matt Houston," "Chips" and "Magnum P.I."
Twenty years ago, there were 20 crime, spy and cowboy dramas, including such memorably macho entries as "Streets of San Francisco," "The Rookies," "Mod Squad," and "Hawaii Five-O."
The past television season had just a smattering of crime-oriented shows, including "Law and Order," "Homicide" and "The Hat Squad." But the first two were almost entirely about police procedures, not about street chases and fistfights.
Far and away the most common shows on network television today are sitcoms. One reason action series have largely disappeared is economic reality: the networks know they cannot match the spectacular displays of action and violence now available in expensive "Rambo"- and "Terminator"-type films. So they have moved away from that genre.
The network executives tried to make this case during the Congressional hearings, pointing out that the most graphic violence on television takes place either on cable channels, where even the goriest films run uncensored, or on independent channels (like WPIX and WWOR in New York), which also have less stringent standards for violent content.
One fact weakens the networks' arguments: the recent proliferation of made-for-TV films based on lurid real-life stories. Several of those films turned up in May, during the intense ratings competition known as a sweeps month. "The timing of the May movies was singularly bad," said Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group.
Faced with the threat of legislation that might hurt their business even more, the networks felt obliged to respond. They agreed last week to precede programs that are particularly violent with an announcement to parents that says so.
Some network executives fear that the announcement -- "Due to some violent content, parental discretion advised" -- will only drive away nervous advertisers. A warning label "has the potential to cost us up to $20 million next fall," Mr. Stringer said.
Richard J. Glosman, the chairman of Creative Media, a company that buys television time for advertisers, said, "A warning label is probably going to make squeamish advertisers even more squeamish."
 
The Network Dilemma
 Mr. Stringer said increased advertiser skittishness would worsen a perennial problem for the networks in their competition with cable: all network revenue comes from advertising, while cable networks make money in two ways, from advertising and from fees paid by subscribers.
The network executives who believe they were scapegoated said some members of Congress who criticized them did not seem to understand the difference between network and other forms of television.
Some executives said it was apparent that the politicians watched very little television. One executive said that despite long interview sessions with network officials, some committee staff members never understood the difference between the stations that a network owns and its affiliates, which are owned by other companies.
David Westin, the senior vice president of Capital Cities Communications, parent of ABC, said, "We were certainly struck by the lack of sophistication about the difference between network television and cable television and local television."
Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who headed the Senate committee looking into television violence, disputed the accusation. He said his staff had come to "understand the field" before the hearings were held.
"I'm not suggesting they are any worse than cable," Mr. Simon said of the networks. "But to say there has been a drastic reduction in violence, I think the May sweeps give you a good idea that that's not true."
 
Amy, Amy, Amy
 Indeed, the networks showed movies in May like "Murder in the Heartland," about a serial killer, and other films based on true-crime stories. Last winter, three networks showed movies based on the Amy Fisher case on Long Island.
These movies do well in the ratings and can also cost less to produce because they do not require writers to devise original stories. These movies are also easier to promote because they have notoriety built in.
Mr. Simon said, "The evidence is overwhelming that television adds to violence in our society," a point he said was supported by network executives, including Mr. Stringer and Mr. Littlefield, in the news conference held last week to announce the parental advisory. Mr. Simon also said it was fair to single out the networks because "they reach the largest audience and they are culprits."
Network executives did not deny that they had economic incentives to oppose further concessions on violence. Foremost is the fear that viewers who enjoy action-oriented shows will simply abandon network television.
Mr. Littlefield gave an example of how viewers might look elsewhere for excitement. He noted a recent decision at his network not to buy the broadcast rights to the movie "Falling Down," which starred Michael Douglas as an ordinary urban resident who, caught in one too many traffic jams, goes on a violent rampage.
"We screened it," Mr. Littlefield said. "And we knew right away it would never appear on our network. So we passed on it."
He added, "We also know that independent stations will buy it, will run it uncut -- and will clobber us."

HEADLINE: Easy Prey for a Violent Criminal;
Prostitutes View Murder as Just One Occupational Hazard

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
The 23-year-old prostitute, who says her name is Margie, walked the stroll off Allen Street in lower Manhattan in a baggy black halter top and baggier jeans, eyeing every passing car.
She said she had seen Joel Rifkin, who the police say is New York's latest serial killer, circling the neighborhood in his white pickup, soliciting prostitutes. She even knew a few women who had dated him. But she didn't want to talk about it. Or even hear of it. 
 "Don't talk to me about no serial killer," she said wearily. It was late, after 1 A.M., and she needed money for a cocaine fix. "I don't want to hear any more bad news about the Life. I've been working six years. It's bad enough."
In the week since Mr. Rifkin, an unemployed gardener from East Meadow, L.I., confessed to killing 17 women he said were prostitutes, women like Margie have been forced to confront, or ignore, the reality that so many women disappeared without attracting notice.
Many prefer to ignore it. Even as the authorities were sorting out Mr. Rifkin's murderous stories, prostitutes were going about their business throughout the city, in force, as usual. For them, serial killers are just another occupational hazard. Violence is the nature of the beast. And working girls, as prostitutes like to be called, often disappear, never to be heard from again.
 
Violent Crimes and Unexplained Disappearances
 Outside the world of prostitution, Mr. Rifkin has underscored what is obvious to those within -- that prostitutes, anonymous and reviled by society, are the criminal's easiest targets. In recent interviews with a dozen prostitutes in Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens, every woman recounted instances in which she was beaten, robbed, raped or stabbed. They all said they knew someone who had been murdered or someone who had disappeared.
"One sicko isn't going to stop girls from working," said a 27-year-old woman standing with her pimp in front of a no-name hotel on 25th Street and Lexington Avenue. Like most of the other women interviewed, she did not want to talk much about Mr. Rifkin. "There are a lot of sick men out there," she said. "Most of them are sick, in fact."
In fact, they are seldom shocked when the quiet, polite man-next-door is exposed as a violent criminal. The meek accountant who does your taxes could be the same man who likes to beat prostitutes bloody, they say, and the upstanding judge who goes to church every Sunday could be the "date" who buys a couple of working girls for rough sex every Tuesday and Thursday. Prostitutes follow a credo: expect the worst.
They often get it.
 
Crimes Are Seldom Reported
 But driven by the demands of drugs or pimps that keep them hustling long hours, and their fear of the police, most prostitutes say working girls never take the time to report crimes against them. And they seldom report the disappearance of an acquaintance on the streets.
"I don't think we watch out for each other as much as we should," said a 28-year-old woman who identified herself as D. She works the Queens side of the Queensboro Bridge and has noticed that another prostitute has been missing for about eight weeks, she said.
"I'm worried about her," she said. "But sometimes a girl moves, or she gets arrested."
On the stroll, in a desolate warehouse area where most of the working girls are drug addicts, D. has been raped, she said, eight or nine times. She said she had told the police about a pack of 40 to 50 boys from nearby projects who like to chase and rape prostitutes. But the police said they deserved it, she said bitterly.
 
'They Almost Caught Me'
 "About four or five years ago, they almost caught me," she said of the pack of boys. "I was screaming down the street and cars were passing as if it were all right." Another prostitute, who was in a cab with a date, let her in the car just as the pack was almost upon her, she added.
To survive, prostitutes say they have to follow their instincts when it comes to choosing their clients, or dates. Men dressed in business suits and driving new cars are considered safer than men in pickup trucks and vans. And a car that spends too much time circling the area prostitutes stroll is often considered suspicious.
"You can tell by the way someone talks to you, or looks," said the woman in front the hotel at 25th Street and Lexington. "But you never can tell." She remembered one time she agreed to let a date take her from Manhattan to his house on Long Island. "He was a short, fat guy with glasses," she said. When they got to his house, he put his hand over her mouth and said he was going to rape her. "I started screaming and I kicked out his window and ran," she said.
In recent months, she added, prostitutes in the neighborhood became the target of a man who would lure the women into his car, smash their heads with a brick hidden in a paper bag, then slash their throats. "He didn't kill anyone, but he came close," she said.
 
'I Don't Want to Be Out Here'
 The last time she was almost killed, Zulma, a 34-year-old heroin addict who strolls the streets under the elevated tracks in Morris Park in the Bronx, vowed never to get into a car with a date she considered suspicious. The date who stabbed her had pierced her abdomen and scarred her legs. But when she needs a fix, she sometimes breaks her vow. "I don't want to be out here, taking all this abuse," she said, adding quietly, "I used to be pretty."
Prostitutes who are pimped are often abused by the men who are paid supposedly to protect them. "The girls are completely loyal to the pimps; they never turn them in," said Lieutenant John Gilchrist of the Public Morals Division of the Manhattan South Precinct.
But outreach workers and the police say that crack addicts who have turned to prostitution to support their habit are the most vulnerable on the streets, since they tend to jump in the first car that stops for them.
"The women we see are resourceless," said Allannah Thomas, a project manager for the Foundation for Research on Sexually Transmitted Diseases, which distributes condoms, conducts H.I.V. testing and provides other outreach services to prostitutes throughout New York City.
"The women are hurt by dates, by their personal partners and in the course of drug transactions. A lot of times people come up to us and ask us to dress wounds."
 
'You Never Really Know'
 Ricardo Ayala, an outreach worker for the foundation, said that in the two years since he began driving the foundation's van, distributing condoms and testing women for H.I.V., he has noticed that many women simply disappear.
"Sometimes the girls tell us about the ones that disappear," he said. "They tell us this woman moved, this one died, this one was killed. But you never really know."
On Thursday night, the van cut short its rounds in a warehouse district in Long Island City because two men who prey on prostitutes, robbing and raping them at knifepoint, had scared the working girls away.
"These guys intimidated the women; they've all left," said Mr. Ayala. "You see, they tell us about these things that happen to them -- getting raped and stabbed and robbed, but no one ever does anything to help them."
Lisa, who has been a prostitute for about five years to support a drug habit and strolls the Allen Street area, has learned the warning signs of a violent date through trial and error.
 
Almost Killed
 "The first couple of years, I got raped so many times it stopped bothering me," she said early Friday morning, as she stood against an apartment house waiting for her boyfriend to bring her drugs. Once, she said, a man almost strangled her. He became violent after she tried to jump from his car when he demanded his money back because he had failed to reach an orgasm.
By the time she starting seeing Mr. Rifkin circle the neighborhood, she said, she had honed her street smarts. She remembered he seemed nervous, and she said she does not get in a car with a man who seems nervous.
The woman on 25th Street and Lexington, who has been working the streets for 10 years, said most experienced working girls know how to use their heels and nails as weapons. A small woman, under 5 feet tall and 100 pounds, she keeps her nails, painted bright pink, two inches long. Her shoes, pink strappy sandals, have four-inch heels.
"These go a long way," she said, lifting her leg to show her heels. "You have to be prepared to kill somebody or be killed."

HEADLINE: Asia and Italy Are Fruitful For Investors

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The Government is collapsing and the economy stalling, but the Japanese stock market is doing just fine. The Japanese recovery, evident on the stock exchange floor but absent elsewhere, continued in the second quarter, far outpacing the returns from most of the world's other leading markets in the second quarter.
American investors in other international markets found that currency losses aggravated weak performances by most major European markets, leaving French stocks at the bottom in dollar terms and German stocks not much better. The best returns among the 24 leading world markets came in Italy, where elections and investigations of political corruption have brought hopes of political changes. 
 In regional terms, East Asian markets seemed to offer the best returns for Americans. Investors in Japan gained almost equally from higher stock prices and a stronger yen. Stocks advanced 9.5 percent in terms of the yen, and 17.9 percent in dollars, as the Japanese currency reached record highs.
 
'Starved for Growth'
 Asia's emerging markets, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, had double-digit advances: in their own currencies and in dollars.
"The world is starved for growth," said Steven Nagourney, the chief global strategist at Lehman Brothers. "The prospects for growth remain greatest in the Far East."
Hong Kong has also gained from reduced tensions between Britain and China. The falling value of the currency in China, where many Hong Kong companies have partnerships and plants, has caused Hong Kong stocks to retreat from their highs.
American stocks were off just a fraction of a percent during the quarter, with the advantage of low interest rates offset by slow economic growth.
Strategists said the prospects would continue to be better abroad, especially for those who could handle volatile currencies.
 
Hedging Risks
 As economies in Europe continue to stagger, said David C. Roche, a global strategist at Morgan Stanley, governments are likely to cut interest rates. Stocks would then rise, but currencies would plummet, so American investors should hedge their risks. "Nobody in their right mind wants to own a European currency," he said.
The recent splintering of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party amid scandal and a slowing economy caused stocks there to give up only a slice of their gains. The Government has embarked on huge spending programs and prodded financial institutions to pour money into stocks.

HEADLINE: Haitian General Begins a Selling Job;
Haitians in U.S. Hopeful

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Haitian immigrants in New York spoke with great caution about the latest sign that democracy would be restored to their homeland. But in the end, there was more hope than misgiving in their voices.
Haitians around the city went about their normal routines yesterday, gathering in churches, barber shops and restaurants, where they eagerly exchanged news from back home. 
 There was no great celebration, only the crossing of fingers by those huddled over newspaper reports and hopeful prayers including those of a Haitian congregation in Flatbush, Brooklyn.
 
'Wait and See'
 "People are skeptical," said the Rev. Rollin Darbouze, the pastor of Holy Cross Church at 2530 Church Avenue in Brooklyn, which for years has provided food and lodging to refugees from Haiti. "Things can change in an instant, and then we're back where we started. That's why we have to wait and see."
On a day when Americans were celebrating their nation's independence, many immigrants recalled the price their compatriots in Haiti had paid under the military leaders who ousted President Aristide.
They spoke of their homeland's abject poverty, brutal political repression and hunger, wondering among themselves about the wisdom of an accord that would allow the military to remain in place until President Aristide returned, and possibly afterward.
"There is great reason to be concerned," said Jean Mercius, 39, the owner of a clothing store on Flatbush Avenue. "The problem is that the crime organization -- those who brought the coup -- are still in town."
Mr. Mercius, whose father helped organize support for Father Aristide's election in 1990, added, "These people still have much political and economic influence, and it will be very hard for them to go away."

HEADLINE: Keep the Aid Flowing to Russia

 BODY:
Economic reform in Russia is alive and surprisingly well. Finally, the West is taking notice and moving to provide real help. Last week the International Monetary Fund handed Russia $1.5 billion. The World Bank has approved a mammoth $660 million loan to develop Russia's oil industry, and dispersed hundreds of millions to pay for medicine and other needed imports.
President Clinton deserves credit for persuading his allies to aid Russia. He pressured the I.M.F. to provide money before Russia could complete key reforms; he orchestrated the West's offer of a $28 billion package in April and pushed a $2.5 billion bilateral aid bill through the House. 
 This week when leaders from the seven leading industrialized nations meet at the economic summit in Tokyo, they're expected to approve Mr. Clinton's plan to create a fund to help privatize Russian firms. These are worthy ways to help Russia build a market-based economy and reel a former foe firmly into the Western orbit.
Prices in Russia rose an astonishing 2,000 percent in 1992. Russia was on the verge of hyperinflation created by irresponsible monetary and fiscal policies. But after victory in the April referendum, President Boris Yeltsin gained a measure of control. His Government has begun to cut back spending by raising energy prices and reducing subsidies to state-owned enterprises. And the central bank has raised interest rates and pledged to pull back on explosive increases in the money supply.
These policies aren't yet tough enough -- which is why the I.M.F. had previously refused to release aid. But Mr. Yeltsin complained that without aid to ease the pain, he couldn't overcome opposition to tighter fiscal and monetary policies. The United States agreed, urging the monetary fund to provide aid on the basis of the steps Mr. Yeltsin has already taken and those his Government has pledged for the future. Last week, the I.M.F. signed on.
The Yeltsin Government's most spectacular economic achievement to date has been the rapid privatization of thousands of state enterprises. But merely turning firms over to private owners doesn't accomplish very much. For those firms to prosper, they need cash to buy modern equipment and technical help. To that end, Mr. Clinton proposed an innovative solution: the West would create a $4 billion fund to provide equity in newly privatized firms. But Japan and other allies shamefully balked at the cost.
Mr. Clinton has lobbied hard to get the allies to commit at least $2 billion to start the privatization fund; this week he's expected to prevail. The Western leaders meeting in Tokyo also need to reaffirm the $28 billion pledge they made in the spring. Mr. Clinton's next task is to convince the Senate to follow the lead of the House and pass his bilateral aid package. These measures taken together could keep Russian reforms on a roll.
Western leaders will address other issues in Tokyo: completing the all-important Uruguay Round of international trade talks and coordinating recovery from worldwide recession. But agreement on these issues is probably beyond reach.
Agreement on aid to Russia, however, is possible. At previous summits, Mr. Yeltsin heard lots of dandy promises from the West. He's now kept his end of the bargain. What he needs to see, when he visits the summit on Friday, is cash. His success is vital to the security of the West, as well as to the lives of ordinary Russians.

'We Hold (Some) Truths . . .'

 BODY:
Americans deem it self-evident that men and women everywhere are created equal, with the same universal right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, just as the Declaration of Independence says. But third-world countries like Indonesia say otherwise, claiming that human rights vary in place and time, and that enforcement is "the competence and responsibility of each government."
Decoded, that seems to say that human rights are what local police say they are -- which is ridiculous and reprehensible. Yet having proclaimed universal principles, Americans once indulged in the same shameless reasoning. Americans not only permitted slavery at home, but with bolder effrontery resisted an international effort to end the slave trade at sea. 
 This self-critical note is certainly not amiss on a weekend of noisy self-congratulation.
After the final defeat of Napoleon, the victorious European allies gathered at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to negotiate an enduring settlement. One item on a crowded agenda was the slave trade. The British Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh, worked diligently to win approval of a declaration calling for total abolition of "a commerce so odious and so strongly condemned by the laws of religion and nature."
It was perhaps the first multinational attempt to end a human rights crime. Sanctions were proposed, and a "watching committee" instituted to monitor compliance. But the United States, while paying lip service to the cause, failed to enforce, or let Britain enforce, maritime measures against slavers.
The Vienna declaration came after decades of ineffective attempts by individual nations, beginning with Denmark in 1792, to abolish slave trading. By 1807, the British Parliament called for total suppression, and a year later, the U.S. Congress adopted similar legislation. Nevertheless, the trade flourished. Finally, at Vienna, Britain pressed for an international right of visit and search on the high seas, with the Royal Navy serving as policeman.
Castlereagh then sought American agreement on a mutual but limited right of search, but was informed by a U.S. diplomat that this was not adaptable to U.S. institutions. So began an argument that lasted for decades over suppressing the slave trade. Not until 1842 did the two countries approve a compromise treaty giving joint English and American squadrons a right to search.
The result was summarized by the distinguished maritime historian Samuel Eliot Morison:
"Laws of the U.S. and of almost every Western nation declared the African slave trade to be piracy, punishable by death; but prior to the Lincoln Administration, no American citizen was executed for the offense. Laws against it either were not enforced, or were so construed that traffic in human flesh was protected by the American flag.
"The British Navy was the only force seriously trying to suppress the trade; but successive administrations, faithful to the obsolete issue of visit and search, refused permission to the British to search American vessels. A slave ship only had to raise the 'proud banner of freedom' to evade search and escape."
In self-exculpation, some Americans discerned a hidden motive. Britain had slaves enough in the West Indies, they pointed out, and could afford high moral ground. Besides, by weakening America's slave-based economy, Britain could dump on European markets stockpiles of colonial goods accumulated during a long war with France.
Doubtless self-interest played its part in Britain, as it did in America's evasion of suppression measures. But if economic changes underlay abolition of the slave trade, that does not diminish the great work of humanitarians. In the words of the British scholar Basil Davidson, no apologist for colonialism, "It was thanks to them that abolition came in the first years of the 19th century and not later, perhaps much later."
Yet in this struggle, Americans sat on their hands, sniped at British motives and let their flag cloak a criminal traffic. The U.S. position then was as morally indefensible as Indonesia's today. -- KARL E. MEYER

HEADLINE: Election Campaign In Japan Shadows the Summit Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 4

 BODY:
This week was supposed to be the crowning moment in Kiichi Miyazawa's political life: a chance for Japan's urbane, English-speaking Prime Minister to welcome the leaders of the industrialized world -- and Boris N. Yeltsin -- to an economic powerhouse that he helped to rebuild from rubble.
But Mr. Miyazawa could not spare the time this morning to review the giant briefing books for the summit meeting or inspect the work of the 36,000 police officers who have turned Tokyo into a barricaded camp. 
 Instead, he was standing atop a truck at 10:30 A.M. in one of the city's busiest intersections, wearing pristine white gloves and a giant white flower in his lapel, pleading with Sunday shoppers not to make the most historic week of his leadership one of the last.
 
The Elections Are Coming!
 Only two days before a parade of prime ministers and presidents arrive for the Group of Seven summit meeting, the talks could hardly be further from the minds of Japan's leaders.
Two weeks from today the nation faces an election that seems certain to end nearly four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. And as the leadership tries to stop a hemorrhage of support, the summit meeting has become something of an annoyance.
To many, President Clinton has become a downright hazard to their hold on office. As he prepared to leave Washington, Mr. Clinton made clear that he hoped the political turmoil in Japan would produce a government more willing to open its markets and a leadership that included "consumer advocates."
While too little time has passed for such comments to resound here in Tokyo, they seemed to put Mr. Clinton squarely on the side of the new opposition parties and the 57 defectors from the Liberal Democrats who have wiped out Mr. Miyazawa's majority in Parliament and forced the July 18 election. Campaigning began today.
 
Trying to Keep Profile Low
 A senior Administration official said the President's remarks, reported Saturday in The Washington Post, were observations, not expressions of advocacy. "He was reflecting on long-term trends in Japan that put greater emphasis on the consumer and the demands especially of younger Japanese for improvement of their standard of living," the official said.
But while American officials here say the President would try to stay neutral, the United States Embassy hustled over the weekend to arrange for President Clinton to meet the leaders of the new opposition parties.
The President will be lucky if he finds many of Japan's leaders in town. Most are on the hustings, mindful that they have only 14 days to save their jobs. Mr. Miyazawa seemed to set the tone when he spent the morning warning voters of the disasters that could befall their country if the Liberal Democrats, who have ruled since 1955, are turned out of office.
 
Accentuating the Negative
 "At a time of crisis, we need a firm party in charge of political power, steering the country," he told the early morning shoppers. The defectors from the party, he warned, are forming an "unprincipled alliance" with the Socialists.
Indeed, the Liberal Democrats' strategy appears to be to run a thoroughly negative campaign, portraying its challengers as unfit to direct the world's second-largest economy and ignoring the rampant corruption that led to the party's disgrace.
But opposition leaders like Morihiro Hosokawa, the head of the Japan New Party, which is expected to gain 40 or so seats, argues, "This is the election with a clear point -- whether to say sayonara to one-party rule."
Statistically it would be almost impossible for the Liberal Democrats to win the 256 seats they need to control the lower house of Parliament.
 
Who Is to Be in Charge?
 The question is whether a new coalition government will be led by the Liberal Democrats, or whether the opposition groups can overcome their many differences and build a coalition that excludes the party.
Mr. Miyazawa's efforts today to acknowledge that "political reform is the voice of the people" have not been helped by two prominent members of his Cabinet. Finance Minister Yoshihiro Hayashi and Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura apparently never got the word that when the main campaign issue is influence-peddling, you are supposed to be against it.
Over the last week or so, both men approached top executives of companies they regulate -- banks and construction concerns -- and asked them for campaign contributions. This is entirely legal, as long as the companies do not exceed the certain limits.
 
Well, Semi-reform, Anyway
 Even though the Miyazawa Government is claiming that it will finally cut the collusive tie between money and politics, the two ministers seemed startled that anyone saw a problem with raising money from companies that depend on them for favors.
As the campaign kicked off and the security net around the capital tightened, it became clear to the 29 million people in Greater Tokyo that this would be an excellent time to leave.
Those daring to drive to the city center were being pulled over and asked politely to open their car trunks and explain their business. Subway stations have been covered with posters saying "Remember the summit seven years ago? We ask for your cooperation this time, again." In Japanese terms, "cooperation" is a nice way of suggesting that you get out of the way.
Already the roadblocks have prompted complaints, mostly from lawyers who say they impinge on personal liberty. But the annoyance arose partly because the police have been so conspicuous recently: similar security surrounded the royal wedding in June, and the roadblocks set up then were never really dismantled.
Divers are also patrolling the waters near Haneda Airport, and plainclothes police have been practicing mock assaults on the baroque state guest house, on the grounds of Akasaka Palace. (Their favorite new gizmo is a triumph of James Bond sleekness and Japanese ingenuity: an ordinary-looking lectern equipped with a desk-top that springs up into a bulletproof shield at the first sign of trouble.)
 
Bombs Left, Pickets Right
 Police officials say they face two threats to an orderly summit meeting -- from Japan's radical left and from its well-financed right.
It was the leftists who rained homemade rockets near the Akasaka Palace during the last summit meeting here, in 1986. The police say they recently found evidence that the group, the Chukakuha, has been developing a rocket with greater range.
The rightists are stirring more excitement this time because of the expected arrival of Mr. Yeltsin. The Russian President has been allowed to bring 60 bodyguards because, apparently, the memories are fresh of an attack in 1891 against Czar Nicholas II. During a visit to Japan as a crown prince, he was slashed with a sword while touring Kyoto.
The right wing's favorite cause is the return of four islands in the Kuriles that the Soviet Union seized in the closing days of World War II.
In ordinary times the police would simply ban the rightists' elaborate sound trucks from around the Russian Embassy. But the law specifically prohibits limits on campaigning by election candidates, and the rightists are fielding several.

EXPLOSION IN SEOUL
 SEOUL, South Korea, Monday, July 5 (AP) -- An explosion today rocked the Seoul hotel where President Clinton is scheduled to stay this week, injuring three workers and forcing the evacuation of 600 guests, the police said. They ruled out the possibility of a bomb.
The blast occurred in the boiler room in the basement of the Hyatt Regency Hotel about 6:40 A.M. The exact cause was unknown, the police said.
A White House spokesman, Jeff Eller, said there was "no evidence that it was any kind of explosive device."
Mr. Clinton is to stay at the hotel Saturday and Sunday after a three-day summit meeting in Tokyo.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Making Gains Among Hispanic Voters

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 1

 BODY:
The photographs of Robert F. Kennedy posing with Cesar Chavez during a hunger strike three decades ago are no longer living room fixtures in the barrios here. "Viva Bush" placards were popular last year. Now, some Hispanic households proudly display photos of Richard Riordan, this city's new Republican Mayor, who won a surprisingly large portion of the Hispanic vote.
Hispanic voters have historically been in the Democratic camp, and most still are. But they are not the reliable Democrats they once were. They are increasingly less willing to cast votes for an all-Democratic ticket. Hispanic support for Republican candidates in recent elections here and in Texas suggest that some of these voters are slowly, yet unmistakably, changing sides. 
 The Hispanic population in the United States is relatively young and makes up one of the largest pools of potential voters. So the Republican Party is aggressively courting middle-class Hispanic Americans with a message of family values, law and order and opposition to abortion.
 
Lapse by Democrats
 "They're getting a bigger share of the vote and I'm extremely concerned," said Domingo A. Garcia, the Mayor pro tem of Dallas, who heads the Democratic National Committee's Hispanic caucus. "The Democratic Party has not done a good job of reaching out to the growing Latino population in the United States. The Republicans are filling the vacuum and are building coalitions, appealing to issues like family values that have wide appeal in our community."
By seeking alliances with Hispanic voters, Republicans hope to gain an edge in close races and are threatening the Democratic Party's tradition of building powerful ethnic coalitions.
While Cuban-Americans, spurred by strong sentiments against Fidel Castro and Communism, have long tended to vote Republican, an interest in Republican politics is spreading to other Hispanic voters who had been considered part of the Democratic constituency.
In contrast, blacks continue to vote overwhelmingly Democratic and show no signs of switching parties. Asian-Americans are not quite as lock step in their support for Democrats, but they generally vote with that party. And in large pivotal states, Hispanic residents make up a far larger percentage of the pool of prospective voters than do Asians.
In the mayoral race in New York this year, Republicans are running highly visible voter-registration drives in some Hispanic neighborhoods. Herman Badillo, the city's first Puerto Rican-born member of Congress, dropped out of the mayoral race to run for comptroller on a ticket with Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is challenging Mayor David N. Dinkins, under the Republican and Liberal Party labels. Mr. Giuliani is seeking to attract support from the Hispanic and Jewish voters who voted for the Democratic Mayor in 1989.
The most recent example of Republican appeal to Hispanic voters was the election last month of Mayor Riordan. Though he did not win a majority of the Hispanic vote, Mr. Riordan made significant inroads, drawing 43 percent, as against 57 percent for his Democratic opponent, Michael Woo, according to a Los Angeles Times poll. By contrast, Mr. Riordan's share of the black vote was only 14 percent.
"Woo should have gotten 70 percent," said Richard Martinez, regional director of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. "It was his to lose. He didn't talk to the Latino community. Most campaign managers don't see the growth of Latino voters; they believe that the Latino vote is apathetic. They're nuts. We outregistered Anglos and blacks last year."
In Texas, three days before the election in Los Angeles, Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Republican candidate, was elected Senator in a landslide in which she carried heavily Hispanic South Texas, 60 percent to 40 percent. While the Democratic incumbent, Bob Krueger, still carried most of the Hispanic vote statewide, Mrs. Hutchison's support demonstrates the potential for what Texas Republican leaders contend is a new winning coalition of urban Republicans, rural conservatives and Hispanic Americans.
Although Democrats still won a majority of the Hispanic vote in the Texas and Los Angeles races, Republican support from those voters was significant. It at least partly reflected that Republicans were far more aggressive than Democrats in running Spanish-language advertising campaigns and phone banks to get Hispanic voters to the polls.
"We're not the enemy like we used to be 20 years ago," said Tirso del Junco, a Cuban-American who heads the California Republican Party. "The Hispanic community identified with Mr. Riordan on jobs and economics and family. There is a notion out there that Hispanics are interested in social issues and that's it. I suggest that's not the case."
Even as more Hispanics voters back Republican candidates, Hispanic politics is still dominated by Democrats. But that, too, shows signs of shifting.
"Latinos are no longer to be taken for granted as being in one corner or another," said Gaddi H. Vasquez, the Republican Supervisor of heavily conservative Orange County south of Los Angeles, whom his party is grooming for statewide office.
Texas has been the most successful breeding ground recently for Hispanic Republicans. Pete Nieto, who was recently elected a Texas State Representative as a Democrat, announced last month that he was switching to the Republican Party. In a statement, he said the lessons of his parents of "hard work, self reliance and family values" were shared by Republicans.
 
For the Next Election
 With Mr. Nieto when he made the announcement was Representative Henry Bonilla of San Antonio, who last year became the first Hispanic Republican elected to Congress from Texas.
In many states, Republicans are hoping to make even greater inroads next year in state and local elections by recruiting Hispanic candidates and getting Hispanic voters to the polls. Looking ahead to the 1996 Presidential race, several important battlegrounds, including California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas, have large numbers of Hispanic residents.
In Los Angeles, the potential Hispanic political clout is clearly illustrated on a wall map at the offices of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in East Los Angeles. In bright orange and yellow colors, the map dispels the notion that Hispanic residents are concentrated only in East Los Angeles, and shows they are spread throughout five neighboring counties, including the San Fernando Valley and the Republican bastion of Orange County.
"That's where the voters are," said Harry P. Pachon, the national director of the group, pointing to the map. "If you're in the Republican Party hierarchy, you ask yourself: 'Will the blacks vote for us?' "
 
'Not Set in Concrete'
 Though Mr. Pachon said the Republicans had largely given up on the black vote, he said they know that "the Latino vote is not set in concrete."
Indeed, a 1992 poll by the Southwest Voter Research Institute showed that in Texas the Republicans have made sharp inroads among Hispanic voters. In California, the poll found that increasing numbers of Hispanic voters are dropping party affiliations and identifying themselves as independents -- but, as the recent mayoral election shows, are willing to vote Republican.
By the end of 1994, more than three million former illegal immigrants, mostly natives of Mexico, will complete a five-year waiting period to be eligible for naturalization. More than half of these people live in California. The Republican Party has recognized the potential faster than the Democrats, and usually dispatches party representatives to naturalization ceremonies.
Although the Republicans have concentrated on well-to-do Hispanic business owners, the party has also sought to portray itself to minorities as inclusive and progressive.
To tap the full potential of the Hispanic vote, both parties have to reverse the low turnouts by Hispanic voters. In the Los Angeles mayoral race, Hispanic voters accounted for only 10 percent of the total.
Peter Skerry, a political scientist and author of "Mexican Americans: The Ambivalent Minority" (The Free Press, 1993), is skeptical of the prospects for a significant shifts in Hispanic voting pattern. Fundamentally, he said, the Hispanic electorate is a "working, lower-middle class kind of vote that's interested in the same economic issues as Democrats."
And Mr. Skerry said Cuban-Americans, who among Hispanics have been the most ardent Republicans, had discouraged others.
"There's intense animosity between Mexican-Americans and the Cuban-Republicans, who got there first and contributed a lot of money to the party," he said. "They're not eager to open the ranks to what they call Johnny-come-latelys."
But Mr. Garcia, the head of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus, said he was so worried about the Republicans that he took his concerns to David Wilhelm, the chairman of Democratic National Committee, and officials at the White House. "So far," he said, "the pleas have fallen on deaf ears. An organized strategy still has not been developed."
But Mr. Wilhelm said he was confident that the Democrats could hold on to the 62 percent of Hispanic voters who said they backed Bill Clinton last year.
"The key with Hispanic voters is the same as it is with voters generally," he said. "If we deliver on economic change, if we pass health-care reform, we will have spoken to those Hispanic voters in a very clear and compelling way."
 Because of an editing error stemming from the error in the chart, the article incorrectly described the political trend among Hispanic Texans. The Republicans did not make "sharp inroads."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 16, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A chart on July 5 with an article analyzing Hispanic voting patterns reversed the percentage of Hispanic voters in Texas who identified themselves as Republicans with those who identified themselves as independents. The share of Hispanic voters there who identified themselves as Republican was 9 percent in 1988, 9 percent in 1990 and 7 percent in 1992. Those who identified themselves as independent were 15 percent in 1988, 12 percent in 1990 and 27 percent in 1992.

HEADLINE: Legislators and Cuomo Agree on New Smoking Restrictions

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 5

 BODY:
Negotiators for the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo reached agreement today on a bill that would expand restrictions on smoking by prohibiting smoking in schools and limiting it in workplace lounges and cafeterias to separate, enclosed rooms.
The bill also would ban smoking in general hospitals, child-care centers, public institutions and treatment centers for children, ticketing and boarding areas of public transportation terminals, indoor zoos and some food stores. It also would ban the sale of individual cigarettes out of their packages, which include warnings about the health hazards of smoking. 
 But the chairman of the Senate health committee, Senator Michael J. Tully, a Republican of Roslyn Heights, L.I., said he could not guarantee that the bill would make it to the floor of his house for a vote.
Mr. Tully, the sponsor of the legislation, put its chances of success at only "60-40." He said the Senate's Republican leadership was encountering fierce resistance from tobacco lobbyists and might kill the bill.
 
No Deal Yet
 "We have not agreed to pass a bill," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I. "It is being looked at."
Aides to Speaker Saul Weprin, a Democrat from Queens, said the Democratic-majority Assembly was prepared to pass the legislation, and aides to Mr. Cuomo said he supported it.
With the Legislature seemingly prepared to leave town by Wednesday or Thursday -- members had been scheduled to leave on June 25 -- lawmakers, the Governor and their aides were still hoping for last-minute deals on a wide array of major bills.
As is often the case in the final frenzy of the legislative session, bills that had lingered on life support for days edged toward death. Others that had been declared dead were resuscitated.
Late this afternoon, for instance, Senate and Assembly leaders declared defeat in their efforts to refashion the state's hospital financing system, meaning lawmakers would have to return to Albany in the fall to deal with the issue. The negotiators conceded that they had failed to forge an agreement with Mr. Cuomo on how much money to pump into the state's hospital system.
 
Deadlock on Hospital Aid
 By manipulating the state's regulation of reimbursement rates for Medicaid and private insurers, the Senate Republicans proposed to give the hospitals $180 million a year above the amount they will receive for inflation. The Assembly Democrats proposed $142 million. Mr. Cuomo, who first suggested a cut in hospital spending, had raised his ante to $100 million, and expressed openness about going even higher, said Michael J. Dowling, the Governor's director of health, education and human services. That is where the bargaining deadlocked.
"It seems best in my judgment to simply set this aside now and engage in continuing three-way conversations," said the Assembly majority leader, James R. Tallon Jr., a Binghamton Democrat and a key participant in the hospital talks. "This takes a little bit more time."
Mr. Tully, the Senate's lead negotiator, said, "I'd say that's true."
But by early evening, Assembly aides said there were new signs of life, largely because Mr. Cuomo had hinted that he might put a new, more generous offer on the table. "Nothing is dead until we're out of here," said one Assembly aide, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Cuomo held an early-evening news conference aimed at keeping hope alive. He said there was still a chance to forge agreements on hospital financing, a dedicated fund for environmental purposes and state assistance for building a new hockey arena in Buffalo and new minor-league baseball parks around the state. The Governor coyly suggested that he would pull some dollars out of his sleeve, but provided no details.
"It's realistic to believe all these bills can be done and I would be surprised if they didn't agree after they've been briefed," Mr. Cuomo said, referring to the legislative leaders.
 
Billboard Measure Passes
 In other action in the Capitol, the Senate gave final approval to a measure that would allow the owners of billboards erected on state property to request permission to cut down trees and other vegetation that block the view of the signs from state roadways. The bill was approved by the Assembly on Sunday.
The legislation was supported as a necessity by New York's outdoor advertising industry. But it was denounced by environmental lobbyists, who view it as a reversal of the state's tradition of restricting billboards on scenic corridors.
Legislative negotiators, meanwhile, had yet to translate their agreement to end rent regulations on high-priced apartments into legislative language. And they were still discussing bills involving banking regulations, medical malpractice insurance, low-level radioactive waste storage and mental health financing.
Aides to legislative leaders said they were close to an agreement that would bring New York State into compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act. But negotiators were trying to decide whether to exempt two New York City-operated garbage incinerators in Brooklyn from tough new pollution regulations.
The antismoking measure, if passed, would continue a five-year effort by the state to place burdens of cost and convenience on New York smokers. The Legislature and Mr. Cuomo raised cigarette taxes this year by 17 cents a pack to 56 cents, one of the highest levels in the country. It was the third increase in five years.
The state also has banned smoking in public places and restricted it to special sections of offices and restaurants. Last year, the Governor and Legislature strengthened penalties against vendors who sell cigarettes to minors, banned cigarette vending machines from establishments frequented by children, and banned free distribution of cigarettes on street corners.
Antismoking forces in the Legislature were buoyed this year by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's finding that tobacco smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmokers.

HEADLINE: Groupe Bull to Cut 6,500 Jobs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, July 5

 BODY:
Groupe Bull, the French state-controlled computer company, said today that it would cut its work force by 6,500 jobs worldwide by the end of next year.
The company, which owns Zenith Data Systems in the United States, has a total work force of 35,200. The job cuts, which follow a previous program that reduced the work force by 27 percent between 1990 and 1992, include 3,000 positions whose elimination had already been set for this year. 
A senior Bull executive told reporters that the reductions were part of a wider cost-cutting plan at the company, which has been losing money. The goal is to break even in 1995.
 
Cost-Cutting Accelerated
"These reductions form part of the acceleration of our effort to reduce costs," Bull's personnel director, Herve Hannebique, said.
Of the 6,500 total job cuts, 2,500 would be in France. It was unclear whether any jobs would be lost at Zenith Data Systems, which is based in Buffalo Grove, Ill. No one was answering telephones at Zenith Data today.
Mr. Hannebique said costs would also be cut in property, purchasing and information systems. In property alone, the company expects to save $87 million.
Bull reported a loss of 4.72 billion francs, or roughly $821.4 million, for 1992, a year when it had originally hoped to break even before interest costs and taxes.
But the economy was weaker than expected in its main markets, and earnings for the whole computer industry have suffered from increasing competition.

HEADLINE: Investors' Quandary On Pretoria

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Many United States institutional investors are not expected to begin immediately reinvesting in South Africa, even if Nelson Mandela calls for an end to international sanctions.
Executives of pension funds and endowments expressed excitement about the prospects of investing again in companies that do business with South Africa but said it could take months if not years to gain approval to put their money back in the troubled nation. 
 While government and pension fund officials have said that they will take their cue to abandon sanctions from Mr. Mandela, the head of the African National Congress, most must also gain the approval of state legislatures and city councils, many of which are in recess and may not convene again for months.
 
Doubts About Change
 Moreover, some legislative bodies and pension funds have expressed doubt that fundamental change has taken place in South Africa and thus are unlikely to rescind divestment policies until free elections are held.
"A lot of institutional investors will probably wait until there's a new constitution and elections before jumping back into South Africa, because once you return there's no turning around," said William Moses, senior policy analyst for the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based group.
"Investors have told us that they don't want to be criticized for acting too quickly or prematurely," he said. "They don't want to be the first one to take action. They want to be second in going back to South Africa so they can better assess the situation and maintain their integrity."
 
A.N.C. Sets Conditions
 Before it calls for abolishing sanctions, the A.N.C. has said the South African Government must meet certain conditions. The most important, it said, was setting a date for free elections. On Friday, black and white political leaders meeting in Johannesburg agreed that the nation would conduct its first general election under universal suffrage next April 27.
But Mr. Mandela, visiting the United States, has pulled away from his earlier position on lifting sanctions, saying that more progress was needed on establishing an interim government that would run the country until the elections.
Mayor David N. Dinkins has said that at Mr. Mandela's request, he is prepared to ask the City Council and New York City's pension systems to end current sanctions on doing business in South Africa, except those that apply to munitions and weapons-making companies. Those would be retained until the South African military and police forces were brought under the control of the people, Mr. Dinkins said.
Business executives have been pressing Mr. Dinkins to lift the sanctions, which prohibit the city from contracting with companies that do business in South Africa. New York is one of more than 166 state and local governments that have maintained sanctions despite the lifting of Federal embargoes by the Bush Administration.
But Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, a trustee of the city's pension funds, has said sanctions should not be lifted until there was one-person, one-vote representation in South Africa. The city, which controls $43 billion in pension funds, has avoided investing in companies doing business in South Africa.
 
No Rush to Return
 Jarrod Wilcox, director of international investments for Battery March Financial Management, which oversees $5 billion in pension funds, said he saw no need to rush back into South Africa because he believed the country would face economic and political turmoil after the elections, and this would create huge investment risks.
"Those who act quickly could be hurt because of the turmoil and disruptions that will follow," Mr. Wilcox said. "The real values in South Africa won't emerge for at least a couple of years." When it does resume investing, Battery March will probably place about $20 million to $30 million in South African companies, Mr. Wilcox said, citing gold mining as an attractive industry.
 
Ban's Removal Sought
 Still, some pension managers and investors are eager to get divestment bans lifted and are anticipating a flurry of activity in many of the stocks of companies that do business in South Africa but have been listed as hands off.
Jose Arau, principal investment officer for the $25 billion California Public Employees Pension Fund, which is subject to the state's 1986 divestment act, said he hoped that Mr. Mandela's visit to the United States would encourage legislators to move quickly to lift the ban.
Without a repeal, the portfolio would be subject to a new round of divestment, Mr. Arau said. Since President George Bush lifted sanctions and companies began returning to South Africa, the fund has put 10 American companies and 10 foreign companies in which it has investments back on a divestiture list.
"We have always been opposed to divestment because we felt it would reduce our return," Mr. Arau said.The policy has cost the portfolio an estimated $600 million in lost returns, he said.
Many colleges and universities, which faced student demonstrations in the 1980's over South Africa, agreed to sell all or part of their holdings in companies with links to that country and are unlikely to reverse those policies soon. Many college officials say they would rather wait for tangible changes in South Africa before reversing divestment policies.

HEADLINE: Still Radical After All These Years;
At 74, William Kunstler Defends Clients Most Lawyers Avoid

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
William Moses Kunstler stood last week in one of his favorite places, the well of a courtroom. Before business began he chatted amicably with the judge, the court clerk, the stenographer, the security guards, the press. Of everything and everyone around him that Brooklyn morning, only the words behind the bench, from Aristotle, were uncongenial.
"Good law must necessarily mean good order," they declare. 
 For more than three decades now, while other lawyers of his ilk have died out or burned out or straightened out or sold out, Mr. Kunstler has challenged Aristotle's aphorism. Loudly and abrasively but increasingly effectively, he has defended the kinds of clients most people loathe and most lawyers avoid.
On Wednesday -- a birthday he shared with the late Judge Julius Hoffman, with whom he tangled so memorably during the Chicago Seven trial -- Mr. Kunstler will be 74 years old, old enough to be a relic, a curiosity, a walking anachronism.
While the familiar glasses are still atop his head, Mr. Kunstler's face has grown craggier, his voice raspier, his unkempt hair whiter and wispier. But thanks to three Islamic clients, he is more visible, more venerated, more vilified than ever. As he writes the front end of his autobiography -- to be called "Loose Cannon" -- he is still gathering material for the back.
The three clients are El Sayyid A. Nosair, whom Mr. Kunstler helped clear of charges that he assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane; Mr. Nosair's cousin, Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny, a suspect in the World Trade Center bombing, and Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, whom the Federal Bureau of Investigation has called the ringleader of the plot to bomb the United Nations and other targets.
Mr. Kunstler is accustomed to abuse, but nothing like what he has received recently. The catcalls accumulate on his answering machine, which regularly records obscenities or death threats. A man calls repeatedly and burps. "That's for your Arab clients," he says. A woman shrieks: "Your name should be 'Monster,' not 'Kunstler.' Other criticism comes in person -- the pedestrian who yells at him on the street, the fellow diner who says he should be shot -- for Mr. Kunstler is arguably the most recognizable lawyer in America.
During the Nosair trial, members of the Jewish Defense Organization broke the windows of his Greenwich Village town house with paint pellets. Last Tuesday, armed with placards, they were back again, accusing him of being a self-hating Jew and chanting, "Not one night of sleep till William Kunstler is off the street!"
 
Letters of Apology
 Shortly before the picketing began, Mr. Kunstler placed letters of apology under every doorstep on the block. "I hope you will bear the inconvenience with the fortitude that the Framers expected all of us to exhibit when strident voices were raised against anyone or any cause," he wrote. "So please forgive me and remember that, just like a trip to the dentist, it will feel so good when the J.D.O. is finished."
There are several lawyers representing defendants accused in the World Trade Center and bomb plot cases. But as the most famous and quotable among them, Mr. Kunstler has assumed a disproportionately important role. A man sustained by controversy and cacophony, whose mood rises with the number of decibels he generates and noses he tweaks, is having another heyday. "I'm more loved and more hated than I ever was," he said.
 
Famous Clients
 Most of Mr. Kunstler's famous clients, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Daniel Berrigan, Lenny Bruce, Stokely Carmichael, and various members of the Attica uprising, Chicago Seven and Black Panthers, were exceedingly unpopular in their day, but they had their followings. But Mr. Kunstler has also represented clients without constituencies.
There was Larry Davis, the drug dealer charged with murdering four drug dealers and shooting six policemen. There was Darrell Cabey, one of the four men whom Bernhard Goetz shot on the I.R.T., Yusef Salaam, convicted of raping the Central Park jogger, and Kevin McKiever, charged with stabbing a former Rockette as she walked her dog on the Upper West Side. All are black and, he contends, victims of American racism.
Whatever their pedigree, Mr. Kunstler contends, his clients have a common gene: all are pariahs, invariably with the heavy hand of Government on their shoulder.
"The battleground has become tougher and the clients less palatable to the general community," he said. "It was one thing to get an injunction allowing Martin Luther King to speak. Now it's Arabs accused of trying to blow up the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, and Larry Davis shooting cops in the Bronx."
 
Less Fearsome, More Famous
 Mr. Kunstler maintains, however, that the compliments exceed the criticism. He has learned there are benefits to senior citizenship besides half-price subway rides -- that if even the most politically unpalatable person hangs around long enough, he can graduate from middle-aged enfant terrible to elder statesman.
Many judges now find him more avuncular and endearing than menacing. Jurors who might once have feared him now ask him for his autograph, even in midtrial. His new-found rapport with them has helped Mr. Kunstler, a lawyer historically faulted for placing theatrics over substance, reach new professional peaks, most notably, in clearing both Mr. Nosair and Mr. Davis of the most serious charges they faced.
He has even become a favorite of filmmakers. The day before the picketers arrived at his home, he and one of his two teen-age daughters were in lower Manhattan, appearing as extras alongside Al Pacino in "Carlito's Way," a film directed by Brian De Palma. Earlier, Mr. Kunstler could be seen as a judge in "Malcolm X" and as a lawyer in "The Doors."
Mr. Kunstler said that the bulk of his salary, which he placed around $100,000 a year, comes from lectures and speaking engagements rather than legal fees. He selects his clients, he said, for reasons of principle rather than of economics. His Islamic clients, he said, are not paying him at all. Mr. Kunstler's methodology practically begs purists and critics to scour for inconsistencies, and in recent years, Mr. Kunstler has given them plenty of ammunition.
He once declared, for instance, that he only represented those he loved. The statement, he now says, was hyperbolic; he concedes that some of his recent clients are anything but lovable. He still maintains that he would not represent Klansmen, Nazis or other right-wing groups. But he is defending Moslem fundamentalists whose politics many of his allies find equally odious, leading to charges that what really ties his clientele together is their publicity value.
"One of the criticisms of me is, 'You're a showboat,' 'You're a publicity-seeker,' and to some extent that has the ring of truth," he said. "I enjoy the spotlight, as most humans do, but it's not my whole raison d'etre. My purpose is to keep the state from becoming all-domineering, all powerful. And that's never changed."
There are few leftists left to find fault with Mr. Kunstler's deviations, and those who do, do so very mildly. "Bill is too courageous and too good a lawyer and done too many good things for me to fault him for something he really believes is the right thing to do," said Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights.
 
Numerous Epiphanies
 Others, like Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, are less forgiving. "He's locked himself into an imposssible position by first claiming that he represents only those he loves or whose politics he supports, then defending people who want to murder Jews randomly on 47th Street," he said. "He can't have it both ways. Does he love these guys?"
Mr. Kunstler is in fact a man of numerous incarnations and epiphanies. The youthful version was a well-heeled romantic, who studied French and wrote love sonnets at Yale, collected in a book called "Our Pleasant Vices." Then came the conventional Kunstler, who settled in the suburbs, fathered two daughters, quietly practiced law, and wrote books with titles like "The Law of Accidents" and "Corporate Tax Summary."
Kunstler the civil libertarian and disciple of Gandhi followed his first epiphany, experienced while defending Freedom Riders in the early 1960's. Epiphany No. 2 occurred during the Chicago Seven trial, from which Mr. Kunstler emerged very nearly as radical and outrageous as his clients. His journey is documented on the walls of his office. A basement lair on Gay Street filled with law books, tattered oriental rugs, and the smell of cats, it was once a stop on the underground railroad.
 
No Ethnic Identity Remains
 As usual, the phone rings continually. Two calls concern a panel discussion on "Zealous Advocacy and the Courts' Need to Preserve Order," in which Mr. Kunstler is scheduled to take part. It seems that two of the judges have withdrawn upon learning of Mr. Kunstler's participation. "Why don't you ask Kevin Duffy?" Mr. Kunstler asked his caller, referring to a Federal judge in Manhattan. "I just moved to impeach him at the House Judiciary Committee, but it might be worth it."
Mr. Kunstler was raised a Jew but no longer considers himself one. He said the charges of self-hatred and betrayal leveled against him "go in one ear and out the other," though he noted that many clients, including Jack Ruby, Abbie Hoffman, and Morton Sobell, a defendant in the Rosenberg spy case, were Jewish.
Mr. Kunstler said he attended seders every year -- "We've doctored up the Haggadah to eliminate sexism" -- but goes to other ceremonies, too. "I go to Catholic churches and Sikh temples and native American ceremonies," he said. "I go to mosques. I have a Koran here."
 
'It Never Stops'
 He married two Jewish women, and at least some of his four grandchildren -- he is not sure how many -- consider themselves Jews. His two youngest daughters, aged 15 and 16, do not. "They're more interested in Act Up and AIDS causes," he said.
Many writers have tried psychoanalyzing Mr. Kunstler, a process Mr. Kunstler has never undergone. "Christ said, 'Know thyself,' but it's impossible," he said. "It's the hardest thing in the world."
Mr. Kunstler's father, a doctor, died at the age of 81 while heading for a house call, and his son wants a similar end. So far, history has been obliging. The kinds of clients and causes he likes just keep on coming. "I get so utterly bored not having a case to look forward to," he said. "I always wondered what would happen if it just stopped, and I thought I would put a bullet in my head. But it never stops. It simply never stops."

HEADLINE: America, a Great Place to Visit

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The largest invasion of foreigners in American history is unfolding across the United States, welcomed almost everywhere. The invaders are tourists, a record 46.5 million of whom are expected this year, and they should spend about $76.9 billion while here -- another record.
The estimates come from the United States Travel Data Center, a Washington-based nonprofit organization. And for the first time, according to the Commerce Department, the total number of overseas visitors to the United States -- an estimated 19.5 million from every part of the world except North America -- will exceed the total visitors from Canada, and by a sizable margin of one million. 
 The result is not only a huge multicultural interchange; it is also an economic bonanza at a time that the Travel Industry Association predicts domestic travel will be flat for the rest of the decade. Last week the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand said that almost one of every 10 hotels rooms in the United States each night is rented to a visitor from overseas and it projected that that figure would be almost one in seven by 1995.
Even bad news -- the murders of tourists in Miami and the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center in New York -- has not stemmed the flow. While foreigners may have changed itineraries to avoid what they consider trouble spots, travel industry officials say, they are not staying away from the United States.
 
Strength of Foreign Currency
 The size of the influx is driven in part by the strength of the Japanese yen, the British pound, the German mark and other foreign currencies relative to the dollar, making the United States an inexpensive destination.
Visitors are also responding to the growing numbers of promotions in their countries from American tour operators, airlines and hotels. Individual states and cities are also opening sales and tourist offices abroad. The Nashville airport and the Memphis and Nashville convention and visitors bureaus, for example, recently joined the privately owned Opryland Hotel in Nashville and Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, in opening a London office to attract British tourists.
All this effort has been paying dividends for several years. The number of foreign visitors has exceeded the previous year's total each year since the late 1980's, and a further gain is being projected for next year as well.
Many foreign visitors need little urging, however. They are here on return trips, intent on catching up on what they missed.
"The last time we were here, we drove 5,000 miles in three weeks, but we didn't get to the West," said Roberta Smithies of London, speaking recently from Buffalo Bill's Museum in North Platte, Neb. This time she and a friend are spending most of their three weeks in Nebraska, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. "We saw all the John Wayne movies, and when people ask why we came here, we tell them: when you think of America, you think of the West."
In recent days many Italian tourists have been visiting Niagara Falls, and Spanish tourists have panned for gold in Dahlonega, Ga., a tiny town near the Appalachian Trail. Tourists from as far away as Malaysia recently turned up at Graceland, while tourists from more than 30 countries have journeyed to Hope, Ark., to see the boyhood homes of President Clinton.
"For some reason," Paul G. Henley, Hope's director of tourism, said, "the Japanese have no interest in going to the cemetery where his father's buried. They just want to see the two houses where the President lived."
The biggest contingent of foreigners for any three-month period is expected to arrive this summer, but from New England to Washington State, foreign visitors are helping to extend tourist seasons during other times of the year as well.
"The last few years we've seen more foreign tourists in the winter than we ever have," said Jane Gillespie, sales director of Grand Canyon National Park Lodges. Even in summer, overseas visitors account for more than one-third of guests at the lodges, where rooms must be booked months in advance.
Similarly, while Miami is not usually considered by Americans as a summer vacation spot, it is for increasing numbers of tourists from Russia and Ukraine.
"We have two seasons here in Florida: hot and really hot," said Alexey N. Mesiatsev, the executive vice president of Rahim Tours of Lake Worth, Fla., which brings in many tourists from the former Soviet republics. "But the hotter the better for our tour members -- especially the ones from Siberia."
 
Cultural Sensitivities
 To attract foreign tourists, hotels and restaurants are becoming more cosmopolitan. Restaurants are changing not only the languages in which restaurant menus are written but also the cuisine they serve. Many hotels have bilingual desk clerks, and some offer telephone lines solely for providing assistance in foreign languages. Most print fire instructions and other emergency procedures in more than one language.
Staff members at the New Orleans Hilton Riverside wear lapel pins with flags signifying the foreign languages they speak, and room clerks there are careful not to book Japanese guests into rooms on either the fourth or ninth floors -- the former because the Japanese pronunciation of the number "four" is similar to the word "death," and nine is similar to the word "pain."
Theme parks and attractions, like Parrot Jungle and Gardens in Miami, routinely print brochures in several languages, while the new international terminal at O'Hare Airport in Chicago has signs in 17 languages as diverse as Arabic and Chinese, advising passengers of delays or telling them to have passports ready.
Gray Line tours from Manhattan to Niagara Falls are offered with guides who speak French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese. And New York -- where foreigners make up 22 percent of the city's 25 million visitors and where visitors spend $1.6 billion a year just shopping -- is filled with stores that cater specifically to tourists from Central and South America.
 
Spending More
 Overseas visitors spend six times more per capita in this country than American tourists spend, according to the United States Travel and Tourism Administration. Their average stay of slightly less than three weeks is almost five times longer than the average domestic vacation.
Corinne Leseur, a Frenchwoman currently touring the United States with her aunt and two cousins, fits the profile of the average foreign visitor. In her three-week visit she is driving a rental car from Louisiana to Miami. "America is a dream come true," she declared recently, after visiting New Orleans's French Quarter.
Ms. Leseur, who works in a pharmaceutical laboratory, lives on Reunion, a tiny island to the east of Madagascar in the south Indian Ocean. It is a long way to come for a vacation, she acknowledged, "but it's something we dreamed of for more than a year."
The 3.7 million visitors from Japan spent the most here last year, an estimated $13.8 billion -- $10 billion more than American visitors spent in Japan. Almost four million Japanese are expected this year, and travel industry officials say a lackluster economy at home does not seem to have curtailed their free-spending ways abroad.
Many Japanese tourists travel on the Delta Queen or Mississippi Queen, the paddlewheel steamboats that ply the Mississippi and several other inland rivers. "They read Mark Twain, so the river trip seems to embody what they envision America should be," Terry Westerfield, a spokeswoman for the Delta Queen Steamboat Company, said.
Los Angeles continues to suffer a drop-off in Japanese and other Asian visitors because of last year's riots.
"This year looks better than last year, when nobody wanted to come here because of the riot, but the number of visitors is still lower than we expected," said Shigemi Kitta, tour operations director of Alfa Tour in Los Angeles. Alfa is one of several small airlines that fly Japanese tourists on one-day roundtrips to the Grand Canyon from Los Angeles.
 
Promoting Florida to Germans
 Several Florida cities sent tourist officials to Germany to try to overcome the negative impact of the murder of a German tourist in Miami, and, for whatever reason, more German tourists are visiting Fort Lauderdale than ever -- possibly in part at the expense of Miami.
"We went from 5 charter flights a week from Germany last year to 11 this year," Francine Mason, a spokeswoman for Fort Lauderdale's tourist bureau, said. "About 41,000 of our one million visitors this summer will be from Germany." Also, 37,000 are expected from Scandinavia.
Foreign visitors are also flooding into New York, where a total of 15 suspects have been arrested in connection with the World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people, and what officials say was a plot to bomb the United Nations and other city sites.
"Terrorism can have harmful effects on international travel," Marshall Murdaugh, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, said. "But we honestly have not seen any concern expressed by international or domestic tour operators, and I'm sure it's because the suspects were apprehended so quickly."

HEADLINE: The Hook: No Ladder A Cherry Orchard Is Easy Pickings

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON, N.Y., June 30

 BODY:
Kneeling on the ground, Norma Saddlewire picked ripe, dark-red cherries as fast as she could from branches just pruned from heavily laden sweet cherry trees.
Nearby, her friend Joyce Nethaway stood plucking cherries from a dwarf tree not more than 10 feet high. 
 Here in the orchards of the 300-acre Fix Brothers farm in western Columbia County, Robert and William Fix have made it possible for customers to pick cherries without leaving the ground.
"It makes it easy for everybody," said Robert Fix's wife, Joan, who noted that eliminating ladders also reduced the possibility of accidents and lawsuits.
One of her three sons, Robert Jr., walked through the orchard, using a ladder and pruning saw to cut high branches and lay them before a steady stream of customers. He explained that pruning during the fruiting season did not harm the trees, nor did it eliminate the need for major pruning routinely done in the winter and spring.
The sweet cherry season started in late June, the beginning of the annual fruit harvest in the Hudson Valley and the rest of New York State, where growing, picking and processing fruit are a major economic enterprise.
 
$200 Million Industry
 "The industry is not only important because it brings in $200 million a year, but it is also responsible for a lot of jobs, both seasonally and permanent, as well as providing us with a lot of good eating," said Richard T. McGuire, the State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets.
Russell Bartolotta Sr., who operates the Klein's Kill Fruit Farm near here, said the cherry crop was good this year. "They are coming in plentiful and sweet," he said. "The flavor is delicious."
In New York, Niagara County is the leading producer of sweet cherries. Columbia and Ulster Counties are major producers in the Hudson Valley. In Columbia County, in one small area near the Hudson River here, eight orchards attract thousands of pick-it-yourselfers during the harvest season.
"We have people coming from all over, from New York City, Long Island, New Jersey," said Mrs. Fix.
Mrs. Saddlemire and Mrs. Nethaway drove 80 miles from Schoharie, just west of Albany, to pick cherries. In less than half an hour, each filled three four-quart cartons with 20 pounds of fruit.
"I'm going to eat some and freeze the others," Mrs. Saddlemire said.
Under a spreading cherry tree, Mrs. Fix stood behind a scale weighing the cherries, which cost $1 a pound.
In supermarkets now, Bing cherries from Washington, Oregon and California are selling for 98 cents to $1.59 a pound.
 
No Fear of Pesticides
 None of a dozen pickers interviewed here indicated any concern about possible danger from pesticides despite the recent report this week by the National Academy of Science that chemical residues on fruit were potentially dangerous.
"I blame the news media for the scare stories on the pesticide dangers," Mrs. Saddlemire said.
William Fix, one of the partners in the farm, said few customers asked about pesticides.
"We spray with fungicides and insecticides six or seven times a year," he said. "If we didn't use pesticides, we would not have any people here because there wouldn't be any fruit. It would be eaten by worms, covered by scab, damaged by every insect you could think of."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Expected to Hold Line on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
After nine months of predicting changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy that never occurred, investors and traders in the credit markets expect today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee will result in an agreement by Fed officials to hold short-term rates stable.
A decision by the committee to maintain rates would modify its assessment in May, when Fed officials voted to hold rates stable for the immediate future but hinted strongly at their willingness to raise rates if inflation worsened. Explanations of any shift may be forthcoming next Tuesday, when the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, is scheduled to present the central bank's views on the economy and monetary policy to Congress. 
 Mr. Greenspan's testimony, which is required twice a year, is likely to include something for everybody.
Bond investors will be assured that the Fed wants low inflation and will stand ready to raise interest rates if that goal is threatened. Congress, meanwhile, will be assured that the Fed will do all it can to keep the economy growing by maintaining low interest rates.
It is a familiar tightrope for Mr. Greenspan, but one that may be fraught with more than the usual difficulty. Because the budget package now being negotiated in Congress promises a combination of higher taxes and reduced spending that can dampen economic growth, many in the credit markets wonder how much pressure the Fed may feel to compensate and help the economy by keeping interest rates low or perhaps even by pushing them lower.
"With the budget package, we now have an economic policy that is good for the bond market, but bad for the economy," said Charles Smith, a bond manager at T. Rowe Price, a Baltimore-based mutual fund company. While he expects the economy to suffer from the tax package, he does not expect the Fed to try a pre-emptive strike. "I expect they will take a neutral posture and wait to see more data," he said.
 
 
Current Policy Is Working
 Some analysts conclude that no change by the Fed is likely because its policy has been working so well. Banks and businesses are awash in cash, so reducing short-term rates from levels that are already the lowest in 30 years would not appear to provide much additional benefit. With Treasury bond yields dropping to a 20-year low of about 6.66 percent last week from 7.75 percent in November, Fed officials may feel unwilling to change a policy that appears to be convincing investors that inflation will remain benign.
"If Greenspan came to Congress, declared a victory over inflation and lowered interest rates, it would surely be popular with Congress and maybe even some parts of Wall Street," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Chemical Bank. But there is no assurance that the inflation-wary bond market would follow the Fed's lead to lower interest rates, he said. "And it's certain that lower rates would not be popular in retirement communities," where low interest rates have reduced incomes, he said.
Raising interest rates -- or strongly hinting they would be raised -- is unlikely, analysts said, because the June data due this week are expected to show a continuation of the low inflation reported for May and because the economy remains sluggish. Last week's weak economic data, culminating in a report showing a meager rise of 13,000 jobs on payrolls in June, have led many economists to reduce their forecasts for second-quarter growth after inflation to 2 percent or less.
 
 
A Dangerous Message
 Mr. Kellner noted that if the Fed adjusted its policy to allow higher interest rates as the economy grows and credit demands increase, "it would be a quite normal development in the economy and would not choke off future growth." But an attempt by Mr. Greenspan to deliver that message is dangerous, he said, "because the Fed is working with a populist President and some members of Congress who would dearly love to curb the Fed's independence."
With the Fed facing such choices, Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director in the New York office of S. G. Warburg & Company, a securities firm, expects that Mr. Greenspan may appease some critics by agreeing to release minutes of Open Market Committee meetings soon after the meetings are completed.
Wayne D. Lyski, senior vice president at Alliance Capital Management, a New York investment adviser, noted that economic growth of about 2 percent would probably not cause the Fed to lower short-term rates. But a decline to 1 percent growth may bring lower rates, he said, even if it means abandoning the principle of keeping key short term-rates equal to or above inflation.
Even if the Fed's policy is unchanged, recent history shows there is plenty of room for interest rates to fluctuate. Since September, when the Fed began pegging monetary policy to maintain a 3 percent rate in the Federal funds market, interest rates on three-month bills have ranged from a low of 2.67 percent at an auction in early October to a high of 3.29 percent in early December to 2.94 percent on Friday. Two-year Treasury notes, which closed on Friday at 3.91 percent, have been as high as 4.83 percent in early December and as low as 3.66 percent in early October.
Long-term Treasury bonds, which closed on Friday with a yield of 6.66 percent, the lowest in about 20 years, were as high as 7.76 percent last November and 7.05 percent as recently as early April of this year.

HEADLINE: Fears Rise Over Wastes Burned in Cement Kilns

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALPENA, Mich.

 BODY:
From industrial plants across the Great Lakes region, tanker trucks and railroad cars haul thousands of gallons of hazardous wastes to this city on Lake Huron, emptying their cargo at the nation's largest cement-making factory where it is burned as fuel.
Almost 10 years ago, with the intent of reducing pollution and conserving resources, Congress amended the nation's hazardous-waste law specifically to encourage recycling such wastes as fuel in cement kilns. About 25 of the roughly 110 American cement plants, many owned by foreign multinational corporations, then installed new piping and other equipment and began being paid to burn hundreds of millions of gallons of hazardous waste each year. 
 First, the lawmakers banned the burial of most raw chemical wastes, making incineration an attractive alternative. Then they decided that cement makers who recycled hazardous wastes as fuel would not have to operate under the same strict standards that applied to commercial toxic waste incinerators. Finally, Congress determined that kiln dust, unlike ash from the toxic-waste incinerators, was not hazardous and did not need to be dumped in special landfills at a cost of more than $1,000 a ton.
But the exemptions for cement makers that were written into the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 1984 are now stirring resentment and fear in rural America. In almost every one of the small cities and towns where hazardous wastes are burned for profit in cement kilns, shrill battles over potential risks to health and safety have become common.
 
New Policy Questions
 Critics of the incineration say the battles are emblematic of a new problem in environmental policy and especially the management of hazardous chemicals: that laws meant to lower risks to health and nature may instead be increasing them.
Cement makers, on the other hand, contend that the technology is safe and the policy sound, and they say they are collecting data to prove it.
Prompted by such a fundamental disagreement, Michigan and other states are investigating what sort of chemical byproducts cement kilns are releasing into the air, water and land. Although Michigan does not yet have enough data to determine if the Alpena plant poses a major risk, the state has found numerous violations of law.
Such close scrutiny of Alpena's hulking cement plant is a recent phenomenon. Since 1906, when the plant was built on a 2,500-acre site, its concrete buildings and towering smokestacks rarely attracted the attention of state inspectors even though they were the most recognizable works of man in a landscape dominated by the blue-gray waters of Thunder Bay and the green expanse of hardwood forests. Generations of men and women have worked at the plant, and it still provides more than 300 jobs and one in every six property tax dollars collected by this city of 12,000 people.
 
Fines and Tighter Rules
 But a community environmental group that started two years ago, the Huron Environmental Activist League, looked into the plant, raised questions about safety and helped prod the state into more aggressive enforcement of the law.
Michigan officials say they have notified the owner, the Lafarge Corporation, that it faces a $150,000 fine for violating air-quality rules and that it will have to establish an environmental monitoring program more extensive than at virtually any other plant in the state.
The state is also studying how Lafarge should dispose of 1,200 tons of dust produced daily by the kilns that is now dumped in the plant's limestone quarry. The dust contains lead, a toxic heavy metal, that state officials say is worrisome but that company executives contend is harmless in its current form. The state is also studying the dust for the presence of dioxin and other toxic substances.
"I remember back in the mid-1980's when this started, people thought cement kilns were the best place for burning hazardous wastes," said JoAnne Merrick, a compliance and enforcement official at the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in Lansing. "The temperatures were high. The wastes could be use as fuel and stayed in the kilns long enough to be thoroughly destroyed. It sounded like a panacea.
"Our mission now is to develop the data to find out whether the public's concerns are real or not."
 
E.P.A. Weighs In
 Last month, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency joined the fray. The agency's administrator, Carol M. Browner, announced a more aggressive plan to oversee the burning of hazardous wastes, especially in cement kilns.
In December, an E.P.A. review found that cement kilns and other industrial boilers using hazardous wastes as fuel were regularly violating Federal law. The agency found that more than half the plants were not adequately analyzing or controlling the wastes they were burning.
Until Ms. Browner's policy change, "cement kilns were often operating without adequate oversight," said Sylvia K. Lowrance, director of the Office of Solid Waste at the agency. "That will no longer be the case."
Turning a mixture of limestone and shale into cement requires heating kilns to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit to bind the raw materials into rock hard nuggets called "clinker." That is then ground and mixed with gypsum to form cement.
Most of the enormous amount of energy required for the process is supplied by coal, but companies continually experiment with alternatives to lower costs. The favorite alternative fuels in the last decade have been paint thinners, waste oils, spent solvents and other petrochemical byproducts.
The environmental agency says five million tons of hazardous waste are burned each year in the United States. Though it is not known how much of the total is burned by cement kilns, Lafarge and its waste-management subsidiary, Systech Environmental Corporation, burned 80 million gallons of hazardous waste in 1992, or 320,000 tons, at six cement plants across the country. Of that, almost 13 million gallons weighing 52,000 tons were burned in two of the five kilns at Alpena.
To executives of Lafarge, the American subsidiary of Paris-based Lafarge Coppee, burning hazardous wastes is a useful marriage of economic and environmental goals. They said in interviews here that using hazardous wastes as fuel earned the company an average of $100 a ton and saved it the cost of normal fuel, reducing the need to strip mine miles of land for coal.
 
Companies Praise Procedure
 Moreover, the company says incinerating wastes in cement kilns represents the safest technology yet developed for destroying dangerous chemical compounds and protecting the environment.
"Our tests of air emissions, our analysis of the cement kiln dust, and our tests of the process prove to us that burning this waste as fuel effectively destroys the hazardous components," said Jim Daniel, the plant's production manager.
To members of the Huron Environmental Activist League, the burning of hazardous wastes at the Lafarge plant is a looming threat. They blame air and water pollution from the Lafarge plant for causing respiratory illnesses, birth defects and other health disorders, though state environmental and health officials say there is no evidence to confirm such claims.
Nonetheless, in an act that angered elected leaders, the critics put up a billboard in early June at the edge of town warning tourists that they were entering a region where hazardous wastes were burned.
"Lafarge says they've done the testing," said John Pruden, an artist from nearby Ossineke who is a leader of the environmental group. "They really haven't."
Caught in the middle of this battle is the state, which nearly two years ago began inspecting the plant frequently. Michigan is now requiring Lafarge to test air and water around the plant more thoroughly.
"Our intent," said Richard D. Alexander, an air-quality specialist in the state Department of Natural Resources, "was to make the Alpena plant the most closely monitored cement kiln in the country."

HEADLINE: Floods Force Corps of Engineers Into Balancing Act on Mississippi

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCK ISLAND, Ill. July 5

 BODY:
As the rain fell again today, S. K. Nanda, the chief hydrologist at the Army Corps of Engineers district office here, punched the keyboards at a bank of computers and choreographed a watery balancing act involving three giant Iowa reservoirs along two Mississippi tributaries that weeks ago had filled to capacity.
From this command post just a few feet from where the Mississippi River was cresting at levels not seen since 1965, and never seen in July, Mr. Nanda was making water management decisions unlike any others he has faced in his 25-year career here. 
 Allowing the three reservoirs to fill much more could threaten the dams that hold them. But emptying them as fast as they were filling would cause the waters to rise more in the Des Moines and Iowa Rivers. That could not only put Hills, Iowa, and other towns downstream of the control dams in peril of flooding, but would also add more water to the Mississippi and cause the flood to top the levees and inundate Hannibal and other Missouri towns south of here.
Thus, Mr. Nanda ordered his dam keepers in Iowa to take just about the only action they could: open the flood gates, emergency conduits and spillways, but not to the maximum amount. "We deal with nature and technology on a daily basis," he said. "We try to make an exact science out of inexact nature."
The decisions made here today with the three reservoirs 100 or more miles away are a microcosm of what occurs every day in a mammoth plumbing system the Government designed and built this century to control the flow of the Mississippi and its largest tributaries.
Over the last 65 years, the United States spent billions of dollars to build roughly 300 dams and reservoirs, construct thousand of miles of levees and flood walls and operate countless pumping stations to regulate water draining from parts of 35 states, an area covering 1.25 million square miles, or more than a third of nation. Along with the construction of the Interstate highways, the Mississippi flood control project is one of the most enterprising civil engineering projects ever devised. Its primary purpose is to rein in a wandering river and keep it confined to a rigid man-made channel.
Some have called the project a supreme act of human arrogance, and today it is easy to see why. The Mississippi continued to bound past its banks and to flood towns along 400 miles from southern Minnesota to Missouri. But what is just as clear is that after decades of hemming in one of the world's great river systems, a supreme act of nature, like weeks of heavy rain in places that elude storage reservoirs, can overwhelm the project.
And that, said Mr. Nanda and his engineering colleague, William Koellner, is precisely what happened to cause this flood. Mr. Koellner, the chief of water control here, said that beginning on June 11, a foot of rain fell in southern Minnesota and lesser amounts fell in northern Iowa. Four days later, 11 more inches fell in roughly the same area. Both storms also moved east and dumped near-record rains on Wisconsin.
 
Much Rain Missed Reservoirs
 Most of the water found its way to the Minnesota River, a Mississippi tributary southwest of St. Paul, but not in any place where the Government had built storage reservoirs. On the east side of the Mississippi, the same sequence occurred in Wisconsin, on the Black and Wisconsin Rivers.
The only part of the downpours that was captured was what fell in Iowa. That drained into the three reservoirs formed by the Saylorville and Red Rock dams on the Des Moines River and the Coralville dam on the Iowa River.
At the Army Corps of Engineers district headquarters here, the two engineers and their staffs monitored banks of computers to analyze rainfall patterns, stream depths and river flows. It did not take Mr. Koellner long to predict that all that water pouring into the Mississippi, and moving downstream at 70 miles a day or so, would be trouble.
In mid-June he said the Mississippi would crest at Davenport, Iowa, across the river from here, at 18.5 feet, about four feet below the record of 1965. But then the weather front that caused the heavy rain stalled over Iowa and Minnesota. More rain fell, and June became the wettest in this region since record-keeping began in 1878, he said.
Today, with the river nearing the 1965 level, water has swamped Davenport's river front. And the only hope Mr. Koellner can offer property owners and city officials is that his gauges 50 miles upstream show the Mississippi's level falling.
In the meantime, the towns on the Des Moines and Iowa Rivers have been more fortunate. The reservoirs have prevented those tributaries from catastrophic flooding, and will continue to do so unless extraordinary amounts of rain continue to fall, Mr. Koellner said. And many of those towns are also protected by concrete flood walls and earthen levees.
Along the Mississippi, the Government built almost 500 miles of levees north of St. Louis to protect farms and towns. How well they work is evident in this old river port city.
The flood wall that protects Rock Island has kept all but the lowest-lying areas here dry. Across the river, Davenport residents chose to preserve their river views and not have any protections built; their waterfront neighborhoods and business districts have now been ruined by water.
In response to the flooding President Clinton toured the area this weekend and pledged a $1.2 billion package of flood-relief assistance.
 
History of Forcing Path
 For all but the last flash of time in its long existence, the Mississippi has determined its own boundaries. During periods of high water, it broke its bank and the energy of floods was dissipated as the water spread across tens of thousands of square miles of uninhabited bottom lands. In the 20th century, Americans by the millions drew up to the river's banks, developing the bottom lands for farms and towns. In 1927, a flood killed 214 people and caused $237 million in damage in the lower Mississippi Valley.
A year later, Congress passed the first Mississippi River flood control act, a law that sought no modern-day balancing of environmental and economic goals. The lawmakers directed the Corps of Engineers to confine the river to a prescribed channel. Some 300 flood control dams were built on the river's tributaries.
The nearly 550 miles of river from Hannibal to St. Paul, where most of the flooding has occurred, is managed by two Corps districts. Along with the Rock Island district's three Iowa dams, the Army Corps district office in St. Paul manages 16 flood-control dams.
Over the last few days, experts with the corps noted with some measure of disappointment that the rains fell where nothing made by man could catch them.
"All of this is within certain powers," said Joseph Raoul, the chief of hydrologics and hydrology for the corps's division office in Chicago. "There is nothing that could have been done that has not been done to handle this."

HEADLINE: Finding Ways to House All Vexes Leaders at Every Level

SERIES: Search for Shelter: New York and Its Homeless -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
President Clinton signed a little-noticed executive order in May directing his Administration to come up with a "single coordinated Federal plan for breaking the cycle of homelessness." There was no ceremony that day, no soaring oratory, no Presidential photo-op at a homeless shelter.
The order itself was as modest as the circumstances of its signing, emblematic of the lowered expectations of what government can do for the poorest of its poor. The President instructed the 17 Federal agencies involved with homelessness to come up with a strategy in nine months, but promised no new money to carry it out. 
 Mr. Clinton's retooling of homeless policies, however limited in scope, is likely to be strongly influenced by New York City's painful experience with this most visible and vexing manifestation of poverty. Two significant figures developing the new plan, Andrew Cuomo and Marsha A. Martin, were also key players in shaping the homeless policies of Mayor David N. Dinkins's administration.
Whatever Washington comes up with, city officials will themselves be moving forward with the revamping of the city's shelter system that Mr. Cuomo masterminded and that Ms. Martin was carrying out. At its heart, the new effort seeks to shift the city's ponderous shelter system toward the use of small residences for the homeless, run by private nonprofit groups, that address such problems as drug abuse and mental illness.
The city's handling of the homeless is also likely to surface as an important issue in the city's mayoral campaign. A recent New York Times/WCBS-TV poll found that New Yorkers ranked homelessness second only to crime as the problem they most want the next mayor to concentrate on.
Mayor Dinkins, unable to fulfill many of the promises he made on the issue in his last campaign, will have to defend the record of a system that provides services costing $500 million a year but that many believe has failed to lead people toward productive lives. His rival, the Republican-Liberal candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, would not talk about the issue for this article and has yet to reveal how, or even whether, he will approach the issue in any detail.
Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Martin say that the new Federal plan will follow many of the recommendations made by the commission Mr. Cuomo headed for Mr. Dinkins, encouraging cities to move away from simply offering rudimentary emergency shelter to a more sophisticated system of assessing the particular needs of each homeless person, placing people in small, specialized programs and then moving them, once they are ready, into permanent housing. The experts call this "a continuum of care."
 
'A Testing Ground'
 "What we've gone through here in New York is a good testing ground for the nation," said Ms. Martin, who became executive director of the Federal Interagency Council on the Homeless on June 14.
But Ms. Martin and Mr. Cuomo acknowledge that there are limits to what the Federal Government can do if financing remains at the level established during the Bush Administration. Mr. Cuomo, assistant secretary for community planning and development at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, annually administers almost $1 billion in Federal programs for the homeless -- not big money when measured against the $500 million that New York City alone spends sheltering the homeless each year.
And without an infusion of money, many of the homeless will remain urban vagabonds, researchers and officials say. For example, the New York State Office of Mental Health estimates that it would cost close to half a billion dollars just to develop and operate housing with special services for the 10,000 homeless mentally ill people in New York -- and that does not count the needs of the other 49 states. Nor does it address the problems of homeless families, drug addicts, alcoholics and assorted other categories of down-on-their-luck poor people.
"Obviously, the ultimate solution lies in additional resources for housing, services, job training, jobs," Mr. Cuomo said. "It's always a question of money, but it's not only a question of money. That's what we learned in New York. The Cuomo Commission was premised on the fact of no new money. So we had to get smarter, more creative."
 
City Hall
A Thorny Issue For the Mayor
The issue in this year's mayoral campaign is likely to center on just that question: Which candidate can run a more humane, effective shelter system with the same or less money?
The public's firsthand experience with the problem makes homelessness a potentially potent issue. It is an inescapable fact of life, even for middle- and upper-class New Yorkers who can send their children to private schools, take taxis and live in doorman buildings. "It's scary and depressing at the same time," said Ester Fuchs, director of the urban affairs program at Barnard College.
Like his predecessor Edward I. Koch, Mr. Dinkins has discovered that the politics of homelessness are unkind to incumbents. The public wants a mayor who will fix the problem. As a candidate in the last election, Mr. Dinkins promised to close the armories, empty the welfare hotels and provide more housing for the homeless. The issue helped to define him as the candidate of compassion, in contrast to Mr. Koch, whose blunt talk about the homeless had come to sound more cruel than candid.
But this year, the question for Mr. Dinkins is not how much he cares, but how much he has accomplished. He is vulnerable because the city still uses the armories and hotels he himself abhors -- and because the homeless are still so visible on the streets. A majority of the New Yorkers polled last month said they disapproved of his handling of the issue.
"David Dinkins is a decent man," said Douglas H. Lasdon, executive director of the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, voicing an oft-repeated criticism, "but he is not a doer."
But Mr. Dinkins contended in a recent interview that his administration deserves credit for developing the approach to homelessness that his former advisers are now carrying to Washington. "We've demonstrated compassion and concern," he said. "We haven't walked away from the problem. We've tried to implement the Cuomo Commission recommendations."
Mr. Dinkins said that the issue is so important to him that his battle for a new agency dedicated to the homeless, one of the central recommendations of the mayoral commission, held up his acrimonious budget negotiations with the City Council last month. Ultimately, he won approval for the agency, though the Council forced him to cut the amount of new city money to finance it. "I knew it was vital, and I wasn't going to yield on that," Mr. Dinkins said.
 
What Would Giuliani Do?
 Talking about Mr. Giuliani's refusal to discuss his views on homelessness, part of his broader strategy to avoid specific positions on a range of issues, Mr. Dinkins said his opponent is evading "a knotty problem. He doesn't have a solution or a plan."
On the stump Mr. Giuliani has spoken only in generalities about homelessness, mentioning it as one of many urban problems that will be alleviated by building a healthier economy and privatizing city-run services.
He clearly intends to appropriate some of the Cuomo Commission's ideas. Though he made no comment himself, his spokesman, Ken Frydman, said, "Instead of being in the business of operating homeless shelters, Rudy feels the city should support nonprofit organizations that can do it better, like Help." Help stands for Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, a nonprofit group founded by Mr. Cuomo that runs apartment-style shelters for families.
And Mr. Giuliani is alert to the issue's political possibilities. He has met with Mr. Cuomo and advocates for the homeless. Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said she told him and his staff during a briefing that he had "a perfect opportunity to seize on the discrepancy between Dinkins's rhetoric and reality."
"They all nodded," she said. "They were taking notes like mad."
When he ran for mayor four years ago, Mr. Giuliani said in answer to a questionnaire from the coalition that he favored closing armory shelters and investing in permanent housing and small shelters offering social services.
"I was very comfortable with him," said Robert M. Hayes, a founder of the coalition who is now practicing law in Portland, Me. "He was a good Catholic schoolboy with whom I could relate. His positions were not materially different than Dinkins's. The question was who would carry them out better. The Mayor has been a disappointment. Giuliani remains untested."
Whoever wins the election will have to contend with the City Council, which is increasingly exerting its influence on the issue. Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone was one of the most enthusiastic backers of Mr. Cuomo's ideas, but the Dinkins administration found him thorny to deal with. Mr. Vallone felt the administration's original proposal for a new homeless agency was too costly and could turn into just another layer of bureaucracy.
He insisted on the Council's right to vote the agency out of existence in two years, which insures the Council a continuing say in city policy. Mr. Vallone says the Council will continue pressuring the mayor, whoever he may be, to get the homeless out of hotels and armories and to turn to nonprofit groups to run shelters. But some leaders of nonprofits worry that the Council, with its newfound power on this issue, may succumb to not-in-my-backyard pressures and try to block new shelters from opening in city neighborhoods.
 
Albany and Washington
Too Many Ideas, Little Money
On the state level, the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo are engaged in a political battle over financing of community care for the mentally ill that has profound implications for the homeless mentally ill. Since the 1950's, the state has been emptying its mental hospitals -- a process that continues to this day and that saves the state millions in patient costs. But wholesale deinstitutionalization has caused homelessness among the mentally ill, advocates say.
Senate and Assembly negotiators last week announced their support for a landmark bill that would require the state to pour most of the savings from further shrinkage of mental hospitals -- as much as $42 million a year -- into group homes, local clinical care and other community-based services that the homeless need.
But Governor Cuomo, struggling to balance the budget, opposes the proposal. It remains to be seen whether a compromise can be worked out.
The courts may force the state to spend huge additional sums on an issue related to homelessness among families. Judge Karla Moskowitz presided over a three-month trial last year on whether the state should be required to increase the monthly rental subsidy to 289,000 families on welfare in New York City. Her ruling could cost the city and state hundreds of millions of dollars in higher welfare payments.
Advocates for the homeless and some city officials contend that the inadequacy of the monthly rental grant, $286 a month for a family of three, causes homelessness among families who cannot afford housing.
Absent legislative action or court mandates, the only real source of new money is the Federal Government. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has administered the principal Federal programs for the homeless, has deep financial troubles of its own. It was recently disclosed that HUD expects to lose as much as $11.9 billion as apartment building owners default on Government-insured mortgages.
It is still possible that there may be new money for services important to the homeless through a Federal health plan, yet to be unveiled. A Clinton Administration advisory group had advocated universal access to drug treatment and mental-health care.
 
A Clinton Retreat?
 But with Mr. Clinton focused on his budget and deficit-reduction package and worried that he has been perceived as too liberal, the Administration seems likely to scale back this sweeping, potentially costly proposal.
"The sands have been shifting," said Herbert Kleber, executive vice president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York City. "I was optimistic that mental health and substance abuse would be covered like diabetes and a broken leg. But they're backing away like crazy."
The Clinton Administration faces a problem not unlike that of the Dinkins administration. It has more big ideas than it has money to carry them out. Ms. Martin, who will be coordinating development of the new Federal plan ordered by Mr. Clinton, talked during her last week on the job here about the limits of the city's efforts to help the homeless, but she could also have been talking about the constraints on Federal policy.
"People refuse to deal with the fact that people are poor," she said. "We cannot solve the crisis of poverty in New York City where 1.1 million people are on welfare. We're going through a budget crisis now. We're making very tough choices. We have committed ourselves to organizing the resources we have in a more effective, efficient fashion. That's good policy, good government and probably good politics."
In November, the voters will decide whether she's right.

HEADLINE: Temporary Workers Are on the Increase In Nation's Factories

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Temporary workers, those Americans recruited by companies like Manpower Inc. and rented to corporate clients, have become a familiar sight in many offices. Now "temps" are being used in manufacturing jobs, too, and in such numbers that the Labor Department no longer knows how many people actually work in American factories. Their growing presence means that manufacturing will probably not offer much help in solving the country's employment problem.
In the past, manufacturers have been among the first to make the economy bloom after a recession. As orders turned up, they hired new employees or recalled old ones. But in an economy that has surged and faltered several times since 1990, temporary workers have provided insurance against the next falter: people who can be brought in or laid off far more easily than regular employees.
 
'Worst-Case Approach'
 "Many manufacturers are taking a worst-case approach," said Ray Marcy, the chief executive of Interim Services Inc., a leader in recruiting and renting temporary workers. "Companies have surges in orders so they need help, but they don't want to hire. And with unemployment at 6.5 to 7 percent, it gives us a pool of talented people whom we can recruit inexpensively for our clients." 
 With the rise of this new class of inexpensive temporary manufacturing worker -- even at such stalwarts as I.B.M., General Electric, Motorola and Johnson & Johnson -- a de facto two-tier wage system is emerging at hundreds of manufacturing sites. It is a system in which temporary workers average $2 to $3 an hour less in wages than the permanent employees who work beside them. Many temps are sufficiently educated and skilled to learn a factory job quickly, even a complex one. But even they command only entry-level pay, which is rarely more than $9 an hour, the Labor Department says.
Some in the temporary-worker industry contend that their presence helps the United States hold jobs.
"The temps, in effect, are earning wages that are competitive with worker pay in other countries," said Bruce Steinberg, a spokesman for the National Association of Temporary Services. If the manufacturers could not find a way to get workers at this lower tier, he said, "then a significant part of manufacturing might be transferred outside our borders."
Nike Inc.'s high-tech distribution center in Memphis, while unlikely to be moved abroad, illustrates the economics that push manufacturers into using temporary workers. Sneakers arrive in bulk from many factories and are repackaged for shipment to retailers. Nearly 120 permanent employees, each earning at least $13 an hour in wages and benefits, work with 60 to 225 temporaries, the number varying with the level of activity.
Norrell Services, based in Atlanta, recruits the temps, trains some to drive forklift trucks and rents them to Nike. It collects up to $8.50 an hour for each worker. That covers $6.50 in wages and a $2 fee to Norrell -- the total cost still being well below that of a regular employee. Neither Norrell nor Nike pays for health insurance for the workers, but Norrell covers their worker's compensation and Social Security.
"We think of the core employees as team leaders," said Austin Martin, a Nike executive in Memphis. "They do the same jobs as the temps, give them direction and make sure the work is done right."
 
 
A Count Too Low
 Temps have been present in manufacturing for years; at Nike's Memphis office they were first used in the 1980's. But with the practice growing rapidly, the Labor Department acknowledges that its total count of 17.8 million workers in manufacturing in June is clearly too low, perhaps by several hundred thousand workers.
A survey of companies that supply temporary workers -- sponsored by their trade group, the National Association of Temporary Services -- showed that the companies provided an average of 348,000 temps a day to manufacturers late last year. That was up from a daily average of 224,000 early in 1992.
They represented more than one-fifth of the temporary workers recruited and hired out late last year by temporary-help companies. But none have been counted as manufacturing workers in the Labor Department's monthly tallies of employed people. The reason is that the companies that supply temporary workers -- Manpower, Kelley Services, Interim, Norrell and more than 1,000 others -- are classified as service-sector companies. So the people they deal with show up in the Government's employment data as service-sector employees, not manufacturing workers.
The survey by the Association of Temporary Services, completed last month, was undertaken partly as advertisement: its member companies are increasingly marketing their skills at supplying temporary workers to manufacturers. But the survey also provided the best measure yet of how this trend has grown.
 
 
Not the Whole Story
 Even that study, however, may not tell the whole story. By one estimate, provided by companies that "lease" whole groups of workers to manufacturers, an additional 75,000 people are hidden away in the Labor Department's statistics, untallied as factory workers. That would bring the total of uncounted manufacturing workers to 425,000.
Manufacturing is one of the economy's best sources of relatively high-wage jobs. But the number of workers has been held down as companies have introduced automation and as some production has moved to other countries. The recession took another slice out of this high-wage job pool; so, there is much interest in how many of these jobs return as the recovery progresses.
So far none have. Quite the contrary, the Labor Department says employment in manufacturing has shrunk by 664,000 since the recession officially ended 27 months ago. But if the estimated 425,000 extra temporary workers were included, the decline would be only about 230,000. This, in turn, would raise questions about the gains in efficiency and productivity that American manufacturers are reported to have achieved in recent years.
The Labor Department measures productivity by adding all the goods that the manufacturing sector produces. That total is divided by the number of hours worked by all the people in manufacturing, to find out how much each produced per hour. Production has remained steady in recent years, so as manpower has declined by 664,000 people, each remaining worker had to produce more to sustain the output. And the Labor Department reported that productivity rose sharply.
 
'We Don't Know'
 But if the decline in manufacturing workers was not so great -- if there were more workers than the department had counted -- the productivity gains would be smaller than previously calculated. Edwin Dean, the productivity expert at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, acknowledges as much. "It appears that we are underestimating the growth in hours worked and overestimating the growth in productivity," Mr. Dean said. "It could be by a trivial amount. We don't know."
In any case, Mitchell Fromstein, chairman of Manpower, says the surge in temporary factory workers encourages a shift in strategy among manufacturers. "What they used to do is produce for inventory or storage, as well as immediate demand, and that kept a factory going with a steady work force," Mr. Fromstein said. "Now they want to produce only when there is demand."
To accommodate their clients, the temporary-help companies often train recruits, mostly for relatively easy tasks, like operating a forklift truck or soldering a computer board or operating a specific machine.
"There are a lot of jobs in manufacturing that don't require all that much training, and that is the real point," said Harvey Maslin, president of Western Temporary Services. "You can train people in a week or two, and they are just as efficient as someone who has been there 10 or 15 years."
That sort of reasoning runs counter to the Clinton Administration's view that the nation's manufacturers, to be competitive, must invest heavily in permanent employees. A well-paid worker, this thesis goes, is worth the pay if he or she becomes skilled and experienced in many tasks and, out of loyalty to the company, constantly seeks new efficiencies.
 
 
'False Dawns'
 "Businesses have been burned by false dawns in this weak economy, and flexibility is critically important to them," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview. "But the use of temporary workers will prove to be a false economy for many American companies."
Maybe. Right now, however, thousands of manufacturers, large and small, use temporary workers, along with overtime for existing employees, as the two primary means of getting work done without having to hire new employees.
Many companies find temps useful in other ways as well. Motorola brings in temporary workers not only as a buffer against a downturn but also to screen people who might, if they work well, be offered jobs in the future. The company's Land Mobile Products operation, which manufactures control panels and other equipment for mobile radio communication, has 125 temps at its Illinois plant. Most have been there for six months, helping the company meet a "bubble" in demand.
"We have told these 125 people that at points in time, when we can increase staff, we would review them and those that qualify might be offered jobs," said London Newton, the division's employment manager.
The hope of making the transition from temporary worker to permanent employee undoubtedly is an important motivator, many experts say. But often the temps are not looking for permanent jobs.
Paul Anderson, 45, of Highland Park, N.J., is one. With degrees in psychology and statistics, Mr. Anderson quit a job with the State of New Jersey in 1990 and struck out on his own as a consultant.
He is still a consultant, but in the evenings. The weak economy left him with only $25,000 in consulting income last year, Mr. Anderson said. So he signed on with Western Temporary Services and that company has rented him to several companies, including Sundoor Brands, which mixes and bottles apple juice and Hawaiian punch in Dayton, N.J.
Mr. Anderson operated assembly line machines, earning $7 an hour alongside regular employees getting more than $10 an hour. "It would bother me if I did not have my nighttime consulting work; I can't get by on $7 an hour," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Out of Step on Japan Trade

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 5

 BODY:
Like the United States, the European Community will continue to press Japan at this week's summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial democracies to curb its $150 billion annual worldwide trade surplus, more than a fifth of which is with Western Europe.
But differences between the United States and Europe over how to address the trade problem will keep them from presenting Japan with a united front on the issue, government officials and analysts said, diluting their message and perhaps weakening their negotiating positions. 
 Despite ending initial negotiations with Japan last Monday without making significant progress, the Clinton Administration is sticking by its insistence that Tokyo accept specific targets for increased imports of goods and services from the United States as the best way of achieving measurable success in reducing the trade gap. A third of Japan's surplus comes from its trade with the United States.
 
Quota Deals Opposed
 The European Community, however, has made clear that it objects to such a "managed trade" approach, primarily out of fear than any specific quotas assigned by Japan to goods from the United States would reduce opportunities for European exporters.
Instead, the community will push a program to review with Japan, company by company if necessary, the reasons why European exporters have difficulty getting access to the Japanese market. Based on the results of the reviews, the community would then propose specific changes to remove the impediments and create more free-market competition, officials said.
Top community officials, including Sir Leon Brittan, the trade negotiator, and Hans van den Broek, the foreign affairs minister, will meet in Tokyo with a Japanese delegation led by Yoshiro Mori, the trade and industry minister, on Tuesday. The next day the leaders of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will open their summit meeting in the Japanese capital.
 
'A Different Style'
 "We don't reject the idea of putting maximum pressure on Japan to reduce its surplus as a percentage of G.D.P.," one European trade official said in Brussels. "We agree with the U.S. on the aim, and we haven't openly criticized the U.S. measures. But we have a different style in our approach to cutting the current-account surplus."
Japanese officials have sought in recent weeks to isolate the United States in its efforts to impose numerical targets on its imports to Japan by portraying the Clinton Administration's approach as counter to the principles of free trade. But it is self-interest rather than ideology that appears to have driven the wedge between the United States and Europe over the issue.
"If the Japanese markets are opened, European business will have to fight for its share," said Keith Richardson, the secretary general of the European Roundtable, an association of leading business executives based in Brussels. "But one hopes there are no special arrangements between the U.S. and Japan that might be done at Europe's expense."
Economists and trade analysts said Europe and the United States, although united in the general goal of inducing Tokyo to reduce its trade surplus, also remained reluctant comrades because of their own deep trade disputes over issues like agricultural subsidies and access to government contracts.
"The fact that the U.S. and the E.C. have disputes going on in many areas really inhibits them from coming in and presenting a united front to Japan," said Nigel Gault, an economist in the London office of DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting firm.
Because of the eroding European economy and the rise in unemployment, economists said the community and the national governments will be under increasing political pressure to take a hard line with Japan on trade, and not just in automobiles.
"Certainly at the moment I get the sense that in Europe there is growing support for protectionism," Mr. Gault said. "It's by no means the dominant sentiment, but it's growing. There's a general fear of cheap imports from all countries in Asia, produced at low labor costs, that are able to undercut workers in the E.C. and take jobs away."

HEADLINE: 64% OF JAPANESE SAY U.S. RELATIONS ARE 'UNFRIENDLY'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 5

 BODY:
As President Clinton heads to Tokyo for the Group of Seven summit meeting and his first official visit to the country he describes as America's most important partner, nearly two-thirds of Japanese polled describe their country's relations with the United States as "unfriendly."
The poll, conducted in both countries by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo Broadcasting System, found Japanese feeling toward the United States to be more negative than at any time in the eight years the poll has been conducted. 
 Japan's view of the United States soured markedly during the first six months of the Clinton Administration, a time of greatly heightened tensions over Japan's trade surpluses, and much of the Japanese discontent appears directed at Mr. Clinton himself.
 
A Sour Atmosphere
 More than two-thirds of the Japanese polled said they did not trust Mr. Clinton to keep his word. But the poll was conducted after months of scandals in Japan that have greatly weakened the Government and left many Japanese sour on politicians in general.
On the eve of his visit, Mr. Clinton cast his position on trade with Japan in a softer light today, telling a convention of schoolteachers that he planned to set broader economic goals in Tokyo this week. [Page A6.]
In the poll of Americans and Japanese, it was perhaps most surprising that the perception of the relationship differed greatly on each side of the Pacific. About 70 percent of Americans described relations between the two countries as "friendly," while only 35 percent of Japanese viewed the relationship the same way. Sixty-four percent of the Japanese viewed relations as "unfriendly."
 
An Abrupt Change
 The change in the Japanese view marked a striking decline. As recently as last December, 53 percent of Japanese said they viewed relations as friendly; in 1985, when the question was first asked, 73 percent described them that way. In the most recent poll, only 4 percent said they expected relations to improve in coming years.
"We are seeing some pent-up sentiments finally explode," said Takashi Inoguchi, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo. "Negative sentiments toward the United States are bursting out somehow and I think the bureaucrats and mass media in Japan are amplifying that."
The poll was based on 1,363 telephone interviews in the United States on June 21-24 and 1,395 face-to-face interviews in Japan on June 10-16. Each poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Much of the bad feeling appears to have been directed at Mr. Clinton himself, who was originally viewed in Japan as a bright young leader. Many Japanese once hoped he would inspire change in their own political system. Only 6 percent of Japanese described their feelings toward the President as "favorable," compared with 35 percent of Americans. Most Japanese, 63 percent, said they were undecided.
Mr. Clinton's favorable ratings rose to 41 percent in the United States when 622 poll respondents were interviewed again on June 27, shortly after the United States attack on an Iraqi intelligence installation in Baghdad. The Japanese respondents were not interviewed again.
 
Follow the Leader
 Several commentators here said they believed that the Japanese view of Mr. Clinton reflected comments from Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other national leaders suggesting that Mr. Clinton has much to learn. "There is a view about Clinton, widely shared here, that he is inexperienced and doesn't know anything about free trade," Professor Inoguchi said. "Many think that he has turned out to be a tiger and has to be dealt with carefully."
Mr. Clinton is to meet with Mr. Miyazawa for two hours on Tuesday afternoon, but expectations are low.
So far, the two countries have been unable to agree on a framework for trade negotiations, with Japan accusing the United States of trying to set targets that place the onus on Japan to close the trade gap. In any case, 70 percent of Japanese who were asked whether Mr. Clinton could be trusted to keep his word said "no."
 
Who Is to Blame?
 Indeed, the poll indicated bigger disagreements among the Japanese and American public than at any time in years on the question of which side is to blame for the economic tensions. Forty-five percent of American poll respondents said Japanese companies are "competing unfairly with American companies," the highest such response since the question was first asked in 1985.
The Japanese, in contrast, overwhelmingly reject the charge. Eighty-five percent agreed with the statement that "the United States is blaming Japan for its own economic problems." Only 12 percent said Japanese companies were competing on unfair terms.
But Japanese also blamed their own leader for troubles between the two countries. An overwhelming 82 percent said Mr. Miyazawa was doing "a poor job in solving trade problems between Japan and the United States." They gave similar marks to President Clinton.
American respondents were more charitable to the President on trade issues: 31 percent said they thought he was doing a good job, 38 percent a poor job and 31 percent did not know or gave no answer.
The 64 percent of Japanese who described Japanese-American relations as "unfriendly" exceeded the previous mark of 55 percent in May 1987, shortly after the United States imposed sanctions on some Japanese electronic products. Washington accused Japan of selling semiconductor chips at unfairly low prices.
 
Domestic Unhappiness
 The poll also revealed some of the popular roots of the political rebellion that has shaken Tokyo.
Eighty-five percent of the Japanese respondents said they did not think Mr. Miyazawa was serious about limiting corruption. Sixty-one percent said they supported splitting the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in two. (The polling was completed just a day before Parliament passed a vote of no confidence against Mr. Miyazawa, forcing an election in which the Liberal Democrats are expected to lose power for the first time in 38 years.)
The poll also showed that Detroit's efforts to improve quality and cut costs have not made much of an impression on the Japanese, perhaps because they see little change in the product offerings since the last, ill-fated Presidential visit here. That was in January 1992, when President Bush came here with the top executives of America's Big Three automakers, who denounced both the Japanese and the agreements Mr. Bush reached here to sell more autos and auto parts.
In the poll, 48 percent of Americans said American-made cars "are a better value," a view held by only 1 percent of the Japanese. In contrast, 33 percent of Americans viewed Japanese cars as a better value, while 91 percent of Japanese respondents held that view.
Such wide differences carried over to views of technological skills in both countries. While 25 percent of the Americans said Japan would have a higher level of technology in manufacturing than competitors in the next century, 60 percent of Japanese said that. About 50 percent of Americans and 25 percent of Japanese said the two countries would be equally matched in technology.
Japan's negative view of the United States extends to fear of crime: 76 percent of Japanese polled said they thought it very likely or somewhat likely that they would be victims of crime if they visited the United States.
At a time when Japan, with United States support, is pressing for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the poll suggests that the Japanese public is less enthusiastic about being in the thick of United Nations disputes.
Asked if "Japan should participate in United Nations peacekeeping efforts in trouble spots around the world," even at the cost of Japanese lives, only 32 percent agreed and 66 percent disagreed. The same share, 66 percent, said they feared Japan would be caught up in another country's war if it increased its military power.
Such results also showed a gulf between American and Japanese views of Japan's responsibilities in today's world. Only 24 percent of Japanese said they thought Japan had a responsibility to give military assistance in trouble spots and 74 percent said it did not. Forty percent said they thought the United States had that responsibility.
 
How the 2 Polls Were Done
 The New York Times/CBS News/ Tokyo Broadcasting System Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted on June 21 to 24 with 1,363 adults throughout the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, and on personal interviews conducted on June 10 to 16 with 1,395 adults throughout Japan.
In the United States the sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were chosen from random digits, permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
Within each household one adult was chosen at random at the beginning of the interview to be the respondent for the poll. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and the number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations relating to region, race, sex, age and education in the sample.
In Japan, the survey was conducted by the Nippon Research Center under supervision of the Tokyo Broadcasting System. Personal interviews were conducted throughout the country to yield a statistically representative sample of the Japanese public.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult Americans or all adult Japanese.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any public opinion survey may introduce other sources of error into the polls. The translation of questions between English and Japanese, for example, can sometimes result in questions that have slightly different meanings in each language.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PUSHING FOR JAPAN PACT

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 5

 BODY:
On the eve of his most significant foray onto the international stage to date, President Clinton cast his position on trade with Japan in a softer light today, telling a convention of school teachers that he planned to take a broader set of global economic goals to Tokyo this week.
Noting that more than 40 percent of the nation's trade is with Asia and that this accounts for millions of American jobs, Mr. Clinton put a positive construction on the relations between the United States and Japan that had been missing in recent discussions. 
 "In recent years, when we looked across the Pacific, we focused on our trade difficulties with Japan," he said. "Well, the trade deficit with Japan is real, unacceptable, and we're working very hard to take steps with Japan to deal with that.
"But our relationships with the Pacific for the most part are good for us, and we will benefit from them."
 
Meanwhile, . . .
 What Mr. Clinton left unsaid, however, was significant.
United States officials have spent weeks trying to get Japan to relax trade barriers to reduce a $50 billion annual trade deficit, but they have encountered significant difficulty in reaching the usual raft of pre-summit-meeting agreements, particularly on critical issues like wider access to Japanese markets.
But Mr. Clinton put an optimistic face on those difficulties today, saying that he planned to appeal to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and to President Kim Young Sam of South Korea to help win a new global agreement on open trade by the end of the year.
"The global economy is here to stay," he said. "We can't wish it away. We can't hide from it, and no political leader can promise to protect you from it. We simply have to compete, not retreat, and we have to do it while maintaining our position of world leadership."
Declaring that "the line between our domestic and foreign policy has completely evaporated," Mr. Clinton sought to link the domestic issues he has focused on and the foreign policy that has lately occupied so much of his time.
 
From Iowa to Seoul
 The meeting here of the National Education Association was the second leg of a trip that will take Mr. Clinton to Tokyo for a meeting of the leaders of seven industrial nations and to Seoul for talks on limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. On Sunday he stopped in Iowa to survey the damage caused by flooding in the Midwest.
In his remarks to the teachers' group, he said the Tokyo summit meeting would provide Washington with its first opportunity to showcase its determination to encourage global growth by reducing its own burdensome budget deficit.
Mr. Clinton said he would call for another meeting of the industrial nations in coming months, perhaps at Camp David, Md., to discuss the structural unemployment that is plaguing several nations.
The President said he also planned to use the trip to Asia to outline his plan to establish a robust economic relationship between the Far East and the United States.
"We cannot long continue to promote democracy when Europe is having the slowest economic growth in four decades, and America over three million jobs behind where we ought to be at this point in our development," he said, adding, "still with the strongest economy of all these industrial nations. We can do better and we must."
During his campaign for the Presidency, Mr. Clinton emphasized the importance of relations with Japan, a theme that he repeated today while expanding his definition to include South Korea.
 
Defending His Budget
 The President touted the budget bills that recently passed the House and Senate as evidence that the United States was "getting our house in order" and "putting the steel back into our competitive edge."
He did not point out, however, that the measures face a significant battle in a House-Senate conference to work out differences over taxes and Medicare cuts.
Mr. Clinton said the new taxes included in the bills are needed to craft a responsible economic plan.
"For 12 years, voters have been spoonfed pablum," he said. "They've been told there is a free ride."
But, he added, "The deficit is like a bone in our throat."

HEADLINE: In Canada, Elderly Praise Their Health Care

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 5

 BODY:
Charlotte M. Cohan, her bones weakened by disease, curled up in a chair at the Rotary-Laughlin Center with a cup of tea and some carrot cake.
"I always thought a nursing home was the worst place you could go to, the end of the line," she said as Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" played on the stereo. "This place is a godsend. I have a hundred friends here." 
 For her shared room and "more food than you can eat" at this downtown Toronto home for the aged, Mrs. Cohan, who is 82 years old, pays the equivalent of $700 a month, financing it through her government retirement pension. She also gets $87 a month in "comfort money" for personal expenses, like magazines and visits to the hairdresser.
Thanks to universal health insurance, benefits to the impoverished elderly in Canada are considerably more generous than those offered by the United States. In part they reflect a greater trust in the role of government in Canada, and a willingness to pay higher taxes for social services.
Fees from nursing home patients, for example, generally represent about one-third of the actual cost in either private or government homes. The balance is paid by provincial governments and community service agencies.
But Canada's different approach to health care for the elderly applies at higher income levels as well.
Americans must use their own money for nursing homes or other long-term care until they deplete their assets; then they can qualify for Medicaid, the Federal-state health program, a process that often leads to anguish and humiliation.
No such restrictions exist in Canada, where there are some means tests for government aid but families are not required to sell off their assets. Those who are better off may be required to pay more, but rich and poor live under the same roof, eat the same meals, go to the same social functions.
Canada's growing fiscal problems arise in part from its health system. But for long-term care it has a system that everyone can afford and that offers more for the money than many patients get in the United States.
The system for the elderly parallels Canada's universal health care, which has also won praise for being simpler and more efficient because the Government pays all health bills.
The Clinton Administration has said it wants to include long-term care in the health-reform proposals it is developing, but it may have to defer any major program because of the costs.
 
Fastest-Growing Age Group
 "We don't have quite the same idea that the only way you're entitled to government help is as a total last resort," said Raisa Deber, health economist at the University of Toronto. "We have a different set of priorities."
A result, said Sharon Sholzberg-Gray, executive director of the Canadian Long-Term Care Association in Ottawa, is that "affording long-term care has never been an issue for individual Canadians."
The elderly are Canada's fastest-growing age group. Some 3 million Canadians are over 65, or one citizen in 10. In 30 years, the ratio will be 1 in 5. American figures are roughly comparable: one American in 8 is over 65; in 30 years, the ratio will be 1 in 6.
The charge for standard nursing-home accommodation, depending on the province or territory, is $625 to $700 a month. The fee is set at about $78 a month under the income received by the poorest pensioners in order to leave the all-important "comfort money."
 
The Cost Is Lower
 Jessie Current, 90, pays about $1,650 a month at Rotary Laughlin. She is Canadian-born. Her late husband was an American in the pulp and paper business and they lived in southern Ohio. "This is nothing like the bills I'd have if I had to go to a nursing home in the States," she said. In the United States the average cost of a nursing home is $2,500 a month.
Using numbers from the provinces and from Statistics Canada, the Canadian Long-Term Care Association has calculated the cost to the taxpayer of all community- and institution-based care programs for the elderly at $3.9 billion a year. This is slightly over 10 percent of the $32.4 billion that Ottawa and the provinces spend on health.
In the United States public funds, mainly Medicaid, pay for more than half of all nursing-home costs. The Health Care Financing Administration reports Medicaid expenditures for long-term care at $38.6 billion last year. An estimated $15 billion to $20 billion of public funds also went into long-term care in Federal and state social-service grants.
 
A Fear of Poverty
 Most American and Canadian health economists agree that the quality of institutions that serve mainly Medicaid patients -- though they vary widely -- is generally below that of the publicly supported Canadian institutions. Medicaid pays nursing home fees that range from $1,200 a month to nearly $4,000 a month, depending on the state, usually well below what the better homes charge private patients.
So great is the fear in the United States of being forced into poverty by the cost of long-term care that more than 2.4 million Americans have bought costly insurance to cover the cost. In Canada, there is no such thing.
No country has a perfect system, but Canada's, while continuing a process of creative tinkering, has caught the attention of specialists in the United States.
"We have looked at Canadian long-term-care programs and found them very interesting," said Robyn Stone, who headed the Long-Term Care Work Group for President Clinton.
 
Some Spending Cuts
 The President is expected to give special emphasis in his proposals to expanding home- and community-based programs, as Canadian provinces are now doing. Keeping people in their own homes longer can improve the quality of life and save money.
Ontario, home to one of three Canadians, has just announced plans to spend $505 million over the next five years, mostly to expand and streamline home-care services for the elderly, like meal programs, home maintenance, transportation and nurses' visits.
The province's Health Minister, Ruth Grier, said in an interview that overall health spending is being drastically curtailed except in the home- and community-based sector, where the aim is to "help the elderly keep their independence as long as possible."
Olive Donaldson, a member of the nonprofit Victorian Order of Nurses, visits 12 patients a day, most of them elderly, in north Toronto. A "foot soldier," as she calls herself, "who is in the trenches every day," she provides home dialysis, intravenous medication, even "bowel routines" if necessary.
For her there is no question about the value of home care. "I feel it's cheaper in the long run," she said. "It takes longer to get well in a hospital. At home you're more relaxed. It's more supportive, and you're in charge."
Ontario government agencies provided some form of home medical care to 307,000 people last year, roughly 3 percent of the population of the province, but more than one-third of those over 65. The number is expected to grow to 340,000 in the current year.
 
A Higher Priority
 Many states in the United States already have well-developed home-care programs for the elderly, financed in part by Medicaid. The main differences are the higher priority given this approach in Canada and the degree of integration here between home and institutional care.
Dr. Duncan Robertson, head of geriatric medicine units at both the Sunnybrook Health Science Center in Toronto and the University of Toronto, points to an "artificial dichotomy" in the United States.
"In making choices, families must do a great deal more work and suffer more anxiety because the system is so complicated and disjointed, whereas in Canada, you literally have one or two contacts with placement specialists who can then access a full range of services," he said.
Basically, the Canadians run care for the aged as a social program, which means that the real risk of financial disaster for those facing long-term-care needs is incurred not by individuals but by society.
 
Tests National Character
 In their book "A Will and a Way: What the United States Can Learn from Canada about Caring for the Elderly," Rosalie A. Kane and Robert L. Kane, health economists at the University of Minnesota, call long-term care a test of national character.
Canadians, they wrote, "seem to show that persons and organizations of good will can grapple with long-term care and produce a program that both the country and individual users can afford."
Mrs. Kane added in an interview: "At the very minimum, the Canadian experience illustrates the art of the possible at a time when pessimism prevails in the United States regarding genuine, far-reaching long-term-care reform."

HEADLINE: Music Notes;
Violinists to Play So Youngsters Can String Along

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
The directors of Music for the World, a new foundation that sponsors music-education projects, have a theory: if Government agencies give money to the public schools for music programs, then music lovers should also chip in. To that end, Music for the World is presenting Fiddlefest, a benefit at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 25 in which 10 well-known violinists are to perform to raise money for the Opus 118 Music Center, a violin-instruction program in East Harlem, and Link Up, Carnegie's education program.
The specifics of the concert have not been announced, but the roster suggests a polystylistic evening. Soloists from the world of classical music will include Itzhak Perlman, Midori, Isaac Stern, Ida and Ani Kavafian and two members of the Guarneri String Quartet: Arnold Steinhardt and the violist Michael Tree. The others will be Diane Monroe and Karen Briggs, who play jazz, and Mark O'Connor, a country fiddler. A student ensemble from the Opus 118 Music Center, led by its founder, Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras, will also perform. 
 "The original energy behind our organization was Walter Scheuer," said Eve Marko, the executive director of Music for the World. "He has been a member of the Carnegie Hall board for many years, and he has made films about music and supported musicians and students who were struggling to make it. But he founded this organization as a way of addressing the bigger picture, which is that people who are interested in music but who have not decided to commit their lives to becoming the next Heifetz now have no access to music in the schools.
"We are in the process of assembling a board of advisers, which includes musicians of all kinds. Because we feel that music in the schools must be not only classical music but any kind of music that can touch young people's hearts."
The organization was founded in June 1992, and Fiddlefest is its first public event. The beneficiaries are in some ways at the opposite ends of the organizational spectrum. Carnegie's Link Up program, the firmly established educational arm of a major New York cultural institution, sends teachers to the public schools to give students introductory classes about music before taking them to the hall for a performance. It reaches about 19,000 students a year.
The Opus 118 Music Center, named for its headquarters at 409 East 118th Street, is more of a neighborhood operation. It was founded in 1991 when Ms. Guaspari-Tzavaras, a public-school music teacher since 1980, lost her job when her program was dropped. Ms. Guaspari-Tzavaras's resourceful response to unemployment was to persuade the Board of Education to let her continue teaching in East Harlem schools so long as she made other arrangements about her salary. She then solicited private and corporate contributions and set up a foundation that pays for her program, which has 130 students between the ages of 6 and 13.
"I've been to her classes," Ms. Marko said, "and I've spoken to the parents of her students, who tell me that music is here to stay, not only in the lives of their children who are in Roberta's classes, but the siblings and the rest of the family. She has really made an impact. So we think of this concert not just as a benefit, but as an advocacy evening. The disappearance of the arts from schools around the country is an issue. But these organizations show what's possible with community support."
Tickets are $500 and $1,000 for the concert, a dinner and a champagne reception, or $35 to $100 for just the performance. Information: (212) 247-7800.
 
A Chicago Renovation
 The Chicago Symphony Orchestra's home, Orchestra Hall, is to undergo a $92 million renovation that will begin next year and is expected to be completed by 1998, the orchestra has announced. The renovation, which will not interrupt the orchestra's seasons, will include an expansion of the hall's stage, which in its present form is too small to comfortably accommodate concerts using full orchestra and chorus. The roof over the stage will be raised to improve the hall's acoustics.
Joyce Idema, the orchestra's director of marketing and public relations, said recently that the renovation would not significantly alter the look of the hall, and that the seating capacity of 2,590 would remain about the same. Because the stage is to be extended backward into the alley behind the hall, no seats in the hall will be lost. Seating may, in fact, be increased: the plan allows for the choral seating area behind the orchestra to be used by the audience, an arrangement more common in Europe than in the United States.
The largest part of the renovation is not in the hall itself, but in the addition of a new wing to the Orchestra Hall building. When the adjacent Borg-Warner Building is demolished in 1995, Orchestra Hall will begin building an extension that will include new office and rehearsal space.
The plan also allows space for a restaurant, a retail store, an exhibition area and an expanded music library, as well as upgraded recording and television facilities. A two-year feasibility study for the project was undertaken by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the architectural firm, and Lawrence Kirkegaard, an acoustician, but Ms. Idema said the team that would actually design and execute the renovation had not yet been named.
Orchestra Hall has been the Chicago Symphony's headquarters since 1905, and has been renovated twice since then. Its acoustics are considered to be fairly good, although some structural work in 1966 is generally considered to have interfered with the sound, something the current plan is meant to correct. A pipe organ was installed in the hall in 1981.
 
Hemidemisemiquavers
 Allison Vulgamore, the general manager of the New York Philharmonic, is to become the executive director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra on Sept. 6. At the Philharmonic, Ms. Vulgamore coordinated the logistics of the orchestra's touring and oversaw its personnel, education and artistic administration departments. She joined the Philharmonic's administration in 1987, after five years in various administrative positions with the National Symphony. In 1991, during the period between Albert K. Webster's resignation as the Philharmonic's managing director and Deborah Borda's appointment to the post, Ms. Vulgamore was acting managing director, and was widely considered a candidate for the post. In Atlanta, she will be the chief administrator of an orchestra that in recent years has achieved considerable national recognition through a series of recordings with its former music director, Robert Shaw (and to a lesser degree with its current conductor, Yoel Levi).
*The New York Chamber Symphony of the 92d Street Y was awarded the 1993 Ascap Award for Adventuresome Programming of Contemporary Music. Each of the orchestra's programs during the 1992-93 season (not counting those in the Baroque series) included at least one new or recent work, and several also revived neglected 20th-century works.
*The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra will celebrate its centennial during the 1994-95 season, and is seeking materials -- documents, photographs, recordings and memorabilia -- both for its permanent archive and for use in special exhibitions and publications. Carnegie Hall began a similar archival project a few years ago when it was preparing for its own centennial, and turned up a trove of material, much of it from concertgoers who had hoarded boxes of programs, ticket stubs, posters and other items. Cincinnati's history has been fairly colorful: its past directors include Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ysaye and Fritz Reiner, and it was one of the first American orchestras to make commercial recordings.

Once Again, Baseball Kicks Dirt on Its Own

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
The Pittsburgh Pirates evidently were not going to let the San Diego Padres beat them at their own game. The Pirates had lost the bulk of their good players through free agency, but here were the Padres trading away their high-priced players, not waiting for them to leave as free agents.
So the Pirates last week went the Padres one better in the game of one-upmanship. They took the we-can-slash-our-payroll-better-than-you-can game into the front office and lopped two of their four highest-ranking executives from their staff. Last Wednesday, Mark Sauer, the Pirates' president, summoned Douglas Bureman, senior vice president for business operations, and Rick Cerrone, vice president for public relations, and told them their jobs were being eliminated and bade them goodbye. 
 "We can absorb their duties internally better than if I had lost any other vice president," Sauer said by telephone from Pittsburgh yesterday, explaining why he chose Bureman and Cerrone to eliminate.
The puzzling part of the Pirates' move is that they banished the vice presidents now even though they will pay them through October. The Padres at least didn't release Gary Sheffield and continue paying his $3.11 million salary. The Pirates could have kept the vice presidents in their positions until the end of the season, giving them an opportunity to look for new jobs without the black cloud of dismissal hanging over their heads.
Asked why he acted now, Sauer said immediate action was required because of "the ongoing financial pressure we're under, particularly with the loss of $7 million or so in TV dollars next year."
"It's important we do that now so we can withstand that loss," he added.
But why didn't he give Bureman and Cerrone the added time and avoid the suspicions that naturally arise when people are fired? "I wouldn't want to have two lame ducks at the senior level," Sauer said. "That would be very unfair to them."
Dismissal isn't very fair either, but if a theory about the whole episode is correct, it places a different perspective on the matter.
The theory, offered by a person close to the Pirates' organization, suggests that the severe step was not done out of financial desperation, but rather was designed as a move to give the appearance of financial desperation.
The Pirates are suing the city of Pittsburgh over maintenance of Three Rivers Stadium and the stadium lease. Their goal is to get a new, more favorable, lease. They especially want to make that point to the man who will soon be the city's new mayor. (If strains of this scenario sound familiar, it's because George Steinbrenner has orchestrated a similar game in New York with the Yankees and Yankee Stadium.)
By firing the vice presidents, the theory goes, the Pirates have created a crisis in Pittsburgh. Fans and news media alike have talked and written the past week about how bad things are with the Pirates. The theme has been that if the Pirates don't get what they need in the near future, the city will lose them.
This, the theory concludes, is precisely the atmosphere the Pirates wanted to create. If Bureman and Cerrone had been told privately that they would be jettisoned at the end of the season, it would not have served the purpose.
Sauer denied such an ulterior motive.
"We're in litigation with the city to terminate our lease," he said. "If we haven't gotten their attention in the last 15, 16 months, we never will."
Whatever the reason, Bureman and Cerrone face future life in or out of baseball with possibly besmirched reputations.
Baseball management is good at besmirching reputations, especially those of the players, who, after all, are the product that club owners are trying to sell to the public. Major league and club officials wonder why their stars aren't as popular among the fans as Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley; they don't understand that they have undermined their players' image by constantly whining about their high salaries and the production they get from them.
If baseball has an economic problem because of players' salaries, let the owners and their chief labor executive, Richard Ravitch, try to solve it with the union privately. Instead, they constantly take their case to the public, as if the fans can pressure the players into agreeing to a salary cap. That strategy is flawed for two reasons:
1. The players never have been and will not now be pressured by what fans think.
2. The last thing the fans want to hear is the owners' crying about the problem they created by giving lavish salaries to players of all levels of ability.
Baseball officials should be selling Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr. (they easily could become baseball's version of Jordan and Barkley), John Olerud, Andres Galarraga, Cecil Fielder, Fred McGriff, Juan Gonzalez, Gregg Jefferies, the Toronto Blue Jays' fab five. They should be talking about the record rate at which fans are flocking to games this season, and the phenomenon in Denver, where 60,000 has become a routine crowd size.
Instead, they sell their problems, seemingly intent on putting their game in the worst light. The fans have enough of their own problems. They go to the ball park to get away from them. They don't need to add baseball's to their own.

TANDEM COMPUTER WARNS IT MAY DISMISS SOME WORKERS

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Tandem Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., expecting a fiscal third-quarter loss, said it might dismiss some employees this month because of a drop in orders and a weak economy. The company, which made its announcement on Friday, would not say how big a loss it would post for the quarter that ended on Wednesday. A survey of 11 analysts by Zacks Investment Research produced a mean earnings estimate of 18 cents a share. That would have been 2 cents more than in the corresponding quarter a year earlier, when Tandem earned 16 cents.

HEADLINE: Ships Are Culprits As Foreign Species Invade Ecosystems

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
Kudzu, the galloping green vine imported from Japan in the late 1800's, has taken over much of the American South. The zebra mussel, which arrived from Europe in the late 1980's, is on the march in the lakes and rivers of the eastern United States, clogging intake pipes and threatening to disrupt water distribution. In Australia, a tropical toad imported from America in 1935 to control sugar-cane beetles is eating everything but the beetles and has become a plague on the land.
Alien species of plants and animals transported around the world by human beings are invading ecosystems on every continent and island, imperiling the natural ecology and to some degree the human economy. And now scientists have found that the kaleidoscopic array of marine creatures in saltwater ponds are being transferred routinely, every day, from one part of the world to another -- in the ballast tanks of ships. 
 Dumped into new habitats when the ships make port, the scientists fear, the billions of organisms are placing estuaries, bays and other inland waters in serious ecological jeopardy by threatening to decimate native species.
Ships have long carried sea water as ballast, but bigger and faster vessels with cleaner, more hospitable tanks have "upped the ante" in recent years, says Dr. James T. Carlton, director of the Maritime Studies Program conducted by Williams College in Mystic, Conn. Marine biologists say that scores and perhaps hundreds of ballast-borne invasions have consequently taken place in the last two or three decades.
"There was ballast water before," said Dr. Carlton, "but now it seems to have clicked into place as a major dispersal vector."
An especially compelling illustration has surfaced in a study in the current issue of the journal Science by Dr. Carlton and Dr. Jonathan B. Geller, a marine biologist at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington. They sampled the ballast tanks of 159 Japanese cargo ships arriving at Coos Bay, Ore. In the laboratory, the scientists discovered that the ballast water contained 367 different types of plants and animals, mostly in larval form, representing all of the major marine habitat groups.
"We found shrimps, crabs, fish, barnacles, sea urchins, starfish, worms, jellyfish, clams, snails, really the complete spectrum of marine life that the public is familiar with," said Dr. Carlton. Invasions of marine organisms such as these have been documented on every continent, the two scientists reported. "We could have been anywhere -- Seattle-Tacoma, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tahiti, Australia" and probably found much the same kind of thing.
 
'Conveyor Belt' of Invaders
 When all the evidence is put together, Dr. Carlton said, "we see a conveyor belt of marine organisms wrapping around the world; there are several thousand species in motion right this moment, as we speak, in the ballast waters of ships."
People have transferred plants and animals from one region to another since ancient times. The global transplantation of organisms accelerated with the European explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries and again with the speedier transportation and expanded trade of modern times, and today flora and fauna in virtually very part of the planet are a mixture of natives and exotics. Some exotics have settled benignly into their new habitats, but others have aggressively eaten or crowded out native species to the point where some natives have been extinguished and others threatened with extinction.
Alien species have been introduced both accidentally, as in ballast water, and on purpose, and some of the purposeful introductions have turned out to be the worst. In a commentary accompanying the study in Science, Dr. Joel W. Hedgpeth, professor emeritus of marine ecology at Oregon State University, described the importation of the tropical American toad to Australia to combat the sugar-cane beetles:
"Unfortunately the toads are nocturnal feeders and the beetles are abroad by day, while the toads sleep under rocks, boards and burrows. By night the toads flourish, reproduce phenomenally well and eat up everything they can find. The cane growers were warned by Walter W. Froggart [sic!], president of the New South Wales Naturalist Society, that the introduction was not a good idea and that the toads would eat the native ground fauna. He was immediately denounced as an ignorant, meddlesome crank. He was also dead right."
Today the toads are thriving so spectacularly that some are the size of dinner plates. Nobody knows what to do about them.
In any bay or estuary, ecological factors like water quality, salinity, time of year, temperature and number of predators and competitors vary from time to time and place to place. If the combination is not exactly right when an invader arrives, it may not become established. "A number of things have to come together to make the invasion click, as it were," said Dr. Carlton. All it takes is a window of ecological opportunity for a successful invasion to occur.
 
Troubled Waters
 Perhaps 5 to 10 percent of species introduced to a new environment become established there, he said.
The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment is completing an extensive study of the impact of foreign species in the United States and is to issue a report later this year. Dr. Carlton, who is a member of the study's advisory panel, said it emphasizes the invasion of exotic plants and animals to the land and fresh water.
The study by Dr. Carlton and Dr. Geller raises a new issue. The researchers boarded cargo ships arriving at Coos Bay from 25 Japanese ports after passages averaging two weeks, during which some of the tiny planktonic and larval organisms died but many survived. "These ships have a lake of water in the middle of them," said Dr. Carlton. Typically, he said, the ballast tank is 70 feet deep and 30 feet square. "You could put a boat in there with an outboard motor," he said. The researchers lowered a net with holes the size of pinheads into the tanks to take samples. The samples were then analyzed at the Oregon Institute of Biology. They contained representatives of all major marine groups, including plants, plant-eaters, meat-eaters, scavengers and parasites.
This wholesale transport of entire assemblages of coastal fauna "renders bays, estuaries and inland waters among the most threatened ecosystems in the world," Dr. Carlton and Dr. Geller wrote in Science. Releasing such a vast array of species means that "at any time you could be inserting into Chesapeake Bay or Long Island Sound or Puget Sound a brand new parasite or predator that could decimate fisheries," said Dr. Carlton. "We are constantly seeing new invasions all around us."
He and Dr. Hedgpeth cited a West Coast example, the introduction of an Asian clam into the upper arm of San Francisco Bay, where it was discovered in 1985. Its larvae, believed to have arrived in ballast water from China, has attained a population density of nearly 12,000 per square yard and is, Dr. Hedgpeth wrote, "capable of seriously interrupting the basic food chain of San Francisco Bay."
But there is hope for a rescue, Dr. Hedgpeth said. An invader from the Atlantic, the green crab, has spread throughout the bay since 1990. Its body is only three inches across, but it is "a vicious little thing," he said, meaning that the crab is voracious and aggressive and able to force shellfish open with its claws. It could well control the Asian clam. The problem is that it may also ravage populations of native clams that draw clam diggers to bays north of San Francisco. The recent appearance of the green crab in one such bay is "an eyebrow-raiser," he said.
All told, said Dr. Carlton, San Francisco Bay has about 150 more marine species as a result of invasions; but given the ability of exotic species to depress native ones, the natives may turn out to be "a shadow of their former selves" in numbers. One concern is that this kind of ecological transplantation and thinning of native species will lead to similar assemblages of species in bays and estuaries everywhere -- "homogenizing the world," Dr. Carlton calls it. Since bays and estuaries are generally sheltered bodies of water with unique species mixtures, he said, they are especially vulnerable to invasion, much as islands are.
Can anything be done?
One short-term but partial solution, Dr. Carlton said, is to dump ballast on the high seas and re-ballast with mid-ocean water. This might reduce or even eliminate the number of estuarine species carried, and many mid-ocean species presumably would not survive in shallow inshore waters. But the maneuver might not be possible in high seas.
In the future, ships might be constructed in a way that would make it possible for the ballast water to be sterilized or filtered, two measures for which vessels cannot practically be modified.
"In the long term I think there's great hope," said Dr. Carlton. "In the meantime we have to hope that we don't sustain an invasion in a place like Chesapeake Bay or Long Island Sound or Puget Sound. That's where the roulette comes in."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Clinton: Victor and Puzzle

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The President gave the small lunch for journalists because he wanted to talk about the Tokyo economic summit before he set off.
I listened earnestly, but the truth is my mind occasionally wandered off -- to a funny movie and to a budget cut that had escaped his attention. 
 Afterward, I stopped feeling guilty about my lapses of strict attention to summit solemnities because taken together the movie and the budget cut seemed to sum up both the President's triumph and his failure -- symbols, something all journalists cherish dearly.
The film was a wonderful assassination of journalistic prophets, a "documentary" prepared by the Clinton people and shown at the inauguration gala. One seer after another was recaptured at different points in the campaign capsulizing Mr. Clinton's chances of becoming President -- out, dead, so long, Bill Who?
The movie should have been the appetizer for lunch. For weeks the press has told us that Europeans think very poorly of Mr. Clinton -- bumbling, inexperienced, unsophisticated, unfit for exalted company.
But here was Bill Who, not only President but going to a summit where he will be the only national leader with a future longer than a blink, representing the country with the most political and economic stability.
In Japan and Italy, the Governments are busy arresting themselves. In Britain, the Prime Minister teeters and the Royal Family is embarrassing comedy. In France and Germany, President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl must be calling Mikhail Gorbachev for tips on setting up their post-office foundations.
But every time my good old naturalized American blood started pumping pleasurably at Mr. Clinton's in-your-eye triumph I remembered that budget item. I thought unhappily that it showed Mr. Clinton's puzzling failure to lead the country on the fundamental issue of the right of the citizens to live in peace and safety.
On Wednesday of last week, with the approval of Administration budget specialists, the House of Representatives cut $231 million from President Clinton's own anti-drug budget. The money was to have been spent on drug therapy and education.
On Thursday, the President swore in his new director of drug policy. Obviously nobody had told Mr. Clinton what had happened in the House because he talked earnestly about how his Administration was increasing the budget for drug therapy and education as essential ways of cutting drug demand. On Friday, the day of the lunch, word still had not climbed up the White House chain.
But, then, why should Administration budget people take too seriously Mr. Clinton's commitment to fighting drugs and the crime and fears it brings to America?
The White House virtually wiped out the anti-drug office that Mr. Clinton turned over to the new director, Lee Brown. The President gives neither direction nor passion to the war against drugs; forgive the unfashionable expression. For the Administration it is not an insy item: No careers are to be found there.
Mr. Clinton talks about creating jobs, but otherwise he has a strange air of detachment about what most Americans who live in the cities really want.
They really want freedom from the dangers of drug addiction for their children -- and freedom from bullets. They want guns in cities criminalized for almost everybody but cops.
They want the disgrace of homelessness handled -- care for the mentally ill, housing for the economically destitute and rousting for the exploiters and marauders of the streets.
They even dream of sending their children to schools without metal detectors, where teen-age girls respect themselves enough not to walk around with big bellies.
No President can give all that, nor government alone. But a President can preach and holler at the citizenry, implore and criticize it, tell Americans what home or school or church can do, what they have to do all by themselves, what government must do and where its limits lie. That is leadership by inspiration, the antidote to leadership by demagoguery.
Everybody tells Mr. Clinton to focus only on the economy, as if Americans had no other hope, dream or fear.
The last American President remembered solely for his impact on the economy was Herbert Hoover. Perhaps that may occur to Mr. Clinton after he returns from Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Bank Courts Growth in Marriages of Convenience

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Edward P. Junker 3d flirts with bankers for a living. A banker himself, he is chief executive for the northwestern Pennsylvania region of the PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh. Two years ago, PNC stripped Mr. Junker and seven other regional executives of much of their operational responsibilities and told them to go out and find banks for the rapidly growing company to buy.
Set in the slow-growth Rust Belt, PNC says its earnings from its existing operations -- which stretch from Kentucky to Delaware -- will increase 6 to 7 percent a year at best. But like other expanding regional banks, PNC hopes it can grow at twice that rate by buying other banks. 
 So Mr. Junker hit the road, calling on the executives and key shareholders of most of the banks in the 20 counties in which PNC wants to expand.
 
 
Polite Overtures
 The flirtation is indirect and cordial. He will commiserate with them about how keeping up with regulations is getting harder for smaller banks. He will mention how PNC has invested in state-of-the-art technology. He will talk about how he has more time to meet with clients and to do the other things he likes best since he sold his bank to PNC in 1983.
Mr. Junker would never be so crass as simply to offer a certain amount of money. Nonetheless, "they know why I'm calling," Mr. Junker said. "Sometimes they are not interested. And sometimes they are just kicking the tires."
 Often, after years of coy rendezvous, a banker may eventually get serious. "As a rule, it's a long courtship," Mr. Junker said. After calling on scores of banks, Mr. Junker has been able to win two for PNC since 1991: the CCNB Corporation in Harrisburg and the First National Pennsylvania Corporation in Erie, his hometown.
"We had great respect for the company and thought they would take care of our employees and customers," said Lawrence F. Klima, the former chairman of First National, which chose PNC over four other bidders last year. And no small reason was the repeated contact with Mr. Junker. "He knew our directors and what made them tick as well as we did," Mr. Klima said.
As the storm clouds of the real estate recession lift, it is mating season for bankers. Their courtship rituals can be seen on the golf course, over steak dinners and before poker games at bankers' conventions. Their urge to merge is a survival instinct in an environment where growth is slow and competition fierce.
No one is more driven to master the art of romancing financiers than PNC's tough, plain-speaking chief executive, Thomas H. O'Brien, who sent Mr. Junker on his mission. PNC is already the country's 11th-largest banking company, with more than $50 billion in assets. But PNC sees its destiny as becoming one of the handful of truly nationwide banks that will survive a decade of consolidation.
Mr. O'Brien plans to buy big banks to get into new markets -- from St. Louis to Maine at first -- and smaller ones to increase its share in existing locations.
While this expansion strategy seems simple, it is very complicated to execute. It is not economical for banks simply to open branches to expand into a new location; market share shifts too slowly in banking. Nor can they just make unsolicited bids for banks they want to buy; hostile offers risk alienating key employees and customers.
 
 
Waiting for an Opportunity
 So PNC must wait for banks to get into financial trouble or for their executives to decide it is time to sell.
"The world isn't ideal," Mr. O'Brien said. "So we have to position the company to be opportunistic and be well prepared financially and with the infrastructure so we can react when the opportunities come. Inevitably they will."
PNC is poised to pounce once it learns a bank is for sale. It has a staff of merger specialists assembling files, with estimated values, on hundreds of banks that it may want to buy. Mr. O'Brien has also assembled a "red team" of executives from all its business lines ready to evaluate a potential acquisition target once negotiations begin.
Mr. O'Brien is not content simply to wait for deals to walk in the door. That is why he has assigned his regional executives to flirt with smaller banks. Mr. O'Brien has devoted himself to the more complex courtship of banks with more than $6 billion in assets; he is particularly fond of about a dozen.
 
 
The Big Ones Get Away
 Indeed, while PNC has bought eight small banks in the last two years, Mr. O'Brien has been unable to win over any of his big targets. Most tantalizing would be to buy a leading bank in Philadelphia, the largest market in PNC's region, where it now has only a small presence. PNC has been especially keen on the largest Philadelphia-based bank, the $22 billion Core states Financial Corporation, which has so far rebuffed Mr. O'Brien's advances.
One reason PNC may have a hard time closing a big deal is that Mr. O'Brien rejects arrangements that are billed as mergers of equals, with the power shared by executives of both banks.
Mr. O'Brien says that he will offer top executive positions to qualified people from the companies he buys but that the power will remain in Pittsburgh. "You can't have equivocation and vacillation and ambivalence," he said.
PNC's smaller deals have proved to be highly profitable. PNC bought banks with assets totaling nearly $5 billion for far less than it would pay for a $5 billion bank, Mr. O'Brien said. Moreover, because PNC has been able to merge most of these banks into nearby operations, it has been able to slash their expenses by up to 50 percent.
 
Appeasing the Chief Executive
 Even with smaller banks, the most difficult aspect of getting deals done is the future of the banks' executives and board members.
Mr. O'Brien said: "Things are finally going well, and the C.E.O. says, 'Why should I turn over something that I've worked all this time for to someone else. If I sell out, I'm not going to be C.E.O. anymore.' "
PNC offers these bankers jobs or severance packages. Nonetheless, banks are often sold when the chief executive is nearing retirement age.
PNC is also hoping more banks will become frustrated with the complexity of keeping up with banking technology and regulations. "It was getting too expensive for us to invest in the branch automation," said Mr. Klima, who sold the bank in Erie to PNC.
Once they decide it is time to sell, some banks simply run an auction. But in other cases, they choose a small number of banks to negotiate with, and the point of PNC's flirtation is to make sure PNC is not forgotten.
 
 
'You Have to Pass This First Test'
 "They have to feel comfortable; to trust us; to believe in us," said Michael N. Harreld, who runs PNC's Kentucky bank. "They want to know how have we treated the employees and the community in past acquisitions. Has the company kept its word? Some people may see these as soft issues, but you have to pass this first test."
The next test, for many bankers, is how much autonomy the bank will be granted after the merger. Here PNC is at a disadvantage, compared with some smaller banks that have a policy of keeping local managements largely intact. For a while, PNC used this type of decentralized structure. But Mr. O'Brien decided to bring most of the important decisions back to Pittsburgh to improve controls and further cut costs.
PNC does let regional executives make certain decisions on prices and credit and allows them to keep making charitable contributions.
"The C.E.O.'s live in the community and will stay there after the deal is done," Mr. Harreld said. "They do not want to be embarrassed when someone comes to them later and says, 'Look what happened to the community,' based on what you did."
 
 
Price Has the Last Word
 Deals, however, eventually get down to price, and since most transactions are done as stock swaps, the seller has to be convinced of the future prospects of the buyer. PNC has an advantage because its stock is selling at a price relative to book value that is higher than the stock prices of many of the banks it is bidding against.
"Where there is a bidding situation, the larger banks have a distinct advantage in that they can pay more," said William J. King, chairman of the Dauphin Deposit Corporation, a $4.5 billion banking company in Harrisburg. "The deals we do are based on relationships with people we've known for a long time."
Yet officials at PNC, more than at other banks, consider their higher stock price to be a trap as much as a benefit. Many large banks are willing to buy banks for stock at a price at which the earnings per share of the existing stock will not be diluted. PNC, however, will not give away more in stock for an acquisition than it would have paid in cash. This pricing discipline earns the bank praise from many analysts.
 
 
Discipline in Acquisitions
 "They are eager to expand, but they are very disciplined about how much they pay," Dennis Shea of Morgan Stanley said. "As a shareholder, that's how you want them to be."
Indeed, PNC is equally wary about completing the deals it agrees to. In February, PNC canceled an agreement to buy Ohio Bancorp of Youngstown for $250 million after inspection of the bank's books disclosed more problems than it had expected. "That was a fascinating transaction because most banks when they say they will do a deal, come hell or high water, won't walk away from it," Mr. Shea said
Pricing is the biggest factor in how many objects of PNC's affection make it to the altar. Mr. O'Brien says PNC is negotiating more potential transactions than before, but since the industry is earning record profits, the prices are too high for many of the banks, especially the larger ones.
"We can do the deals that the market gives us," Mr. O'Brien said. "Now what the defense gives us is the short pass -- the smaller deals. So we have decided to use lots of short passes to get to the end zone."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 13, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Tuesday about the PNC Bank Corporation misstated the amount by which the company expects earnings from existing operations to increase yearly. The company expects revenues from existing operations to increase by 6 to 7 percent and earnings to increase by 10 to 15 percent because of cost-cutting.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO;
CLINTON COURTING REBEL LAWMAKERS ON TRIP TO JAPAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, July 7

 BODY:
Landing in the midst of Japan's political turmoil, President Clinton set out Tuesday to build relationships with a new generation of politicians trying to overthrow the party that has ruled Japan for four decades. And this morning, in a speech at one of the country's leading universities, he sought to enlist the Japanese people to lower trade barriers for their own good and prosperity.
In a toughly worded address to students at Waseda University, Mr. Clinton outlined his strategy for relations with Asia but also argued that Japan's high prices and restrictive practices had "hurt Japanese consumers." He told the audience, mostly students, that major changes in the country's trading system "would benefit both of us," and argued that "you have a common cause with the people of America." [Excerpts, page A8.] 
 The speech this morning came on the first full day of the President's six-day Asia tour, built around the Group of Seven economic summit meeting that began today.
[About the same time, trade ministers for four of the leading industrial nations said they had reached a crucial tariff reduction agreement that would likely lead to a revival of stalled global trade talks. If the agreement represents a breakthrough, it could become one of the most significant accomplishments of the summit meeting. Page A9.].
 
New Political Landscape
 Mr. Clinton wasted no time making it clear, in several symbolic actions, that he was preparing to deal with a political landscape that was changing for the first time since the 1950's.
On Tuesday evening he moved directly from a meeting with the faltering Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to a reception that included the opposition leaders who in recent weeks have broken with Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, undercutting its majority in Parliament.
White House officials said the meeting was part of an effort to reach out to a new group of younger Japanese politicians who, whether they succeed in taking power or not after elections on July 18, seem bound to gain influence in America's economic and security relationships with Japan over the next several years.
Mr. Clinton said he took no position in the coming elections, but many of his comments appeared to endorse the efforts of the new parties and rebel politicians to challenge the status quo. Even before he left Washington, he spoke enthusiastically about the the rise of "consumer advocates" and other reformists in Japanese politics, and was quoted by The Washington Post as saying that a new generation of leaders in Japan would be "a big plus for us."
He continued that theme in his speech this morning, comparing the current changes to Japan's Meiji Restoration in the mid-19th century, when feudal lords were overthrown and the country opened to the West for the first time.
He described the American relationship with Japan as "the centerpiece" of America's strategic relations in the Pacific, where 40 percent of United States foreign trade is now conducted. He often complimented the energy and ingenuity of Japanese business, but warned that "it is clear that our markets are more open to your products and investments than your markets are to ours."
 
Change of Direction
 For the United States, which has built its postwar relationship with Japan by supporting the Liberal Democrats, his meeting on Tuesday night with leaders of the opposition -- and some leaders of the governing party itself on all sides of the reform debate here -- seemed part of a subtle effort to redirect American policy, distancing it from the Liberal Democrats.
"We come here with an outstretched hand and hope that all the ferment and change and political debate going on in Japan will be a very positive thing for your people and our relationship," Mr. Clinton told group of 30 or so Japanese leaders -- business executives, journalists and members of the governing party and the opposition -- gathering at the residence of the American Ambassador.
"Many of the things that you are debating, from political reform to economic issues, are being debated in our country and in other industrialized democracies," he said. "I think this period of change should be viewed by all of us with hope."
Several of the elder party leaders listened with obvious discomfort.
A senior Administration official, underscoring the impression that Mr. Clinton wanted to reach out to the new Japanese leadership in the governing and opposition camps, said, "We had to make it very clear that the President understood there was a power transition under way here, and is ready to work with it."
Mr. Clinton's comments came as American and Japanese negotiators worked to come up with a draft "framework" agreement -- the guiding document for how to conduct the next several years of trade negotiations -- by the end of the Group of Seven summit meeting.
At a news conference on Tuesday after his meeting with Mr. Miyazawa, whom few expect to be in office after the elections, Mr. Clinton declared that "there are still issues which divide us." But he said that Mr. Miyazawa had sent him "a very thoughtful letter which reached out across the gap between our two positions."
At issue was a fundamental difference of approach. The United States has insisted on agreements keyed to numerical targets that would produce "measurable results" -- such as increases in American market share or in the number of American-produced parts designed into a Japanese product. Japan has refused to enter any accord that could provide for unilateral action against Japan if the effort fails.
 
Coining a Bureaucratic Phrase
 In recent days Mr. Miyazawa has said that Japan would agree to what Japanese officials are calling, in a turn of bureaucratic phraseology, "non-obligatory reference indicators." The indicators appear to be vague economic measures that would not be held as binding agreements.
"It is fair to assume that the Japanese have moved in our direction," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Tuesday night, but he declined to say what concessions the United States was offering.
While the trade negotations went on, the Japanese public was instead transfixed by images of Mr. Clinton warmly greeting the opposition leaders who bolted from the governing Liberal Democratic Party last month, passing a resolution of no confidence that brought down their own Government and threw the country into political turmoil.
Mr. Clinton spoke with Tsutomu Hata, a former Finance Minister who led more than 30 members of Parliament out of the governing party, and Morihiro Hosokawa, founder of the Japan New Party. Both men are considered contenders for Mr. Miyazawa's job.
While Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, worked the room, leaders from the other Group of Seven nations were arriving here in a blitz of black motorcades. John Major of Britain, Helmut Kohl of Germany, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi of Italy and Kim Campbell of Canada all arrived for a meeting that many predict will produce few agreements of substance, chiefly because so many of the participants are politically weak at home.
But there is much on the agenda, from the Clinton Administration's efforts to get countries to agree to a target of 3 percent G.N.P. growth, to half-hearted calls for action in Bosnia and a move to halt to the spread of nuclear weapons. Mr. Clinton is also scheduled to see President Suharto of Indonesia, the leader of the nonaligned nations, in what Mr. Christopher called "more evidence of our commitment to Asia."
 
A Different Tone
 Mr. Clinton's tone upon landing here on Tuesday was clearly different from his last encounter with Mr. Miyazawa, in April in Washington. Then, to the distress of the Japanese, Mr. Clinton talked almost entirely about easing economic tensions, saying that had to come ahead of all else. But this time he sounded more like the Japanese themselves, speaking on several occasions about the need to maintain the security and political aspects of the relationship, and to keep economic tensions in perspective.
But for Mr. Clinton, the key issue may be whether he can keep up the pressure to achieve a broad framework agreement on trade in coming days. When the two leaders met for the first time in April, they vowed to have a framework together by the time of Tuesday's meeting, paving the way for them to begin to negotiate about specific sectors of each other's economy. But that was before Japan's political turmoil.
The sticking point has been the American insistence on "measurable results." Until recently, Mr. Miyazawa and the Japanese bureaucracy refused to even talk about any kind of "targets," saying they were an interference in free markets and an invitation to retaliation by the United States if the goal was not met.
 
An Exchange of Letters
 But after weeks of deadlock, and with the summit meeting and election approaching, Mr. Miyazawa wrote the letter to which Mr. Clinton referred in his news conference. Mr. Clinton responded in a letter delivered just hours before he landed.
Mr. Clinton was asked repeatedly whether it made sense to negotiate with a Government that seemed certain to be forced out in coming weeks.
"Conventional wisdom would have it that it would not be possible at such a political moment," Mr. Clinton said, sitting at Mr. Miyazawa's side. "But the Prime Minister has defied convential wisdom."
But he added, "That does not mean that we will get an agreement."
Japanese and American officials say they are discussing compromise language that would allow the United States to declare itself satisfied that Japan is making a commitment to "measurable results."
Officials traveling with Mr. Clinton said they would rather leave Tokyo this week with no agreement than with one that gave up too much. But it is not yet clear who, the Americans or the Japanese, would have more at stake if the negotations fail. Mr. Clinton would have to face Congress, where there are calls to immediately limit Japan's $50 billion trade surplus with the United States. But Mr. Miyazawa is in a classic bind, needing to show Japanese voters that he is tending to the relationship with America while avoiding surrendering to their demands.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Egypt Ties Are Strained In Detention of Islamic Cleric

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, July 6

 BODY:
Relations between the United States and Egypt, once the linchpin of American policy in the Arab world, have sharply deteriorated over a number of disputes that culminated with the detention of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, whom Egyptian officials condemn as a "creation" of Washington.
Three years ago, President Hosni Mubarak played the crucial role in assembling George Bush's coalition to fight Iraq in the Persian Gulf war by serving as host for an Arab summit meeting here that cracked the myth of Arab solidarity. 
 Now senior Egyptian officials, including President Mubarak, contend that the American Government repeatedly ignored their warnings about the danger posed by Mr. Abdel Rahman, whose followers in the United States include suspects in the bombing of the World Trade Center and in a plot to set off bombs in Manhattan.
 
Afghan War Effort by U.S.
 What is more, the officials say, the United States, especially at the height of the war in Afghanistan, courted the militant cleric as part of the struggle to woo Islamic fundamentalists in the fight against Soviet troops.
Egyptian officials are angry that Washington has shifted responsibility of any prosecution of the sheik to Cairo, because the American authorities detained him on immigration charges instead of charging him with a crime.
"Once the cleric became too much of a liability," an Egyptian official said, "rather than arrest him they decided to let him leave the United States a free man unless, they told us, we agreed to make an extradition request. This is another example of American ineptitude."
State Department officials said that under American law, Mr. Abdel Rahman, who is appealing an expulsion order, could leave and seek refuge in a third country that would support his militant goals, including the overthrow of the Egyptian Government.
The only way to counter such a departure, American officials said, was a formal extradition request by the Egyptian Government, which was delivered to the United States Ambassador, Robert H. Pelletreau, by Foreign Minister Amr Mousa on Sunday.
The anger expressed by Egyptian officials over American actions regarding the sheik represents a growing alienation between the two allies, especially as the Clinton Administration places greater emphasis on human rights issues and the establishment of democratic governments.
 
Cultural Differences Cited
 "The Americans, as they do in the whole world, come here and want us to be like them," one official said. "They understand nothing of our values or our culture, and the result is chaos."
Ambassador Pelletreau has expressed increasing displeasure with the human rights record of Egypt and has accused the Government of being slow to liberalize its largely state-run economy. Mr. Pelletreau has also personally confronted President Mubarak about what is seen as endemic corruption within the Government, a participant at the meeting said.
Earlier this year, Egyptian officials say, they were outraged after discovering that two employees from the United States Embassy had been meeting with prominent members of the Islamic Group, who consider Mr. Abdel Rahman as their spiritual leader.
A sense of abandonment by Washington has been made worse in recent weeks by some American Congressional leaders who have said the United States should begin cutting back its $2.3 billion in annual aid to Egypt.
 
The Power of Perceptions
 "Perceptions affect politics more than facts," said Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a columnist, "and the perception is that the Americans are indebted to the sheik for his support during the war against the Russians in Afghanistan."
The Egyptian authorities appear to fear that the United States, not wanting to repeat the mistakes it made in Iran, might be willing to have a relationship with a fundamentalist government here, rather than risk losing a cornerstone in the Middle East.
The Egyptian Government, struggling to fend off mounting violence by Islamic militants, could have exploited the detention of Mr. Abdel Rahman, and the arrest of at least 12 of his followers in New York, by carrying its campaign against Islamic fundamentalism to the outside world.
The Islamic Group has carried out bombings and assassinations in Egypt against Government officials, police officers, intellectuals, Coptic Christians and foreign tourists. The country's tourism industry, which once brought in $2.2 billion a year, has been virtually shut down. In the last 18 months 180 people have died in militant-related violence.
But what was an opportunity to build links between those under attack in New York, and those under attack in Egypt, appears to have been squandered. The high profile that the Clinton Administration and the American press have given to the sheik and to the arrest of his followers is seen by many Egyptian officials as an effort to enhance the stature of Egypt's Islamic militant movement.
"The mass media has turned out to be a propaganda tool for the terrorists, especially when through ignorance, the terrorist crimes are overestimated, and the terrorists capabilities magnified," Al Ahram, a Government daily, said a recent editorial.
Two Egyptian newspapers quoted President Mubarak last month as saying Mr. Abdel Rahman had obtained a visa in return for services to American intelligence. One paper apologized and said it had misquoted Mr. Mubarak. But officials continue to repeat the assertion, despite American denials.
The United States, Egyptian officials say, knowingly gave Mr. Abdel Rahman a multiple-entry visa in 1990 even though he was on a list of foreigners considered undesirable. State Department officials have referred to "an error" in issuing the visa in Khartoum, the capital of the Sudan.
"The Egyptians," a Western diplomat said, "seem incapable of imagining that a superpower ever makes a mistake."
 
Green Card Is Revoked in 1992
 American officials also say the Immigration and Naturalization Service mistakenly granted a green card, or a residency permit, to Mr. Abdel Rahman as a religious worker.
In March 1992, the green card was revoked by the immigration service because, officials said, the sheik had concealed that he was a polygamist and had been convicted in Egypt of falsifying a check. A judge ordered him deported in March, but Mr. Abdel Rahman remained free, until his detention on Friday, pending an appeal.
But these actions, including a decision by immigration authorities to let him enter and leave the United States three times after arriving in July 1990, are seen by Egyptian officials as evidence of the relationship between the Americans and the militants.
So the detention of Mr. Abdel Rahman and the arrest of this followers have divided Washington and Cairo instead of uniting the two Governments in a battle against terrorism.
"The Americans and the Egyptians need each other," said Mr. Sid Ahmed, the columnist, "but there is so much distrust and suspicion that it now affects every issue between them."

HEADLINE: Doctors Weigh the Costs Of a Chicken Pox Vaccine

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Ever since vaccines have consigned measles, mumps, rubella and polio to the history books, chicken pox has been the only major childhood illness that parents weather with their children.
Now, a chicken pox vaccine that has proved both safe and 97 percent effective in trials in children may be about to enter the United States market. But as eager parents await news of its release, doctors and Federal officials are hesitating about whether to use it. 
 Scientists have worried that the immunity granted by the new vaccine may wane over time, so that those who avoid chicken pox in childhood might get it as adults, when it is a more serious disease. They have also raised the theoretical concern that the vaccine, which consists of a live weakened strain of the chicken pox virus, might itself cause symptoms.
But at heart they are all struggling with a subtler question: Is chicken pox a bad enough disease that all children should avoid it?
"The major controversy is whether the medical consequences of chicken pox are serious enough to warrant a major vaccination effort, whether chicken pox is worth preventing," said Dr. Walter Orenstein, director of the national immunization program ofthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who will probably have to make that decision for the country within a year.
The new vaccine, which is made by Merck & Company, is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration. If the agency deems it "safe and effective," it will be approved for marketing, and doctors will then turn to the Centers for Disease Control for guidelines on its use.
 
2 Sides of Debate
 Parents who have lost nights of sleep and days of work dabbing calamine lotion on that notorious "dew-drop on a rose petal" rash, as it is described to medical students, know how they would answer. Chicken pox affects 90 to 95 percent of Americans by the end of adolescence, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and another 2.5 percent over the age of 20. More than 60 percent of the cases occur in children aged 5 to 9.
But from a medical perspective, chicken pox is more a monumental nuisance than a danger. Unlike measles, which is often followed by pneumonia, or polio, which can result in permanent paralysis, chicken pox in children is usually a benign short-lived illness with virtually no long-term consequences, which grants lifetime immunity. A vast majority of the economic cost of the disease is attributable to lost pay of parents who become housebound with children who are not allowed to go back to school or day care until their pockmarks have disappeared.
Some scientists say that it is nonetheless time to approve a chicken pox vaccine.
"To me there are enough complications and parents lose so much time from work taking care of kids with chicken pox that it is worth vaccinating," said Dr. Anne A. Gershon, head of pediatric infectious disease at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. She added that chicken pox can be devastating, even fatal, in children with poor immune systems, like those with cancer or those taking steroids for asthma.
 
Ruling Is Awaited
 But others balk at the idea of giving the shot to every child.
"Do you want to give a vaccine -- with unknown side effects -- to prevent a very mild disease?" asked Dr. Philip Brunnell, head of pediatric infectious disease at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. "I think it's a difficult question and I'm glad I don't have to make the decision." He and others emphasize that to justify vaccinating everyone against a disease that for most is more inconvenient than harmful, the shot itself must be unquestionably safe.
The vaccine was discovered in Japan more than a decade ago and is now used to immunize all children in that country. It has been close to release in this country several times, but each time it has run into obstacles: a manufacturing glitch, now corrected, that resulted in a vaccine that produced a chicken-pox-like rash, and persistent demands from cautious public health officials for more and more data on the rate of side effects and how long the immunity might last.
"I've given up trying to predict when it will come out," Dr. Orenstein said. "In 1982 I said it was likely to come out soon. Now I'd say within the next year."
The extraordinary hesitation regarding the vaccine is partly a result of evidence that it is effective only for a limited time. A widespread vaccination program could cause a reduction in the number of cases of chicken pox in children, but an increase later in adults.
Although the total number of cases would be far lower, the number of deaths and hospitalizations might well rise. That is because chicken pox is a far more serious disease in adults, lasting many weeks and frequently accompanied by complications like pneumonia and, sometimes, inflammation of the brain.
 
Dormant Herpes a Concern
 
 
Some doctors have also expressed concern that the active ingredient of the chicken pox vaccine is a live, though weakened, varicella zoster virus. This virus belongs to the herpes virus family, a group of viruses notorious for their ability to outwit the human immune system and persist in the body for life.
These viruses often lie dormant in the nerves or lymphatic system, but occasionally re-emerge, producing disease flare-ups. Reactivation of herpes simplex virus produces recurrent oral or genital herpes. Reactivation of the latent varicella virus in people who have had chicken pox produces a painful blistering rash called shingles or herpes zoster; shingles most often occurs in the elderly or in people whose immune systems are weakened, generally many decades after chicken pox has disappeared.
 
Dangers of Miscalculation
 Could doctors in good conscience inject patients with a virus that would infect them forever? Would this mutant strain of the chicken pox virus be more likely to result in shingles many years later? A miscalculation would be unfortunate, since shingles is far more painful and heals far less well than chicken pox in children.
New research has alleviated some of the worries: Studies in children successfully treated for leukemia, who are prone to shingles, have suggested that the vaccine virus is less likely to produce shingles than the true chicken pox germ. But the answers to other questions, like how long protection will last, are not likely to be forthcoming.
"Some things can't be answered in a trial," Dr. Brunnell said. "You're just going to have to license the vaccine and see what happens. All the information you're ever going to have you have in hand."
Research in Japan has shown that children who are vaccinated retain immunity for at least 10 years. But it has also shown that while 97 percent of children develop protection from chicken pox after one immunization, only 75 percent of adolescents are similarly protected. Many experts say that adolescents and adults will probably need two shots.
The Centers for Disease Control recently commissioned a cost-effectiveness study to try to weigh these many variables. The results, which were presented last month, showed that for every dollar spent on chicken pox vaccine, society could expect to reap only 94 cents in medical benefits.
But the analysis changed strikingly if the indirect costs of chicken pox, like a parent's lost wages, were figured in. With such indirect costs included, the study found that society got $5.50 in benefits for every $1 spent on vaccine.
The benefit cost ratio for the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is $3 for each dollar spent when only direct medical costs are included, and $14.40 per dollar spent when indirect costs are added in, according to Dr. Sandra Holmes, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control. The ratio for the hemophilus B vaccine is $2.40 for every dollar spent for direct medical costs and $2.80 with indirect costs added.
For research purposes, the centers assumed that the vaccine would cost $35 for a single dose, although no one is sure how Merck would price it, and many vaccines have cost more than predicted when they actually reached the market.
 
Easier Way to Cut Costs
 Some experts, like Dr. Brunnell, have suggested that there is an easier way than vaccinating to reduce the cost of chicken pox to society: by simply reducing the number of days children are kept home when they have the disease. Many schools do not allow children to return until the last of their lesions has crusted over, in the mistaken belief that the child is contagious up to that point. But the disease is most contagious before the rash appears. Most children feel well enough to return to class far earlier, Dr. Brunnell said.
"If the parent's lost work is the problem, then maybe we should send children back to school sooner," he said.
Anticipating that the drug agency may well approve the vaccine this time around, the Centers for Disease Control recently asked its vaccine advisory panel to determine how it should be used.
"From what I know right now, if it were my kid, I think I'd rather he get the vaccine than chicken pox," Dr. Orenstein said. "My 10-year-old had a very mild case, and I thought, what's the big deal? But when my 5-year-old got it, the child was very uncomfortable and we were up for several nights. It's that kind of problem that the vaccine would eliminate rather than serious disease."

HEADLINE: ACCORD IS REACHED AT TRADE PARLEY

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, July 7

 BODY:
Trade ministers for the leading industrial nations said today that they have reached a crucial tariff reduction agreement that they said will likely lead to a revival of stalled global trade talks.
"We have concluded our deliberations successfully," Kabun Muto, Japan's Foreign Minister, said upon emerging from a meeting of trade officials of the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Community. "We believe it will result in substantial progress." 
 Details to were not immediately available, so it still remains to be seen just how far-reaching their agreement is. One of the major questions, for instance, is whether the United States agreed to reduce protection for the American textile and clothing industries sufficiently to satisfy the European Community.
But if the talks were indeed a "breakthrough," as some officials suggested, it could become one of the most significant accomplishments of the Group of Seven summit of industrial nations, which begins today. It would also be a surprising outcome, given how far apart the parties were just a day ago.
An agreement by the major trading companies to eliminate or reduce tariffs on hundreds of items is expected to serve as the basis for the resumption of worldwide trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Failure Could End GATT
 But failure to reach an agreement here, or the attainment of only a limited accord, could sound the death knell for GATT's seven-year-old Uruguay round, which aims to extend free trade rules to agriculture, textiles and services.
"Tokyo is the acid test," Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of GATT, said last week.
Asked today whether the new agreement would be significant enough to jump start the Uruguay round, one American official said, "I don't think there is any question it will."
Before the meeting of the trade ministers began last night, the four governments were so far apart that it seemed that any agreement would be somewhat limited. "There's some movement by everybody but, unless a miracle occurs, not enough to get a detailed agreement," said one participant, who insisted on remaining unidentified.
 
Quit at 3 A.M., Resume at 10
 But the trade representatives met until 3 a.m., far later than expected, and apparently made progress in narrowing the differences. "It's not yet completely agreed, but we can see the prospect of something coming up that 24 hours ago looked unlikely," one European official said early this morning. The trade ministers then met again from 10 a.m. to 12:30 to hammer out the final details.
With much of the developed world in recession, scholars and government officials are beginning to question whether GATT, or the principles of free trade in general, have outlived their usefulness.
The leaders of France in particular have said that developed nations need to be protected from competition with lesser developed nations that pay low wages and pollute the environment. Angry at the United States over duties it is placing on foreign steel imports, French leaders have openly said that no market access agreement should be reached in Tokyo.
This French position has hampered the ability of the European Community to make concessions in the market access talks, according to one American official.
At each of the last three summit meetings, the Group of Seven has resolved to complete the Uruguay round by the end of the year, always to no avail.
This time, there is a recognition that action, not merely words, are necessary. Officials have been saying for months that only a far-reaching agreement by the major powers to cut tariffs would coax the remaining 100 or so members of GATT back to the negotiating table by December to try to conclude the Uruguay round, named after the location of the first talks in 1986.
 
Setback in Tokyo Meeting
 But hopes for such a broad accord seemed all but dashed two weeks ago after the trade ministers had a particularly rancorous meeting in Tokyo. The Europeans said the United States was not going far enough to reduce tariffs on textiles and clothing. The United States complained about Europe's high tariffs on semiconductors and about its limits on the broadcasting of foreign television programs, ostensibly to preserve Europe's cultural independence.
It was after that stormy meeting that the ministers decided to schedule last night's emergency session in a last-ditch attempt to get an agreement before the summit.
Going into last night's meeting, the four governments were still apart on many areas, officials said. The United States had not amended its offer on textile tariff cuts and Europe had not made major new concessions on electronics tariffs and television programs, this official said. Japan, meanwhile, was not offering to cut trade restrictions on wood products and distilled spirits enough to satisfy its trading partners.
However, agreements had basically been reached among the nations to eliminate tariffs on pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, construction equipment and beer.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO;
Excerpts From Clinton Talk in Tokyo

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, July 7

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's speech by President Clinton before the opening of the summit meeting of the leaders of the world's major industrial democracies.
Our first international economic priority must be to create a new and stronger partnership between the United States and Japan. Our relationship with Japan is the centerpiece of our policy toward the Pacific community. 
 Our two nations account for nearly 40 percent of the world's output. Neither of us could thrive without the other. Producers in each of our countries are consumers for firms in the other.
 
Solving Global Problems
 We are also joined in our efforts to address global economic problems. We have worked closely in an effort to move toward a new trade agreement.
And I hope Japan will join in the initiative I proposed just two days ago in San Francisco -- a meeting of the senior G-7 economics and labor and education advisers to look into a new problem with the global economy: stubbornly persistent unemployment in the richest nations of the world, even where there is economic growth, rooted in the inability of so many of these nations to create new jobs.
The economic relationship we have has always benefited both our nations. Americans buy huge volumes of Japanese products. American companies in Japan employ thousands of your citizens.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In the 1980's, when my country went on a huge debt binge, massively increasing public and private debt, Japanese purchases of much of that debt helped to keep our economy going and helped to prevent our interest rates from exploding. Still, our economic relationship is not in balance.
Unlike our relations with all other wealthy nations, we have a huge and persistent trade deficit with Japan. It usually exceeds $40 billion, with the deficit in manufacturing products in excess of $60 billion, in spite of the fact that in recent years our manufacturing productivity has increased very greatly.
It is impossible to attribute this trade imbalance solely to unfair Japanese barriers from governmental policies, to a unique distribution center system. Indeed, it is in part simply a tribute to Japanese abilities to produce high-quality, competitively priced goods, and to the skill of Japanese businesses in piercing so many overseas markets -- including our own.
 
Markets Are More Open
 Yet, it is clear that our markets are more open to your products and your investments than yours are to ours. And it is clear that governmental policies consistently promoting production over consumption, exports over domestic sales, and protections of the home market, contribute to this problem.
The trade deficit is on the rise this year, even with the market rise of the yen against the dollar. Though American purchases of Japanese products have remained fairly constant, Japanese purchases of American products have dropped markedly as a consequence of slow growth here in your economy with no offsetting government policies to stimulate demand.
This problem has, as all of you know, fueled resentment in our country, both from workers and from businesses who have worked hard to streamline their operations, reduce labor costs and increase productivity and now want the benefits that can only come from being able to compete and win in a global economy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Harm to Japanese People
 This persistent trade imbalance does not just hurt American workers and businesses, it has hurt the Japanese people. It has deprived you, as consumers, of the full benefit of your hard and productive work.
For example, partly because of restrictive economic policies, the average Japanese family pays more than twice as much of your income for food as the average American family. And many other consumer products are far, far more expensive here than elsewhere, with these differentials going far beyond what can be accounted for by the transportation costs of bringing products to this market.
Our relationships with Japan have been durable, not only because of our security alliance and our political partnership, but because our economic relationship has actually served our interests and yours. I believe we must change this economic interest to improve the lives not just of the American people, but of the Japanese people as well.
It would be wrong for me to come here as President to ask you to embrace changes that would only benefit the people who live in my country. I believe that the changes I advocate will benefit both of us, or I would not be here pushing them.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Principles for Trade
 Our governments have made progress in these last few days in crafting the basic principles of this new framework. And we will persist until we can produce a sound agreement that is in the interests of people in both countries.
What the United States seeks -- let me make clear -- is not managed trade, or so-called trade by the numbers, but better results from better rules of trade.
Openness like this cannot simply come from pressure from the United States. That is one reason I wanted so much to be here with you today. A new openness can only come, ultimately, when Japanese leaders and Japanese citizens recognize that it is in your interests to pursue this course.
So, today I would send this message to all of you and to the people beyond the walls here in this hall; you have a common cause with the people of America, a common cause against outdated practices that undermine our relationship and diminish the quality of your lives.
The ideas I propose are beneficial to both of us because they will increase the number and lower the cost of the products you are able to buy, the services you are able to access, and they will thereby reward the work, the education, and the skills that you bring to daily life here in Japan. You are entitled to no less.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We should take these steps together for ourselves and for future generations. I am optimistic that the people of Japan and the people of the United States can hear the same message and move toward the same goal.

HEADLINE: Rising Yen Might Widen This Gap

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration sees the recent strengthening of the Japanese yen against the dollar as one means of reducing Japan's monumental trade surpluses. But as the leaders of the seven leading industrial nations gather here this week, some American business executives and trade experts are warning that a strong-yen policy could backfire.
Yes, they say, a strong yen will make American goods less expensive relative to Japanese products and thus more competitive. But the strong yen -- the dollar has fallen more than 13 percent against the Japanese currency since the beginning of the year to a current level of 108.83 yen -- is also making it prohibitively expensive for some foreign businesses to build their own factories, distribution networks and marketing operations in Japan.
 
Conflicting Currents
 And such direct investment into Japan, American trade experts say, is critical to achieving sustained success in this notoriously difficult market. 
 But because of the strong yen, it now takes more dollars to buy companies, rent offices, hire employees, advertise or build plants in Japan.
"You've got to control your own destiny in this market if you want to really penetrate it," said Thomas A. Lynch, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, the international consulting and accounting firm. "That's why direct investment really matters."
The logic behind this emphasis on investment, rather than simply on placing more foreign-made goods in Japanese stores, is simple: exports follow investment. Trade experts say they have found a striking correlation between investment and exports.
"Overwhelmingly, U.S. exports of manufactured goods go to countries where there is substantial U.S. direct investment presence," Edward Graham, a trade expert at the Institute for International Economics, wrote in a paper presented at a Yale seminar.
The issue covers direct spending on business operations, like acquisitions, plant construction and investments in other operations. Such spending is distinguished from portfolio investments, like buying of securities or other such financial transactions.
Japan is expected to post a record $160 billion trade surplus this year, about $50 billion of which will be with the United States. But there is an imbalance in Japan's relations with the world that is even more lopsided than the trade imbalance: Japanese companies are among the largest foreign investors in the world, but Japan gets less business investment from foreign companies than any other industrialized country.
Direct investment from the United States in Japan, America's second-largest trading partner after Canada, is less than American business investment in Brazil.
In the last 10 years, for example, Japan made $325 billion in business investments abroad, a little more than 40 percent of which went to the United States. But foreign companies, facing stratospheric costs and informal barriers, if not outright hostility, have been able to invest a relatively minuscule $22 billion into business operations in Japan in the same period. American companies supplied about 40 percent of that sum.
At one time, the Japanese Government rejected assertions that it had stifled investment, but the evidence is so overwhelming now that it has begun several programs to entice foreign investment. Government-controlled institutions are offering low-cost loans and extensive information to help foreign companies.
"We are very aware of this imbalance, and we are very keen to improve the situation," said Makoto Nomura, a director in the industrial policy bureau at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Foreign business executives here say that the measures do not come close to breaking down the long list of barriers they confront, but they say the steps do help and may, over time, help change the hostile attitudes.
In America, for instance, Honda both makes cars and sells them to dealers through its own American marketing and distribution subsidiary. But General Motors has no production operations here and sells autos through Japanese importers.
 
A Shift of Emphasis
 The huge imbalance between outgoing and incoming investment has prompted some experts to focus on opening Japan to investment as a more promising approach to reducing Japan's huge surpluses than the traditional focus on getting Japan to buy more American goods.
That is why the yen's surge is seen as a double-edged sword. A strong yen does make Japanese goods more costly for Americans, pinching Japanese exports, while making American exports to Japan less expensive and thus more attractive. That is the macroeconomic impact.
But on the microeconomic level, where business executives make their daily decisions, the strong yen creates yet another hurdle for those struggling to penetrate Japanese markets. Some American Government economists argue that when costs in Japan rise in dollar terms, the yields on investments rise as well, making the investments attractive. Executives reply, though, that as the hurdle to entry rises they are discouraged from accepting the risks.
In the debate over how to nudge Japan to lower its trade surplus, the old approach of focusing largely on the movement of goods ignores the fact, experts argue, that most international trade takes place not just between countries but between multinational companies and their overseas subsidiaries. The freer these companies are to establish overseas units to produce, market and distribute their goods, the argument goes, the greater the volume of trade.
 
Trade Within Companies
 In his book "Rivals Beyond Trade," published by Cornell University Press, Dennis J. Encarnation of the Harvard Business School writes that the overseas sales of American multinational companies through overseas units are nearly three times the level of total American exports because overseas units buy and sell goods with third countries as well.
The underlying point is that these investments, not just low tariffs and open markets, are the engine for sales in foreign markets.
Even in Japan, experience has shown that trade does expand with investment. A recent study by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry found that affiliates of foreign concerns in Japan account for less than 5 percent of Japan's exports but about 17 percent of its imports.
As a result, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1992, these affiliates imported $3.5 billion more goods into Japan than they exported. In other words, they did precisely what American trade negotiators have been trying to achieve, they whittled down Japan's huge surplus.
Japanese companies, from Toyota to Sony, have followed this strategy with notable success in America -- investing huge sums so that they operate through companies they control. The Sumitomo Corporation, for instance, sells about 80 to 90 percent of the goods it exports -- from steel plates to computerized industrial machinery -- to its own overseas subsidiaries, said Hiroo Kinoshita, an executive managing director.
 
Contrast With Europe
 This is the approach American multinational companies have used to build a significant presence in Europe, where the United States has a trade surplus. The only major market where the approach has proved nearly impossible is Japan.
In contrast to Japan, the United States gets business investment from abroad in almost equal proportions to the amount that American companies invest overseas.
The investment issue has been raised before by American negotiators, but the Clinton Administration has promised a greater focus on it.
Corporate Japan agrees that steps should be taken to encourage direct investment. "Japan has considerably more regulations on business than most other countries, and this undoubtedly obstructs the entry of new companies, both domestic and foreign, into the market," Keidanren, a group representing Japan's largest corporations, said in a study last year. "We take the view that in certain areas such as corporate finance, taxation, etc., foreign firms must be accorded preferential treatment."
The report also concedes that the keiretsu, groupings of companies bound together through cross-shareholdings, can obstruct incoming investment and that unwritten guidance from Government officials and other informal regulation discriminate against foreign companies.
Even when foreign companies do make a sincere effort to break into Japan by looking for an acquisition, the results have been poor.
"The opportunities we see are often ones Japanese companies aren't interested in," said Mr. Lynch of KPMG Peat Marwick. "I've never seen anything approximating an open auction for a company in Japan."
What is particularly frustrating for some is that the collapse of Japanese stock prices in the last three years and the decline in property prices was expected to help change that. Acquisitions were expected to be easier and more common -- at least until the dollar weakened against the yen. The figures on acquisitions, however, remain paltry and appear likely to decline this year from the modest total of $614.4 million last year, according to Ulmer Brothers, a New York investment bank.
"We thought a window was opening up," said Yoshinori Yokoyama, a partner in charge of the Japan office of McKinsey & Company, the big consulting company. "We tried to convince our partners in our other offices around the world to raise the opportunities with their clients on investing in Japan. But companies are quite cautious still. The costs are a problem that have just gotten worse."

HEADLINE: Costly School Overhaul for Massachusetts

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 6

 BODY:
All three branches of government are in rare agreement about the state of public education in Massachusetts: inadequate. But there is no unanimity on where to find the money to fix it.
Last month the state's highest court became the 12th in the nation to order lawmakers to devise a plan to close the financial gap between the wealthiest and poorest school systems. In the same week, Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican, signed a $1.3 billion measure adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature to raise spending in the poorer districts to $5,550 per student by the year 2000. 
 "The reform act moves in the direction the court has pointed us," said Robert Blumenthal, a counsel at the Massachusetts Department of Education. "They dovetail: the opinion calls for greater equity and the reform act aims at greater equity."
Some wealthy communities spend nearly three times what poorer communities do on each public school child. Lincoln, a wealthy suburb of Boston, spent $9,567 per pupil in the 1990-1991 school year; Douglas, a working-class community on the Connecticut border, spent $3,251.
But with state and local governments squeezed by recession and by widespread sentiment against higher taxes, it is not at all clear where they will find the money to close this gap. The measure just signed by Mr. Weld commits a relatively modest amount of state money, $175 million, for the fiscal year that began July 1.
The Supreme Judicial Court's decision did not specify a fund-raising mechanism. It did join a handful of other state courts around the nation in ruling that the State Constitution required that the public schools provide all children with seven specific skills -- from arts appreciation to solid writing and oral communication skills.
All state constitutions have education clauses that describe state responsibility for public education. The Massachusetts Constitution has had the same language since 1780: "It shall be the duty of legislatures and magistrates [and] the executive branch, in all future periods of this commonwealth, to cherish . . . the public schools and grammar schools in the towns."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Speculation on Fed Action Pushes the Dollar Upward

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday on expectations that United States inflation is picking up, a situation that could prompt a move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, is concluding a two-day meeting in Washington today. Rumors arose that the Fed might tighten credit quickly to stamp out inflation, despite recent weak economic data. 
 Currency dealers said this year's rally in gold prices had heightened inflationary fears. And adding to concerns about inflation was another sharp gain in the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodity prices.
"The fact that we are seeing broad participation in this advance from most commodity arenas confirms that inflation has returned," said David Lundgren, president of Lundgren Financial Services.
Dealers said evidence suggesting German inflation might be easing led to speculation that the German central bank could cut rates again soon. "Dealers are now focusing on the next Bundesbank easing, which most expect to happen before the bank's summer break in August," said Chuck Spence of Standard Chartered Bank in Los Angeles.
In London, the dollar closed at 1.7000 marks, up from 1.6980 marks Monday. The dollar closed at 1.7040 marks in New York, up from 1.6978 at Friday's close. The United States markets were closed Monday for the Fourth of July holiday.
The dollar finished at 108.83 yen in New York, up from 108.55 yen Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar finished at 109.08 yen, up slightly from 109.05 yen Monday.
The British pound settled at $1.5040 in New York, down from $1.5095 Friday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.5063, from $1.5110 Monday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.5130 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120; 5.7630 French francs, up from 5.7383.

HEADLINE: Drug Industry Musters a Coalition To Oppose a Change in Medicaid

SERIES: Special Pleaders -- A periodic look at lobbying.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
It looked like a consumer organization, and it seemed to spring up spontaneously to fight a provision of the pending budget bill that it said would condemn poor people to inferior medical care.
The group, calling itself the Coalition for Equal Access to Medicines, is an unusual union of poor people, minority members and public health advocates, but it did not come together effortlessly. It was created and financed by another interest group, one with perhaps the biggest stake in the outcome: the prescription drug industry. 
 Members of Congress who follow drug issues said they were unaware of the industry's involvement in the coalition, which describes itself as "an ad hoc volunteer organization."
 
Its Reason for Being
 Public statements of the coalition, like its letters to Congress and the White House, give no clue to its origins. But its purpose is clear: to defeat a measure the Federal Government believes would help control Medicaid spending on prescription drugs.
The drug executive who inspired the coalition acknowledged in an interview that one reason the group was formed was the industry's belief that consumer advocates and minority members had far more credibility on Capitol Hill than drug companies.
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have accused the drug industry of charging excessive prices, and they warn that it will have to make financial sacrifices under the health plan the White House expects to propose this fall.
 
'An Obvious Self-Interest'
 The drug executive, Richard D. Stone, vice president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the main trade group for prescription drug companies, said, "We don't want this to be looked at as a drug-industry issue alone because we have an obvious self-interest."
He said his association had organized the coalition with the help of a Washington lobbying firm, Apco Associates. "We hired Apco Associates in May to help us generally with public relations and coalition-building," he said. "We told them to service this coalition, to staff it and to help them."
The "organizing committee" of the coalition includes officials from the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Lupus Foundation of America, the National Urban League, the National Council on the Aging, a Hispanic doctors' group in California and the Rev. Jesse Jackson's group, the National Rainbow Coalition.
Coalition members say they do not think they have been exploited. They say the cause is a good one: to insure that low-income people in the Medicaid program are not denied access to medicine crucial to their health.
 
Aimed at Approved Drugs
 The group's aim is to kill provisions of the deficit-reduction bill that would encourage states to establish lists of approved Medicaid drugs. If a drug was not on the list, called a formulary, Medicaid would generally not pay for it.
Medicaid, a joint Federal-state program, spends more than $6.7 billion a year on drugs prescribed for people outside hospitals. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that formularies would save the Federal Government at least $275 million over five years. States expect to save almost as much.
Mr. Stone calls the numbers "phony baloney."
The President proposed such formularies as part of his budget request to Congress in February. Formularies have been used by hospitals for more than a century. In theory, experts select the best, most effective drugs and exclude those that offer no significant therapeutic advantage.
Drug companies typically offer big discounts to get products listed on formularies. Under the Medicaid legislation, states could exclude an expensive brand-name product while covering similar, less costly brand-name drugs or generic versions of the same drug.
 
Inferior Health Care Charged
 Critics like Mr. Stone say formularies condemn poor people to inferior health care and do not save money in the long run because people denied appropriate drugs make greater use of hospitals, nursing homes and other costly services.
Most big hospitals and health maintenance organizations have formularies. But drug manufacturers fiercely oppose Medicaid formularies. They say state officials will select drugs on the basis of cost, not quality, and fear that Medicaid formularies will set a precedent for similar restrictions under any national health insurance plan that Congress might enact.
Referring to the industry's role in opposing formularies, Mr. Stone said: "We feel good about it. We think we are doing the right thing for patients."
Apco employees refused to discuss their work for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. "We don't discuss our relationship with clients or what we do for them," said Dan DuPont, a senior associate of the firm.
But Mary Fraker, an Apco employee, insisted in a letter written on behalf of the coalition that the group was an authentic "grass-roots movement." She maintained that the provisions of the budget bill allowing restrictive formularies "would have a devastating effect on the nation's 30 million Medicaid patients."
 
Overlapping Interests
 Apco Associates was formed in 1984 as a consulting arm of Arnold & Porter, a law firm. It was acquired in 1991 by the GCI Group, the public relations division of Grey Advertising Inc. of New York.
Drug companies and coalition members do seem to have overlapping interests. The drug industry has highlighted the shared interests by supplying the coalition with information and advice, including scientific studies and data to show what it considers to be the dangers of formularies.
The organizing committee of the coalition includes Charles B. Inlander, president of the People's Medical Society, a consumer group with 85,000 members. He said he had learned of the coalition from an employee of the Upjohn Company, the drug manufacturer.
"In the world of health care, politics makes strange bedfellows," Mr. Inlander said. "We don't take money from drug companies, and we have criticized the pharmaceutical industry, but we are not averse to joining anybody in a coalition."
Mr. Inlander said he feared that doctors would be less willing to take Medicaid patients if the doctors' authority to prescribe drugs was restricted by formularies.
 
Different Reactions to Drugs
 In the battle over formularies, drug companies say minority members have particular reason to be concerned. Mr. Stone, the vice president of the drug manufacturers group, said that black, white and Hispanic people respond differently to certain drugs.
For example, he said, antidepressants have greater side effects when prescribed for Hispanic patients than for non-Hispanic white patients. Likewise, drug researchers say blacks are less responsive than whites to beta blocker drugs, prescribed for treatment of high blood pressure.
The coalition has enlisted black clergymen in its campaign. A letter to Mrs. Clinton, signed by seven clergymen, says that if she supports Medicaid formularies she is violating her "moral obligation to protect God's little ones -- the vulnerable young, seniors, women, the disabled and the poor."
Both the House and the Senate have voted to allow Medicaid formularies, so the idea is likely to be included in the deficit-reduction bill that emerges from a conference committee. The committee will begin drafting a compromise bill later this month. The drug industry and the coalition plan to lobby members of the committee.
 
New Drugs Face Delay
 In theory, a formulary includes the most useful and effective drugs in each therapeutic category, including painkillers, antibiotics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, ulcer drugs and asthma drugs. But doctors and drug executives say it may take months or even years to get new drugs added to the list.
The organizing committee of the coalition includes Dr. Daniel Thursz, president of the National Council on the Aging; Nancy Sander, president of the Allergy and Asthma Network, and Dr. Richard O. Butcher, president of the National Medical Association, which represents black doctors.
"We see formularies as a type of rationing," Dr. Thursz said. "It may eventually be part of a universal health plan, but it should not apply just to the lowest economic class in our society."

HEADLINE: Jersey City Lures 3 Tenants To Waterfront Development

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, July 6

 BODY:
In a display of competitiveness that was both economic and political, New Jersey officials said today that they had lured three new tenants and almost 400 jobs from New York City to a sparsely occupied office development on the Hudson River waterfront here.
The announcement continued a pattern of interstate rivalry for jobs that intensified last fall, when the First Chicago Corporation agreed to move 1,000 employees from lower Manhattan to Newport Tower, a 36-story building with a breathtaking view of the World Trade Center towers. 
 Dismissing the notion that New Jersey and New York were engaged in a jobs battle, Gov. Jim Florio, sounding very much the candidate he is, extolled the state's transportation and telecommunications networks and relatively low energy costs as factors that draw businesses.
"These firms didn't come here by accident," he said. "They were very aware of their own bottom line."
 
Investment From State
 Last fall, when First Chicago announced its move here, New York City development officials were angered and disheartened by New Jersey's approach at Newport Towers, which opened in 1989 but was only 37 percent occupied late last year.
At that point, New Jersey invested almost $7 million in the building, in return for a stake of about 8 percent. The money allowed the building's owners to offer tenants a variety of high-technology amenities for computer wiring and other interior office construction at no cost. Occupancy is now up to 43 percent.
Representatives for each of the new tenants -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Solar International Shipping Agency and Legent Corporation -- said yesterday that they felt that they could get more for less by moving to Jersey City and that they had not sought counteroffers from New York City.
Neither Solar nor Legent approached New York City to discuss moving, said Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"We're disappointed that they never approached us with their needs," Ms. Marengo said. "We obviously value every single job. New York is the world capital of commerce, and it's too bad that they're willing to stand by on the sidelines."
She said the city had been aware of the F.D.I.C.'s interest in moving since May 1992, but she said she did not know the extent of any discussions.
 
And Now a Few Words . . .
 In a brief address to a small gathering of development officials at the marina near the office tower, Governor Florio lapsed into what sounded like a stump speech on his record over the last three and a half years. Speaking of the devastating effects the economy has had on the job market in New Jersey, Mr. Florio, a Democrat, blamed the Reagan and Bush Administrations, saying, "You can't bounce back instantly from a recession that is this deep."
Never once mentioning his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, the Governor nonetheless provided a spirited defense of his record and of the state's virtues, of his own come-from-behind qualities and of his administration's "vision" to "divine and define the future."
Citing the most recent jobless rate (6.9 percent last month), the Governor talked of the hard work and tenacity that goes into creating jobs. "That's what the last three years have been about -- tenacity," he said.
Standing with him at the lectern was the newly elected Mayor of Jersey City, Bret Schundler, whose Republican administration is the first since 1917 in this city and the object of affection by senior politicians of both major parties.
The Governor clearly enjoyed using the power of his office to bring "a little gift for the Mayor," who responded with similar praise for New Jersey's competitive stance.
The F.D.I.C. may relocate up to 200 employees from Manhattan. Solar, a ship brokerage, will move its entire staff of 80 from Manhattan to Newport Towers. Legent, a computer software company based in Vienna, Va., will move the 90 members of its development staff here; the 25 members of its sales staff will remain in Manhattan. Legent has 2,100 employees at 75 offices worldwide.
Although the Governor's office announced that the F.D.I.C. would move as many as 300 workers here, Carol Austrian, an agency spokeswoman in Washington, said only 145 people would move from the New York regional headquarters offices on Madison Avenue. She said the agency had authorization to move up to 200.

HEADLINE: Big Three Auto Makers Had 9.9% June Sales Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 6

 BODY:
Sales of the Big Three auto makers rose nearly 10 percent in June as consumers again flocked to domestic models to replace aging cars and light trucks.
General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler kept the industry's spring sales momentum moving in June. According to sales figures released today, the Big Three had a combined sales gain for the month of 9.9 percent, compared with an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent for Japanese auto makers. The figures include cars and trucks the auto makers import for sale in the United States.
 
Domestic Sales in June Up
 Domestic sales in late June were up 6.7 percent, with the Big Three reporting a 7.8 percent increase, compared with a 1.1 percent improvement for Japanese companies that build cars and trucks in the United States. 
 On an annualized basis, cars in late June sold at a 7.7 million rate, their best since late December 1990 and way above mid-June's 6.6 million annualized selling rate. Light trucks sold at an annualized rate of 5.1 million, the same as in mid-June.
Car and light-truck sales have remained strong throughout the spring -- and now into early summer -- despite a decline in consumer confidence and stagnant sales for many general merchandise retailers. Analysts say car owners have taken advantage of lower interest rates to replace millions of cars bought during the mid-1980's.
But car buyers have not been ignoring the economy as they have shopped. Cars advertised as good values are among the most popular.
At the halfway point in the sales year, the best-seller list shows several changes from a year earlier. Most notable is the fall of the Honda Accord. The best-selling car in the United States a year ago, Accord appears poised to fall out of the top 10 among total vehicles and headed for sixth place among passenger cars.
The biggest climber on the list of best sellers was the Chevrolet Cavalier, an 11-year-old subcompact due for a new model in 1995. In contrast with Accord, whose sagging sales were partly attributed to age, Cavalier is succeeding despite an older body style.
Chevrolet is aggressively marketing Cavalier for value. Its under-$8,000 base model includes antilock brakes, which are still an option on many models.
Led by Chevrolet, G.M. is heading into the new model year with a heavy push on value pricing -- offering a set price on a well-equipped model. That can save a buyer hundreds to thousands of dollars over the same car with options purchased separately. It also lowers the factory's cost because it can build more models the same way.
All G.M. car divisions, including Cadillac, will be pushing value pricing this fall, especially in California where G.M.'s market share has suffered over the years from imports.
In June, G.M. car sales were up 1.2 percent and truck sales were up 12.3 percent for an overall gain of 4.9 percent. Its GMC Truck division set a 91-year record with 41,646 sales in the month.
"Not only are we setting month-to-month records, but the entire 1993 model year is shaping up to be a record year for us overall," said Ray Rota, GMC Truck general sales manager.
Ford reported June sales increases of 2.3 percent for cars and 16.8 percent for trucks for a total improvement of 8.8 percent over last June.
Chrysler also continued its stunning sales success compared with 1992. Car sales were up 37.7 percent and trucks were up 20.2 for an overall gain of 26.7 percent. Chrysler topped the one million vehicle sales mark 45 days ahead of last year.
Most of the credit on the passenger car side has gone to Chrysler's new LH midsize sedans, but Chrysler said its top car sellers in June were the older Dodge Shadow, Plymouth Acclaim and Dodge Spirit.

HEADLINE: Pros in the Caddy Shack: Country Club Recession;
An Engineer Learns to Carry Golf Clubs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARAMUS, N.J., July 6

 BODY:
Until Pentagon budget cuts crippled production of Trident submarines, Tom Kingsley worked as a mechanical engineer at the Groton Naval Base in Connecticut, teaching officers how to operate the nuclear reactors that power the subs. Two years ago his employer, General Dynamics, dismissed him.
Now, at age 29, he is caddying under the majestic oaks at the Ridgewood Country Club here. 
 Mr. Kingsley is not the only refugee from a sour economy carrying golf bags on the lush fairways at Ridgewood, which has a caddy corps of 135, one of the largest in the New York region. Alongside the high school and college students working for pocket money and tuition, and the career caddies who travel to Northern golf courses in the summer and to Southern golf courses in the winter, there are about 15 other well-educated and well-trained professionals or craftsmen, including an accountant, a lawyer, a chef, a truck driver, an electrician and a couple of salesmen.
Between caddying rounds at one of the premiere golf courses in the Northeast, they pore over classified job ads, read self-help books, reorganize resumes, grumble about the economy and, in some cases, struggle with their pride.
Mr. Kingsley says his most unsettling caddying jobs are for players in his age bracket, the late 20's or early 30's.
"They got one break or something, and we're carrying their bags," he said as he ate a container of fried brown rice between rounds the other day. "That's where it gets humiliating. We picked the wrong field, and we're in the wrong place at the wrong time. When you're 26 or 27 and making a nice living with a nice apartment and a nice car and moving right along, and all of a sudden you lose a job, it humbles you."
California and Florida, where he looked for jobs for several months, are glutted with unemployed engineers, he said.
"We are not building anything in this country anymore," he said. "We are not designing anything. Everything is coming from overseas. Imports are killing us."
His only professional job offer in recent months came from South Korea. It required a one-year commitment there, and Mr. Kingsley, who is married, is undecided about making it.
Ridgewood's caddy master, Dave Fagerstrom, said the unemployed professionals began trickling in a year or two ago. Some had carried at Ridgewood in their teens. Some came at the suggestion of friends after their unemployment benefits expired.
"The thought of coming here wouldn't occur to but one in 10 guys because most don't know golf or play golf or haven't caddied," Mr. Fagerstrom said. He's quick to note that all caddying jobs are filled now.
Those lucky enough to have caught on speak warmly of Mr. Fagerstrom for giving them steady work yet flexible enough hours to pursue interviews for new jobs. Stories of lives in transition abound in the caddy alcove outside Ridgewood's grand old Tudor-style brick clubhouse.
Ralph DelVecchio, 39, drove trucks, delivering overnight packages, for Purolator Courier until three years ago.
"The fax knocked that overnight letter business right out of business," Mr. DelVecchio said. Now he's honing his caddying skills in the hope of one day landing a regular full-time caddying job on the Ladies' Professional Golf Association Tour.
"I'm pursuing what I love," he said. "Obviously I'm not going to make it as a player at age 39. Caddying on the tour is a craft and I'm learning the craft for that level."
Scott Ledlow, a 28-year-old salesman with a new master's degree in business administration, is caddying at Ridgewood again as he did as an undergraduate in the early 1980's. He pursued his master's degree after losing his job in marketing for a company that prepares computerized payroll systems for other companies. Though he has received no offers, he keeps going on interviews.
"Companies seem to feel things are going to be happening," Mr. Ledlow said. "It's just a matter of when."
Mike McSherry, 46, worked as a retail accountant for Stern's for 16 1/2 years before a corporate merger eliminated his supervisory job and the jobs of the company's controller and two assistant controllers a couple of years ago. A Ridgewood member who is the chief financial officer of a brokerage house recently offered Mr. McSherry a $25,000-a-year entry-level job in Manhattan. He said no.
"I couldn't see the commute," he said. "I'll probably kick myself."
 
'It's a Great Workout'
 Mr. McSherry wants to return to supervisory accounting work. "But companies can be very selective," he said. "I don't have a master's degree. I'm not certified. I'm competing against all these guys."
Stiff competition in the job market is also on Michael Petta's mind. He is a 28-year-old lawyer trying for a job with a small-to-medium-size law firm specializing in defending doctors against malpractice suits.
"The Catch-22 is they want experience," Mr. Petta said. "Trying to get started with no medical experience is challenging. You have to show you're willing to learn medical issues."
For now, caddying is fine for Mr. Petta. "I think it's an excellent, if not the ultimate, in-between job," he said. "It's a great workout for your legs, you're walking miles and miles in fresh air and sunshine."
The pay is not all that bad. Those willing to work long and hard can earn anywhere from $450 to $600 a week, straight cash.
Caddies receive from $25 to $40, depending on tip, for carrying one bag for 18 holes. Most routinely carry doubles, or two bags, on each 18-hole round. The best money comes from carrying doubles for 18 holes in the morning and then for 18 more holes for other golfers in the afternoon.
Drawbacks exist. The job provides no medical benefits, Social Security deductions or paid vacations. Rainy days are slow.
But the caddies do get to play Ridgewood free each Monday. And sometimes they are invited to other courses to play. Mr. Kingsley, the engineer, who usually shoots in the low 80's, went to the neighboring Arcola Country Club on a recent Monday. He took a caddy for the day.
"Boy, what a nice game when you have somebody carrying your bag for you," he said.

Agency Plots Future After Account Loss

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Martin, Davis, Omon & Partners, which opened as Omon New York Ltd. in 1989, is pondering its future after the loss of its large Toyota corporate advertising account.
Joanne M. Davis, the president of the agency, disputed a report this week in the newsletter The Delaney Report that the agency had gone out of business. She said yesterday that its future was being evaluated, adding that billings, once as high as $25 million, had dropped below $5 million and the number of employees, once as high as 19, was now "a handful." 
 The Delaney Report estimated the Toyota account billings at $5 million to $10 million. Jim Olson, a spokesman for Toyota Motor Corporate Services of North America, said the account was moved last month to a new shop in New York opened by two former employees of Martin, Davis, Omon.

HEADLINE: Divided on Inflation;
Few Signs of Price Pressures, but Anxiety Among Economists Refuses to Go Away

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Blue-chip corporations from Sears to I.B.M. are sending out pink slips by the sackful, leaving millions of qualified workers sifting the want ads for employment. Whole industries, from airlines to cigarettes to computers, are hemorrhaging cash in a struggle to attract price-conscious consumers. Why, then, are economists worried about inflation?
One answer is that many are not. "You are looking at a global economy with lots of excess capacity," said Van Doorn Ooms, the director of research at the Committee for Economic Development. "It's difficult to see inflation on the horizon." 
 But a surprising number of economists, representing a variety of schools of thought, do have an inflation itch that they cannot scratch. And yesterday, many investors joined them as an index of commodity prices surged, rekindling inflation fears. [Page D16.]
These on-again, off-again anxieties are reflected by the Federal Reserve, whose divided governors are apparently hoping that tough anti-inflationary talk will obviate the need for action. Indeed, it is hard to remember a time when so many economists are of two minds on so basic an issue.
Start with the case for what is probably the majority view: that, for the moment, inflation is not a serious concern. Rising prices are a byproduct of scarcity, of too much demand chasing too little supply. This hardly fits the current market for labor: With 7 percent unemployment and this year's high school and college graduates scrambling for jobs, there is no discernible upward pressure on wages.
Nor, for that matter, is scarcity a problem in production. While a handful of prominent industries -- notably steel and lumber -- are operating near capacity, most are not. In fact, chronic overcapacity plagues businesses ranging from airlines to publishing to telecommunications. And even where American companies are beginning to fill their order books, foreign competition generally deters them from raising prices.
True, the rising value of the yen relative to the dollar has made it more expensive for Japanese companies to manufacture for the American market. And the resulting increases in Japanese car prices have been mirrored in higher prices for Detroit's models. But anecdotal evidence of import-driven inflation is misleading.
While computer simulation models do indeed suggest that a 10 percent rise in the exchange value of foreign currencies would increase Americans' overall cost of living by roughly three-tenths of a percent, the impact of the yen's appreciation has been negligible because it has been fully offset by the depreciation of the currencies of America's other trade partners. According to Morgan Guaranty Trust, a dollar actually bought more abroad in April 1993 than it did a year earlier.
In other words, Toyota prices may be going up, but the prices of Mercedes-Benzes and just about everything else imported from the rest of the world are going down. "You'd have to look beyond the computer models" to link price pressures to currency fluctuations, concludes Mark Lasky, a senior economist at DRI Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
That, however, is not the end of the story. Textbook analysis just doesn't seem to apply to current economic conditions. Consider the erratic course of economic growth and price increases in recent months. While the rate of economic growth was a tepid 1 percent in the first quarter of 1993, down sharply from the previous three months, the inflation rate inched up to nearly 4 percent. The inflation figures for April and May were back down to a reassuring 1.7 percent rate, but those who look hard enough can still spot some inflation straws in the wind.
Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, notes that gold prices rose to a two-year high last week and yesterday the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 leading commodities surged on news of soybean crop damage and gains in other basics. Though there are myriad unrelated reasons why gold has risen, Mr. Yardeni points out that gold has been a reliable leading indicator of general price increases. He suspects that the recessions in Europe and Japan are bottoming out -- and that demand for goods and services will pick up worldwide. "For the first time since 1987," he concludes, "we are facing inflationary pressures."
That suspicion is reinforced by the analysis of Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University and a member in good standing of the "monetarist" school of economics. Monetarists believe that one way or another, prices follow trends in the growth of the supply of money. And while some measures of money have hardly been growing, the ones of greatest significance in Mr. Meltzer's view -- funds available for loans, currency and checking deposits -- are up 10 to 12 percent in the last year. "The Federal Reserve has been pumping out money at a rapid rate," he observes, a rate that presages inflation.
 
Point of Higher Prices?
 Mr. Meltzer's concerns are shared by a prominent economist with little patience with monetarist orthodoxy. Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the economy may be operating closer to full capacity than is generally believed, and thus may be closer to the point where increased demand for goods and services translates into higher prices.
During the 1980's the unemployment rate fell well below 6 percent without stirring pressure for inflationary wage increases. That led many economists to the cheerful conclusion that the "natural" rate of unemployment -- the rate that was consistent with stable prices -- had been permanently reduced.
But Mr. Krugman worries that this experience was a yet-unexplained anomaly, that the minimum noninflationary rate of unemployment is really between 6 and 7 percent. Moreover, this minimum may be going up rather than down, as industries from military contracting to banking shed employees in response to a combination of Government belt-tightening and increased global competition. "We have already seen a modest recovery from a shallow recession," he says. "There may not be a lot of room left for stable growth."
Such reasoning certainly influenced the Clinton Administration to back away from pre-inaugural plans to jolt the economy with temporary tax cuts and spending increases. And Congress, in its new-found enthusiasm for fiscal rectitude, scotched even the symbolic $20 billion stimulus left in the Administration's deficit-reduction package. That left the inflation-policy ball squarely in the Federal Reserve's court.
 
Greenspan's Stand
 Thus far, the Fed has confined its actions to threats. "We need to be especially vigilant not to be mesmerized by the current tranquility of the inflationary environment," Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said in April. And the Fed vice chairman, David Mullins, echoed that view late last month. "If inflation were to become re-established in the minds of the markets, with no timely response from the Fed, that could be damaging to the economy," he said.
Mr. Ooms interprets these warnings as a form of meta-policy, in which the Fed uses the prospect of tighter credit as a substitute for actually raising interest rates. Like nuclear deterrence, the idea is to achieve the goal without resort to force. "It's probably not a bad idea for them to jawbone down expectations," he says.
But Mr. Krugman is skeptical. He sees the Fed's current approach as a compromise between hard-liners who want to push inflation toward zero and more liberal governors who worry that the economic recovery will falter once again if the Fed moves to tighten credit. Such uneasy compromises have a way of coming undone.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
American's Drop in Traffic Sends Airline Stocks Lower

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Stocks of several major airlines fell yesterday, apparently on news that American Airlines' traffic dropped 3 percent in June from the 8.9 billion revenue passenger miles flown a year earlier.
Some erosion had been expected, since fare price cuts this summer are not comparable to last year's half-price sale. But analysts say investors seem to have reacted to the failure of either leisure or business traffic to bounce back. 
 The stock of American's parent, AMR, fell $2.625 yesterday, to $61.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, where trading volume was almost 1.4 million shares.
"Last Friday, American warned that traffic would come in a little softer than originally forecast," said Kevin Murphy, the airline analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. "But they suggested yields would come in a little better than expected. Consequently, they expressed comfort that their performance would be consistent with general expectations."
Donald J. Carty, American's executive vice president of finance and planning, said yesterday, "While traffic was down somewhat more than our projections, we expect our June revenues to be in line with our earlier expectations."
 
Follow-the-Leader Trading
 Mr. Murphy is projecting earnings of 40 cents for AMR's second quarter, although the consensus is that the carrier will earn 28 cents. Last year, the company lost $166 million for the second quarter.
Delta Air Lines stock fell $1.75 yesterday, to $47.125, and UAL, parent of United Airlines, was off 62.5 cents, to $125.375. Mr. Murphy attributed the declines in Delta and United to follow-the-leader trading. "Investors are all generally seeing there's no significant recovery in demand, domestically or internationally," he said.
The major airlines have been at the mercy of an American economy that had been in recession and even now appears to be improving only slowly, and they are suffering from weak economies in Europe and in Japan. Mr. Murphy also pointed to new upstart United States carriers as well as improved telecommunications -- what he described as an "information highway" -- that have made some business travel unnecessary, or at least optional.
A further sign of the global nature of the problem was provided by the International Air Transport Association, which on the weekend reported that the May worldwide passenger load factor of 64 percent (that is, the percentage of seats filled by paying passengers) was the lowest for any May since 1988. "The early summer season," the association said, "has not brought the hoped-for turnabout in the I.A.T.A. airlines' traffic and capacity trends."
The load factor for United States airlines was only 63 percent in May and 61 percent for the first five months of 1993, but both represented slight gains over the comparable periods last year -- 1.4 percentage points and 1.5 percentage points, respectively.

HEADLINE: Fed Official's Inflation View

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Further progress on reducing the rate of inflation this year is still possible, even though inflation picked up in the first few months, Susan Phillips, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said today.
"It certainly is still feasible that we could have further progress on reducing inflation as we continue through this year," Ms. Phillips told the National Association of College and University Business Officers. 
 The Fed must insure that a "firming of prices recently doesn't persist," she said.
She does not expect inflation to soar, she said, adding that "the economy is well positioned for a period of sustained, noninflationary growth."
Ms. Phillips and other members of the Fed's Open Market Committee will meet this week to decide the central bank's stance on interest rates for the ensuing six weeks. They will also set long-term monetary policy goals for the remainder of 1993 and decide on tentative goals for 1994.
Many analysts say the Fed is likely to see the economy as strong enough not to need the stimulus of interest rate cuts. At the same time, the Fed is likely to see no need to push interest rates higher to curb inflation.

HEADLINE: France Sees No Recovery

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: PARIS, July 6

 BODY:
There is no sign that the recession France has been mired in since the end of last year is ending, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said today.
"The French economy is in recession since the autumn of 1992 and there has been no sign of a pickup so far: production, consumption and investment are heading downward," Mr. Balladur told the state-sponsored Economic and Social Council, a group of politicians, industrialists and trade unionists. 
 More than 3.1 million people in France are unemployed, and if no steps are taken, the job situation will deteriorate rapidly by the end of the year, the Prime Minister said.
The extent of the downturn is exceptional, Mr. Balladur added, blaming the recent, steep slump in Germany's economy. He said he hoped the pickup in "Anglo-Saxon" economies -- by which the French usually mean the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia -- would spread to the rest of the industrial countries, including France.

The Constitution: Is It Organic or Cast in Stone?

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
Main Currents in American Legal Thought
By Bernard Schwartz
660 pages. Carolina Academic Press.
$49.95
In the foreword to "Main Currents in American Thought" in 1930, Vernon L. Parrington wrote, "The point of view from which I have endeavored to evaluate the materials is liberal rather than conservative, Jeffersonian rather than Federalistic." What excited generations of college students was Parrington's notion that the literature of the American people was not purely literary but rather an outgrowth of their environment, ethnic differences and epoch. 
 An even more intense Jeffersonian approach characterizes "Main Currents in American Legal Thought," by Bernard Schwartz, the eminent constitutional scholar. The title of his weighty tome (hundreds of cases are cited, but with notable clarity) quite frankly borrows from Parrington's book. Mr. Schwartz, a biographer of Chief Justice Earl Warren, is a professor of law at the University of Tulsa College of Law. Running through his highly readable history of the evolution of American law during the last two centuries is his unabashed admiration for the judges, lawyers and Presidents who interpreted the Constitution liberally.
 As with Parrington's literary "Main Currents," Mr. Schwartz's legal "Main Currents" presents his narrative through the ideas and works of significant individuals. The result is a procession of the lawyers and jurists -- from John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis D. Brandeis, Benjamin N. Cardozo and William J. Brennan Jr. -- who looked upon the Constitution as a living document that could serve Americans in their own time.
Mr. Schwartz cites chapter and verse to show that the early jurists and legislators refashioned the common law to promote an agent for change and progress. As chairman of a legislative committee to revise the laws in Virginia, Jefferson plainly sought to adapt the British common law to American conditions. His revision offered an opportunity to destroy the economic base of the planter aristocracy that dominated Virginia life. Jefferson deplored the land laws that concentrated power in the hands of owners of large estates. He wrote that Virginia and the new nation needed an "aristocracy of virtue and talent" rather than an "aristocracy of wealth."
A virtue of "Main Currents in American Legal Thought" is that Mr. Schwartz continually relates judicial opinions to what was happening in the country. In the 19th century, slavery was the great albatross: Southerners like Jefferson and Chief Justice John Marshall may have cursed slavery, but at the same time they lived by it. Marshall's account book shows that he bought slaves at various times and argued in court that slaves were property. It took the Civil War to destroy the peculiar institution and change the Constitution and the court rulings.
Two modern Supreme Court justices come to the forefront in the book: "If Chief Justice Warren's activist jurisprudence set the theme for the midcentury concept of law," the author writes, "it was Justice Brennan who did the same in the latter part of the century." Judge Learned Hand of the Federal Court of Appeals once referred to Justices Warren, Brennan, William O. Douglas and Hugo L. Black as "the Jesus Quartet." Brennan was a student of Felix Frankfurter (later a Supreme Court justice) at Harvard law school. After Brennan joined Chief Justice Warren's activist wing, Frankfurter supposedly said in his anecdotage, "I always encourage my students to think for themselves, but Brennan goes too far!"
The outstanding feature of Justice Brennan's view of the Constitution, the author writes, is its plastic nature. In a 1983 opinion involving the First Amendment phrase against the establishment of religion, Justice Brennan said that the burden of judicial interpretation is to translate "the majestic generalities" of the Constitution, conceived as part of the pattern of liberal government in the 18th century, into principles for dealing with the problems of the 20th century.
The arguments for and against the conservative doctrine of "original intention," the idea that the court should try to determine the original meaning of the framers of the Constitution, receive full treatment in the book. "We have no way of knowing how completely the statements recorded by Madison reflected the actual intentions of the 55 men who sat in Independence Hall during the summer of 1787," Mr. Schwartz says. "Advocates of original intention really urge the rejection of much that has become settled in 20th-century jurisprudence."
"Main Currents in American Legal Thought" is a bracing work of scholarship that could inspire readers to think about the nature of the right-of-center decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States today compared with the rulings by the great liberal justices of the recent past. The author leaves the clear impression that the liberals on the bench were much closer to the hearts and minds of the framers of the Constitution than are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and the majority of his colleagues.

One Picasso, Two Writers And an Editor on the Spot

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Norman Mailer has long been fascinated by Pablo Picasso, and so it seemed like a natural fit when the renowned author set out, he says, to write a biography of the renowned artist for his editor at Random House, Jason Epstein.
But there were a couple of difficulties, the most pressing among them being that Mr. Epstein happened, quite awkwardly, to be the editor of another biographer, John Richardson, who is working on a four-volume series on Picasso. Mr. Richardson's exhaustive dissection of the artist's early years, "A Life of Picasso: Volume I, 1881-1906," achieved both critical and commercial success several years ago. "I was apprehensive and told Norman that there might be a problem," Mr. Epstein said. 
 To make matters worse, when the editor showed Mr. Richardson a draft of Mr. Mailer's manuscript, which relied heavily on quotations from the earlier biography, Mr. Richardson disagreed with most of Mr. Mailer's analysis and refused to allow his material to be used. "Quite apart from not wanting to have my publisher bring out another book on Picasso while my own book is still selling, I think that both of us would look foolish," Mr. Richardson said in an indignant letter to Mr. Epstein in November in which he curtly called Mr. Mailer's book a "scissors-and-paste job."
That put everyone in an awkward position. "It had become a close situation at Random House because we both had the same editor," Mr. Mailer said. "So I offered to move publishers for the one book. It seemed simpler than to have an editor torn apart by two writers in dispute."
 
'Norman's Interpretation'
 Mr. Mailer, forced to excise large chunks of material from his book, took the manuscript to Nan A. Talese, head of her own imprint at Doubleday who said she thought Mr. Richardson was, at the very least, overreacting. "There's been an enormous number of books written about Picasso," she said, "and the facts are essentially the same. This book is Norman's interpretation of the facts as already known."
It is unclear when Mr. Mailer's book will be published, particularly because no contract has been signed with Doubleday, said Stephen Rubin, the president and publisher. "There's tremendous mutual enthusiasm for the project, but we're not even in negotiations yet," he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Richardson said he planned to take the second volume in his planned set to another Random House editor, Sharon Delano. And Mr. Mailer said he would continue to publish with Random House. His next two books, Mr. Epstein said, are to be the second part of his novel "Harlot's Ghost" and a work of nonfiction about Lee Harvey Oswald.
 
Absorbing Poseidon
 Simon & Schuster's decision to merge its Poseidon Press into its adult trade division has given rise to much speculation about the future of Poseidon and its two established editors, Ann Patty, who is also vice president and publisher, and Elaine Pfefferblit.
The company said Ms. Patty would continue to publish books under the Poseidon name, much the way Nan A. Talese does at Doubleday, although Poseidon would no longer exist as a separate corporate division. Ms. Pfefferblit is being removed from Poseidon and is currently casting about for another job. Her current projects include Bruce Bawer's book "A Place at the Table: The Gay Individual in American Society," to be published in November, and two works in progress by Daphne Merkin.
Simon & Schuster officials strove to present the change as a positive move for Poseidon and Ms. Patty.
"It's an accounting change more than anything," said Carolyn K. Reidy, the president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's adult trade division, who said she and Ms. Patty had been searching for months for a way to make the imprint more economically viable. "Our feeling was that the only way to do it would be to remove it as a free-standing economic unit. There is no diminution in Ann Patty's stature or position."
 
The Balance Sheet
 Nonetheless, some present and former employees of the company are portraying the change as a sign of the friction between Ms. Patty and Jack Romanos, the president of the Paramount Publishing consumer group. And they say it is just another ominous step in the consolidation of Simon & Schuster's disparate publishing niches by the company's parents, Paramount Publishing and Paramount Communications, in the name of a more efficient bottom line. Other Simon & Schuster imprints that have fallen by the wayside in recent years include Summit Books, Linden Press and the trade division of Prentice Hall.
"I don't know what kind of commitment men sitting around in Los Angeles making movies have to the future of literature," said one high-ranking employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But others within Simon & Schuster said the company had successfully found a way for Poseidon to go on, when its balance sheet did not always show profits (although its supporters say it would have proved profitable if it had been given credit for its paperbacks). "The alternative was to fold it," said one Simon & Schuster editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They've demonstrated that they were willing to do that, and that's what they've done in the past."
Poseidon has been publishing about two dozen books of serious fiction and nonfiction a year, but it has no wildly best-selling authors who might have carried it along in the face of corporate pressure. News of its diminished status within Simon & Schuster has generated a flurry of telephone calls from authors worried about their own situations.
Mr. Romanos said the change in Poseidon was motivated simply by dollars and cents and was consistent with the company's effort to reduce the number of books it publishes by about 14 or 15 percent over the last few years. "It was an imprint with its own overhead structure, and it simply wasn't publishing enough or didn't have sales high enough to support that overhead structure," Mr. Romanos said. "It was a simple case of the numbers not adding up."
 
New Chicago Manual
 The Chicago Manual of Style, a classic reference book for writers, editors, proofreaders and the like, was last revised 11 years ago. Now it has been revised again. The new edition, the 14th, is to include expanded information about nationalities, tribes and races; it also includes a revamped chapter on foreign languages, with a new section on Hebrew. It is to be published by the University of Chicago Press in September and, at more than 900 pages, is 200 fact-filled pages longer than its predecessor.

HEADLINE: New Status for Stylish Art of Braiding

BYLINE: By RUTH M. BOND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Aminata Khafra sat in the sparsely furnished living room of her row house in northwest Washington making braids in the carefully parted hair of a young girl, a friend's daughter.
Ms. Khafra was slowly transforming 10-year-old Shannon Gopoul's hair into a "singles" style, in which at least a hundred tiny braids hang down from the scalp and rest gently on the shoulders. The style, which took five hours to complete, is one of seven that Ms. Khafra, 28, said she had learned by watching her cousins as a girl in Mali. 
 "It's a creation of the mind and the finger," Ms. Khafra said, gently turning her subject's head to the proper angle.
Ms. Khafra is one of many black women and girls who braid hair in their homes. And because of a new licensing law passed here in March that establishes hair braiding as its own trade, distinct from hairdressing and cosmetology, they will be able to move their businesses out of the home and into the economic mainstream.
"If I get my license, I'll open up a salon," said Ms. Khafra, who does braids for four or five people a week and charges between $70 and $90 for a hairdo that can last as long as three months. She hopes her salon will also sell African clothing like the robe she was wearing, a vivid assemblage of orange, green and brick-red strips of cloth.
Under the new law, hair braiding will have its own set of rules and licensing avenues, training and testing procedures. While many of the details still have to be worked out, a grandfather provision is expected for those who can show they have been braiding for clients for at least three years.
Braiders say that the most important part of the new law is that it separates African-style braiding from traditional cosmetology, which emphasizes the use of chemicals to straighten, perm, tint and dye hair. Several new salons, like the Sahel Braiding Parlor and Braids Unlimited, both in the Shaw-Cardozo neighborhood in northwest Washington, have opened here since the beginning of the year.
Many braiders call Taalib-Din Abdul Uqdah, 40, a co-owner of Cornrows & Company, a braiding salon in the Brightwood section of upper northwest Washington, the father of the new licensing law. For more than a decade, he and his wife, Pamela Ferrell, battled politicians, inspectors and the local cosmetology industry to gain greater recognition and economic opportunities for braiders.
The old regulations, which had not been updated since 1938, required anyone offering hair-care services to the public to complete lengthy and expensive programs offered by cosmetology schools, which generally emphasized changing the nature of black women's hair. Mr. Uqdah called the old rules discriminatory because they did not address the needs of African-American women who want to wear their hair in natural styles.
Cecilia Hinds, 32, another Washington braider, said that her life would have been much easier if the law had been different seven years ago when she was preparing to go into business. She said of her 1,500-hour course at the National Institute of Cosmetology in Washington, "It was a lot of time and money spent for something that you weren't going to be doing."
Washington is the second locality to establish separate licensing for hair braiders. Last year, New York State revised its cosmetology regulations to establish a "natural hair care" license. Braiders in other parts of the country, including Louisiana, Florida, Illinois and Michigan, are working to get similar laws passed.
The law in Washington also paves the way for the establishment of specialized braiding schools. Braiders say the schools are essential because making cornrows -- the generic name for coifs of African origin in which hair is intertwined in looping, twisting patterns that hug the scalp and resemble rows of corn -- requires a great deal of skill. Braiders must be taught the correct way to make forms like dufil braids, flat twists, rhasta twists, thick rolls and Nubian knots. Ms. Ferrell's book "Where Beauty Touches Me" (available from Cornrows & Company, 5401 14th Street NW, Washington 20011; $24.95) pictures more than 60 styles. The most complicated of the styles takes as long as 16 hours to complete.
Mr. Uqdah and Ms. Ferrell, who employ 10 fulltime braiders, see about 25 clients a day at Cornrows. They have developed a 750-hour training curriculum that they hope will be used as the basis for the new licensing requirements. It will include safety measures and hair physiology: improper technique can damage the scalp and can even cause baldness. Chemical processing will be taught only as background information.
Of great importance to many braiders is the preservation of an art form that dates back thousands of years. "I think this is a renaissance period," said Hiddekel Burks, a braider in Chicago and a founder of the National Braiders Guild, who is working to get a similar law passed in Illinois.
For braiders, new laws are important in their continuing efforts to win wider acceptance for hair styles that have met with much resistance from many employers and others who regard the African-inspired styles as hostile expressions of blackness. Those attitudes have led some women to sue their employers -- often successfully -- for the right to wear their cornrows.
But Aliska Moffett, who owns Cinnamon's Braiding and Beauty Salon in New Orleans, said that wearing braids is not in itself a statement against society. "It's more of a spiritual and cultural thing," she said, a way of continuing centuries of traditional African fashion and lore.

HEADLINE: Haiti: The Secret of Success

 BODY:
Getting the Haitian military to agree to a timetable for returning President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power is a considerable achievement. The United Nations mediator, Dante Caputo, and the Clinton Administration deserve much credit.
But after pressuring President Aristide to accept an agreement that leaves real power in military hands for most of a four-month transition period, the U.N. and the U.S. are now obliged to insure that army and police commanders live up to their parts of the deal. They must end political intimidation now and actually surrender power at the end of October. 
 The transition is scheduled to begin shortly, with political consultations leading up to the nomination of a new prime minister by President Aristide. Other steps include limited amnesty for those involved in the 1991 military coup, suspension of international economic sanctions and provision of more than $1 billion in international assistance.
The most important changes in internal security are scheduled toward the end of the process, including the creation of a civilian police force, replacement of the military and police high command and the return of Father Aristide.
The obvious risk is that the military will continue to intimidate and even eliminate Aristide supporters while it still can, to influence key political decisions starting with the choice of a new prime minister.
The best deterrent against this would be quick reimposition of sanctions. A new Security Council resolution is being prepared that would allow Mr. Caputo and Secretary General Boutros-Ghali to reimpose sanctions automatically if, in their judgment, the military begins undermining the agreement. Its terms, passage and credibility are crucial to success of the whole enterprise.
There's an important lesson in the diplomatic endgame that brought this agreement. For more than 20 months, as Washington sent mixed diplomatic signals, the Haitian military defiantly rejected all serious diplomacy. But less than two weeks after the Clinton Administration sought and won stiff U.N. economic sanctions, the generals were at the bargaining table ready to deal.
The secret of diplomatic success is usually a matter of mixing threat, patience and compromise in just the right proportions. The Haiti agreement is a welcome sign that, after embarrassing stumbles elsewhere, the Clinton Administration may be getting the recipe right.
