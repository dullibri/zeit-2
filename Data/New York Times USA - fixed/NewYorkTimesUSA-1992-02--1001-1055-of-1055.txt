HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
G.O.P. Air War Reflects Competitiveness of Georgia Contest

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Somewhere between New Hampshire and Georgia, the economy dropped off the screen and was replaced by good, old-fashioned Christian values.
In a new high-voltage negative commercial that went on the air here Wednesday, Patrick J. Buchanan attacks President Bush for "investing tax dollars in pornographic and blasphemous art." 
 While scenes of leather-clad gay men flash on the screen, a narrator intones, "This so-called art has glorified homosexuality, exploited children and perverted the image of Jesus Christ." The footage is from a movie subsidized by the National Endowment for the Arts.
 
Taking It Personally
 In a second television commercial, Mr. Buchanan attacks Mr. Bush for a proposal to use church donor lists to collect taxes while the screen shows a picture of a quaint country chapel. (Actually, the Treasury Department made the proposal.)
The new commercials went on television a day after President Bush unveiled advertisements attacking Mr. Buchanan for his opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf and implicitly questioning his patriotism. In the advertisements, Gen. P. X. Kelley, a retired Marine Corps commander, says that he "took it personally" when Mr. Buchanan opposed the Persian Gulf war.
The increasingly bitter air war between Mr. Buchanan and the President reflects the competitiveness of the Republican race in Georgia, where the first Southern primary will be held Tuesday. Mr. Buchanan has acknowledged that he needs to win at least one primary over the next two weeks to remain competitive. Since his television campaign at this point is limited to Georgia, this state appears to be his top priority.
Mr. Bush, on the other hand, has suffered two embarrassing primary showings in recent weeks -- the first in New Hampshire, where he ran against Mr. Buchanan, and the second in South Dakota, where he ran against an uncommitted slate. His new un-kinder advertising campaign seems to demonstrate his determination to avoid a third one.
As the campaign enters a frantic, and potentially decisive phase, with more than a dozen primaries to be held over the next two weeks, candidates in both parties have abandoned many of the high-minded claims of their early advertisements and opted instead for cutting down their competitors. But compared with the Republicans, who are trying to do to each other what General Sherman did to Atlanta, the Democrats are behaving like regular Southern gentlemen on the Georgia airwaves.
 
Harkin Short of Cash
 In fact, only two Democratic candidates, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, are currently televising commercials here.
Short of cash, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has no television commercials on in any state now. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who is hoping for an infusion of contributions following his victory on Tuesday in South Dakota, began advertising today on Colorado television only, but advisers say they are considering whether to go on the air in other states, like Georgia.
And former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, unconventional in all things, has throughout the campaign eschewed 30-second television spots in favor of 30-minute "info-mercials."
In Georgia, where Mr. Clinton has come under heavy attack from Mr. Kerrey on his draft record, the Governor began showing a commerical that criticizes Mr. Tsongas's economic policies, saying "much of what Tsongas proposes smacks of trickle-down economics." But, the commercial said, "that's what went wrong in the 80's."
 
Harsher and Harsher
 Frank Greer, Mr. Clinton's media adviser, calls the commercial a "very straightforward spot." But the Tsongas campaign calls it a negative advertisement. And Ed Jesser, Mr. Tsongas's communications director, said today that his campaign would counter Mr. Clinton's commercial with one of its own criticizing the practitioners of "old politics."
Mr. Jesser said that wherever the Clinton campaign put on its commercial, the Tsongas campaign would put on its counter-commercial. "Wherever they go up, we go up," he said. The two campaigns are already showing their battling commercials in Colorado.
It remains to be seen whether negative advertising will work in the primaries, or whether voters, like overstimulated laboratory rats, will simply fail to respond. But several potential voters here said today that they thought Mr. Buchanan's latest attacks went too far.
 
'Kind of Spiteful'
 "I've seen a couple of different Buchanan ads, and I didn't particularly like them," Scott LeCraw, a financial manager, said. "They were kind of spiteful, mean-spirited, and unnecessarily so. Frankly, I find it a little insulting."
Mr. LeCraw said he usually votes Republican, but Georgia residents can vote in either primary, and he was considering voting in the Democratic race instead. He said he wished that Mr. Buchanan was telling voters more of what was good about him and less of what was bad about President Bush.
"I don't need to be told what a bad job Bush is doing," he said. "I know that."

HEADLINE: Russia Gathering In A-Weapons Briskly

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The transfer of all short-range nuclear weapons to Russia from other former Soviet republics will probably be completed by May, two months ahead of schedule, a senior Russian general said today.
Gen. Sergei Zelentsov, chief nuclear engineer in the Russian Defense Ministry responsible for the withdrawal of about 3,000 tactical warheads outside Russia, described the new timetable here at a conference of nuclear scientists from the United States and the former Soviet Union. 
 The early withdrawal is significant because of concerns that economic and political unrest in the newly independent republics could threaten the control of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal, particularly the smaller, more mobile tactical warheads. The Bush Administration has urged that the tactical warheads -- mostly nuclear-tipped artillery shells and short-range missiles -- be consolidated under a single authority, and ultimately dismantled, as quickly as possible.
There are now about 12,000 tactical weapons in Russia and 3,000 in Ukraine and Belarus, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Approximately 3,000 tactical warheads that had been in the other Soviet republics have already been transferred to Russia. There are also about 12,000 long-range nuclear weapons in the former Soviet arsenal, but all of them are located in four republics -- Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Senior Russian nuclear officials said at a news conference today Moscow sought to dismantle the tactical weapons by the end of the decade. In the meantime, they said, Russia would seek American financial and technical assistance to build safe storage areas for the plutonium and highly enriched uranium bomb components.
Boris V. Nikepelov, the First Deputy Minister of Atomic Power and Industry, said that 100 tons of weapons-grade plutonium and 400 to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium could be recovered from dismantling tactical and long-range nuclear weapons. He declined to give the number or location of dismantling sites, but said they were adequate to do the job.
Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that Administration officials were waiting to review detailed engineering drawings and cost estimates for the storage buildings, before approving any aid.
In the two-day workshop, the fourth in a series organized by the Federation of American Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council, American and Russian officials said they addressed such problems as improving safety at nuclear plants, storing nuclear materials and converting Russia's 10 nuclear weapons plants to commercial use.
The workshop has no official governmental status, but the United States contingent included representatives of the Bush Administration and Congress as well as private interest groups. And many of the Russian participants are senior scientists with political influence at home.
 
Support for Science Center
 Scientists from both sides repeated support for a plan proposed by Russia, the United States and Germany to establish an international science and technology center in Russia that would support scientists and engineers of the former Soviet Union to redirect their military expertise to civilian purposes.
The Bush Administration has pledged $25 million to the project out of $400 million appropriated by Congress to help in the elimination of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Germany and other European countries are also contributing to the center.
By financing peaceful research or commercial projects, the center seeks to blunt the temptation of ex-Soviet nuclear experts in need of a job to sell their services to aspiring nuclear powers like Iraq, Iran, Libya or North Korea.
Yevgeny N. Avrorin, the scientific leader of the Institute of Technical Physics at Chelyabinsk-70, one of two Russian research centers for nuclear weapons design, said such temptations would be natural, but that he hoped "a moral threshold" against spreading nuclear technology would prevent highly trained scientists from selling their talents indiscriminately.
 
Halt Reusing Material
 The Russian scientists also said their Government has agreed to stop reusing nuclear materials from dismantled weapons in new arms, and instead store the material -- typically highly enriched uranium and plutonium -- at sites that would be subject to international monitoring, if Washington agreed to similar inspections.
Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, has said that new plutonium production would cease by the end of the decade. Mr. Nikepelov said that efforts to speed that process were hampered because the same plants that produced plutonium also provided electricity.
Mr. Avrorin said Russian officials have drawn up 30 proposals for alternative uses for the nuclear weapons labs, whose budgets were slashed by 50 percent this year, participants said.
"The task will be to find projects with a maximum profit return," said Mr. Avrorin, who conceded that the former Soviet scientific community has a lot to learn about Western-style supply-and-demand practices.

Britain Offers Nuclear Help
 LONDON, Feb. 27 (Reuters) -- Defense Secretary Thomas King announced a British package of assistance today to provide Russia with 250 special containers for transporting nuclear weapons and up to 20 special armored vehicles to carry them.
Officials said Russian technicians would dismantle the weapons.

HEADLINE: Charity Leader's Success Was Also His Undoing

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The key to William Aramony's downfall as leader of the United Way of America was the same key that opened the doors of prosperity for the organization for decades: he made the charity resemble a corporation.
Mr. Aramony resigned today after disclosures about how he ran the United Way's national operation: creating profit-making affiliates that acquired luxurious condominiums, receiving annual compensation of nearly half a million dollars, flying the Concorde and riding in limousines. 
 People familiar with the philanthropy business today called Mr. Aramony's downfall unfortunate but predictable.
Mr. Aramony's monumental success over the years, one expert in philanthropy said, had been in building a bridge that corporate leaders can pass over on the way to meeting pressing social needs. In order to get corporate leaders to cross, he said, Mr. Aramony had to make the United Way a place where executives would feel comfortable. But, he said, every brick of the edifice he built took the charity itself further away from the soul of philanthropy, and from the spirit in which ordinary people give their money to worthy causes.
Many people who knew Mr. Aramony praised him today, even as they raised questions about his methods. "The guy knocked himself out for the movement," said Lester M. Salamon, director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies. "Whatever anybody says about him, he knocked himself out with a level of enthusiasm and commitment that was striking."
But others, including those with corporate and philanthropic ties, were less forgiving. "It is particularly profane to have someone in the good work that the United Way has done all across the country be sullied, by finding out the kind of perks and personal leadership that has been revealed," said John Hechinger, chairman of the Hechinger Corporation and a major donor to charities in the Washington area.
And Robert O. Bothwell, executive director of the Washington-based National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, said of Mr. Aramony's salary, "I think it is obscene that he is making that kind of salary and asking people who are making $10,000 a year to give 5 percent of their income."
He said the United Way had in the end created "an old boys' network that works very well for those who are in it." But he said charities not supported by the United Way have been stymied when they, too, have tried to penetrate the corporate world and take advantage of the workplace fund raising that has long proved the United Way's strength.
William Aramony, born July 27, 1927 in Jewett City, Conn., has been involved in the organization for most of his adult life. The youngest of four children born to immigrants from Lebanon, he grew up in Worcester, Mass. He earned a master's from the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work and after working in United Way affiliates he came to the executive offices in Washington in the late 1960's. At that time, he has pointed out, the local affiliates that now make up the United Way did not have a single name, or even a common stated purpose.
In a book published by the organization on its centennial five years ago, he described how he had acted on the advice of management consultants at Peat, Marwick & Mitchell toreshape the national organization, which does not control local fund raising or spending but gets voluntary dues from local affiliates in return for training, management services and advertising. He formed a partnership with the National Football League that provided invaluable public-service advertising free of charge. And he helped to develop what the group calls its core strategy, which emphasizes its annual communitywide campaigns.
In those campaigns, workers are encouraged by employers to contribute to the United Way through payroll deductions. Charitable agencies that benefit from the unified fund raising usually agree not to make their own appeals for support while the United Way campaigns are under way. Workplace charity has been an approach that few charities have been able to duplicate unless they join the United Way.
United Way's near monopoly on giving in the workplace has engendered considerable resentment among charities that are not affiliated with it. One of the key disagreements in philanthropic circles is whether individuals should be allowed to designate the causes that their contributions will support. The United Way usually does not provide this choice to its donors, and some organizations say people would give more willingly if they could name their own beneficiaries.
"The pie could be much larger," said Oliver Porter, who heads the Combined Health Appeal of America, representing health agencies that do not operate within the United Way. "If I have a fault with United Way's leadership, it is the lack of recognition that we really have not reached the potential for giving."
 
Ambitious Plans for Growth
 In his 1987 book, "The United Way: the Next Hundred Years," Mr. Aramony said he believed the United Way's approach could double its financial power in just five years. The target is unlikely to be reached this year, despite continuing and steady growth in giving, which reached $3.1 billion in 1990. (Figures for last year are not yet available.)
Mr. Bothwell of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy said that despite United Way's growth, contributions only increased 17 percent after accounting for inflation between 1970 and 1990. National income grew nearly 60 percent at the same time, after accounting for inflation, and philanthropic giving grew even faster, he said.
"We ought to re-examine just how dynamic a leader he has really been," Mr. Bothwell said of Mr. Aramony.

HEADLINE: Weicker to Veto Almost Any Expansion of Gambling

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vowed today to veto almost any expansion of legalized gambling in Connecticut, including slot machines, which are being pushed by many lawmakers as a way to improve the fortunes of the ailing cities and to compete with the Indian-owned casino that opened this month.
"Gambling is going to be the No. 1 issue in the legislature," Mr. Weicker said. "And I think it poses far and away the greatest threat." 
 In a rare appearance before the legislature's Public Safety Committee, which is considering everything from riverboat gambling on the Connecticut River to a full-blown casino in downtown Hartford, the Governor urged lawmakers to reject what he said would be a nearsighted solution with damaging long-term consequences for the state's quality of life.
But the appearance turned into a debate on how long poor residents in places like Hartford should have to wait for the economic revival that Mr. Weicker said was under way and whether gambling ultimately lifts people from poverty by providing jobs, or grinds them further into misery by stealing their money.
 
'I Can't Wait'
 "My concern is to get jobs to the people of the city of Hartford," said State Senator Frank David Barrows, a Democrat who represents Hartford's North End, a poor, predominantly minority area. "I can't wait," Mr. Barrows said in a one-on-one exchange with the Governor. "I'd rather see a casino."
Mr. Weicker responded that he could only promise to fight "with the last breath" in his body to get jobs for poor urban residents and that the specter of Atlantic City, where a poor urban core has remained despite the glitter of the casinos, should haunt everyone who has to make a choice.
"We've got to go ahead now at this very critical moment and define our state," Mr. Weicker said. "Is it a gambling state or is it a family state? Are we going to invest in, or are we going to bet on, the future?"
Mr. Weicker said he had not intended to testify at all, but changed his mind this morning after the State Treasurer, Francisco L. Borges, came to the Governor's office rampaging against the casino proposals.
 
'Sickening and Unspeakable'
 Mr. Borges, who has often acted as a sort of spokesman for Connecticut's poorest residents, testified that the prospect of full casino gambling in Connecticut was "sickening and unspeakable" because it would rip apart urban families that are already exploited and suffering.
"The only shot in the arm a gambling casino would give us is like the ones that the heroin addicts on Hartford's streets depend on for their cheap, quick, dirty, easy and ultimately death-inducing fix," Mr. Borges said.
The backdrop to the gambling debate, referred to by many of the speakers at the five-hour hearing, is the success of the Mashantucket Pequot Indians, who opened a casino on their reservation in Ledyard earlier this month.
The casino, which pays no state or Federal taxes because it is owned by a sovereign Indian nation, has already gone to round-the-clock operation and announced an expansion to 56,000 square feet from 46,000 by this spring.
A spokesman for the casino, David R. Kripitz, said about 10,000 gamblers a day, with 15,000 to 20,000 on weekends, have been drawn to the mostly rural area in the southeast corner of the state. He said about 500 more employees would be added by this summer, on top of the 2,500 jobs now provided by the casino.
 
Wooing Away Customers
 Officials who run the state's off-reservation gambling enterprises, like jai alai and offtrack betting, all paraded before the Public Safety Committee today saying the Indian casino had wooed away customers.
"Our business is off 22 percent since the opening of Ledyard, and frankly it can only get worse," said A. Robert Zeff, president of Bridgeport Jai Alai. "We need the machines to survive," he said, referring to slot machines.
Mr. Weicker, whose longstanding opposition to gambling is well known, has twice met with the chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., Stephen A. Wynn, in recent weeks in Hartford, including a well-publicized lunch at an expensive Hartford restaurant. But he took pains today to deny any change of heart. Mirage operates casinos in Nevada and has been pursuing expansion in other states.
"What the Governor is doing," Mr. Weicker said, "is trying to learn the facts of an industry and an activity of which he knows very little, except as a dice-thrower or a two-dollar bettor. We're learning, all of us, and we'll make the right decisions on the basis of the facts."
A spokesman for Mirage, Alan M. Feldman, interpreted the meetings somewhat differently.
"He's doing what any chief executive should do," Mr. Feldman said, "exploring possible revenues for his state."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Excerpt From a Speech By Vice President Quayle

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by Vice President Dan Quayle at a dinner of the Economic Club of New York yesterday:
As we seek our economic security in this uncertain world, we must learn what works and what doesn't. Let us look at this great city. It attests to what becomes of those who put their faith in the benevolence of the state. In what should be a liberal paradise, what do we find instead? 
 *Honest, ambitious, hard-working New Yorkers struggling to pay the highest local taxes in America, about $1,600 per person.
*A business tax three times greater than that paid by businesses in Chicago and Los Angeles.
*One in every eight people on the dole.
*Taxpayers investing $7,000 a year for each public school student, compared to $3,000 per student in private schools. The taxpayers' investment in education gets a high school graduation rate of 38 percent. That means 62 percent don't finish on time.
Liberal economics may prevail here, but it sure doesn't work here. It's estimated that by 1994, a total of 320,000 private-sector jobs will be lost in New York City. When the taxpayers meekly protest these high taxes, the liberal deep-thinkers snap back that we lack "compassion" for the working man. But the working man is usually the one most hurt by this kind of thinking.
Now I know, it's an election year. And I don't pretend to be entirely nonpartisan. But ladies and gentlemen, I am not appealing to party affiliation. I'm appealing to reason and tragic experience. The liberal vision of a happy, productive and content welfare state hasn't even worked on 22 square miles of the most valuable real estate in the world.
You don't build economic strength by taxing economic strength. If you tax wealth, you diminish wealth. If you diminish wealth, you diminish investment. The fewer the investments, the fewer jobs.
These last few days I've been asked a lot about the message from New Hampshire. The message is simple and direct: The people are fed up with Washington. They're fed up with big government. They're fed up with high taxes. They're fed up with government regulations. And they are fed up with our bad economy. We agree with that message.

HEADLINE: House Budget Panel Backs Shift of $15 Billion From Military

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
A Democratic plan to cut the military budget by about twice as much as the White House wants next year picked up important support today when the House Budget Committee proposed shifting $15 billion from the Pentagon either to domestic programs or to deficit reduction.
The action by the committee embraces a plan for cutting military forces and spending outlined last week by Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee. 
 Mr. Aspin's plan would cut $15 billion, or more than double the $7 billion in reductions that President Bush outlined in his revised $281 billion military budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Over all, Mr. Aspin's plan would cut $91 billion from the military budget by 1997, $48 billion more than the White House has proposed. Mr. Aspin did not specify how the savings should be spent.
 
Pentagon Officials Protest
 In a counterattack, senior Pentagon officials today issued their sharpest criticism of Mr. Aspin's plan.
"Mr. Aspin's budget appears to be merely political, appears to be merely an exercise, and tends to come up with a number that's lower than ours," the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, told reporters.
Despite the Pentagon opposition, the action today sets up a politically attractive package of military budget cuts and increased financing of domestic programs that seems likely to attract widespread support among House Democrats.
The Democratic budget plan would divert Pentagon money to an array of domestic programs, including Head Start pre-school programs, housing, AIDS research and assistance for laid-off workers in the military industry.
In addition to Mr. Aspin and Representative Leon E. Panetta of, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, the proposal has the support of Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House.
 
Revising 1990 Budget Pact
 Any transfer from the Pentagon to domestic spending would require a revision in the 1990 budget agreement that barred the movement of money from military to other programs. That prohibition appears headed for elimination in the House, and the Senate would probably also approve the change. While President Bush has said he opposes the revision, he may not fight it. But he will fight the additional cuts in the Pentagon budget.
Deeper cuts would probably face opposition in the Senate, which has historically supported higher military spending levels. Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, has not offered any alternatives to the Administration's plan, and, in fact, has expressed concern that the White House cut too deeply in programs like the B-2 Stealth bomber and reserve troop levels.
But at a hearing of the Armed Services Comittee today, Mr. Nunn and Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the committee's ranking Republican, challenged the four military service chiefs to re-examine redundant roles and missions in the armed forces.
"Does every service need a legal corps, a medical corps, a dental corps, a chaplains corps, an engineer corps, an acquisition corps?" Mr. Nunn asked. "Can the services specialize more, and provide less overlapping and more complementary capabilities?"
Mr. Nunn asked, for example, if the Army could provide heavy tank support for the Marine Corps, as it did in the Persian Gulf war. Or could the Navy and Air Force consolidate their aircraft development program, and produce a single compatible combat plane, like the old F-4.
Mr. Nunn emphasized that he was only posing the questions and had not reached any conclusions on the issues. But he said that to present a convincing case to Congress and taxpayers, it was important to show "we're not wasting investment on needless duplication."
Senator Warner went further, challenging the service chiefs to justify or eliminate overlapping missions, or else "we'll do it."
The service chiefs responded that they were working to reduce any redundancies, but warned that assigning Army tanks to support marines, for example, would require the Army to maintain additional forces they might otherwise eliminate.
The military chiefs saved their most stinging criticism for Mr. Aspin's plan and other proposals to cut the military's size and budget faster than the Pentagon wants, contending that deeper cuts could jeopardize American security interests and force out thousands of troops from the all-volunteer military.
 
Administration's Plan
 The Administration has proposed a "base force" in 1997 of 12 active Army divisions, 15 active fighter wings, a 450-ship Navy and 1.6 million troops. Mr. Aspin has proposed four alternatives, but the option he prefers would reduce the armed forces to 9 active Army divisions, 10 active fighter wings, 340 ships and 1.4 million troops.
"If we go below the base force, we're taking a major risk in achieving decisive victory," said Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army Chief of Staff.
Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, the Air Force Chief of Staff, agreed and called the proposed military cut "kind of senseless." General McPeak said it "requires great mental chutzpah to think we can meter our size with any great precision."
 
Turmoil in Military
 Each chief had a story of meeting recently with soldiers, pilots or sailors in the field whose careers and families would be thrown into turmoil by deeper budget cuts. The military says its plans would spare massive numbers of forced troop reductions.
Gen. Carl E. Mundy Jr., the Marine Corps Commandant, said: "I've got nowhere else to cut but people. The base force is it." .
Members of Congress have become increasingly sensitive in recent weeks to cutting too deeply and increasing unemployment lines in a recession, and in an election year. House aides said today that Mr. Aspin's proposal for the fiscal year 1993 would spare cuts in active forces.
Senator Nunn has estimated that more than two million military-related jobs will be lost by 1996. In response, Mr. Nunn has proposed allowing military personnel a year's leave to attend college or undertake vocational training to prepare for civilian life. He also supports a plan to increase retirement pay to those in the military who go into teaching and law enforcement.

HEADLINE: New Niche for Moscow Entrepreneurs: Real Estate

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Albert Andonian, a Frenchman who lives half the year in Moscow, stood in the hallway of a two-room apartment and scoffed at the owner's $5,500 selling price.
"The space is badly laid out," he said, and grabbed the kitchen door frame, as if to pull down a partition. He railed that the nearest subway station was not within walking distance. But finally he offered $5,000, in dollars. "I would like this apartment for one of my sons," he said. 
 Emir Bagirov, president of Altair, a new and increasingly busy real estate firm, listened quietly to Mr. Andonian's voluble pitch for a lower price, and turned him down. Later, the broker predicted that the Frenchman, an exporter of Russian-made pipe, would eventually agree to pay the $5,500, then hold the apartment as an investment in the belief that prices are on the rise in a real estate market that has never before existed.
It is a belief that Mr. Bagirov likes to encourage.
 
The Supply and the Demand
 "I have 600 people who want to buy apartments and 20 who want to sell," he said, perhaps exaggerating the demand, as real estate agents tend to do even in Russia, where brokers like the 34-year-old Mr. Bagirov, a former electronics engineer, are new to the trade.
Suddenly, an urban real estate market is emerging, with transactions often taking place in hard currencies. While foreigners like Mr. Andonian are helping to swell the ranks of buyers, a new law, signed last month by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, promises to vastly increase the ranks of the sellers over the next few years.
The law says that people who occupy apartments assigned to them by the state -- most of Moscow's 9 million people -- can be in effect the instant owners by the simple act of registering with the city government and paying a fee of 340 rubles, or about $3.10.
Until last month, apartments had to be purchased from the state, a restriction that played a big role in limiting the supply. Most of the few apartments available had belonged to emigrants, who acquired them from the state, then left them to be sold by real estate agents for the dollars that they needed in Israel, Europe or the United States.
Now, a Russian family's home can also become its chief source of wealth, much as the homes of Americans are. Playing on this theme, real estate agents exhort people through newspaper advertisements and flyers tacked up in lobbies to register their apartments and offer them for sale.
"Take an elderly woman with a pension of 420 rubles a month who needs 2,000 rubles to live," Mr. Bagirov said. "She can sell her apartment for 500,000 rubles [$5,000], move in with her sister or her children and live like a queen." And Mr. Bagirov can collect a standard 5 percent commission.
Despite the quick-money lure, Moscovites seem to be holding back, though there are no statistics yet. The big concern is that their costs will rise. Instead of paying less than 100 rubles a month to the state for rent, utilities and repairs, they fear, the Government will hit them with property taxes. And repairs could prove costly. There is also the unresolved question of who pays for major repairs or maintenance in a building where some apartments are owned by individuals, some by the state.
"They'll wait to see what happens," said Boris Pinsker, a Russian economist. "You can tell everyone that they now own their apartments, but that won't change their mode of living. Unless they want to move, they don't need to be owners and so they won't register. They can just as easily be renters."
This reluctance is undoubtedly helping to sustain prices, which range up to $200,000 for a six- or seven-room downtown apartment in an older, high-ceilinged building.
 
The Geometry of Living
 Many of the available apartments are occupied by several families. To get the families out, brokers purchase small apartments in less expensive neighborhoods to offer in exchange to each family.
"They get the privacy of separate apartments, and in exchange the families turn over to us the big apartment, which is worth more in cash than all the small ones we trade for it," said Aleksandr Savevenko, who heads the Moscow Central Real Estate Exchange, which pools the capital of several brokers.
After renovation, some downtown apartments are sold to wealthy Russians, a group that is growing in number. Most, however, go either to foreign companies, which use them as office space in a city short of commercial buildings, or to foreign individuals, who use them as homes.
That presents another problem that Mr. Savevenko and other realtors happily offer to solve: Foreign companies can legally own apartments; foreign individuals cannot.
 
The Citizenship of Owners
 "I think that foreigners will be given the right to buy apartments when a surplus appears on the market," said Yevgeny Kandaurov, assistant to the chairman of the State Property Fund, which supervises the privatization.
Meanwhile, the brokers get around the prohibition by registering an individual's apartment in a company's name or in the name of a Russian citizen. Sometimes a joint venture is formed to purchase an apartment.
As Mr. Savevenko described the procedure, a brokerage firm becomes the Russian partner in a 50-50 joint venture with the foreigner. After the purchase, the firm sells its 50 percent to the foreigner, who then becomes the sole owner of the apartment, which remains registered as a joint venture.
"We arrange all the documents and handle all the paperwork," Mr. Savevenko said.
Beyond finding ways to sell apartments to foreigners, the brokers have another headache: finding the right price. In so small a market, prices for similar apartments vary widely. Often quoted in dollars rather than rubles, they range from $300 to $1,300 a square meter (about 11 square feet).
A telephone survey of half-a-dozen people who had offered their apartments for sale through newspaper ads showed that prices often were set on the basis of phone conversations with other Moscovites who had placed ads.
But some pricing guidelines are emerging: distance from the center of the city, whether the building's exterior is brick or drab concrete, the distance from a subway.
Partly to gauge the right price, brokers have organized auctions as their main marketplace. Rather than take prospective buyers to see apartments, as Mr. Bagirov did with Mr. Andonian, they offer the apartments at auctions attended by brokers who represent buyers. One such auction takes place every Tuesday in a rented art gallery.
The auctioneer, Aleksandr Sashen, dressed in a cutaway morning suit, began the proceedings on a recent Tuesday by lighting a thick white candle in a bronze candlestick, a bit of instant tradition thought up by the brokers to give the auction atmosphere.
 
Going! Going! Still Going!
 Some 200 brokers, about 30 percent of them women, sat quietly on folding chairs as the offerings were flashed on a bank of television screens. They had received mimeographed lists of the offerings, and some brokers had visited some of the apartments. Other brokers, the majority, sat quietly through the proceedings. They had come not to bid but, as several said, to get a feel for price levels.
A two-room apartment was offered for 4.5 million rubles, about $45,000. No one bid. Neither were there any bidders for a two-room apartment on the city outskirts, with telephone, at 2 million rubles, nor for a two-room apartment downtown for 5 million.
"Are there any bidders?" Mr. Sashen asked, never raising his voice nor pitching an apartment's virtues. The unsold apartments might be offered again at a future auction at a lower price. Or the sellers might wait until the Yeltsin Government cancels a new 28 percent sales tax. (The auction prices included the tax.)
Finally, there was a buyer for a three-room, centrally located apartment offered for $25,000, with Mr. Sashen announcing a stipulation from the anonymous seller: There had to be at least one bid above the $25,000 minimum. The apartment went for $26,000.
Another apartment was also sold, and two others were leased, before Mr. Sashen doused the candle with his fingers and the auction recessed.
"The idea of the candle," he explained, "is that when it goes out, the auction must end. But so far there have not been enough properties offered to use up a candle."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The South;
For Southerners, Issues Go Beyond the Economy

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 27

 BODY:
At the County Cork Pub, the owner, Art Fessenden, says the economy is probably Topic A when people think about politics, but it is not topic A, B and C the way it was in New Hampshire.
"You have people here, middle management people, that have been hit very hard, but I don't think the economy is the only thing they're thinking about," he said. 
 As the Presidential primaries head South, to a region where both a good war and good manners count, the contests that will dominate Presidential politics for the next two weeks are already being shaped by cultural and character issues, regional ties, the Persian Gulf War and race. The Southern primaries begin Tuesday in Georgia, move on to South Carolina on March 7 and culminate March 10 with Super Tuesday elections in Texas, Florida, and five other Southern states or states that border the South.
 
A Diverse Region
 The contrast with the angry, economically driven politics of New Hampshire says as much about the soul of the South as it does about its economy, political analysts say.
It is dangerous to generalize about a region where South Florida, the Mississippi Delta and the Texas Oil Patch have about as much in common as Moscow, Las Vegas and Beirut. Economic conditions vary considerably in the region. And the notion of the South as a political land apart, particularly within party primaries, died decades ago.
"I don't think the candidates are going to preach a gospel that's any different in the South than any place else," said James Cobb, a history professor at the University of Tennessee. "Southern politics have become more nationalized, and national politics have become Southernized."
Certainly, some economic concerns are national.
"The economy is very much the 800-pound gorilla everywhere," said Alan Secrest, a Democratic poll-taker and consultant, who often worked with candidates in the South.
 
More Stable Economy
 But no state in the South has an economy that has been whipsawed the way New Hampshire has been. Between December 1990 and December 1991, non-farm employment in New Hampshire fell by 3.2 percent, a percentage drop exceeded only by New York and Connecticut. In the Southern states where primaries are scheduled, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi saw modest job gains; Georgia had the largest employment decline in the region, but at 1.8 percent that decline was half as severe as New Hampshire.
"New Hampshire went from first to worst, and that's why the economy was so important for them," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. "The economy's not going to be forgotten, but it's not as extreme a picture here."
Dr. Ratajczak said the closest thing to New Hampshire's economic roller coaster can be found in Virginia, Georgia and Florida. "There you have the same thing to a smaller extent," he said. "You had states that were outperforming the national average and then we fell into a recession and performed at the same dismal average as the nation as whole."
In Atlanta, for example, a survey of local residents a year ago found that 65 percent were satisfied with economic conditions. The same survey recently found 29 percent were satisfied.
 
Mixed Battleground
 In the two main Super Tuesday battlegrounds, the picture is also mixed. In Florida, the unemployment rate jumped to 7.3 percent in December 1991 from 5.5 percent in December 1990, a percentage increase that exceeded New Hampshire in the same period. In Texas, unemployment was almost unchanged in the same period, increasing to 6.7 percent from 6.5 percent.
"Texas ranked first among the top 15 states in job growth during the recession," said Ray Perryman, an economic consultant and economist in residence at Baylor University. "I don't think the economy will be as dominant here was it was in New Hampshire."
Still, he said economics could still play a role in a somewhat different way. On the Democratic side, a familiarity with energy issues is considered important, a factor that could work for Gov. Bill Clinton from the neighboring energy-producing state of Arkansas.
On the Republican side, few doubt that President Bush's longtime ties to Texas and his ability to direct Federal resources toward the state will be a major economic consideration in the race.
 
Some Deep Concerns
 For many Southerners, particularly those most directly affected, the economic concerns may be as deep as they were in New Hampshire.
"I'm looking at the candidates to see their stance on health care and the economy," said Karen Fort, a caterer in New Orleans, who is struggling to keep alive the catering business she started after losing her job in the computer industry.
But, for most Southerners, the region's historic poverty takes the edge off the current downturn.
"We don't seem as mad, maybe because our fall has not been as far as other parts of the country," said Allie Mack, a political science professor at Jackson State University in Mississippi. "Things were pretty bad here before the latest downturn in the economy. We here in the South have a long history of adjusting fairly well to bad times with few complaints and groans."
Thus, the economy may be the gorilla, but it may not be the voting issue, some analysts say. Instead, if there is one thing that does define politics in the South it is that personal and cultural factors often outweigh anything else.
"Our voters respond to personality, to emotional appeals," said Natalie Davis, a political science professor at Birmingham Southern College in Alabama. "We don't like to get too detailed. Image is more important than substance. We vote for people we like."
 
Raising Cultural Topics
 But the effects of cultural and personality issues can be a lot more difficult to calculate than economic ones.
For instance, Patrick J. Buchanan has shifted the focus of his challenge to President Bush in the South, moving from the economic message he hammered at in New Hampshire to one freighted with cultural issues, like advertisements that accuse Mr. Bush of supporting investing tax dollars in "pornographic and blasphemous art."
But it is not enough to raise the right issues in the South. You have to raise them in the right way. And many here question whether Mr. Buchanan's bare-knuckles approach will appeal to Southern Republicans.
"I read something the other day that Northerners enjoy arguing as a kind of sport," said Professor Cobb of the University of Tennessee. "For Southerners, it's a prelude to shooting each other. His personality may be too pugnacious; he doesn't have many of the kind of personal qualities I think Southern white voters would be inclined to appreciate."
On the Democratic side, that same instinct obviously works for Governor Clinton, who never fails to mention in the South that it is nice to be back in a region where he is the only one who does not speak with an accent. But Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska is already trying to make Mr. Clinton's draft history an issue in a way he did not in New Hampshire. And throughout the South, in a way that has the potential to work for President Bush and against Mr. Clinton, the victory in the Persian Gulf war lingers as much as any place else in the country.
 
Issue of Race
 And then there is race. It is a stark view of how much the South has changed and how much it has remained the same.
In the primaries, with Democrats all courting black voters and Republicans seldom disagreeing on racial issues, race is seldom an issue the way it always is in the general elections, but it is still an inescapable part of Southern politics.
For the Democrats it comes out in the degree to which any credible candidate has to appeal to black voters. With Mr. Clinton having a head start on enlisting the support of prominent blacks in the region, Mr. Kerrey and Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, made earnest efforts this week to draw attention to endorsements by lesser-known black officials.
 
Chance of a Renewed Fight
 For the Republicans, there is always the chance of refighting the region's racial battles. Mr. Buchanan has already raised the issue of racial quotas, saying President Bush caved in by signing the Civil Rights bill last year. Many think the issue is likely to continue.
"Pat is more Southern than many white Southerners when it comes to race," said Hodding Carter 3d, the Southern journalist and author and former official in Jimmy Carter's Administration. "I think he's going to play that card hard, and if he doesn't he's a fool. As long as he's painted and is happy to be painted as an extremist, he might as well take advantage of it.."
Still, Mr. Carter says Mr. Buchanan faces a rough road because of another cultural value: the degree to which Southerners tend to respect authority and the office of the President. Despite George Wallace's old plea for voter to "send them a message," Mr. Carter said Southern voters, particularly those likely to vote in the Republican primary, are less likely to follow that path than were voters in New Hampshire.
"You tend to go more with the established leadership in the South," Mr. Carter said. "That's just a fact. It's got to be really bad times to mobilize a revolt against those already in authority."

HEADLINE: Dow Down 13.87; Small-Stock Activity Is Brisk

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday, with blue-chip issues down moderately and the broad market holding onto firm gains resulting from strong buying in some technology and biotechnology issues.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 13.87 points to finish at 3,269.45, with Walt Disney, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and Caterpillar being the big losers among the Dow stocks. 
 Harry W. Laubscher, the senior vice president-market analyst at Tucker Anthony, said Wednesday's bond rally gave the market a short-term "buy" signal that should keep it stable.
The stocks that have had significant consolidations have come down enough in price to be attractive to buyers. "We should have about a week of rising market," Mr. Laubscher said. "This week's batch of econmic data has painted a mixed picture, and investors need more data to determine if the economy is rebounding."
Also waiting is the Federal Reserve, to see if another cut in interest rates is necessary.
The weekly jobless claims report, as well as the data on a 1.5 percent decline in January existing-home sales, did not induce a market reaction or derail investor hopes of an economic turnaround, analysts said.
"You can expect the market to experience nearby strength into next week," Mr. Laubscher said. "But with valuations now at extreme lines, higher prices are not likely to hold for long.
"The action of I.B.M., off 1/2, to 87 3/4, gives us a good clue to the market's real health."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 215.1 million shares, down from 241.5 million on Wednesday. The number of gaining issues held a slight advantage over losing ones, 912 to 810, even as the Big Board composite slipped 0.48 point, to 228.75.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped to 413.86, down 1.49 points, while the American Stock Exchange index gained 2.12, to 416.09.
Trading on the Nasdaq was brisk, as investors focused on some of the technology and biotech issues. The activity moved the composite index up 1.55 points, to 633.95, and the Russell 2,000 index of smaller company stocks up 0.81 point, to 211.01.
Walt Disney was down 1 5/8, to 154 1/8; 3M 1 3/8, to 91 3/4, and Caterpillar 1 1/4, to 49 1/8.
 
CUC Up to $34.50
 Elsewhere, CUC International, a computerized consumer-services company, rose by 2 1/2, to 34 1/2, as Keith Mullins, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, began his coverage of the company with a "buy" rating.
Disappointing fourth-quarter results on Wednesday by Oshkosh B'Gosh, caused the stock price to drop by 1 and finish at 28 1/4 yesterday. The apparel marker reported a loss equal to 3 cents a share, after a restructuring charge of 25 cents.
Favorable data released by Gensia Pharamceuticals about its cardiovascular drug, Arasine, sent the stock price climbing only a week after rumors that the report would be negative moved the stock down. Yesterday, it rose 12 1/2, to 62.
McDonnell Douglas was off 1 1/4, to 65 3/4. Michael Rosen, another Smith Barney analyst, downgraded the stock to "hold," from "speculative buy." Traders said Mr. Rosen said he did not see any more short-term events that would raise the stock.
Concern over slow growth may have been behind Goldman, Sachs's lowering of the 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates of Conagra, the Omaha-based food company. The stock was down 2 1/2, to 28, in active trading.
Warner-Lambert said yesterday that the Food and Drug Administration had raised issues that questioned whether it would receive approval of a version of its cholesterol-lowering drug, Lopid SR. The drug company's stock fell 3 7/8, to 65.
Wal-Mart, after reporting strong fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, rose 7/8, to 54 3/4, earning the attention of a number of analysts that gave the stock a favorable rating or increased their earnings estimates. According to some analysts, the company's stock has lagged behind other retailers'.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Democrats Are Divided, And Not Only on Taxes

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
House Democrats were divided today, not only on taxes the leadership was able to eke out only a 12-vote victory -- but on the leadership. While some members resented what they considered arm-twisting, others said the leadership's get-out-the vote effort was wimpy, a reflection of why the Democratic-controlled Congress has been taking it on the chin.
"Pressure around here is the Speaker asking: 'Are you going to vote for this bill? Oh, no? Why not? Oh, that's O.K.,' " complained Representative John Bryant, Democrat of Texas. "That's why nothing happens around here. The Speaker should say, 'This bill is important to me -- I need your vote.' " 
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, spent the last three days on the telephone, warning their fellow Democrats that failure to pass a tax bill would be yet another sign of Congressional impotence on a matter of critical concern to their economically hard-pressed constituents. "The leaders are saying: 'Chaos will kill us. We have to pass something,' " said Representative Brian J. Donnelly, Democrat of Massachusetts.
It did not always work. Representative Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, voted against the bill despite what he called arm-twisting. "The Democratic bill will balloon the deficit," Mr. Hamilton said. "There will be an enormous loss of revenue."
Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, also cited a "good government" reason for voting no. "I got a call from Gephardt on the importance of party unity," he said. "I'm sensitive to the need for party unity, but good policy is always the best politics."
 
Not Like Haberdashery
 For many Democrats who voted yes, it was a hold-your-nose ballot. Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who was working for the floor for the bill, said that "People are saying, 'I can support it, but I don't like it.' "
In a floor speech, Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, recalled a New York department store advertisement that he said provided a metaphor for today's debate. "Barneys used to have an ad: 'You can select, you don't have to settle,' " he said. "Unhappily, taxes are not like men's haberdashery. Here we have to settle."
President Bush, of course, thinks he does not have to. He has threatened to veto this bill if it reaches his desk, and he has a perfect record when his confrontations with Congress reached that stage. Mr. Bush has vetoed 25 bills since he took office. Each has been sustained.
 
Congress's Self-Bashing
 Congress-bashing is by no means limited to the White House or, if public opinion polls and term-limit amendments are an accurate reflection of voter sentiment, to the voters. During the tax debate, both Democratic and Republican representatives joined in.
"How can America return to greatness if Congress continues to vote on bills that are at best half good and half bad?" asked Representative James A. Traficant Jr., Democrat of Ohio. "Where I come from, half good and half bad is mediocre. The problem with our country is we have enacted mediocre laws and we have a mediocre economy and we have a mediocre Congress that leads a mediocre Government."
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said: "People are angry at Congress. They see this body as out of touch, as incompetent, and I tell them, 'If you are not angry now, democracy is brain dead.' "
 
Participation Lacking
 Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, bemoaned the sparse attendance in the House chamber during most of the tax debate. He recalled that in an earlier time, when legislation was negotiated on the House floor, "it required that every member be present." He continued: "But in the end, we had a product in which all of us were participants. We don't have that today."
Instead, the Republican bill was drafted by the White House, and the Democratic bill was drafted by the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee and modified by the Democratic caucus. The House members were given prepackaged choices.
Indeed, sometimes the reaction goes beyond the deploring stage to outright rejection of the prepackaging. The long labors of the fall of 1990 eventually produced a budget agreement, but not before the House turned down the so-called budget summit's White House-leadership compromise.
Mostly, Republican leaders took a low-key approach to this bill. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, noted that "we need 146 votes to sustain a veto." He continued, "We're telling our people, 'Don't breathe heavy; we'll be back for a real bill.' " Given Mr. Michel's capsule history of how legislation has come to be written, it was not clear exactly what Mr. Gingrich had in mind, or for when.
 
House Floor Debut
 Resplendent in a red-and-yellow-checked suit, Jamie Cooper, 10 months old, made his debut on the House floor today, resting in his father's lap during the debate on the tax bill.
"I want him to learn good habits, but this is a tough place to learn good habits, especially when we're doing a tax bill," said Representative Cooper, who was baby-sitting, with bottles of baby formula in the pockets of his dark blue suit.
"Jamie has shaken a few hands and been kissed by a few people," Mr. Cooper said, adding, "I hope he hasn't gotten anything contagious."

Stock Sale Is Planned At Domino's

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Tom Monaghan, the entrepreneur who owns Domino's Pizza Inc., has decided to sell stock in his company to the public later this year, the company said today.
Accordingly, Mr. Monaghan, who now serves as Domino's president, is cleaning up Domino's balance sheet to make the company more attractive to investors by writing off bad loans and selling Domino's assets not related to pizza. 
 Mr. Monaghan also plans to sell the Detroit Tigers baseball team, which he owns separately from Domino's.
While Mr. Monaghan, who owns 98 percent of Domino's, initially expects to retain majority ownership and remain as president, the offering could make the pizza chain one of the largest publicly owned fast-food operations in the nation, smaller than McDonald's but in the same league with Wendy's in terms of capitalization, said John McDevitt, the chief financial officer of Domino's, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich.
The decision to take Domino's public and sell the baseball team was motivated by "estate planning considerations," said Mike Jenkins, a Domino's spokesman. Mr. Monaghan, who declined to be interviewed, is married, has four daughters and is 54 years old. Two years ago, he put Domino's up for sale for $1.2 billion but got no takers.
Goldman, Sachs & Company, Domino's investment bank, is advising Mr. Monaghan on the sale of his stock. Mr. McDevitt said that Goldman, Sachs and the NBD Corporation, which owns the holding company for Detroit's biggest commercial bank, would handle the sale of the Tigers.
Among those who have said they are interested in buying the team are Edsel Ford 2d, a Ford Motor Company executive and son of the late Henry Ford 2d; Keith E. Crain of Crain Communications Inc., a publishing company that owns Advertising Age, Automotive News and business weeklies in several cities, and Joel Ferguson, a real estate developer and businessman in Lansing, Mich.
All three men have said separately that they are interested in buying the team, but Mr. Ford and Mr. Crain did not return telephone calls today; Mr. Ferguson could not be reached.
 
Favorable Environment
 Analysts say the market environment for restaurant stocks was favorable. Shares in restaurant companies are generally performing well, and chains that offer low-priced, good- value meals are relatively recession-proof, one analyst said.
Still, many questions remain about Domino's. Michael G. Mueller, a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said he would be curious to know Domino's strategy for long-term growth in the intensely competitive pizza business. More fast-food companies are offering pizza, including McDonald's in many of its outlets, and fancy pizza is also growing in popularity, he said.
"There's a pretty big proliferaiton of higher-quality pizza operators," Mr. Mueller said.
Mr. Jenkins said "a lot of people have been saying we must be in some kind of financial trouble" to consider selling stock. "But nothing could be further from the truth," he said.
 
Loss Is Expected
 Because of the write-off of $41 million of bad debt, which has been carried on Domino's books for several years, the company expects to post a $48 million pretax loss on revenue of $1.7 billion for 1991. On an operating basis, however, Domino's is profitable, Mr. Jenkins said.
"We sold 12 million more pizzas last year than in 1990, but there was a lot of discounting," he said, adding that about half the pizzas sold last year were discounted.
Domino's has more serious competition now in the pizza delivery business, the niche where it dominates the national market. Pizza Hut, a unit of Pepsico Inc. that mainly operates restaurants, last year branched into the delivery business.
With many customers seeming to prefer Pizza Hut's recipe, Domino's in recent months has been putting more cheese and more toppings on its pizzas and heavily promoting its new recipe.
"Our market tests show that consumers preferred our hand-tossed pizza to their hand-tossed," Mr. Jenkins said, adding that Domino's product costs slightly less. Domino's contends that Pizza Hut has not gained market share despite spending aggressively to expand home delivery.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Claims Up 7,000 From Previous Week

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits climbed to 459,000 for the week ending Feb. 15, the second straight week claims have increased, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said claims rose by 7,000 from the previous week, putting them at their highest point since mid-January. 
 The increase was led by higher claim applications in Texas and Oklahoma. States reporting the biggest decreases in claims were Michigan and California.
Analysts had been expecting claims to fall during the week, in part because unemployment offices in several states were open one less day in observance of Washington's Birthday.
 
Claims Near 450,000 Mark
 The four-week average for claims remained near the 450,000 mark, where it has been for some time. Economists said that served to underscore the seriousness of the country's unemployment problems.
Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said on the basis of information known now, he expects the jobless rate to rise to 7.2 percent or 7.3 percent in February. It has been stuck at a recession high of 7.1 percent for the last two months.
"You open the papers every morning and you find more people being laid off," he said. "You don't read stories about people being hired. We can't have an economic recovery with jobless claims sticking around the 450,000 mark."
Robert Brusca, an economist at Nikko Securities in New York, said jobless claims were remaining at recession levels because the anemic economic growth that was occurring was not enough to take care of new workers entering the labor market.
"We aren't getting enough growth in the economy to reduce the unemployment rate," he said. "It is still rising and when that is happening, that is still a recession."
Mr. Brusca said he was looking for the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, to actually fall by 1.5 percent in the current January-March quarter.
He predicted growth would resume in the spring. But he said he was looking for the unemployment rate to continue climbing to around 7.5 percent because it would take some time for companies to start hiring back workers.

Gold Prices Rise on News Of Big Purchase in London

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold led a rally of precious metals futures yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York on news of a large gold purchase by Middle Eastern interests.
Gold futures climbed $4.40 after news of the purchase in London of about 300,000 ounces of gold. Prices eased a bit toward the close of trading. 
 A weaker dollar and heavy fund buying of silver futures also helped precious metals, said James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc. in New York.
Gold futures for March delivery settled $4.20 higher at $353.90 an ounce; March silver was 4.2 cents higher at $4.103 an ounce.
The interest in gold yesterday was a turnaround from recent sluggish activity in the market, which has seen futures traded in a narrow range. Gold prices had fallen to $348 an ounce in foreign markets and attracted buyers, Mr. Steel said.
The cost of producing gold is estimated at about $325 to $330 an ounce.
Mr. Steel said the lack of recent interest in gold was a result of ample supplies and the fact that there was no inflationary pressure to spark prices.
"There is no speculative reason for funds to come in and buy the market," he said. "There is no reason for gold to go over $360 a troy ounce. So it is trapped in a thin trading range."
Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange as crude oil futures rose on trade buying and because of support from gasoline.
 
Heavy Buying of Gasoline
 Heavy refiner buying of gasoline on the Gulf Coast sent gasoline futures soaring, according to traders. An increase in refinery runs, and Tuesday's report of a drawdown in gasoline stocks, also helped to lift gasoline futures.
Crude oil for April delivery was 29 cents higher at $18.75 a barrel; March heating oil was 0.37 cent higher at 51.24 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline was 1.71 cents higher at 56.28 cents a gallon; April natural gas was 2.4 cents lower, at $1.156 for thousand cubic feet.
Grain and soybean futures were mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders prepared for deliveries against March contracts.
Wheat futures declined on fund liquidations. Profit taking also took its toll on the March contract after Wednesday's sharp gains.
But the July contract gained on concerns about the condition of the winter wheat crop. Farmers in Illinois and Indiana are reporting they will plow under some of their wheat crop because of damage caused by an early fall freeze, said William Biedermann, an analyst at Allendale Inc. in Chicago.

Dollar Falls Amid Reports Showing a Weak Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday, weakened by unfavorable economic news that suggested United States interest rates could decline further.
Money traders said a primary force weakening the dollar was a series of economic reports in the last few days that painted a mixed picture of the United States economy at best. 
 The pessimism was reinforced yesterday by a real estate trade group's report that sales of existing homes fell 1.5 percent in January, and by the Labor Department's report that claims for jobless benefits rose in mid-February.
United States economic weakness implies that interest rates will fall, making dollar-denominated investments worth less and in turn hurting the dollar's value.
Some money traders said they also sold dollars because of partisan wrangling over how to stimulate the economy. The House rejected President Bush's tax plan in favor of a rival Democratic proposal aimed largely at raising taxes on the rich and cutting middle-class taxes. Mr. Bush has vowed to veto such a measure.
"We were reminded that we have some fiscal problems from our weaker-than-expected numbers," said Zlatko Glamuzina, head currency trader for the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch.
But traders said no clear direction for the dollar was established and it stayed within a relatively narrow range. Some said underlying demand for dollars was likely to push it higher over the next few days.
"The dollar looks a bit anemic at these levels," said John McCarthy, chief dealer for the New York branch of Agemene Banc Nederland.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 129.35 Japanese yen, from 129.73 yen Wednesday. Later, in London, it fetched 129.45 yen and in New York it fetched 129.00 yen, down from 129.20 Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7550, from $1.7460 late Wednesday. Later, in New York, the pound fetched $1.7645, more expensive than its $1.7550 value Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.6345 German marks, down from 1.6452; 1.4805 Swiss francs, down from 1.4935; 1.1783 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1789; 5.5555 French francs, down from 5.5920, and 1,226.00 Italian lire, down from 1,234.75.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Failure Looming For Trade Talks

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
A failure of trade negotiations under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is looming -- primarily as a result of the refusal of France to cut its agricultural subsidies and the inability of France's partners in the European Community to persuade the French to compromise.
But many Europeans blame the United States for the impasse. Jacques Delors, who heads the European Commission, accuses the Americans of "not budging because they think they can divide the Europeans, and they are wrong about that." 
 The Bush Administration regards cuts in agricultural export subsidies crucial to a successful conclusion of the trade negotiations. Julius L. Katz, the United States deputy trade negotiator, interviewed shortly before he took off Wednesday for Europe, said the United States has gone as far as it could toward a compromise on farm subsidies.
The Administration, he said, has now accepted the package of proposals offered by Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of GATT. These include a 36 percent cut in farm subsidies, in budgetary terms, over the next six years, from its original proposal to eliminate farm export subsidies completely. The Dunkel proposal, Mr. Katz said, would mean "no more than a 25 percent cut" in the physical volume of subsidized farm exports.
Ambassador Katz said he had "speculated out loud" about the possibility of removing agriculture from the Uruguay Round to save the rest of its agreements. But such a solution is impossible, because many nations, even more dependent on agricultural exports than the United States, will not accept smaller cuts in Europe's farm subsidies. Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and other agricultural exporting countries have accepted the Dunkel proposals. But the French, Mr. Katz said, "are still saying no to Dunkel."
There is widespread concern, among American and Japanese business executives, that Europe is turning inward. With the end of the cold war and the Soviet threat, many Europeans think the United States is losing its importance in the world economy.
"If America's decline hardens into reality, Europe will suffer," Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, writes in his new book "Millennium." Mr. Attali, a close adviser to President Francois Mitterrand of France, adds, "But, if Western Europe is able to link Eastern Europe with its development, an integrated Europe has a chance to assume the role of the center of the world economy. It will then be able to develop as the most populated, the richest and the most creative center in the world.
"If not, the new center will likely be Japan, for that island nation combines the necessary conditions for attracting global monetary, industrial and even cultural power."
Yet many of Japan's government and business leaders, keenly aware of how vital open world markets have been to their own development, are worried about how a failure of the Uruguay Round would damage the Japanese economy. But with its weak political leadership now worsened by the scandals linking Japanese gangsters to some highly placed politicians, the Liberal Democratic Government, afraid of losing the farm vote -- and especially that of the rice farmers -- is doing next to nothing to help rescue the Uruguay Round.
"Japan is a sideline player," Mr. Katz said. "Japan is always playing a waiting game. You'd think they'd be in the forefront, given what they have at stake."
Some Japanese officials, however, are starting to speak out. Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said last week that Japan would be left on the sidelines of the world economy if it refused to lift its ban on rice imports. And he told a parliamentary panel that Japan would be held responsible if the Uruguay Round failed.
The United States itself is being accused by its GATT partners, and even its free-trade partners in Canada, of sliding toward protectionism because of election-year pressures from the Democrats and industrialists and workers hit by the recession. Mr. Bush's trip to Japan, accompanied by the chief executives of the Big Three auto companies, is offered as Exhibit A in the Administration's drift toward managed trade.
Ambassador Katz denies this, declaring that he has never known any President so committed to open trade and so willing to get into the trade issue.
Will the Uruguay Round fail? "I have swung from optimism to pessimism and am now neither optimistic nor pessimistic," Mr. Katz said.
He said his "honest answer" was that the Europeans and the United States were now very close to an agreement, though France is the linchpin. "Even if the talks fail," he added, "it won't be the end of the world. It won't be Armageddon."
But many businessmen and economists fear that a failure to make a trade deal now would start a process of deterioration that would aggravate a growing split into rival trade blocs and inflict new hardships on the world economy. The irony is that a relatively small number of high-cost farmers in France and Japan may wreck a global trading system from which vast numbers have benefited.

HEADLINE: Home Resale Pace Is Down

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell 1.5 percent in January, the first decline in four months, a real estate trade group said today. The Midwest posted the only regional gain.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.22 million, down from 3.27 million in December. 
 The realtors attributed the drop to rising mortgage rates and also said the beginning of the year was a slow time for home sales.
But Dorcas T. Helfant, the association's president, said sales in January were up 12.6 percent from the same month a year earlier. She added that a national survey in early February showed a substantial increase in contracts signed for closing later this year.
The survey results hint that a nationwide jump in activity could come as early as the spring, she said.
After falling 2.5 percent in September, existing-home sales advanced for three straight months including a 2.1 percent gain in December.
But according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rates rose from 8.23 percent at the beginning of January to 8.68 percent at the end of the month.
The median price of a previously owned home was $102,300 in January, up 2 percent from December and 6.3 percent from January 1991. The median means half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
The Midwest posted the only gain in sales. The annual rate of 920,000 units was 8.2 percent above that of December and 21.1 percent more than a year earlier.
Sales in the Northeast were unchanged at 490,000 units, but up 19.5 percent from January 1991.
But sales dropped 7.3 percent in the South, to a 1.14 million rate, although they were 4.6 percent above those of a year earlier.
Sales fell 5.6 percent in the West, to 670,000 units. Still, the rate was 11.7 percent above that of January 1991.

HEADLINE: A Selection of Culinary Oases For Department-Store Wanderers

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
FINALLY, the coast is clear. President's Day sales are over. Christmas is long past, and every last pesky unwanted gift has been returned.
Serious weekend shoppers are sighing with relief. No more dodging dawdlers on the escalators of New York City's department stores and clothing emporiums. No more wishing for copies of The National Enquirer at the cash-register lines. And, most important, no more taking a number to get something to eat at one of the restaurants that appear amid the shoes or luggage like friendly St. Bernards. 
 The restaurants are crucial, because it is part of every serious shopper's strategy to recharge at just the right moment. For an all-day assault, this moment occurs just as the morning flush of energy fades, but before the descent into irredeemable fatigue begins. Eat too soon, and early efficiency is lost. Too late, and the energy for a second wave of purchasing will not reach critical mass.
A shopper's restaurant needs are therefore elemental: relieve hunger, slake thirst, rest legs, restore energy. And good department-store restaurants are like the best corner men in the boxing business, who will do whatever is necessary to patch their man together and send him back into the ring. However beaten down you are by the price of overcoats, however battered you are by the search for the perfect birthday gift, it is the mission of the restaurant to keep you standing for a full 15 rounds of shopping.
Recognizing this, most department-store restaurants in Manhattan have come a long way from the old days, when they were little more than dairy bars, places for a quiet cup of soup or an ice cream cone for the children. Most of the stores listed here offer full meals, many offer wine and beer, some offer a selection of restaurants to choose from. A couple, like 745 Cafe in Bergdorf Goodman for Men or Le Cafe in Barneys New York, stack up well against any other similarly priced restaurants in their neighborhoods. All offer serious shoppers the best dessert imaginable: more shopping.
 
Barneys New York
Seventh Avenue at 17th Street, (212) 929-9000.
LE CAFE, lower level: Barneys New York is filled with men and women in desperate need of distraction from the specter of what they can't afford. And Le Cafe, a clattering open well just a curving marble staircase beneath the ground-level women's department, is one of the few places in the store that has taken note of the 1990's retreat from exorbitance.
The service is cafeteria-style, with an array of daily specials from which to choose. Men still wearing their padded Italian jackets from the So Hip It Hurts era, and model-like women wearing all manner of last year's hound's tooth, line up, choosing from among such fashionably homey fare as meat loaf with mashed potatoes, baked ziti and chicken salad. Luckily, the meat loaf ($12.95) is as smart as a double-breasted blazer, the chicken salad in a pungent cilantro vinaigrette ($14.95) as bright as a red bow tie. There is also an attracTive array of salads and pastas.
There is an espresso machine, Pilsner Urquell and Samuel Adams beers, Perrier-Jouet Champagne and a selection of ports and sherries. Accessorizing, as every tight-budget fashion plate knows, is the secret.
(Fridays 10 A.M. to 7:30 P.M., Saturdays 10 A.M. to 6:30 P.M, Sundays 10:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.)
 
Henri Bendel
712 Fifth Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 247-1100.
SALON DE THE, second floor: As fitting for a store whose first name is Henri, the restaurant is called the Salon de The. This salon has two parts: an airy balcony overlooking some of the best-dressed shoppers in New York, and a cramped, bright hothouse of a room -- which is not so bad on an icy winter day. The smart wooden tables are equipped with real flowers and shelves for stashing handbags and other bundles, but there is barely enough space to squeeze a shoebox between tables.
Sandwiches and salads are the basic ingredients here, good for ruminating over the collection of eccentric and ornate teapots that line the walls, and for other important questions. Like, why are the lunchers considerably less well dressed than the other shoppers? The bread and rolls are dense and fresh, fine for straightforward sandwiches like the chicken breast with lettuce, tomato and avocado ($10.50). A salade Nicoise ($11.50) was beautifully presented but dull, like an out-of-season veneer from a tanning salon. Pastries ($4.50) are by Guy Pascal.
(Fridays and Saturdays 10 A.M. to 6:30 P.M.; Sundays noon to 6 P.M.)
 
Bergdorf Goodman
754 Fifth Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 753-7300.
CAFE VIENNA, seventh floor: As appropriate to this frothy store, customers are lured to the konditorie-like Cafe Vienna by the promise of dessert, chocolate and whipped cream. The quaint, carved tabletops are close enough for eavesdropping, no small boon for the single shopper.
There is a small array of salads and inviting sandwiches, including grilled ham and gruyere ($8.95) and chicken, bacon and avocado on pumpernickel ($9.95), but dessert is the thing.
The orange coffee cake was dry, but the chocolate mousse cake with raspberry sauce was dense and rich ($4.50 each) and perfectly accompanied by a mocha-cappuccino with whipped cream ($4).
(Fridays and Saturdays, 11:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.; closed Sundays.)
 
Bergdorf Goodman for Men
745 Fifth Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 339-3326.
745 CAFE, third floor: The round, windowed capsule of a room reverberates with the voices of those who have discovered this inexpensive and congenial haven. The leather banquettes, marble tables and wood-and-leather chairs fit as easily as a classic sack suit, and are as welcoming.
Many of the patrons look as if they beat a path here without stopping to look at the Burberrys or Armanis, and with good reason. The food is fresh, flavorful and creatively prepared. Savory salads ($4.50 to $10.95), a delectable plate of open-faced lobster, shrimp and gravlax sandwiches ($12.95), a superb chicken pot pie ($10.95), a tangy shrimp, avocado and black bean salad with a lime barbecue sauce ($12.95) are the big draws.
Iced tea ($1.50) is fine and unsweetened. All in all, the 745 Cafe is the best bargain in the store.
(Fridays and Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.; closed Sundays.)
 
Bloomingdale's
Third Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 705-2100; (212) 705-3085.
LE TRAIN BLEU, sixth floor: This reproduction of a luxury European dining car, with its brass fitting and overhead baggage racks, is so authentic that patrons walking down the wide central aisle balance as if they are expecting the floor to lurch at any minute. But the comfortable velvet chairs, heavy tables, carved ceiling and unchanging view of the 59th Street Bridge contribute to a warm feeling of solidity. If a final reassurance was needed, each table bears a single rose in a delicate glass flute.
Le Train Bleu is for serious eating, with prices to match. Such dishes as fillet of salmon in parchment on a bed of vegetables ($16.75) or veal sorrento with prosciutto and mozzarella ($16.50) may be too much for the shopper intending to disembark for a turn through women's wear. An appetizer of fried shrimp ($8.25) was crisp, but its orange-ginger dipping sauce tasted like marmalade. A smoked tuna, apple and pear salad ($8.50) was marred by a mayonnaise dressing, making it more like a Waldorf salad.
Instead, grab a window seat, treat yourself to a restorative glass of sparkling wine (Bouvet rose, $5) and a smoked-salmon omelet ($14.75), and watch the cityside stay put.
(Fridays and Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.; closed Sundays.)
PASTA AND ESPRESSO BAR, metro level: If Le Train Bleu is meant to replicate a European dining car, this spot, with its aggressive neon and fluorescent lighting and clattering ambiance, is more like the subway. In fact, it is not far from the entrance to the Lexington Avenue line, near the luggage department.
This is an economy-minded place, so the cramped tables, which look like metal and marble, are actually plastic and Formica, and the flowers on each table are cloth. Still, the long black bar with tubular Italian-style seating suggests modernity and comfort.
The menu, which in fact includes simple pastas and espresso, otherwise strains to be Italian. Under headings like piatti principali, insalata and cucina sandwiches lurk such un-Italian dishes as quiche, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and tuna salad. A Greek salad is lively, even though its accompaniment, an 8-inch individual cheese pizza ($6.75), is of the how-much-cheese-can-you-glop-on-the-crust school. Much better is the delicate lemon poundcake ($2.75), which, with an espresso ($1.25), makes a fine little pick-me-up.
(Fridays and Saturdays 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.; closed Sundays.)
 
Saks Fifth Avenue
Fifth Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 940-4080.
CLUB SFA, eighth floor: Lines snake out of the entrance to Cafe SFA, with tourists from Oklahoma standing next to the most lunching of ladies. They come for the comfortable, patterned cloth banquettes, lovely wood paneling and views of Rockefeller Center, not to mention the comfortable, well-spaced tables, which make this large, airy room a blessing for weary legs and bag-laden arms.
There are a half-dozen wines offered by the glass, and the menu is intelligently calibrated to meet all levels of hunger. Of particular interest to anyone who has hopelessly picked away at the enormous troughs passed off as salads these days is the Quick Bite, a bowl of soup and a half-sandwich for $11. For the more famished, there is a roasted half-chicken with herbs ($12) or swordfish hash, a peculiar melange of swordfish, pepper cubes and potatoes ($12). Oh, and if you are not daunted by huge bowls, try the Oriental chicken salad: strips of chicken breast mixed with Chinese vegetables and fragrant with sesame oil ($11).
Meticulous care is taken to appeal to all tastes. A cup of coffee, for example, arrives not only with sugar cubes, but also with granules of turbinado sugar and two different artificial sweeteners.
(Fridays and Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.)
 
Macy's
151 West 34th Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenues, (212) 695-4400, extension 2920 or (212) 967-6034.
PATIO RESTAURANT, eighth floor: Only the most intrepid shoppers reach the Patio. To get there, after all, means that you've turned your back on the Cellar Grill (burgers), the Celler Cafe (coffee and dessert), the Cafe L'Etoile (what the food industry calls a "white tablecloth establishment"), Le Petit Cafe (coffee and dessert), the Self Treat Yogurt Bar ("where healthy eating is fun!") or the Fountain Restaurant ("eat in the magical world of Mother Goose").
But then you'd miss this classic 1950's lunch counter, whose cheerful yellow-and-black decor and no-nonsense waitresses have made only the slightest concessions to the changing fashions of the last 35 years. Several elderly women bend over bowls of French onion soup. Occasional couples pull up to the Carvery at one end of the counter for thick roast beef sandwiches. Whole baby chicken ($8.50) or cheese ravioli ($7.50) with vegetable and your choice of meat or tomato sauce, are nostalgic reminders of TV dinners. Tropical iced tea ($1.25) tastes like a liquid Life-Saver. Peanut butter crunch ($4.25), which places peanut butter, hot fudge and butterscotch sauces on a bed of ice cream, will make a child of anyone.
Only two things are missing: meat loaf and mashed potatoes. Too modern.
(Fridays, 9:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M., Saturdays 9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sundays 11:30 A.M. to 4 P.M.)
CAFE L'ETOILE, mezzanine: This bright little tile-floor cafe is certainly more modern than the Patio, but it is in some ways just as traditional. There is a handsome paneled section with a small bar for smokers, and a windowed section of banquettes, wicker chairs and tightly spaced tables overlooking the perfume department.
The lunch menu seems old-fashioned: Sacramento tomato juice ($2) seems a peculiarly ancient appetizer. Eggs Benedict ($8.50), a pool of congealed hollandaise over poached eggs, Canadian bacon and undertoasted English muffins, was soggy. A salade Nicoise ($12.50) included chunks of canned tuna, though the lettuce, green beans and potatoes were nicely dressed in a garlicky vinaigrette.
A much better option is the refreshing afternoon tea ($7.25), served from 2 to 5 P.M., which includes a glass of sherry, a scone and clotted cream, cucumber and ham-salad sandwiches (served a little too chilly), and a selection of desserts. The tea is a real infusion. The piped-in music is Brahms. And you can eavesdrop:
"You get a lot of Europeans who come here?" one matronly customer asked a waiter.
"Yes," he answered.
"You see?" she told her companion. "That's why the wine!"
(Fridays, 11 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Saturdays 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Sundays 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.)

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
Visible, Emotional Rift Over U.N.L.V. Coach

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Feb. 27

 BODY:
The polarization of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas over the future of the embattled basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian created emotional confrontations in two campus episodes today.
In one, the university's president, Robert Maxson, who rejects the coach's recent insistence that his resignation has been withdrawn, was berated at a Board of Regents meeting by a supporter of Tarkanian who was in the audience. 
 And at a campus rally organized in support of exerting tighter controls over the athletic program, pro-Maxson speakers were jeered and interrupted by fans who think Tarkanian has been treated unfairly by the university. Several times, discussions in the crowd led to angry finger pointing, and university police had to step in to end one argument at the end of the rally.
Emotions over the Tarkanian situation have become heated in recent days as the coach concludes what he planned to be his last season at U.N.L.V. But Tarkanian said on Sunday that he was rescinding his agreement to resign because, his lawyers said, the agreement was the result of "coercion and fraudulent inducement" by Maxson.
 
Tight Security for Board Meeting
 Tarkanian and his lawyers have also maintained that Maxson and other university officials had been the source of several damaging reports about Tarkanian and the basketball program, including a recent report that the F.B.I. was investigating allegations of point shaving by the 1990-91 U.N.L.V. team.
The basketball program was not included on the agenda of the Board of Regents meeting. But amid increased security, including the unusual presence of uniformed officers, the board allowed Bernard Weisman, a supporter of the team from nearby Boulder City, Nev., to address the group.
"President Maxson," Weisman said at one point as Maxson looked on impassively, "I really don't know if you're in awe of Jerry Tarkanian or not. I don't really know if you're jealous of Jerry Tarkanian or not."
About 50 supporters of the coach, some dressed in T-shirts that read "Keep Tark" and "Fire Maxson," broke out in laughter.
"But that could be the bottom line," Weisman said.
Tarkanian's supporters cheered when Weisman summarized the coach's importance to the university. "Tark the Shark is what it should be called," Weisman said, referring to the university. "Because if not for him, we've got nothing."
 
A Fan and His Pain
 At the rally, held in the sunshine next to the student union, supporters of the coach booed members of the faculty and staff who spoke of the damaged reputation of the university.
One of the speakers was James Deacon, a professor of biological sciences who introduced a motion at a faculty senate meeting earlier this week to declare a two-year moratorium on the basketball program.
 
A Matter of Record
 Deacon described himself as a loyal U.N.L.V. basketball fan long before the recent days of national championship contention and sellout crowds at the Thomas and Mack Center. He also described the pain he felt in watching the program slip into controversy and disgrace as it was twice placed on probation by the N.C.A.A.
Deacon spoke of a recent graduate who went to a job interview in Kansas, only to discover that the interviewers were more interested in talking about the scandal at the university than about the applicant's credentials.
"A quality education is being provided," Deacon said, "but the word is so pervasive that a product of the university doesn't get a chance for a first job, we've gone too far. It is time for us to step back and recognize what has happened, and cut our losses."
Deacon gave up the microphone to Nate Cebrun, a friend of Tarkanian who had challenged a number of the earlier speakers. Cebrun said that a number of demonstrators holding signs that placed academic reform over basketball had been holding national championship T-shirts less than two years ago.
"I never heard that much about hotel management," he said. "I've heard of the Runnin' Rebels."
Bill Robinson, an assistant professor of economics, had a suggestion for the crowd to help the resumes of recent graduates.
"I'll put the record of the Runnin' Rebels on it when you were there," he said, "and we'll see who hires you."

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

Rent Before Buying
 "Rent now, buy later" could be the slogan for a brand new venture started by an entrepreneur, an investment banker, an art publisher and a money lender who are out to democratize the art world and challenge the conventional gallery system. The venture, called Art America, offers collectors and corporations contemporary artworks for rent with an option to buy at wholesale prices. The company's mission is to make art accessible to more people at a time when money is tight. 
 "As the art market started its rapid descent, we realized that in every monster there is a seed of success," said Steven M. Brier, Art America's president. "We're trying to balance the supply-and-demand ratio. As more art is being created than ever sees the light of day, the traditional outlets no longer serve the artists."
To make its argument, the Manhattan-based company is offering prospective clients written information that asserts: "Between 1960 and 1980 the number of practicing artists grew from 50,000 to 200,000 with some 60,000 in New York City alone. While the creation of art has grown dramatically, the current system of distribution has not kept pace."
Unlike such businesses as One Night Stand, where women can rent a Chanel party dress for just an evening, Art America offers no quick fixes. "We couldn't rent a work of art just for a night," Mr. Brier said. "The cost of insurance and shipping wouldn't make it worth our while."
In fact, initially the company has geared itself more toward corporate clients and collectors. If a more modest request, like renting a dozen prints, comes along, Art America will eventually be able to accommodate it, but not for a few months.
The practice of renting artworks began more than 40 years ago, when museums offered such a service to their patrons. But the idea of a company that deals exclusively in the business of renting art with an option to buy has drawn skepticism among gallery dealers as well as corporate curators. They wonder whether, given the recession in the art world, there is actually a market for such an enterprise. They also question whether this business will have harmful effects on the traditional relationship between artist and gallery.
So far, Art America has committed about 80 artists to its program; it plans to act as a broker, not to maintain inventory of its own. Some artists are offering paintings, others prints. For easy marketability, the company is starting out with established artists like Sol LeWitt, Robert Ryman, Robert Mangold, David Salle, Richard Artschwager and Eric Fischl. In some instances, Art America is working directly with artists; in others, it is making arrangements with galleries whereby the gallery receives 10 percent of any sales income, the artist gets 40 percent and the company keeps 50 percent.
Art America offers three lease programs. The first, called the Unique Lease, is meant for corporations, offices or serious collectors. It requires renting artworks worth at least $500,000 at today's appraised market values. A two-year rate is 5 percent a year, based on the value at the inception of the lease. In other words, $500,000 worth of art can be rented for $20,000 a year on a two-year agreement; a three-year agreement is available at 4.5 percent a year and a five-year lease at 4 percent a year.
The second program, the Multiple Lease, is intended primarily for lithographs, photographs and etchings. It requires the leasing of a minimum $250,000 worth of artworks, also based on the appraisals at the inception of the loan. The third option is the Custom Lease. This arrangement, which can work in several ways, is basically a money-lending service set up for collectors or corporations that wish to buy artworks that Art America cannot obtain itself.
Under all of Art America's plans, a client who wants to buy a work of art during the term of the lease may purchase it at 60 percent of the original appraisal. After the lease is up, the wholesale option to buy is renegotiated, based on the current market value. Artists working directly with Art America get 2 percent of the wholesale value of a work for rentals and 50 percent of the purchase price when a piece is sold. "We are not only hoping to attract private collectors, but corporations," Mr. Brier said. "Art America wants to infuse the corporate world with high culture."
Mr. Brier also pointed out that for corporations, the price of leasing art is considered a tax deduction as part of its operating expenses, provided the payments do not give the corporation equity interest in the artworks. "We've structured our prices and terms around the Internal Revenue Service rules," Mr. Brier said.
In the early 1950's, the rental of artworks began at institutions like the Museum of Modern Art. "People used to come and choose art from big library racks," recalled Sandy Lang, who heads the Modern's art advisory service. The museum charged 10 percent of the value of the work for two months with a two-month option for renewal. "We needed to have at least 2,000 to 3,000 works available," Ms. Lang said, "and finally we ran out of space."
The museum ended its rental program in 1982. Now the Modern will organize or create special exhibitions running up to three months for corporations that are patrons of the museum. The works are not from the museum's collections, but are borrowed from artists and galleries. The cost, which includes everything from trucking and installation to insurance and organization, ranges from $6,500 to $8,000 or more, depending on the size of the show.
"I think Art America has a market," Ms. Lang said. "It all comes down to whether or not they will get quality works of art."
Many dealers aren't so sure, saying the scheme will never work and is an assault on the gallery system, since galleries would make less money and lose control of where an artist's work ends up. "I don't think it's going to set the world on fire," said Douglas Baxter, director of the Pace Gallery in Manhattan. "A lot of what goes into art is pride of ownership. Still, anything that gets art out into the world is a good thing."
Margaret Kelly, curator of the art collection for Forbes Inc., calls the scheme "just another new angle at a time when the economy is not so strong." But, she said, "for small businesses like law firms who like to change their art frequently, it could be a good service."
"Renting art is a fragile area in terms of the larger corporate structure," she added. "As more corporations are making cutbacks, it could lower morale if money is spent on something perceived as an extra."
Many experts on the art business say Art America is simply another sign of the times. "This could never have happened in the 80's," said Mary Boone, the Manhattan art dealer. "Then there were too many collectors trying to buy too few works of art. Now there are 50 percent fewer collectors."
Henry Welt, a partner at Kronish, Lieb, Weiner & Hellman, a Manhattan law firm that represents some artists, sees Art America as a source for potential harm within the art business. "It doesn't recognize the role of the gallery in assisting the artist," he said. "Besides, the whole idea of renting art perpetuates the 80's concept of art as commodity, a concept most people in the art world hoped was finally gone."
 
Too Late for the Boom
 The tale of the S. Bitter-Larkin Gallery, at 597 Broadway in SoHo, is yet another parable of the 1980's. It involves a bank and a dealer who together tried to cash in on the art boom, but just a little too late.
Two and a half years ago, Sylvia Bitter-Larkin opened a gallery with work by blue-chip contemporary artists like Francis Bacon, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Alexander Calder. Her inventory, subsidized by Sofib Bank in Paris, a subsidiary of Peugeot, was bought at auction or through other galleries at the height of the market.
But people who have been involved with the gallery said that when most dealers began suffering last spring, Bitter-Larkin's business fell especially fast. Since the gallery's inventory of contemporary art had been purchased at top dollar, rather than assembled over the years at lower prices, nothing could be sold at a profit in the rapidly declining market. So last April, Sofib Bank stepped in and foreclosed on the gallery's space, then removed Ms. Bitter-Larkin's expensively purchased inventory, first sending it quietly to Christie's for appraisal and then to dealers in Paris for resale, the sources said.
An article in L'Express in 1990 said that a month before Sofib removed the art, Joel Seydoux, the banker in charge of the gallery's loan account, had been dismissed for misappropriating the bank's funds in unrelated transactions. Mr. Seydoux could not be reached; telephone calls to numbers thought to be Mr. Seydoux's in Paris went unanswered.
Both Ms. Bitter-Larkin and lawyers at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in Manhattan, which represents Sofib, declined to comment. The gallery is still open, however, and Ms. Bitter-Larkin is still there, without any of the blue-chip artworks she purchased; she is now showing work consigned directly by artists. The bank now leases the space to Ms. Bitter-Larkin, the sources said.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
Few restaurants in New York City, or in the United States, for that matter, are as steeped in culinary history as La Cote Basque. The grand premises on East 55th Street in Manhattan previously housed Le Pavillon, the most influential French restaurant in America in the 1940's and 50's. In 1957 the legendary owner, Henri Soule, had a dispute with the landlord and moved Le Pavillon to East 57th Street. Two years later, he returned to open a second restaurant, called La Cote Basque, in the original space.
Since 1979, the chef and owner has been Jean-Jacques Rachou, who came to the United States in 1963 to work at another renowned establishment, the Colony in Manhattan. Under Mr. Rachou, La Cote Basque has seen spectacular success over the years and a sizable expansion. The recession has hurt, of course. And Mr. Rachou's decision three years ago to leave the kitchen and act as dining-room host was equally calamitous -- much as if Itzhak Perlman put down his violin to act as master of ceremonies for the New York Philharmonic. 
 Not surprisingly, the food declined in Mr. Rachou's absence from the kitchen. About a year later, he was compelled to put on his chef's toque again, with felicitous results.
The sumptuous and romantic dining room is more awe-inspiring than ever in this age of tiled trattorias and makeshift bistros. When one waxes poetic about the glamour and theatricality of New York City, this room is an exemplar; crisscrossed with beams, ringed with lipstick-red murals and erupting with fresh flowers, it has a timeless charm. Bernard Lamotte's seaside murals of St.-Jean-de-Luz and the French countryside are its trademark. If you look to the right upon entering the restaurant, you will spot a scene with donkeys crossing a field. The one that curiously resembles a log with legs was painted by La Cote Basque's first chef, Pierre Franey, who was simultaneously the chef at Le Pavillon.
Mr. Rachou's classical cuisine still arrives on oversize plates in lumberjack portions. One appetizer that could never be too large is the ball of duck foie gras rolled in minced black truffles over a mache salad. Equally aristocratic is a delicious quail en croute that is stuffed with foie gras, truffles and mushrooms, all set over an intense sauce of veal stock dotted with green peppercorns. A compelling shellfish timbale, made of lobster, shrimp and scallops, is bound with potatoes heavily scented with tarragon and garnished with caviar.
A typical, and luxurious, Cote Basque starter is the salade gourmande, a mountain of sparkling lobster, ruddy slices of tender duck breast, artichoke hearts and, of course, more foie gras. Another is the re-creation of a lobster using its own meaty claws, smoked salmon wrapped around baby shrimp for the body, a carved avocado for the tail and truffle-flecked dressing. Less ornate but equally good are jumbo lobster ravioli surrounded by shrimp and served in a lovely shellfish broth.
Mr. Rachou boasts a wine cellar with great depth, especially in Bordeaux and Burgundy. But unless you are the type who dabbles in prestige wines, choices are limited. Moreover, it is incomprehensible that a restaurant that prides itself on such a rich selection could frequently omit listing vintages and producers. The longtime service captains here are alert professionals, and little gets by them.
Don't expect any gastronomic revelations among main courses. This is largely familiar fare, most of it done with authority and finesse. Take an antediluvian dish like duck a l'orange. Mr. Rachou demonstrates that the reason it has fallen out of favor is that most chefs don't know how to make it, turning the misshapen fowl into an oversize lollipop. At La Cote Basque, the duck's skin is nicely browned, the meat moist and the sauce balanced with bitter and sweet. A special of pheasant was exceptionally good, too, the double breast portion remarkably moist and served over duxelles and sauerkraut.
La Cote Basque is renowned for its cassoulet, and justly so. The crock of duck confit, sausages, beans and pork has the buttery texture that is the touchstone of this dish. A crusty blackened sirloin steak carries an edge of saltiness that makes it irresistible; it came with good rosti potatoes, green beans and sauteed salsify. Morels and garlic could not rescue a dryish grilled capon. Yet there is always a splendid rack of lamb or side of veal from the dining-room cart.
In seafood, snapper coated with herbs and grilled is deftly done, served with savoy cabbage. Lobster meat receives interesting treatment, tangled in fresh noodles along with shiitake, pearl onions and carrots.
Desserts are even more opulent and iconographic than before. How about a piano built of bittersweet chocolate holding a mixed-berry mousse and layer cake for a keyboard? Souffles are sublime, whether Grand Marnier or chocolate, and the crunchy, chewy dacquoise is a paradigm of the art.
It is a delight to see La Cote Basque halt its free fall and get its bearings again. In a sense, this institution is the foundation upon which much of contemporary French cuisine here was built. It deserves to stand tall.

HEADLINE: Senior PGA Tour May Drop Event

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Unless a last-ditch effort to raise $200,000 is successful, the MONY Syracuse Senior Golf Classic -- one of the Senior PGA Tour's original stops -- is finished, officials said today.
"We notified the PGA that we would not be signing the contract to hold the event this year," said Gary Camp, the MONY general manager and tournament director. 
 The event is still on the schedule for June 14-16 at the Lafayette Country Club near Syracuse, said Ric Clarson, the Senior Tour's director of administration. A final decision will be made within the next few days, he said. The tournament made its debut in 1982.
MONY officials blamed the recession for the tournament's demise.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Sharper Image Begins Its First Campaign in Newspapers

BYLINE: By Stephanie Strom

 BODY:
USUALLY, when a retail business starts having financial difficulties, its advertising budget is the first to get the guillotine.
But at the Sharper Image -- the gadgetry emporium that in the 1980's became a nouveau hardware store for America's affluent young professionals -- hard times have instead led to its first print advertising campaign. Full-page newspaper ads are appearing in large metropolitan areas around the country. 
 Previously, the retailer relied on its slick, engrossing mail-order catalogues to promote its business.
Now, the company portrays the newspaper ads as a sort of economy move. "It seems contrarian, but really, we're cutting back," said Richard Thalheimer, the company's founder, chairman and visionary in chief, pointing to the expense of the catalogues.
Somewhat to his surprise, the campaign has noticeably improved sales. In Kansas City, Mo., and Buffalo, where the company tested its advertisements, sales in the local Sharper Image stores increased by more than 80 percent the week after the ads first appeared, Mr. Thalheimer said.
The company picked up the additional business at a relatively low cost for each potential customer, he said, although its overall advertising costs increased. The Sharper Image sends out about 6,000 of its catalogues in the Kansas City area at a cost of about 60 cents each. For a full-page ad in The Kansas City Star, which has a circulation of about 240,000, the company paid about $8,000, Mr. Thalheimer said. That works out to about 3 cents per reader, although a newspaper ad is less precise than a catalogue in reaching a target market.
And since the ads are conceived and created by the Sharper Image's in-house creative team, which also compiles the catalogues, the cost of the ad space was the only big additional expense that the newspaper campaign created.
While the company will continue to mail out the 6,000 catalogues, Mr. Thalheimer figures the newspaper ads will reach people who would never shop by mail. He decided to publish the ads in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City, where the ad appeared in The New York Times on Feb. 20.
Newspaper advertising has declined significantly as the retailing industry continues to retrench and consolidate. But some companies that used to rely on retail chains to advertise their products may now find that they have to promote their goods themselves, some advertising executives say.
Newspapers are an easy way to do that, said Adam Hanft, a partner in the New York advertising agency of Slater Hanft Martin. "The next day, you find out what works," he said. The Sharper Image tried television and radio advertising about three years ago, but had trouble gauging the effect on sales.
Searle, a manufacturer and retailer of women's apparel that is noted for its shearling coats and microfiber rainwear, has also begun its first advertising campaign. Searle Blatt, the company's founder and president, said women clip the ads, which run in The New York Times, and bring them into the company's four stores in Manhattan, asking for featured clothing.
"One woman came in the other day with a whole stack of them held together by a rubber band," Mr. Blatt said. "Needless to say, she bought a lot of merchandise."
The new Sharper Image ad encourages shoppers to mention it for $10 off the price of any purchase that exceeds $50. The ad shows and describes eight items, including the $119.95 Thermoscan thermometer, which takes body temperatures via the ear.
Among other, less expensive offerings are $29.95 aviator sunglasses, $19.95 gel insoles and a $39.95 windbreaker -- evidence that the Sharper Image no longer caters exclusively to the very affluent, Mr. Thalheimer said. "We've changed so much over the last year that the customer doesn't know what we are," he said. "The ads are a way to tell thousands of people we don't just sell gadgets."

HEADLINE: Hold the Cheers on Haiti

 BODY:
Democratic principle gained next to nothing from the bargain agreed to by Haiti's exiled President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and parliamentary leaders this week. The most that can be hoped is a slowdown in army-sponsored killings of Aristide supporters.
Even that hope rests on the good will of army officers. They are understandably grateful that the agreement promises an early lifting of the international embargo, no outside military intervention, blanket amnesty for officers involved in the coup and indefinite postponement of President Aristide's return to power. 
 The agreement, which still must be ratified by Haiti's Parliament, formally recognizes Mr. Aristide as President but turns the Government over to an unelected Prime Minister who would inevitably be vulnerable to military intimidation. The corps of international civilian monitors provided by the agreement will be too weak to prevent the army from dictating government policy. If peace returns, it will be because the army feels it has won.
The Organization of American States supported these terms because of Washington's unwillingness to turn up the heat on Haiti economically or by a regional peacekeeping force. President Aristide accepted the agreement but interprets it as being tougher on the coup-makers than it is.
To their credit, several Latin governments were willing to back O.A.S. military intervention to reinforce hemispheric democracy. But others were not, and the Bush Administration seemed more concerned with halting the flow of Haitian refugees than defending democracy against 7,000 thugs in uniform.
Instead the Administration offers to help "professionalize" the Haitian military. That's been Washington's standard response to military terrorism in the Americas for decades. It has rarely, if ever, worked.
The best course now is early ratification and carrying out of the agreement's terms. That could halt the present violence and save lives. Democracy, barring miracles, has been lost.

HEADLINE: Stay the Course. What Course?

 BODY:
In the wake of George Bush's near-disastrous 53-to-37 percent win over Patrick Buchanan in New Hampshire and an embarrassing 61-to-39 percent win over Nobody At All in South Dakota, campaign commentators all say he must quickly recast his campaign. One other thing needs reshaping first: his Presidency.
The voters of New Hampshire and South Dakota, like a lot of Americans, suffer deep anxieties. They worry about jobs, health, education and the erosion of America's skills and competitiveness. They sense a loss of will and direction and they expect more from their President than banalities ("Message: I care") and a cameo appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
 They are impatient with a man who has flipped on taxes and flopped on the environment. Ronald Reagan denies having said that Mr. Bush "doesn't seem to stand for anything," but in substance it's not an alien thought. Voters find it hard to tell poll takers just what Mr. Bush intends to accomplish in a second term.
In truth, many Americans don't care all that much about grand visions. They do care whether the man in charge offers answers to real challenges. Here are three ways in which Mr. Bush might address that yearning for direction. None would bend his basic instincts out of shape; each would play to his strengths as a negotiator.
Seize the Peace Dividend. The Administration proposes to cut $50 billion in military spending over the next five years. Representative Les Aspin, a Democrat, would cut twice that. The Pentagon has not yet demonstrated why Mr. Bush could not move just as fast -- and seize the issue.
He could also lay out now an intelligent plan for using the money to enhance savings, investment and long-term economic growth. There are obvious candidates, starting with kids and concrete. Such a proposal would help the economy grow, unlike the phony tax fixes he has so far proposed. And it would go a long way toward giving his Presidency the definition it now lacks.
Save the Russians. Why worry about foreigners when America's in trouble? Because everyone, Americans included, stands to lose if the old Soviet Union explodes. If it does, spending for military contingencies would eat up some of the peace dividend. And a huge potential market for American goods would dissipate. Congress has been conspicuously sluggish on helping the republics survive another winter. Here again is an issue begging for Presidential leadership.
Come Clean on Health Care. Mr. Bush's health care plan includes several creative proposals to cover poor families and make the system more efficient. What's missing is an honest way to control costs. It's no mystery: Limit the tax deductibility of employer-paid insurance premiums. Mr. Bush likes the idea but doesn't want to push it until after the election. A little candid courage now would make half a plan nearly whole.
With an affirmative program, the President would be better positioned to treat Patrick Buchanan for what he is: a godsend. Mr. Buchanan's neo-isolationist foreign policy provides an excellent foil for the robust internationalism that comes naturally to Mr. Bush. And Mr. Buchanan's baiting of minorities provides the opportunity for Mr. Bush to champion decent values.
All this may not be enough. But it's more than the disconnected bits and pieces that President Bush is trying, with diminishing success, to pass off as serious policy. Many Americans will agree to stay the course, but first they have to know what it is.

Sal Scarpitta
Leo Castelli Gallery
578 Broadway (near Prince Street)
SoHo
Through tomorrow
 
Annina Nosei Gallery
100 Prince Street
SoHo
Through March 7
Sal Scarpitta has not been an easy artist to keep track of. Although he was born in New York in 1919, he has exhibited as frequently in Italy as in the United States, and his art has remained closer to European models than to American ones. (The influence of Lucio Fontana, among others, is discernible.) These two exhibitions offer a bookends view of his still very active career, with early work at Castelli, where he first showed in 1959, and more recent work at Nosei. 
 The earliest piece at Castelli, titled "Isola (Bedroom Wall)," from 1957-1958, consists of a wall-dependent wooden stretcher completely encased in resin-sealed strips of stained canvas. Mr. Scarpitta's inflation of the traditional stretched canvas into sculpture is deftly handled, but at least as notable is his effort to give the art object a psychological charge as a thing bandaged or straitjacketed, and possibly concealing something under its wrappings.
In the 1991-92 pieces at Nosei, this format becomes more sculptural -- it incorporates metal components to supplement wood and canvas painted in metallic colors -- and the image created is disconcertingly literal. By inserting a paddlelike instrument into a central opening in each piece, Mr. Scarpitta creates the form of a baking oven, specifically a pizza oven. The "pizzas" themselves, looking gray and decomposed, are made of disks of steel wool or collaged scraps of cloth, often with the sole of a shoe planted in their center. These are certainly among the strangest objects this artist has yet produced. Are they emblems of the creative process, or of art as a hot fast food gone unappetizingly cold? Are they an ironic bow to the artist's Italian-American heritage, or a reminder of sinister political realities?
Like the other new works at Nosei, which include the freestanding sleds and skis that have become the artist's signature, the oven pieces look overly elaborate and ungainly compared to the more abstract work of his earlier years. Yet for this very reason they also seem more complex and disturbing. Whether they constitute a multi-layered joke or a shout in the dark is hard to say, but for Mr. Scarpitta to be able to provoke such puzzlement at this point in a long career is an accomplishment in itself.

HEADLINE: Irish Majority Doesn't Favor Violence

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Irish America Sleeps as Doherty Loses," Robert J. Hogan's impassioned Feb. 6 letter on the Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for the deportation of the Irish Republican Army fugitive Joe Doherty, was impressive, if only for being two centuries too late. For the benefit of Mr. Hogan, Ireland is an independent nation that is free. We are not under the cruel yoke of British oppression. That myth is found only in fiction or in the money-gathering tactics of I.R.A. supporters in the United States. 
 Far from being "impassive and passionless," Irish-Americans are probably more aware of what is happening in Ireland than Mr. Hogan would admit. There are extremist groups on both sides in Northern Ireland, with limited support in their communities, but who seek to prolong the agony of the people of Ulster.
The I.R.A. is a terrorist organization and is not representative of the Irish people -- North or South. I.R.A. members are not "soldiers of a struggle." They are terrorists. The I.R.A. does not recognize the legitimacy of the government of the Republic of Ireland. It seeks to overthrow the democratic institutions of state, break all ties with Britain, withdraw from the European Community and impose a senseless, undemocratic answer on Ireland's problems.
Irish unity is not the burning issue of everyday life in Ireland. Although most people in the south of Ireland would probably welcome Irish unity in the distant future, they would never want it by violent means. Unemployment, emigration and recession are larger, more pressing problems.
Irish-Americans have a rich, varied and dynamic heritage, and it deserves more than Mr. Hogan would allow. I am Irish and proud of my heritage, but I am tired of being patronized by people like Mr. Hogan who want to have a fairy-tale version of Ireland. One built on death and destruction. Wake up, the world is passing you by.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Colorado;
In Mountain State, Tsongas Strikes Vein of Support Among Urban Voters

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Its icy mountain peaks and vast, lonely plains have always given Colorado a sort of flannel-shirt image, a place where rosy-cheeked workers breathe air freshened by ponderosa pine.
But far more typically, a Colorado voter lives in a city or suburb, holds a college degree and wears a business suit to work behind a computer terminal. Young, relatively affluent, liberal on social issues, but fairly conservative on economic issues, these are the voters who represent the heart of the Democratic electorate here. 
 It is a profile that suits Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator who is leading in public opinion polls here five days before next Tuesday's primary.
Mr. Tsongas, whose Colorado campaign had been run from a cousin's kitchen until this week, has been gaining in a daily poll being conducted by The Denver Post and now has the support of 30 percent of Democrats, as against Gov. Bill Clinton's 22 percent. The survey of 310 registered Democrats, conducted Monday through Wednesday and published today, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points.
 
A Neighbor Is Lagging
 Bob Kerrey, the Senator from next-door Nebraska who had hoped to win some neighborly affection, was the favorite of only 8 percent in the survey. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California ranked next with 9 percent, followed by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa with 3 percent.
On the Republican side, President Bush is leading Patrick J. Buchanan by 65 percent to 26 percent, the survey of 308 registered Republicans found. Mr. Buchanan, the conservative columnist who is proving to be an irritating burr under Mr. Bush's saddle, has canceled appearances here to devote more time to Georgia, which also holds its primary on Tuesday.
Colorado's population is concentrated along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, a north-south strip that includes Denver, Colorado Springs and Pueblo. The bulk of jobs in the state are white collar, predominantly in information processing, insurance and banking. The largest employer is US West, the telecommunications giant.
 
Improving Economy
 Colorado's economy, which was struggling in the late 1980's after oil prices fell, has been improving, thanks to growth in the white-collar sector. It has averted much of the recessionary problems felt in places like New Hampshire, and its unemployment rate is 5.6 percent, compared with about 6 percent nationally.
These white-collar workers, who outnumber unionized factory workers, have been precisely the kind of voter that Mr. Tsongas attracts.
"His message has resonated here in the same way that Gary Hart's did in the 1980s, appealing to the white-collar, highly educated and culturally liberal," said Cal Jillson, chairman of the political science department at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
Mr. Tsongas comes across as the sort of thoughtful, dry-witted corporate executive that many young business people in Boulder or Denver can see themselves joining for a glass of white wine and interesting conversation. He is seen as "the flipside of Tom Harkin," said Professor Jillson, who is more of a shot-and-beer Democrat.
 
Libertarian Streak
 The traditional liberalism of the Democratic Party does not fare well here. A libertarian streak runs through Colorado's electorate, perhaps a legacy of the independent Westerner who prizes freedom above all. It was one of the first states to legalize abortion, but it soundly defeated a proposal to provide state money for them.
It is quality of life, rather than availability of jobs, that tends to dominate voter concerns in Colorado. Environmental issues are salient in Colorado, especially in the college town of Boulder. Mr. Brown, in particular, has focused on environmental concerns. In many states, revenue from lotteries go to education. In Colorado, the money goes for parks and recreational features like bike trails.
Today Mr. Tsongas got another boost, winning the endorsements of two popular Denver Representatives, Patricia Schroeder and David E. Skaggs. In an appearance here on Wednesday, Mr. Tsongas was introduced by Lee Hart, the wife of former Senator Gary Hart. Mr. Hart has not endorsed a candidate.
 
Soaring Since New Hampshire
 Mr. Hart has not endorsed a candidate. But political analysts here say Mr. Tsongas has thus far appealed to Colorado voters who had supported Mr. Hart's call for "a new Democratic Party," independent of the party's traditional liberalism.
Until he arrived in Denver on Wednesday, Mr. Tsongas had not visited Colorado since September. Before the New Hampshire primary, he was near the bottom in surveys here, but has been soaring since then. His strength in Colorado prompted his campaign to step up its efforts here, opening a headquarters on Wednesday.
As Mr. Tsongas has emerged as the front-runner here, he has drawn the barbs of his opponents, especially from Mr. Clinton. In television ads, the Arkansas governor describes Mr. Tsongas as a "Reagan clone" and believer in trickle-down economics.
 
Democratic Drought

 Colorado has not supported a Democratic Presidential candidate since 1964 when it gave President Lyndon B. Johnson 61 percent of the vote. President Ronald Reagan rolled up huge margins of victory in 1980 and 1984, helped largely by the importance of the military to the state's economy. But President Bush did not fare nearly as well in 1988, defeating Michael S. Dukakis here by eight percentage points.
Gov. Roy Romer, a popular Democrat who embarrassed President Bush during a meeting with the nation's governors at the White House earlier this month, has not endorsed a candidate. But former Gov. Dick Lamm is supporting Mr. Clinton.
The state's strongest Democratic base is Pueblo, a city of steel mills and unionized factory jobs 109 miles south of Denver where Hispanic voters represent nearly 30 percent of the electorate. Republicans are strongest on the Western Slope of the Continental Divide, and in Colorado Springs, home of the Air Force Aacademy where voters are strongly pro-military.
As a Senator from nearby Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey had hoped to take advantage of regional loyalties here as he did in South Dakota.
But that has not been the case. Coloradans tends to look to the West, rather than the Midwest. Indeed, said Walter Stone, a political science professor at the University of Colorado, "people in Colorado have been known to tell Nebraska jokes."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the Democratic primary campaign in Colorado referred to an advertisement for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas that was critical of Paul E. Tsongas. The article quoted the ad as calling Mr. Tsongas a "Reagan clone." That was a paraphrase provided by a Tsongas aide; the words do not appear in the ad.
The writer should have checked the ad firsthand. It said Mr. Tsongas favored "another capital gains tax cut for the rich, more nuclear power plants and a 5-cent-a-year hike in the gas tax," and added, "but that's what went wrong in the 80's."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Kerrey and Clinton See Their Roles Reversing

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Gallant visits the sick in hospitals and talks to fifth-graders about patriotism and friendship.
Goofus calls Jesse Jackson a backstabber on an open microphone. 
 Gallant says he fought for his country.
Goofus has to explain why he did not.
As readers of the children's magazine Highlights know all too well, Gallant did everything right, and his clumsy twin, Goofus, did everything wrong.
In a brief moment of role reversal, which he would dearly like to prolong, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska seems to have traded campaign personas with Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
For the past few days, it has been Mr. Clinton who looked grumpy and uncertain, while Mr. Kerrey, after weeks in walkabout mode, seemed at least to be paying attention to where he was and sometimes to enjoy being there.
Even so, it is not clear whether Mr. Kerrey's new attentiveness will give him the lift he needs in the March 3 primary in Colorado, a Western state that he needs to win to show he cannot be shellacked in his own part of the country.
 
Talking Tough to Bush
 In recent polls in Colorado, he trailed Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas. Even Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, was a few points ahead. On Friday, Mr. Kerrey's campaign televised two commercials in Colorado, a biographical sketch and another about his concern for the environment.
Today, Mr. Kerrey reached for Mr. Clinton's cloak of electability and gave a dress rehearsal of how he would talk tough to George Bush if he were the nominee.
At Macalester College here, he called Mr. Bush's economic policies "obscene" and said that "like most smut, it is the disgusting substitute for the real thing." Mr. Bush, he said, was a "shill for the rich and a patsy for the powerful."
 
Admitting to Being 'Awful'
 Before the New Hampshire primary, it was clear who was Gallant and who was Goofus. Governor Clinton charmed crowds, racked up endorsements, raised money, sold himself on "electability" and became a front-runner before the first vote was cast. Senator Kerrey made a joke about lesbians into an open microphone, kept changing advisers and advertisements and did so poorly selling his plan for national health insurance he now calls his own performance "awful." Moreover, he seemed to lack the stomach for basic political engagement.
Something, perhaps the prospect of having his campaign end, helped Mr. Kerrey overcome his qualms. A Vietnam veteran who won the Medal of Honor, he sharply attacked Mr. Clinton in the South for the way in which he avoided the draft in the Vietnam war, warning that he should not be nominated because Republicans would seize the issue and "open him up like a soft peanut."
Mr. Clinton, who dealt with accusations of marital infidelity with a calculated and measured response -- an appearance with his wife on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" -- responded to these recent attacks on his draft record with reflexive counterpunches. His campaign was also thrown into a tizzy after Mr. Clinton, normally the most sure-footed of campaigners, vented his rage about the Rev. Jesse Jackson into an open microphone after believing, mistakenly, that Mr. Jackson planned to endorse Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
 
Midwestern Reserve
 Is Mr. Kerrey beginning to display a little of the political charm that Mr. Clinton has tried to claim as his monopoly?
In public, Mr. Kerrey is not usually as warm and polished as Mr. Clinton. He seems held back by a veneer of Midwestern reserve, a reverse pride in not showing off. It melted a little in a small rally in Tampa, where after a powerfully delivered speech, Mr. Kerrey stepped under the police security ropes and threw himself into an enthusiastic pool of supporters, happily shaking hands and ruffling children's heads. (In New Hampshire, by contrast, Mr. Kerrey's speeches were occasionaly so dry and uninspiring that audience members would not linger to meet the candidate. Marvin Rosen, a co-chairman of Mr. Kerrey's finance committee, joked that "there were times when if I didn't have to stay, I'd have left the room.")
Before attacking Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kerrey even did some good deeds. He took a private tour of Grady Hospital in Atlanta, talking to mothers who are recovering drug addicts about their babies. He sat before a group of fifth graders in Tallahassee and asked so many questions the principal had to interrupt him to send the children back to classes.
 
More Care in Interviews
 In his interviews with reporters, the candid and whimsical candidate whose sponanteous musings drove advisers to despair, has grown more cautious, avoiding introspection and instead reciting passages from his standard speech to reporters over the din of his airplane's engine.
And the candidate who wavered between bringing up Mr. Clinton's performance during the war and saying in troubled, thoughtful tones that he did not want to make an "issue" of Vietnam, now raises it with old-fashioned gusto as the March 10 "Super Tuesday" primaries draw near.
He also seems to revel in his broadsides against the President and his family. Among other things, Mr. Kerrey today attacked Mr. Bush's personal financial dealings, those of his sons, Marvin and Neil, and one of his brothers, who Mr. Kerrey said was "building a golf course" in China for the "butcher of Tienanmen Square." Mr. Bush, Mr. Kerrey said, made economic policy that "is pretty closely tied to his own family interests."
Later, Mr. Kerrey dismissed questions about whether he had been a little harsh. "This isn't the Dartmouth debating club," he said. "This is the rough-and-tumble of the campaign."

HEADLINE: China Gives Light Sentences To Advocates of Democracy

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 28

 BODY:
China said today that it had handed down relatively short sentences for 11 protesters tried recently in connection with the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989 and subsequent democracy protests.
These are believed to be among the last cases of people who have been held without trial for more than two years after the military crackdown on June 4, 1989. The sentences, reported in Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper controlled by Beijing, ranged from immediate release to five years in prison. Sketchy details on some of the convictions were provided earlier this week in Beijing by people familiar with some of the defendants' families. 
 By the standards of the hard-line Government, which earlier sentenced two prominent democracy advocates to 13 years each, the sentences reported today were mostly on the mild side.
The disclosures come as Beijing officials are calling for faster economic change and seem to be a sign that China is finally willing to resolve many of the cases in which dissidents have been held without trial. Such cases have figured prominently in its discussions on human rights with Western nations.
 
Public Barred From Trials
 While the relative leniency, by hard-line standards, is probably a response to Western pressure on China, there is not necessarily a specific link to the vote by the United States Senate this week to add conditions on an extension of low tariffs for Chinese exports.
The trials were held at various times, effectively closed to the public and the press, and the timing seems mostly to reflect the aim of resolving the Tiananmen cases by the time the national legislature convenes for its annual session, around March 20.
Wu Xuecan, a former editor at the official People's Daily who was arrested for distributing a leaflet during the demonstrations, was sentenced to four years. Zhai Weimin, whose name appeared in 1989 on a list of 21 most-wanted university students and who later tried to organize an anti-Government underground movement, was given three and a half years.
Sentences begin from the day of detention, so those who were taken into custody at the time of the 1989 crackdown have already served more than two and a half years. The sentences were also released in a State Council letter to John T. Kamm, a Hong Kong-based American businessman active in promoting human rights.
One dissident, Bai Chunxiang, about whom little is known, was released without punishment. Peng Rong, a Beijing University student who was arrested for organizing a survey about demonstrations, was sentenced to two years and is expected to be released in May. Li Minqi, a student arrested for his role in a commemoration on the first anniversary of the military crackdown, was also given two years and will presumably be released in June.
The Hong Kong report suggested that China had now closed all of the cases raised by the State Department in its human rights report this year. In fact, a number of cases remain unresolved. China has not given information on about a dozen other dissidents whose names appeared on a list presented to Beijing in November by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
Moreover, Bao Tong, a top aide to the former Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, was officially arrested in January and is expected to be tried soon. Wu Jiaxiang, a party official as well as a writer and researcher, was also arrested recently and is awaiting trial.
Little is known about the six other people sentenced, but presumably they were workers who had taken part in the demonstrations: Li Baoqin and Wang Guoqing, five years each; Dong Huaiming, four years; Wang Zhong xian and Wei Ren, three years each, and Wang Lidong, two years.

The Fed will allow securities firms that meet its standards to trade directly with its foreign exchange desk. [41.]
The nation's farmers received 2.9 percent more for their goods in February, with higher prices for wheat, tomatoes, cattle and hogs than in January, the Agriculture Department said. [49.]
The Christian Science church faces a financial crisis linked to a new magazine and investments in TV and radio broadcasting. [1.]
 
COMPANIES
A Federal grand jury has indicted David Paul, Centrust's former chairman, on fraud charges arising from the alleged sham purchase of $25 million in securities by B.C.C.I. [37.]

HEADLINE: Shift in Drug Summitry: U.S. No Longer Dictates

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 28

 BODY:
At the close of a summit meeting here on drug problems in the Americas, a Bolivian journalist asked President Bush why he was so insistent on the use of armed force in the drug war and so resistant to economic strategies.
The question was an echo of what Mr. Bush had been hearing for two days from the leaders of the six Latin American countries attending the conference. 
 Actually, Mr. Bush replied, he wasn't all that stubborn. "One thing that I learned out of this," he said as he shared a dais with the other leaders at a news conference, "is the need to work more cooperatively in alternative cropping" -- his shorthand for getting Andean farmers to shift from growing coca, the raw material of cocaine, to fruits and vegetables.
"I think there's more we can do to be of assistance on alternative cropping," the President added.
 
U.S. Turns More Flexible
 By speaking in a tone of of collegiality but steadily pursuing their own strategies, Mr. Bush's Latin American allies in the drug war seem to be gradually forcing him to shift to their tactics.
Mr. Bush said he was not thinking of big increases in economic aid but perhaps more trade benefits and some incentives to American corporations to create jobs in the drug-producing countries by starting businesses, farms and mining operations. The Administration has also begun showing a new flexibility as Latin leaders resist the deployment of their armies in the drug war.
Whether the Latin American approach will bring the success that has so far eluded Mr. Bush is not clear. But it is apparent that he cannot compel the governments to follow his dictates.
In the last year Colombia and Bolivia have refused to extradite drug kingpins to the United States, preferring to strike deals in which many powerful traffickers have accepted lenient prison terms without being required to surrender their fortunes, personnel rosters or ledgers. In Colombia, the result has been a remarkable drop in violence, but no measurable decline in cocaine exports.
 
Irate Warning From Peru
 On the first day of the meeting, President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru startled the Bush Administration with what one American diplomat described as an "in your face" outburst. Mr. Fujimori told reporters that Mr. Bush's strategy of repression had failed and that he was having no more of it.
"No government may fight against an entire population," Mr. Fujimori said, referring to Peru's 250,000 coca growers. "This will lead to a fight that may produce even a civil war or a war of the Vietnam type."
Administration officials suggested that Mr. Fujimori's undiplomatic remarks had been mainly intended for the ears of constituents back home. In any case, his fury squelched an American-backed proposal from Colombia to set what the Peruvian leader viewed as an unattainable, and thus potentially embarrassing, goal of cutting coca production by 50 percent over the next eight years.
By the time the leaders held the final press conference of the summit meeting on Thursday, the atmosphere seemed cordial once again. Mr. Bush praised the Peruvian leader for his hard work and Mr. Fujimori praised the United States' generosity. His lingering complaint was not with the Administration, but with Congress for withholding most of the $100 million allocated to Peru this year. The lawmakers are reacting to continued reports of human rights abuses by the Peruvian security forces.
Clearly the Peruvian President was not seeking a return to the icy relationship that his predecessor, Alan Garcia, maintained with the United States. "He got what he wanted and he backed off," one Administration official said of Mr. Fujimori.
The Latin Americans had been talking economics from the time Mr. Bush first met with them on the drug issue two years ago in Cartagena, Colombia.
At Cartagena, they reluctantly accepted Mr. Bush's argument that the Andean nations needed a one-two punch: a strong anti-drug offensive by their armies and police forces followed by increased economic assistance once a trail had been blazed.
Colombia, Bolivia and finally Peru accepted more than $30 million a year for their armies, up from virtually nothing in previous years. But the civilian leaders felt doubtful about their ability to maintain control over more heavily armed battalions. The armies themselves spoke contemptuously of chasing drug traffickers as a job better suited for the police.
With many commanders struggling even to provide boots for their troops, the armies rationalized that they could take the anti-drug money and continue to operate as traditional military forces, backing up the police on the front lines but not actually touching drugs or traffickers.
 
More Interested in Rebels
 But even in Colombia, where the army has been most active, the generals were more interested in pursuing guerrillas; after all, the insurgencies in Colombia and Peru are the No. 1 threat to their national security. In the end, neither the Colombian Government nor the Bush Administration was satisfied that the anti-drug money was being well spent. So both sides agreed as the summit meeting was opening to rechannel some $75 million to the Colombian police force.
Bolivia said that it was also planning to pull its army out of the drug war, including two battalions that had just received more than $10 million in special drug enforcement training. Weeks earlier, the Latin American countries had rejected overtures by the Bush Administration for an expansion of United States military control over anti-drug operations.
Administration officials, who had been increasing the flow of money to the armies and urging that they take a more commanding role for three years, sensed the hardening of attitudes and headed for middle ground.
The Bolivians, who are negotiating with the Administration on the details of how the army money might now be spent, spoke soothingly of the change.
"This is something that has been evolving," said Gustavo Fernandez, the chief of staff of the Cabinet of President Jaime Paz Zamora. "We all have more knowledge of the problem now and we're in a better position to look at the issue."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-to-3 vote that the State of Oregon was justified in denying unemployment benefits to two American Indians who had lost their state jobs as drug counselors because they had participated in a religious ritual involving ingestion of peyote, an illegal drug.
Many people might consider that case, which bore the forgettable title Employment Division v. Smith, either impossibly technical or faintly exotic. But to many groups concerned with religious liberty, the case was an alarm bell. The Supreme Court was petitioned to reconsider its decision by an improbable alliance that united the American Civil Liberties Union with the National Association of Evangelicals, and that encompassed Southern Baptists, Mormons and Jews. . 
 What brought these groups together was not the outcome of the Oregon case but the reasoning in the Court's majority opinion, by Justice Antonin Scalia. Although the First Amendment bans any law "prohibiting the free exercise" of religion, all rights have some limits. Certain clearly antisocial acts have remained crimes even when believers sincerely wanted to give them the sanction of religion. And all sorts of government regulations, from building codes to schooling requirements, can potentially impinge on the way people worship and practice their faith.
So where does one draw the line? Allow human sacrifice? Obviously not. But what about animal sacrifice -- or snake-handling? Allow going naked, as some of the Russian Dukhobor sect insisted on doing in Canada? Probably not. But what about wearing a yarmulke in the armed forces rather than following the prescribed uniform regulations? What about the religious conviction of Old Amish parents in Wisconsin that their children should not attend school after the eighth grade, regardless of compulsory education laws?
In upholding those parents in 1972, the Supreme Court outlined in Yoder v. Wisconsin a widely accepted standard: government should not burden religious practice unless it was necessary to serve a "compelling" state interest and was the least restrictive way of doing so. But in the Smith case, Justice Scalia argued that the exercise of religion deserves no special protection, so long as the law or regulation impinging on it is "neutral" and "generally applicable."
This would seem to mean that if a state regulates the slaughter of livestock uniformly, it does not have to make any special provision for kosher butchering. If a town restricts the size of all indoor meeting places, it need not make exceptions for larger churches.
And possibly: if all schools are required to distribute condoms or all hospitals to provide abortions, there is no reason why religious institutions should be exempt. "Generally applicable" anti-discrimination laws may well encourage challenges to faiths that do not ordain women or that separate the sexes during worship.
Conservatives expected Reagan appointees to the Court like Justice Scalia to be sensitive to the concerns of religious groups -- but also to be deferential to the decisions of legislative majorities. Majoritarianism carried the day in Smith. Justice Scalia admitted that small or unpopular religious groups might have a hard time winning protections from town councils, state legislatures or government agencies, but that was just the price of democracy.
The anti-Smith coalition, having lost its plea to the Court to reconsider, has persisted. It has persuaded Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, to introduce a measure that would re-establish by law the standard of "compelling" government interest before even a neutral, generally applicable law or regulation could penalize religious practice.
Politically, it is a formidable group encamped around Capitol Hill, like the Greek allies outside the walls of Troy. But there are some noticeable gaps in the ranks. Chief among them are a number of anti-abortion groups and, quite noticeably, the United States Catholic Conference, the civic arm of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
Their objections to the bill center on three points: whether it would provide grounds for challenging tax exemptions for religious bodies, denying government financing for secular programs in religiously affiliated hospitals or schools or -- especially -- striking down restrictions on abortion. Opponents of tax exemptions, government financing or abortion restrictions would argue that such legal provisions infringed on their "free exercise" of religion.
Indeed, a number of civil libertarian and abortion rights groups in the anti-Smith coalition have been making that kind of Constitutional claim for years -- a fact that has made the Catholic Conference and the anti-abortion groups highly suspicious of the new coalition.
The anti-Smith coalition does not deny that some of its members would like to use the free exercise argument for purposes that the Catholic Conference and the anti-abortion forces abhor. It simply says that these, like all other free exercise claims, will have to be fought out in the courts under the "compelling interest" standard that the Smith decision overturned -- rather than be left to the shifting decisions of political majorities. The conservative members of coalition feel confident that given the conservative turn in judiciary, the fears of the Catholic Conference and anti-abortion leaders are unfounded.
Next week, the Catholic Conference, which has not yet taken a public position on the bill or on an alternative proposed by the anti-abortion groups, may break its silence. And President Bush, who will speak before the National Association of Evangelicals but is also linked politically to the anti-abortion groups, may give a nod one way or the other. It will be an interesting week for reading tea leaves.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Congress Anxiously Waits to See House Bank's Deadbeat List

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The televised debates on the floor of the House this week were about taxes, Presidential politics and Haitian refugees. But the impassioned whispers in the corridors and cloakrooms were about another question: Who will be on list of the House Bank deadbeats?
With Congress in a defensive mood and an election just over the horizon, a few bad checks loom as more career-threatening than an anemic economic recovery plan and more embarrassing than a botched campaign speech. 
 An ethics subcommittee is putting the final touches on a review of the defunct financial institution, and preparing a list of members who overdrew their accounts repeatedly by tens of thousands of dollars. A storm of anxious chatter has been loosened over who may be on the list and how to minimize or exploit the political damage caused by making it public -- or trying to keep it secret.
Even as lawmakers solemnly insisted that they want to expose even the hint of corruption, they were maneuvering behind closed doors either to expand or to contract the list to help friends or hurt enemies.
 
Accusations Flying
 Raw, unsubstantiated accusations were flying. Their stomachs almost audibly churning with fear that their own check overdrafts could hurt their re-election chances, members privately identified other lawmakers who they expect will be on the list of the most egregious check abusers.
"What's out there is enormous fear," said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Connecticut Republican who is a member of the ethics committee.
Hypersensitive to the accusation that their institution does little more than waste taxpayer money, Congressional leaders are trying to play down the affair by declaring that no taxpayer money has been stolen, that no crime has been committed. That is a claim many Republicans are challenging even as they admit they have no evidence to prove otherwise.
The ethics committee says that to stay above politics, it is investigating House bank accounts by numbers without names attached. But the fear and controversy grew to a high pitch this week when a former employee of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, which ran the bank, told senior House Republican staff members that he had been informed by a current employee that a senior Democrat had matched the account numbers with names.
Representative Matthew F. McHugh, a New York Democrat who is chairman of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, has repeatedly denied that anyone on the ethics committee knows the names of the alleged bank abusers.
 
'This Is a Rumor Mill'
 "This is a rumor mill," complained Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, when asked about a closely knit group of liberal members who have been commonly mentioned as probable check abusers. "I know nothing about the facts and I don't think anybody does."
The rumor mill began churning last September when the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, reported that members had written 8,331 bad checks from July 1989 to June 1990. Without identifying members, the G.A.O. disclosedthat 134 members had written 581 checks of $1,000 or more in a six-month period without having sufficient funds in their accounts.
If the Democratic leadership has its way, only a few members at most will be identified as repeatedly overdrawing their accounts by amounts in excess of their next month's salaries. The senior Democrats are being forcefully resisted by an irreverent group of freshmen Republican Congressmen. Known as the Gang of Seven, they are pushing for maximum exposure in an attempt to incite a revolution against Democratic dominance of the House.
In a tacit alliance with the insurgents, a growing number of conservative and moderate Democrats are pressing Speaker Thomas A. Foley to go public with a sizable list and recast what they describe as the shoddy administration of the House.
"Influential people are telling the leadership that the entire leadership will be dismissed after the election if they don't manage this problem properly," said a middle-ranking Democrat Congressman. "This is creating enormous strains on the institution."
Republicans and Democrats agree that of the 25 or so members who will probably be identified as egregious check abusers, the majority of Democrats will probably be greater than the roughly three-to-two proportion by which they control the House. The process by which the names will become public has not been decided, but the ethics subcommittee is expected to assemble a final list by next week. Then it will be up to the full ethics committee to approve the list, and decide when to make it public.
A few Republicans have threatened to resign from the ethics committee unless at least some violators are identified, a move that would stimulate the still private Republican accusations that the Democratic leadership is attempting a cover-up.
When the scandal first broke, Mr. Foley said there was no need for disclosure because public funds had not been misappropriated. But then the group of Republicans went into action after receiving a wink and a nod from Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip.
One of the Republican freshmen, Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, drew widespread attention to the check overdrafts by staging a bit of guerrilla theater on the House floor; he appeared before his colleagues with a paper bag over his head to dramatize what he characterized as his embarrassment over the affair.
In October, the House leadership bowed to the pressure by introducing a resolution to close the bank and direct the ethics committee to determine which if any members had committed "significant, substantial, repeated abuses."
Members of the Gang of Seven say the release of a list of check abusers will not be enough. They do not accept the leadership's contention that no crime was committed, asserting that since the repeated overdrafts were in effect interest-free loans, they should have been reported on tax returns and Congressional ethics forms.
They also say that they are interested in knowing where members came up with the money to finally make good on their accounts, suggesting that they could have taken money from campaign funds, which is illegal under Federal Election Commission rules, or that they received undisclosed emergency union donations.

Esprit de Corps Names A New Chief Executive

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Esprit de Corps, a leading sportswear company based in San Francisco, said yesterday that Fritz Ammann had been named president and chief executive, effective April 1. Mr. Ammann has most recently been chief executive of Charles Jourdan and its affiliated companies in Paris, and was previously chief executive of Swatch.
Mr. Ammann, who is 48 years old, succeeds Isaac Stein, who has been acting chief executive since April, when Corrado Federico resigned. Mr. Stein will continue as chairman. An investor group led by Mr. Stein and Susie Tompkins, Esprit's co-founder and creative director, purchased the company from her ex-husband and co-founder, Doug Tompkins, in June 1990. 
 "Fritz's diverse experience in consumer marketing will allow us to take full advantage of opportunities in both our core businesses and new market segments," Mr. Stein said in a statement.
Mr. Ammann's appointment coincides with the March 3 debut of the Susie Tompkins collection, a new product line aimed at moving the Esprit line from teen-agers to women in their 20's, and with the opening of expanded quarters in New York. Esprit, one of the largest designers of clothes, is known mostly for its colorful and casual clothes for teen-agers. A private company, Esprit does not report financial results, but is estimated to have sales of more than $1 billion.
Mr. Ammann "has a strong international reputation for operations," said Harry Bernard, a partner in Colton Bernard Inc., an apparel-industry consulting firm based in San Francisco. "My question is, how much influence will he really have on Susie? He needs to create a far more efficient internal operating structure at Esprit. The trick will be to do that and still keep Susie comfortable."
"Fritz is a dynamic, highly spirited leader who shares our values and enthusiasm," Ms. Tompkins said in a statement. "I couldn't imagine a more qualified and compatible person. We are very lucky to have found him."
Mr. Ammann has been chief executive of PCW, the parent company of Charles Jourdan, since 1989, and was chief executive of SMH, which owns Swatch and Omega, from 1986 to 1989. He has also held executive and management positions at Metro, in Vienna; Omega Inc. in Switzerland, and Genesco, at various locations.
He holds both an M.B.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from Saint Gall in Switzerland. Mr. Ammann is married, with two children, and will be relocating from Paris to the San Francisco area.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Assails Iraq Over Its Refusal To Destroy Weapons

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The Security Council clashed again with President Saddam Hussein today over Iraq's continuing refusal to go along with plans for eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles under the terms the Council set last year for ending the Persian Gulf war.
The Council issued another strongly worded statement condemning Iraq's failure to cooperate with the special commission set up by the United Nations to oversee the destruction of the Baghdad Government's most dangerous weapons. The statement asks Iraq to send a delegation to New York to explain its position "without further delay."
 
Council Demands Iraqi Reply
 The statement warns Iraq again of "the serious consequences" of its failure to obey the Council's orders. It tells Iraq to "communicate directly to the Council without further delay an authoritative and unconditional acknowledgement of its agreement to accept and implement" those orders. 
 It rejects as unacceptable a new Iraqi letter, received today, in which Baghdad refused to destroy Scud missile-related equipment as the special commission has ordered and reiterates that this equipment must be destroyed.
The statement also says the Security Council's members will "continue their consideration of this question no later than the week of 9 March 1992" -- a pledge that diplomats say is intended to set a kind of deadline for the Iraqis to come to New York and give a definitive account of its position.
"The Security Council is deeply concerned this is all part of a giant stall by Iraq," the American representative, Thomas R. Pickering, said after the meeting, adding that "serious consequences means precisely that."
The Council's latest quarrel with Iraq appears the most serious that has erupted between them since the United States and its gulf war allies sent troops into the north of the country early last year to establish safe havens for rebellious Kurds fleeing President Hussein's troops.
Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish head of the special commission, returned empty-handed from Baghdad last week after the Council sent him there to secure Iraq's unambiguous agreement to cooperate with its cease fire terms.
 
A Test of Wills
 In a clear test of wills, Iraq refused to start destroying the Scud missile equipment. On Thursday, the United Nations agreed to an Iraqi request to postpone for 24 hours the planned destruction of this equipment in the presence of a team of international inspectors who are now in Baghdad.
But that deadline passed today with Iraq still refusing to start the destruction process. Instead, it told the Council that it wanted to convert the equipment to civilian purposes and proposed to send a high-level mission to New York next month to discuss its plans.
Reporting on his visit to Baghdad, Mr. Ekeus told the Council on Thursday that Iraq would be willing to cooperate in the destruction of its most dangerous weapons only if the Security Council started to lift its economic embargo on Iraq. The embargo's major feature is a ban on the sale of Iraqi oil, the country's principal export, unless Baghdad agrees to use the revenues only for food, medicine and other necessities for the Iraqi people, and to repay Kuwait for damage caused by the Iraqi invasion and occupation, which began in August 1990 and ended a year ago today.
Mr. Ekeus also said Iraq remained reluctant to accept its plans for long-term monitoring of its military industries to insure that it does not develop any new weapons of mass destruction, saying this breaches its national sovereignty.
Today's Council declaration is the latest of several issued this year telling Iraq that it must fully comply with the plans for destroying its most dangerous weapons.
A declaration issued after a summit meeting of Security Council members in January said the gulf war resolutions they had adopted "remain essential to the restoration of peace and stability in the region and must be fully implemented." Then on Feb. 19 the Council warned Iraq that it faced "serious consequences" unless it agreed to give up these weapons and cooperate with the United Nations. It was after that warning that Mr. Ekeus was sent to Baghdad to talk with the Government.
Iraq, in the letter delivered today, said it wanted to send a delegation to New York to discuss the whole issue of destruction of these weapons and the equipment used to make them.
In the letter, Iraq's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, argued that Iraq should be allowed to retain equipment used for building Scud missiles if it can be converted to civilian use.
He said Iraq had already submitted plans for converting the equipment "for purely civilian purposes connected with the production of liquid fuel tanks and rubber separators for the oil industry and for the production of civil explosives used in road construction, cement industries and the manufacturing of the 100-kilometer Ababil missile."
Iraq is banned only from possessing missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers, or about 90 miles.
The letter, addressed to Mr. Ekeus, asked that "no final decision be taken to implement the plan to destroy the equipment in question."
Instead, it proposed "that this subject be discussed within the general picture of all the fundamental matters to be submitted to the Security Council and to your excellency by the high-level Iraqi delegation to be dispatched during March in order to determine the complete picture of the Iraqi programs related to weapons of mass destruction and prevent the re-use of such equipment in any prohibited activity, while preserving Iraq's industrial capabilities for civilian and other non-prohibited purposes."

Former Head Of Centrust Is Indicted

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 28

 BODY:
David Paul, former chairman of the Centrust Savings Bank, was indicted on Federal conspiracy and fraud charges that contended he propped up his failing institution with a $25 million sham purchase of securities by B.C.C.I., prosecutors said today.
Mr. Paul also conspired to loot Centrust for his own gain, said James McAdams, acting United States attorney for southern Florida. The former Centrust chairman collected almost $21 million in salary, bonuses, stock dividends and loan proceeds in the five years he controlled the institution, Mr. McAdams said. 
 The indictment ties the savings and loan failures to the huge fraud at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the international bank seized by regulators last summer.
The indictment also named a former B.C.C.I. shareholder, Ghaith Pharaon, and William Christopher Berry, who ran the failed savings institution's investment department, Mr. McAdams said.
Mr. Paul and Mr. Berry lied about a stock swap between Centrust and the defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan, and repeatedly falsified documents to misrepresent Centrust's financial health, the indictment said.
"Paul and Pharaon are charged with willful misapplication of Centrust money," Mr. McAdams said after reading the charges. "Such practices strike at the heart of the economy of this nation and must not go unaddressed."
Centrust was seized two years ago by Federal regulators at a loss of $1.7 billion amid charges that Mr. Paul plundered the institution at the expense of account holders.
Mr. Paul, 52 years old, faces up to 100 years in prison and $5 million in fines if convicted on 20 counts. Mr. Berry faces 90 years and $4.5 million on 18 counts, and Mr. Pharaon could be jailed for 10 years and fined $500,000 if convicted of two conspiracy counts.
The investigation into Mr. Paul and the failure of Centrust "is continuing and it is intensive," Mr. McAdams said. He would not comment further.
Mr. Paul's lawyer, Aubrey Harwell of Nashville, said overzealous regulators brought on the indictment, adding, "Mr. Paul is ready to begin to vigorously defend himself against these charges."
A judge last week ordered Mr. Paul jailed for up to 18 months for contempt for refusing to produce documents sought by the grand jury looking into his institution's failure.
Mr. Pharaon, 50, a Saudi businessman who also was indicted in November in Washington on racketeering charges, remains a fugitive. Mr. McAdams offered no information on Mr. Berry's whereabouts.
The indictment said Mr. Paul and Mr. Pharaon conspired to make Centrust appear healthier than it was after the Federal Home Loan Bank Board expressed concerns in May 1988 that Centrust's portfolio of junk bonds left the institution dangerously exposed.
To convince regulators that investors believed in Centrust's future, Mr. Paul arranged to sell B.C.C.I. $25 million in bonds, then buy them back two months later. Mr. Pharaon pocketed a $331,500 commission on the deal, the indictment said.
The indictment also said Mr. Paul and Mr. Berry arranged the swap of stock between Lincoln and Centrust in December 1987. Both institutions sold stock to each other at a large increase over the purchase price, generating significant paper profits when no capital actually changed hands, the indictment said.

HEADLINE: Dow Ends Busy Week With Yawn, Off 1.78

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices were flat yesterday in choppy trading. Concluding a roller-coaster week that included two new records and two retreats, the Dow Jones industrial average ended at 3,267.67, off 1.78 points for the day and 12.52 for the week.
Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, said he noted some profit taking by investors and a little program trading late in the afternoon. "This weakness in equities should not last, given the strength developing in the bond market," he said. The firm bond market had helped to underpin stocks for most of the trading session. 
 Auto stocks advanced strongly after Merrill Lynch gave the auto-making group a positive recommendation. Chrysler rose 3/4, to 17; Ford Motor rose 1, to 36 3/4, and General Motors gained 1 3/8 to 37 1/2.
 
 
G.D.P. Change Little Noted
 The upward revision of the United States' fourth-quarter gross domestic product, another indicator of the economy's outlook, did not seem to have a great impact on the market, Mr. Jarrett noted.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was on the lighter side of the average trading day, with 221 million shares changing hands, up from 215.1 million on Thursday. The Big Board index slipped 0.54 point, to 228.21, as the number of losing stocks moved ahead of gainers by 895 to 825.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.16 points, to 412.70, while the American Stock Exchange index finished unchanged at 416.09. Trading on Nasdaq issues moved the composite down 0.48 point, to 633.47 as the Russell 2,000 gained 0.14 point, to 211.15.
Blue-chip issues rose in the morning, helped by futures-linked buying, gains in the bond market and what analysts said was portfolio window dressing at the end of the month, when money managers have a tendency to make trades that embellish portfolios.
Investors were also cautious, unwilling to make big moves before economic reports are released next week, including the February unemployment data due out on Friday.
 Market analysts at MMS International, a Wall Street research firm, said the economy had given conflicting signals this week, with better-than-expected durable goods orders, then lower-than-predicted consumer confidence and home sales reports.
 
 
Komag Shares Fall $3
 After reporting lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, the shares of Komag fell 3, to 14 7/8. At least two analysts cut their 1992 earnings estimates on the computer software company, traders said.
Shares of Filenet, a computer company, rose 1 1/4, to 32 1/4, on a positive article in Investor's Business Daily that noted strong growth prospects for the company's document-image-processing system. According to the article, government agencies and credit-card-processing companies are all seen as potential customers for the system, which scans paper documents and stores information on optical disks.
Shares of Takecare Inc., a hospital management and service company that reported record fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, surged to a 52-week high of 29 1/2 before closing at 29, up 4. Analysts at Kidder, Peabody and First Boston repeated "buy" ratings.

HEADLINE: New York City Delays Billing Non-City Cabs

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
With tensions building in the fiscal border war between New York City and its suburbs, the city has temporarily backed away from one plan to raise revenues from nonresidents to help balance its budget.
Under the plan, out-of-town taxis that pick up passengers in the city would have had to pay the same licensing fees as city-based cabs. The move angered suburbanites, particularly in the wake of Mayor David N. Dinkins's proposal to increase the income tax on the 724,000 nonresidents who work in the city. 
 The city has not dropped the plan, but a threat to fine and tow violators, starting on Monday, has been put off for 30 days to allow New York State legislators to try to negotiate a settlement with taxi operators.
The dispute comes against a backdrop of increasingly bitter debate over how to raise revenue in the region. Last week, after meeting with Mayor Dinkins, two New Jersey state senators denounced the Mayor's plan to raise the commuter tax, saying that a "border war" had begun.
"New Jersey isn't going to stand around and let our people be taxed," one of the senators, Louis F. Kosco, said. On Monday, Mr. Kosco and State Senator John P. Scott -- who represent Bergen, Passaic and Essex Counties -- introduced a retaliatory bill that would tax non-New Jersey residents who work in New Jersey. They also plan to meet with Republican legislative leaders in Albany to press their case against the city tax increase. The proposed increase can not be enacted without the New York Legislature's approval.
 
Commuters Are Taxed Less
 New York City officials contend that commuters now pay very little compared with residents, although they benefit from city services like police, hospitals and transportation.
"We look at it as trying to provide essential services to commuters who earn their livelihood in New York City," said David Rubenstein, the assistant director for tax policy, revenue forecasting and economic analysis in the city's Office of Management and Budget. Noting that nonresidents now pay 0.45 percent of their income in city taxes, compared with up to 4.6 percent for residents, he added: "In municipalities where there are income taxes, nowhere is the discrepancy so great between residents and nonresidents."
Mayor Dinkins has proposed that the nonresident tax, which has not been raised since 1971, be raised to 0.75 percent on wages and 0.95 percent on earnings from self employment. This would provide about $60 million in direct budget relief, plus $80 million to help transportation in the region, Mr. Rubenstein said.
But few officials outside New York City are pleased with either the commuter tax or the licensing fees for non-city taxis.
Robert J. Bondi, the Putnam County Executive, denounced them as "New York City's latest effort to balance its budget upon the backs of its suburban neighbors."
Assemblyman Gregory P. Young, a Westchester County Democrat, and the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, spoke by telephone with Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel Thursday afternoon to secure the 30-day moratorium.
"The other guy blinked," said Douglas Major, the president of the Limousine Operators of Connecticut, which represents 42 limousine companies with about 400 cars. Although he worried that Connecticut, New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester County taxi services might still have to pay fees to New York City, he and many other limousine operators saw the moratorium as a sign that a compromise would be reached.
But the chairman of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, Fidel F. Del Valle, said: "It remains the city's contention that if you are in the business of operating for hire in New York City you should be licensed in New York City."
For several years, the commission has wanted annual fees of $500 for each taxi company, $275 a car and $62 a driver, plus a one-time $44 fingerprinting charge for each driver.
Legal actions by suburban owners had blocked the city from enforcing the regulations until last month, when a New York State Supreme Court judge lifted a restraining order.
The hundreds of non-city limousine companies have objected that they only do part of their business in the city and already pay licensing fees where they are based.
Many suburban operators also angrily attribute the city's motives to its dismal financial condition.
"We get the feeling that New York City is so messed up financially and so corrupt that they will do anything for money," said John Gouveia, whose County Limousine Service in White Plains is 44 years old.
Ronald Goldberg, the owner of Monte Carlo Limousines Inc. of Selden, L.I., and the president of the Nassau-Suffolk Limousine Association, said that the services could not pay the new fees without raising fares.
He estimated that if the fees were imposed, his fare for a one-way trip between Kennedy International Airport and Selden would increase to $110, from $90.

HEADLINE: Democrats Assail Quayle On Welfare

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
In a swelling chorus of outrage that was colored by partisanship, New Yorkers -- at least Democratic politicians -- today lambasted Vice President Dan Quayle and called his criticism of the state and its welfare system little more than a thinly disguised appeal to racism.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said Mr. Quayle's stinging rebuke on Thursday of New York's "liberal economics" and its welfare system should have made the audience ill and was part of a calculated political effort to blame the recession on the unemployed. 
 "There's no doubt that the Republicans have done their political homework," Governor Cuomo said in a statement released by his office. "They've decided from their polls that a significant number of voters are susceptible to divisive and irrational arguments that welfare is largely to blame for the nation's economic ills."
The counterstrike by the Governor, whose verbal feuds with the Vice President have often degenerated into slashing personal exchanges, came less than 24 hours after Mr. Quayle traveled to New York City and in a biting, broad-ranging attack, called it a paradigm of everything that is wrong with liberalism.
"The liberal vision of a happy, productive and content welfare state hasn't even worked on 22 square miles of the most valuable real estate in the world," the Vice President said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. He went on to recite a litany of New York's problems and said they were a product of liberal social policies.
"Liberal economics may prevail here, but it sure doesn't work here," the Vice President said in the speech to club members during a dinner at the New York Hilton in midtown Manhattan. "Let us look at this great city. It attests to what becomes of those who put their faith in the benevolence of the state."
The speech was part of an effort by the Bush Administration to make welfare into a major election-year issue on the assumption that middle-income voters will be hostile to welfare in a recession. The President, whose re-election drive has been plagued by much greater hurdles than expected just six months ago, made welfare an important point in his State of the Union Message last month.
Mr. Cuomo has generally urged the Administration not to exploit welfare as a political issue and has warned that the tactic risks fanning racial intolerance. But today's response rekindled the personal feud between the Governor and the Vice President that erupted last fall when Mr. Quayle repeatedly referred to the Governor as "Mario" and Mr. Cuomo responded by calling the Vice President "Danny the Cabin Boy."
"If they were dumb enough to listen to the Vice President and not get sick to their stomach, this country is in worse shape than I thought," the Governor said, referring to members of the Economic Club. "If they were as smart as I think they are in New York, what they said is: 'This is a joke. They sent this kid here to play cynical, political games.' " Mr. Cuomo made that remark in an interview on the CNBC program "Inside Opinion."
The Governor's view that Mr. Quayle was appealing to racism by bringing up welfare was supported by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat. A student of the welfare system for more than three decades, Senator Moynihan has written several studies on the subject and is considered one of the country's leading authorities.
"We're not going to let welfare become a corrosive, divisive, damaging, hurtful issue to our nation. We're better than that, better than this speech," Senator Moynihan said today, as he introduced a bill intended to break welfare's hold on generations of many families by increasing Federal financing for job training to $5 billion, from $1 billion.
Though Senator Moynihan criticized welfare bashing in general, he also called on Mr. Bush to "put up, or please to shut up." He criticized, as an appeal to race, a Bush campaign commercial in which the President promises to "change welfare and make the able-bodied work."
Senator Moynihan's Republican counterpart, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, praised Mr. Quayle's comments. As part of his own stump speech in his bid for re-election, the state's junior Senator regularly denounces "welfare cheats" and claims that the state's exceedingly generous welfare provisions make New York a haven for the poor.
 
'Basically Correct'
 "Quayle's observations were basically correct," Senator D'Amato said today in a telephone interview while traveling between events in New York.
Mr. Moynihan said the criticism of welfare raised the race card.
Asked whether the recent statements on welfare had raised a race-based appeal, a Bush campaign spokeswoman said, Torie Clark, said: "Nothing could be farther from the truth. It's just the opposite in fact -- the President wants to help all people of all colors to get work, to get education and to help them keep their families together."
Many of Mr. D'Amato's potential Democratic opponents found the Administration's approach wanting.
Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Queens Congresswoman, said Mr. Quayle's remarks were part of a cynical attempt by the Republican administration to shift the national debate away from the cuts in Federal aid that have caused the urban social problems that the Vice President points to as proof that the welfare system does not work.
"I think it's a tactic that is attempting to move the discussion away from what the truth is," she said. "The truth is that the Federal Government has abrogated its responsibility. Everything tends to look distorted when you're looking at reality through a country club window."
Another Senate candidate, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, joined the chorus denouncing the use of welfare as a political tool. "This is a diversionary tactic by two birds of a feather," she said, referring to the Senator and the Vice President. "New York is in trouble because of the disastrous budgets of Bush, Quayle and D'Amato."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Florida;
Where the Immediate Forecast Is Sunny for Bush but Cloudy for Democrats

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 28

 BODY:
A week and a half before the primary voting, George Bush seems poised to win all the Republican delegates from Florida, the fourth largest block in the country, but the Democratic picture is much more clouded.
Bill Clinton has far and away the best organization and the most money to spend among the Democrats, and the campaigns of his competitors have not taken root here. But this large, diverse and rapidly growing state has a history of election surprises. Few experts rule out the possibility that Mr. Clinton could be overtaken on March 10, "Super Tuesday." 
 Despite Florida's economic miseries and President Bush's disappointing showing in New Hampshire and South Dakota, he appears unbeatable here.
 
Bush Campaign Optimistic
 The President's son Jeb, a former Florida Secretary of Commerce and now his father's state campaign chairman, said he saw "no visible evidence" that the campaign was in any trouble.
Thomas Hines, a Tampa businessman who is running the Florida campaign for Mr. Bush's challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, said Mr. Buchanan had not conceded Florida, but he added, "I'd be satisfied with just a portion of what we did in New Hampshire here in Florida."
Under Republican rules in Florida, the candidate who gets the most votes in a Congressional district takes all the delegates from that district, and the one who wins statewide also wins a bonus group of delegates.
So even if Mr. Buchanan receives 37 percent of the vote as he did in New Hampshire -- much better than most politicians imagine he will do -- he will have no Florida delegates to the Republican convention in August unless he wins a Congressional district.
Democrats are looking at two examples from the past and are uncertain which is the most applicable to 1992.
Four years ago, Michael S. Dukakis used organizational and financial strength to win a substantial victory here. The alternative example is that of Gary Hart, who came to Florida in 1984 after a surprising victory in New Hampshire and defeated Walter F. Mondale, who had superior organization and money.
This year, Mr. Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas, has campaign organizations in all the state's 67 counties and endorsements from many of its most prominent Democrats. He handily won a straw poll at the state Democratic convention in December, and he has enough money for blanket television advertising.
Richard Scher, a political scientist at the University of Florida, said he was of two minds about which of the past examples would prevail this year.
On one hand, Mr. Scher said, many Democrats seem disturbed by questions about Mr. Clinton's personal life and are "waiting to see if another shoe drops."
 
Where's the Excitement?
 But in Mr. Clinton's favor, Mr. Scher said, is the fact that none of the other Democrats seems to have generated the kind of excitement here that Mr. Hart did in 1984.
Paul E. Tsongas may have the best chance to emulate Mr. Hart's come-out-of-nowhere success in Florida. Mr. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, has run a few television advertisements and plans to step up his commercials as election day nears.
Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's national campaign manager, conceded that Mr. Clinton would be difficult to overtake. But he said, "We have enough money to be competitive." Mr. Kanin called Flordia "delegate rich," and observed that under the Democratic rules, Mr. Tsongas could win delegates without finishing first statewide or in any Congressional districts.
The other Democrats do not seem to. Paul Pezzella, an experienced organizer of Florida campaigns who is running Senator Bob Kerrey's, suggested that he did not have sufficient money now for television commercials
Senator Tom Harkin's campaign also seems to be struggling, even though he finished second in the straw poll in December.
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California is not mounting a competitive campaign here.

HEADLINE: U.S. Airline Traffic Off in '91

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
United States airlines, cramped by recession and the impact of the Persian Gulf war, saw traffic decline last year for the first time ever, the Federal Aviation Administration said today.
And this year so far, "jet fuel prices are remaining high, air traffic remains soft and profits continue to elude the industry," the F.A.A. said in its annual report on air transport. 
 Airlines were hit by sharply rising jet fuel prices, caused primarily by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting uncertainty about oil supplies. In addition, fear of terrorist attacks after the United States went to war cut air travel, especially on international routes.
Still, the biggest problem, the F.A.A. said, was "the lethargy of the domestic and international economies over the past year," reducing both business and recreational air travel.
All these adversities came as many airlines were trying to deal with huge debts.
The F.A.A. noted that Pan American, Eastern and Midway had stopped flying; that Continental, T.W.A. and America West were reorganizing in bankruptcy court, and that the United States airline industry over all lost $3 billion in 1991.
The agency predicted slow growth for the industry this year and a somewhat stronger performance in 1993. It said domestic traffic, which declined 1.7 percent last year, should increase about 2.7 percent this year and annual increases should average 4.1 percent during the decade.
The report said total traffic on United States carriers fell by 1.4 percent last year, the first decline since the birth of commercial aviation after World War I. North Atlantic traffic was off 12.3 percent. Pacific traffic was up, by 5.9 percent, but that was off sharply from the 20 percent annual increases of recent years.

HEADLINE: Treasury Note and Bond Prices Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates fell in moderately active trading yesterday, as dealers reacted positively to a number of reports that suggest the economy remains quite weak.
Although the Government raised its estimate of how much the economy expanded during the fourth quarter, bond market participants, who dote on signs of weakness as deterrents to inflation, were encouraged by the report because most of the upward revision was related to higher inventories. 
 "Higher inventories means less production going forward," one government bond trader said. "That means there will be less growth in the first quarter."
In addition, a survey of Chicago purchasing managers showed that conditions in the hub of the Midwest's industrial sector remained weak in February.
Results of the Chicago survey are often seen by market participants as a useful indicator to what the monthly national poll of purchasing managers will show. The results of the national survey will be released Monday.
Yesterday's price moves capped a week that saw an abrupt shift in attitudes about the market's prospects. Over the last few days, the gloom that enveloped the market seems to have evaporated.
"Pyschology has turned 180 degrees this week about the Fed and the economy," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets.
"There has been a realistic reassessment that an economic recovery will not be strong, and that the Fed may not have finished easing monetary policy."
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 3/8, up 19/32 , to yield 7.79 percent, compared with 7.84 percent late Thursday and 7.94 percent on Feb. 21.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 3/4, up 1/2 point, to yield 7.24 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.24 percent, compared with 5.32 percent late Thursday.
 
Treasury Bills Rise
 Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.92 percent late yesterday, up 1 basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.97 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Kingdom of Thailand offered $300 million worth of 10-year securities through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 8.25 percent bonds, maturing March 2, 2002, were priced at $99.67 to yield 8.299 percent, one percentage point over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Morgan Stanley and Company acted as lead manager for an offering of $150 million worth of five-year notes for the Household Finance Corporation.
The 7.50 percent notes were priced at $99.564 to yield 7.606 percent, one percentage point over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Canada Frees Retirement Funds for Home Buyers

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Acting on a tax proposal similar to one now before Congress, the Canadian Government this week decided to allow all Canadians to tap their individual retirement accounts to buy a home.
The move, which became effective with the Government's new budget late Tuesday, is intended to be a short-term stimulus for home construction and job creation. 
 It has generated both a fair amount of enthusiasm here and considerable attention in Washington.
 
U.S. Senator Reacts
 Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate's tax-writing Finance Committee, said on Thursday: "We also need to jump-start our economy. And, much like what Canada is doing now, opening up the I.R.A. for home purchases would make a big difference."
Canada's equivalent of the I.R.A., the Registered Retirement Savings Plan, represents a $100 billion-plus pool of savings that now can be tapped to make down payments on a new or existing home.
The accounts are extremely popular here, generating more than $10 billion a year of savings. When they were introduced in the 1970's, Canada's savings rate was on a par with the rate in the United States, but since then Canada's rate has climbed to about 14 percent, nearly three times the level in the United States.
The United States started I.R.A.'s for all wage earners in 1982, allowing individuals to contribute up to $2,000 to their account each year and deduct the amount from their income for tax purposes. But tax changes in 1986 disallowed or curtailed the deduction for those with company pension plans and for couples reporting annual income of more than $40,000.
Under their new housing initiative, Canadians get the right to make penalty-free and tax-free use of up to $20,000 from their retirement accounts toward the purchase of a principal residence.
 
A Limited Time Span
 To limit the cost to the Treasury, the life of the new measure was held to one year. Money for home purchases can only be taken out up to March 1, 1993. Any money taken out must be returned in equal installments over a 15-year period, starting Dec. 31, 1994.
The decision to open the Canadian accounts to housing purchases was taken after much debate within the Government and over the opposition of senior officials in the Finance Ministry, who had argued that the measure was risky in an unstable housing market and fraught with potential administrative problems.
But they were overruled by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his Finance Minister, Donald Mazankowski, who were under great political pressure to bring a little good news to voters who have been enduring a recession even worse than the one in the United States.
The initiative is Ottawa's second move this year to spur the troubled housing industry. In early February, it cut the minimum down payment for Government-guaranteed mortgages to 5 percent, from 10 percent. Historically, housing in Canada has not received as favorable treatment from the Government as in the United States. Here, for instance, mortgage interest is not tax deductible.
 
Different Political Systems
 President Bush also wants to help housing, but he must get his proposals through Congress. In a parliamentary democracy with a large majority in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Mulroney has more power to make things happen immediately.
President Bush proposed both a $5,000 tax credit for first-time buyers and a waiver of the penalty for early withdrawals from I.R.A. accounts if the money was used for a first-time home purchase.
On Thursday, the House rejected the President's overall tax proposal, but the legislation it did pass has a provision allowing penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 from I.R.A.'s to buy a first home or for educational or medical expenses. The withdrawal would be taxed as income.
Senator Bentsen and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, want to expand the approach by allowing penalty-free withdrawals from parents' and grandparents' accounts for first-time home purchases by their children or grandchildren.
 
Builders Are Pleased
 People involved in real estate were enthusiastic about Ottawa's move. Mary Celovsky, a representative in a Royal LePage realty office near Pearson International Airport in Toronto, said there had been "big discussions in her office about the Government plan, and personally I feel very positive about it."
John Bassel, president of the Canadian Home Builders' Association, called it "a springboard to recovery."

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats' Tax Proposal Is Less Generous Than House Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
When they take up tax legislation next week, Senate Democrats will try to aim their version of a "middle class" tax break more narrowly than the House did, with a program of $300 tax credits for children that will be denied to families with incomes over $70,000 and to people too poor to pay income taxes.
The other big difference from the plan voted Thursday in the House is that the Senate Democrats want to make their credits permanent. The cornerstone of the House Democrats' bill is a temporary, two-year program of tax credits of up to $400 for a working couple. 
 With both parties using the tax and growth bills to score campaign points, President Bush has threatened to veto the House bill. He expressed hope that a Senate measure would be more to his liking, although any Senate bill is also likely to have an increase in taxes for high-income people that he has called unacceptable.
 
Dole Predicts a Veto
 Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, predicted that result today and said no serious legislation would come up until after Mr. Bush vetoed a Democratic bill with tax increases. But while Mr. Dole criticized the Democrats for supporting tax increases, he did not offer much praise for Mr. Bush's alternative either.
"There's not much in either package to really jump-start the economy or blow it out of the water and make it really jump," he said. Mr. Dole, who has introduced the President's complete tax package in the Senate, has said before that he opposed some of its provisions.
That package includes an increase of $500 in the personal exemption for children, to $2,800 from $2,300 now, but the increase is not on the list on which he has demanded action by March 20. Not only Democrats but also his opponent in the Republican Presidential primaries, the television commentator Pat Buchanan, have made much of the omission.
Whatever legislation the Senate may pass, it will start taking shape on Tuesday when Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas presents a proposal to the Finance Commitee, which he heads. New details of that proposal emerged today after another caucus of Senate Democrats on the subject.
Mr. Bentsen means to propose credits that would not be available to families with incomes of $70,000 or more, and to save money by allowing the credits only for children under the age of 16.
When he first proposed the program last fall, the credits would have been available to high-income families, too, and paid for children under the age of 19. But that program would have cost $60 billion over five years, and this one will cost about half as much.
Cost is the main reason for the changes, but politics is involved, too, for leaving out top-income taxpayers helps make the Democrats' election-year argument that while the Republicans favor the rich, their party cares about the people who need help more.
The term "middle class" has become a political catchword here. Polls have shown that more than four-fifths of Americans regard themselves as middle class. The House Democrats' tax cut would provide maximum benefits once a working couple's income reached $26,000. But at one point this month the Democrats boasted that their program would actually mean lower taxes for all but the top 1 percent of the public.
 
A 'Double Hit'
 Mr. Bentsen has defended his bill by arguing that "middle-income families with children took a double hit in the 1980's."
"Their incomes went down, their taxes went up," he said. "The 1980's, in fact, were the most anti-family decade since the Great Depression."
In an interview today, he contended that his plan would help what he called typical middle-income families. A family of four with an income of $35,000, he said today, would see its income taxes cut by 25 percent under his plan.
He acknowledged that he expected little help from Republicans in the Finance Committee when he brings up the proposal. "If I lose one Democrat, I'm blocked," he said. The committee has 10 Democrats and 9 Republicans.
But he also faces opposition from some Democrats, like Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, because the plan is not intended to provide a "refundable" credit, or one that would go in cash to poor families whose taxes were less than the credit.
Recently Mr. Bentsen has said that is not necessary, because in 1990 Congress passed "$18 billion worth of earned-income tax credits, and that's for the working poor." He maintains that his new tax credit is aimed specifically at middle-income taxpayers, who "did not receive proper attention in the last tax bill."
 
Would Increase Cost
 Another critical reason for the omission is that making the credit refundable would increase the cost of the five-year program by close to $20 billion.
This will stimulate some opposition from Senate liberals, like Mr. Bradley, but the savings are important. Without them the program is still expected to cost about $30 billion.
Last year, Mr. Bentsen wanted to pay for his program of credits out of savings at the Pentagon. He concedes now that he will have to find the money by increasing taxes on high-income people, and he does not want an increase as large as the one in the House bill, which would raise the maximum personal income tax rate from 31 to 35 percent on individuals with taxable income over $85,000 and couples over $145,000.
Mr. Bentsen's proposal, which will also include reductions in taxes on capital gains and incentives for the real estate industry, is to come before the Finance Committee Tuesday. While he has offered no estimates on how long it will take the committee to vote on its provisions, Mr. Dole foresaw quick action.
The Kansan predicted that the commitee would finish quickly enough so that the Democratic bill would "probably pass the Senate sometime late next week or the following week."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Modest Gains In Volatile Trading Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar made modest gains against major foreign currencies yesterday in a volatile trading session that lacked any significant market-moving news.
Gold posted a small loss. Gold for current delivery on the New York Commodity Exchange closed at $353, down 90 cents from late Thursday. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $353.50 an ounce, unchanged from late Thursday's quote. 
 A report that showed the United States gross domestic product grew by an annual rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent in the October-December period was within analysts' expectations and did not have a strong effect on the market, said Jerry Egan, chief foreign exchange dealer for the Bank of Boston. The number was an upward revision from the estimate of three-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier.
Mr. Egan said a survey on consumer confidence, released late in the session, was digested quickly within the market and also did not affect prices much.
Though the dollar was trading in a narrow price range, activity was volatile. Mr. Egan described it as "nuclear."
Currency analysts are awaiting release of the February employment report next Friday to provide insight into the economy's direction. Until then, Mr. Egan said the market is "at an equilibrium, but it's a high-strung equilibrium."
The dollar gained against the German mark after a report from Germany said that country's industry expects the dollar will trade at 1.80 marks by the end of the year.
The dollar jumped quickly against the mark on the report, only to settle back, Mr. Egan said. The dollar closed in New York at 1.6390 German marks, up from 1.6345 late Thursday. In London, the dollar closed at 1.6375 German marks, down from 1.6445.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 129.33 Japanese yen, from 129.35 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 129.15 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 129.50 yen, up from 129.00 yen late Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7565, from $1.7550 late Thursday. At closing in New York, sterling cost $1.7580, less expensive than $1.7645 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, against the rates late Thursday, were: 1.4855 Swiss francs, up from 1.4805; 1.1823 1/2 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1782 1/2; 5.5725 French francs, up from 5.5555, and 1,230.00 Italian lire, up from 1,226.00.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Gain Is Revised Up to 0.8%

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The nation's economy grew at a faster rate in the fourth quarter than was previously reported, the Government said today, but the pace of growth was still sluggish.
The Commerce Department revised the annual rate of growth upward to eight-tenths of a percent, from an estimate of three-tenths of 1 percent made a month earlier. The change largely reflected a buildup in inventories rather than new strength in the economy. 
 "I'd say it was revised upward for the wrong reason; it came from inventories," said Susan Hering, an economist with Salomon Brothers. "It suggests that we're starting off this year with producers trying to pare inventories, and that casts a pall over the first quarter."
According to today's report, the nation's gross domestic product -- the total amount of goods and services produced -- fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent for all of 1991, unchanged from the initial estimate.
The economy has now grown in three straight quarters, but that growth, after two quarters of declining output, has been so weak that many Americans do not feel an upturn. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the second quarter and a 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter.
In the first year after other postwar recessions, the economy has grown by 6 percent on average.
"The reason people are complaining is that with the little bit of growth we've had over the last three quarters, output is still below where it was in the third quarter of 1990," when the recession began, said Kurt Karl, an economist with the WEFA Group, an economics consulting firm in Bala- Cynwyd, Pa. His firm forecasts that output will fall by 1.1 percent at an annualized rate in the first quarter.
 
Growth Expected for '92
 White House economists are forecasting that growth will pick up in the second quarter, and that growth for all of 1992 will be 2.2 percent.
The figures for growth in the last three months of 1991 will undergo a final revision next month.
According to today's report, businesses increased their inventories by $10.9 billion, far more than the $2.7 billion reported last month.
Wholesalers and retailers saw their inventories balloon when sales proved weaker than anticipated. Consumer spending in the fourth quarter fell $1.7 billion from the third quarter. Even though that is an improvement on last month's estimate of a $9 billion drop, consumer spending declined by two-tenths of 1 percent last year.
Today's report said that net exports -- the difference between exports and imports -- rose by $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter, down from the $22.8 billion previously reported. The report said that exports in the fourth quarter rose by $17 billion, a downward revision from the $19.9 billion reported last month.
Over the last year, exports have been one of the few bright spots in the nation's economy. "In the fourth quarter, export growth successfully bridged over the renewed weakness in domestic activity," said Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers.
According to the report, exports rose 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter, while imports rose 2.5 percent. Purchases of durable goods fell 6 percent, while purchasess of nondurable goods fell 3.2 percent. Purchases of services rose 2.9 percent.
 
Loan Delinquencies Down
 In another report today, the American Bankers Association said the delinquency rate for consumer installment loans had edge downward in the fourth quarter, the first such decline in almost two years. The banking association reported that the percentage of consumer loans delinquent more than 30 days fell to 2.58 percent from 2.74 percent in the third quarter.
"The good news is that the recovery is trying to get off the ground," said John M. Albertine, who runs a Washington-based economics forecasting firm. "The bad news is that in the near term, it is unlikely to get as high or go as fast as previous postwar recoveries."

Cleaning Service Does More Than Windows

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
Dr. Ruth Aaron came into this world more than 91 years ago, and left it on Feb. 4.
She left behind a rather frayed mink coat, three dozen pairs of slippers given to her on Swiss Air flights, piles of well-thumbed books in five languages and a fascinating little silver contraption to slice sugar cubes to exactly the dimensions one prefers for one's tea. 
 These pieces of herself are now being stacked and polished in Apartment 10E of a building in midtown. Soon they will be dispersed to a larger world that never knew the German emigre who became a dentist at a time when few women did. This is not a sad thing; this is the world going on.
"Everything gets recycled," said Kristin Bergfeld. "Everything gets another life to it."
Ms. Bergfeld is a cleaning lady who takes the larger view. Her Bergfeld's Housekeeping and Cleaning Services cleans everything from studio apartments to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. To help save lives, Ms. Bergfeld employs three dozen part-time employees, all of whom have physical or mental disabilities or would otherwise be unemployed. To help save the planet, she uses only nontoxic cleaning products.
It is not a big business, which allows for the personal touches that the former public school teacher cherishes. Her most personal assignments, the ones she finds the most rewarding, involve organizing the possessions of a person who has died or is moving to a nursing home. Family members are relieved both of a heavy job and a heavier emotional burden.
"It's caring," Ms. Bergfeld said of what she formally calls her estate clearance service. "It is providing for people something they cannot and should not have to do."
The job at Dr. Aaron's was unusual in that it began before she died. She had decided to move to a Quaker community in New Jersey where her younger sister already lived. She wanted to take only a few prized belongings, principally books.
Someone at the Quaker community had recommended Ms. Bergfeld, who is a Quaker herself. Other jobs have come through putting out the word with geriatric social workers and bank trust officers.
On the day they first met in mid-December, Ms. Bergfeld remembers hearing Dr. Aaron shouting in German before she even got off the elevator; she later learned this was a result of her bad hearing. The older woman was very clear about what she wanted: "Get rid of it," she barked. "Just dispose of it."
That is and isn't what Ms. Bergfeld does. Unlike auctioneers and others who will come in and denude a household for a flat fee, she charges by the hour, usually about $30 for her entire crew to organize, sell, donate, pack and ship a person's belongings, as well as clean the home.
Her goal is to maximize the value of someone's possessions, promising that her fee will never exceed what she is able to fetch for them. This, she says, is the case for a sparse studio apartment as well as a mansion.
But this is not the only value Ms. Bergfeld struggles to maximize. She wants the things she gives away for tax deductions to do the most possible good. Nice women's clothes, for example, go to homes for battered women because the women there probably fled with nothing, and good clothes help rebuild self-esteem.
So, for weeks, Ms. Bergfeld -- who is 47 years old, plays the flute, once taught school and was one of the local forces behind Earth Day in 1970 -- came to Apartment 10E. She helped an old woman comb through her own history.
A silver bowl -- "wonderfully ugly," Ms. Bergfeld calls it -- will go to Sotheby's where it is expected to fetch $8,000 to $12,000. Three necklaces made of shells the size of grains of rice from Northwest Africa will be donated to the American Museum of Natural History. The Metropolitan Museum fell in love with an odd-looking gold cigarette box. A dealer in antique textiles has cornered some fine linens.
As the two women sorted, they developed a rather odd way of communicating. The older one, the one whose ears used to work better, would speak. The younger would answer with handwritten notes.
Dr. Aaron left her home by ambulance on Jan. 24. On a table in the apartment where she lived for 34 years was a stenographer's notebook of Ms. Bergfeld's half of the conversation.
"You are first. Leftover things are second."
"I am going to order a delivery of soup for myself. Would you like some?"
"You have brains and very good ones. This stuff isn't easy."
"They very carefully carry the boxes to the truck one at a time."
You never know such things, but Ms. Bergfeld ventures the suggestion that she helped her client over a hurdle that transcended the logistical. The final one.
"I think part of her could let go when she knew things were taken care of," this unlikely cleaning lady said.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
An Alternative To Chasing Yields

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
BECAUSE of the plunge in interest rates in the last year, many Americans are searching for investments with higher yields than the 4 or 5 percent that now typifies certificates of deposit, money market funds and similar conservative holdings. But in doing so, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants says, many are overlooking a more useful financial strategy: pay down consumer debt.
"Lower interest rates should compel most consumers to pay off consumer debt that is accumulating at double-digit rates, as opposed to collecting 5 percent on savings," said Howard Safer, managing partner of Kraft Brothers, Esstman, Patton & Harrel of Nashville, who has earned the institute's accreditation as a personal financial specialist. 
 Mr. Safer said that he and other institute members had discovered that this obvious thought did not occur to many people. "Debt has gotten so ingrained that people do not put it into perspective," he said. "They need to do an overall statement of financial condition" before deciding how to reinvest a C.D. or whether to move money out of a money market fund. "Many things that were customary and ordinary in the 80's need to be turned around in the 90's," he added.
Mr. Safer said he first noticed this narrow focus on redeploying savings without regard for outstanding debt when he conducted a workshop on personal financial planning recently. A young couple were concerned about renewing a $5,000 C.D., he recalled. When he asked if they owed any money, it turned out they were making minimum monthly payments on credit card debts, incurring 19 percent interest charges, and had a home-equity loan outstanding.
He pointed out that paying off the credit card debt and avoiding that interest cost was likely to be far more beneficial than any low-risk savings. "It was like a light went on," he said, "and it is not only the middle class."
A client of Mr. Safer's who earned $400,000 a year had $100,000 in a tax-exempt money market fund yielding less than 3 percent, "because he doesn't have the risk tolerance for longer bonds or stocks." But he also had a large home mortgage. "He had become acclimated to the idea that a mortgage is good because the interest is tax deductible," Mr. Safer said.
Yet, even a low 8 percent mortgage costs a taxpayer in the 31 percent Federal bracket 5.5 percent after taxes, almost twice what the client was getting on his savings. Given his aversion for risk, it made sense to pay down the mortgage.
Of course, Mr. Safer added, "if you think equities will do double-digits as they have in the past, and you have an 8 or 9 percent mortgage, mathematically you come out ahead" to be in the stock market.
The advice to pay down debt before shifting their savings is for people who are constitutionally unable to take risks, fearing stocks can lose ground just as easily as they can gain it.
 
Charitable Trusts
 For upper-income families, estate taxes, which go up to 55 percent, can be more onerous than income taxes. Consequently, people who plan their estates carefully -- facing the unpleasant subject of mortality -- can come out ahead financially, as well as emotionally, by cutting taxes.
Ilene T. Nadel, president of Creative Philanthropic Resources Ltd., told of a woman who recently set up a charitable lead trust that gives more to charities and to her son and less to the tax collectors. She was advised by Ms. Nadel and Norman D. Altman, the firm's vice president and a partner in the law firm of Drew & Altman, which has offices in Westport, Conn., and New York.
The donor, a widow, put $1 million worth of securities into the charitable lead trust. Each year, for 10 years, the income from the trust will belong to charity, Ms. Nadel said. The donor serves as trustee and has reinvested the money at a guaranteed 5.8 percent.
The donor is an alumna of Hunter College, and Hunter will get $25,000 a year for a chair in her name, and $8,000 a year to invest for the chair in the future. Other charities will get $25,000 a year for 10 years. When the trust ends, the $1 million principal will pass to her son, who will owe no tax on it, Ms. Nadel said.
The tax aspects of trusts are complicated, and must be calculated for each trust. In broad terms, here is how the savings work: Under Federal tax law, a person may give or bequeath $600,000 without tax liability. Any combination of gifts and bequests above that amount is subject to tax.
Because this trust is to end in 10 years, the $1 million is discounted for inflation. In tax jargon, it has a "present value" of $600,976.64, which makes it subject to Federal gift taxes of $361.36, and to New York State gift taxes of $25,558.56.
Since the trust has used up the woman's limit of $600,000, any assets still in her estate will be subject to estate tax. But she has the security today of knowing that she has provided for both her son and the charities she wants to benefit.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
WHITE HOUSE SAYS BUCHANAN IS LIKELY TO REMAIN IN RACE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The White House said today there was a prospect that Patrick J. Buchanan could carry his challenge to President Bush through the California primary. The President's spokesman said a quarter or more of Republicans seem inclined to vote against Mr. Bush to symbolize their unhappiness over the economy.
The spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said results of the first three primary elections suggested a level of voter discontent that was unlikely to fade until the the recession itself did. 
 Mr. Fitzwater's remarks, coming as the President begins a weekend of tough campaigning against Mr. Buchanan in Georgia, amounted to the most cautious official assessment of Mr. Bush's political fortunes in some time.
 
Changing a Prediction
 Strategists in Mr. Bush's campaign headquarters in Washington have long maintained publicly that Mr. Bush is cruising to his party's nomination and that the Republican challenger would be driven from the race by early May.
But today, a senior official traveling with Mr. Bush suggested that such predictions about the demise of Mr. Buchanan's candidacy were no longer necessarily valid. Instead, the official, who discussed campaign details only on the condition of anonymity, predicted that Mr. Buchanan would dog the President all the way to the last primary contest, on June 2 in California.
Some strategists have described that as a nightmare for Mr. Bush's campaign, which is struggling in California and would be wounded further by Mr. Buchanan's attacks from the right.
 
Taking a New Line
 But the official said he thought Mr. Buchanan would "be there all the way," and, echoing a new line used today by other Bush campaigners, he called Mr. Buchanan "our Jesse Jackson."
The reference draws an analogy between this year's Republican contest and the 1988 Democratic Presidential race, in which the Rev. Jesse Jackson consistently attracted votes, money and press attention away from other candidates.
He said his views did not necessarily reflect those of Mr. Bush's political advisers in Washington.
Indeed, in Washington another senior official in Mr. Bush's campaign disputed the notion that Mr. Buchanan would last through the primary season.
"It doesn't seem right to me," this official said. "Buchanan's going to have to assess his own situation. If he goes to California, he can't get the nomination. Does he do more damage to himself if he stays in than if he gets out?"
In what may signal a growing anxiety over Mr. Buchanan's attacks, both Mr. Fitzwater and Vice President Dan Quayle today delivered slashing criticism of the conservative challenger.
Mr. Fitzwater described Mr. Buchanan as "the town bully" who was seeking to destroy both Mr. Bush and the Republican Party.
Mr. Quayle, campaigning in Georgia for the third day in a week, assailed Mr. Buchanan as a political trickster whose early opposition to military action in the Persian Gulf undercut his conservative credentials.
"Next Tuesday, Georgia has the opportunity to vote for the only true conservative for President of the United States," Mr. Quayle told an audience in Augusta. "Would a true conservative oppose President George Bush in Operation Desert Storm? Would a true conservative hide behind protectionism? Would a true conservative sound like George McGovern in saying, 'Come home, America?' "
 
Economic Troubles Cited
 Mr. Bush's advisers said after his victory in the New Hampshire primary, where he won 53 percent of the vote to Mr. Buchanan's 37 percent, that economic troubles figured in that disappointing margin.
But they have also insisted that New Hampshire was an aberration, a rare state where unemployment was so high and fiscal pain so intense that voters lashed out at an incumbent President simply to protest his economic stewardship.
By comparison, when Mr. Bush drew only 61 percent of the vote in South Dakota's primary last Tuesday, on a ballot with no opposition, Mr. Fitzwater and campaign officials hailed it as a "great victory."
The remaining 31 percent of South Dakota Republicans voted for a slate of uncommitted delegates.
Mr. Fitzwater said today that the President was "doing very well" in the primaries. But "as indicated in New Hampshire," the spokesman added, "there's a segment of people who are concerned about the economy and are reflecting it in their votes."
 
Estimates of Opposition
 Asked how large that segment is, Mr. Fitzwater said: "I don't know how you quantify it, but clearly, there's an economic protest vote out there. The first three primaries indicate it's in the 25 to 30 percent range."
On Thursday, as Mr. Bush concluded an international meeting on narcotics control in San Antonio, Mr. Fitzwater told reporters there was no "magic button" to propel the President through the primaries, and that "we just have to tough it out."
"The President looks good," Mr. Fitzwater said. "His speeches look good. But we've got a level of economic discontent in this country that's not going to change until the economy does."
In Washington, the senior official in Mr. Bush's campaign said that Mr. Fitzwater's assessment of the electorate "is not far off the mark," but that the share of voters protesting the economy was smaller in most of the South.
One potential exception, he said, is Georgia, where Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan meet next Tuesday in what some analysts say is a bellwether of Mr. Buchanan's ability to wage a long campaign.
There, the Bush campaign official said, Mr. Buchanan could capture as much as 25 to 30 percent of the vote, roughly the same as the share of voters who are soured on the economy.
While Mr. Bush's advisers have no doubt about the President's ability to win all the Republican primaries, they show signs of new awareness of the damage that a prolonged assault by Mr. Buchanan could wreak.
After weeks of ignoring the challenger, the Bush campaign is shifting course, aggressively attacking both Mr. Buchanan and his record, and playing to issues that will bring back the conservative Republicans that the Buchanan campaign has stolen away.
In a speech in Houston today, Mr. Bush spoke largely of religion and family values and attacked Government welfare, which he said is "trapping people in dependency." The President has barely mentioned welfare, a topic Mr. Buchanan has exploited, in previous speeches.
Also today the Bush campaign began broadcasting a new advertising attack in Georgia that brands as "false and misleading" Mr. Buchanan's own campaign commercials.
The Bush advertisement assails Mr. Buchanan for opposing the Persian Gulf war and charges that Mr. Buchanan's positions on international trade would cost thousands of jobs in Georgia.
The ad also implies that Mr. Buchanan is sexist, quoting him as saying that women may not be psychologically equipped to perform certain jobs. In both New Hampshire's and South Dakota's primaries, polls showed that women were much more inclined to support Mr. Bush than were men.
Mr. Bush's more aggressive posture came after weeks of suffering silently as Mr. Buchanan attacked him with tough speeches and television advertisements. The paradox was that in complaining about Mr. Buchanan's negative commercials, the Bush campaign was suffering from the very weapons that Mr. Bush used to great effect in 1988 against Michael S. Dukakis in the general election and against Senator Bob Dole of Kansas in Republican primaries that year.
Because of that record, Republican strategists were puzzled by the aggrieved tone of Bush campaign aides as they complained about the challenger's tactics.
In joining the assaults today, Mr. Fitzwater asserted that Mr. Buchanan had become enamored with the publicity generated by his maverick campaign.
He contended that Mr. Buchanan was now campaigning to secure a base of support for a more serious run at the White House in 1996, even at the expense of Repubican victory in 1992.
"He's vowed, in the television appearances that I've seen, that he's out to destroy the party, out to destroy the establishment, out to destroy the Republicans, to destroy the President," Mr. Fitzwater said. "He a town bully kind of guy who just wants to tear things down. He doesn't stand for anything himself. He just stands for ripping things apart."

HEADLINE: China's Somewhat Capitalist Road

 BODY:
Beijing newspaper commentaries this week signal a new drive by Deng Xiaoping to put China back on the capitalist road, ending a two-and-a-half-year detour into Socialist stagnation. Mr. Deng's new course deserves American encouragement but not blind support.
The Senate's vote Tuesday to impose a whole list of impossible conditions on China's trading privileges won't help. But neither does President Bush's repeated refusal to press any conditions on the Chinese leadership. 
 Mr. Deng's new campaign bodes well for those reformers who survived the horrible repression of Tiananmen Square. They now have a green light to resume policies that brought prosperity and rapid development during the 1980's.
But that decade also showed what was wrong with his encouragement of capitalist experiments within Socialist structures: It brought economic dislocation in 1988 and political disaster in 1989. There's little hope that Mr. Deng, weaker today, will be bold enough to break with old dogmas now. Transformation awaits the post-Deng future.
The reforms begun in 1979 tapped the power of private initiative and widened personal freedom. They opened China to the world and spurred double-digit rapid growth. But as Kathleen Hartford writes in a World Policy Journal article, the reform decade ended in crisis largely because of Mr. Deng's unwillingness to junk the whole Maoist legacy.
In the countryside, peasants were only partially liberated. Beijing relied on compulsory grain quotas to supply cheap food to city dwellers. Some peasants grew rich. But others drifted to more- prosperous municipalities. There they lived in a legal limbo because of strict Socialist residency laws. Their urban presence dramatically raised the stakes in the 1989 upheavals.
Private businesses had to compete for supplies against state-run giants. Price reform remained incomplete, distorting economic signals and encouraging corruption. Wage equality laws and excessive staff requirements discouraged entrepreneurship. Halfway reforms alienated intellectuals who wanted political freedom and more radical economic changes. Reform, Deng Xiaoping style, led to prosperity -- and the tragedy of Tiananmen.
For two and a half years the leadership has stressed stability and repression. Mr. Deng now calls for renewed reforms because there seems no alternative. No other path promises enough prosperity to ward off discontent.
None of the underlying contradictions have been resolved. Communism's erosion elsewhere has stiffened Beijing's resistance to loosening controls. The Bush Administration's near-automatic support has diluted U.S. influence. The best hope is that a new generation of reformers will gain the experience, and power, to do what Mr. Deng still resists: Let China freely enter the modern world.

HEADLINE: A Wake-up Call for City Hall

 BODY:
How many more knocks must the Dinkins administration absorb before it realizes that quick fixes won't solve its fiscal problems?
The latest bad news was an implicit warning from bond rating agencies that they would downgrade New York City's bonds if the city relied on borrowed money to plug its budget gap. So the city scaled back its borrowing plans, saying it would make up the difference with a patchwork quilt of savings -- including $100 million from the Municipal Assistance Corporation and money from the city's reserve fund, its fiscal safety net. 
 In short, Mayor David Dinkins and his advisers lunged for gimmicks instead of the one solution that would help the most: comprehensive, long-term labor reforms and reductions in the work force.
Labor accounts for half the operating budget, but City Hall has yet to get significant concessions from its unions. True, it has negotiated early retirement programs. And it pledges to reduce the labor force from a high of 225,000 to about 200,000, largely through attrition.
But that doesn't begin to go far enough. Every city service but police protection is suffering from cuts, yet the administration still hasn't demanded labor savings that will help it do more for less. Even the latest settlement, with the sanitation union, delays an agreement requiring workers to put in a full day's work for a full day's pay. Other cities and towns have won productivity savings, worker furloughs, salary cuts, layoffs. All such measures exact pain; yet some may be necessary to help the city survive this recession.
Even labor leaders, who haven't shown much statesmanship of their own, complain about City Hall's lack of resolve. Mr. Dinkins named an able public servant, James Hanley, as Labor Commissioner, for instance, but undercuts Mr. Hanley's authority by insisting that he report to a Deputy Mayor.
The Administration's original plan to borrow $700 million over four years might have worked if Mr. Dinkins, as he promised, had insisted that the unions buy future wage increases with productivity savings. But the rating agencies said the plan would saddle the city with too much debt.
The city will borrow only about $250 million and draw the rest from here and there, including the Assistance Corporation and the city reserve fund. That's a risky strategy, especially since the reserve provides a protective cushion against the unexpected. City Hall has to give up gimmicks. It needs a solid strategy to reduce and improve its work force, and it needs it now.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
In Wine, a Fledgling Venture by Mail

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Huib Geerlings, a Dutch accountant working in Boston, decided there had to be a more satisfying way to make a living than figuring corporate taxes.
So in 1987, he fused his dual passions, wine and computers, into a business that is popular in Europe but not big in the United States: selling wine by mail. 
 Now he makes his living offering wine buyers in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Illinois the vintner's equivalent of L. L. Bean's mail-order boots and Harry & David's parcel-post pears.
Geerlings & Wade Personal Wine Importers, the company Mr. Geerlings formed with his partner, Phillip D. Wade, is based in Canton, Mass., south of Boston. They say their privately held company has annual revenues of $3.2 million, and they expect it to grow rapidly by offering good selection and prices lower than many wine stores on a selected number of wines -- without the intimidation many people feel when they walk into a store.
Sales have doubled since 1989, with 32,000 cases shipped in 1991. Geerlings & Wade forecasts sales of up to 72,000 cases for 1992.
While the business is still relatively small, its fast growth flies in the face of the recession and the drop-off in wine sales nationally. Wine shipments in the United States fell to 168 million cases in 1991, from 178 million in 1990, according to Impact, a newsletter and research firm in New York that follows the alcoholic beverage industry.
"There are others selling wine by direct mail, even though it is a very small segment," said Len Egol, senior editor of Direct magazine, which tracks the direct-marketing business. "But it is a pretty effective way to sell the product. It makes sense to sell wine through the mail when you look at how successful selling food has gotten."
Windsor Vineyards in Windsor, Calif., has been selling wine by mail for more than 30 years. According to a Windsor spokeswoman, the company sells only its own wines in a limited choice of varietals, generally priced from $9 to $16 a bottle. Its specialty is personalizing the labels on the bottles for a wedding or birthday.
Geerlings & Wade sends out about 20,000 copies of its monthly newsletter that describes new wines it has spotted. Included are detailed taste evaluations, a rating chart and such esoteric facts as how pebbles cover the ground in the Chateauneuf-du-Pape region of France and keep the vines warm at night.
The company offers two new wines a month at $7 to $18 a bottle. Cases can be bought for as little as $69. The company says its prices generally fall 5 percent to 20 percent below those in retail outlets.
An Alsatian white wine, pinot blanc, is the company's best seller, with Pouilly-Fuisse and Bordeaux also popular. All cost less than $100 a case.
 
Business Is Restricted
 To get state licenses to sell wine, a company must have at least one retail outlet in any state in which it has mail-order customers. That is why the business in the United States has been restricted, at least across state lines. Within states, many big wine shops have extensive catalogues for shipping to customers within the state.
To get states' licenses, Geerlings & Wade has a small retail beachhead in each of the four states in which it operates, but Mr. Geerlings said the company sold 95 percent of its wine through the mail, shipping cases on its own trucks or by United Parcel Service.
Mr. Geerlings, 37 years old, says his business is fueled by a filing and order-tracking software program operating on a network of eight personal computers in the Canton office. The data base software tracks more than 13,000 regular customers who call the company's toll-free number, where at any one time 10 to 14 employees may be fielding the calls and processing customer orders. In addition to names and addresses, the program keeps records of every purchase, the amount, wine preference and even where shipments should be left by drivers.
Mr. Geerlings, a computer expert who created the customized system, can instantly sample different slices of his customer data base to forecast how much inventory to buy and who is likely to order it.
The technology, though, is combined with a high degree of service based on a simple premise: most people know little about wine when they go into liquor stores, supermarkets and wine shops. That often leaves shoppers to choose blindly or be steered by wine-shop clerks.
Geerlings & Wade provides the expertise and the shopper does not have to leave home.
 
'A Strange Product'
 "Wine is a strange product for many people," Mr. Geerlings added. "To know if a wine is decent, you have to open it and taste it. A lot of our customers are intimidated going into a wine shop, but we select the wines for them and we guarantee it. If they open the first bottle and don't like it, they can return the whole case."
The mail-order wine concept has its skeptics. Angel Nardone, executive director of the American Wine Society, a 3,800-member organization of wine lovers and amateur wine makers, said she had heard of the idea but would not buy through the mail herself. "It's chancy," Ms. Nardone said. "I wouldn't risk this type of ordering. I'd just as soon go down to the wine shop and get recommendations from a knowledgeable wine merchant."
Mr. Wade, 34, insists that the company does not expect its customers to forgo relationships with wine shops. "We can't provide everything," Mr. Wade said. "We're a supplemental source."
Peter Ouellet, who owns a small manufacturing company in Somersville, Conn., started buying wine from Geerlings & Wade last year and has bought a dozen cases since. "I'm too busy to do all the experimentation you have to do to learn a lot about wine," Mr. Ouellet said. "What they offered was perfect for me."
Though a good portion of its customers are white-collar professionals, Geerlings & Wade wants to expand its market "to get the Gallo buyers to come to us," Mr. Wade said.
Mr. Geerlings said wine neophytes made up just part of the customer base. A large number of customers are connoisseurs, affluent people with their own wine cellars who think nothing of spending $5,000 a year on wine. These buyers frequent wine and liquor shops but are also willing to shop by mail.
Mr. Geerlings cites Peter van Hoof, his former economics professor at Rotterdam University in the Netherlands, as the key to the company's success. Mr. van Hoof still teaches, but he also serves as the point man for Geerlings & Wade in Europe. He is a wine expert and searches the vineyards of France, bringing back dozens of bottles of wine to Rotterdam, and supervising a group of six tasters who give each wine a rating.
Surprisingly, Mr. Geerlings and Mr. Wade make it clear that this is not a long-term proposition. They say they are plowing the substantial profits -- around $700,000 in 1991 -- back into direct mailings. They hope to establish outlets in 10 states, ship 250,000 cases a year and build a customer base of 50,000. After that -- in two years or so, if the plan works -- they would like to sell out at a substantial profit and start another business.
"I don't know what it will be yet," Mr. Geerlings said. "I just don't want to do the same thing forever."
