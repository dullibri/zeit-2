HEADLINE: Foiled Once in City, Wal-Mart Turns On the Charm for S.I.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
After being rebuffed in its first effort to open a store in New York City, Wal-Mart is trying again, and this time it hopes that Wal-Mart enthusiasts like Sandra Como will flock to its cause.
 After all, she lives on Staten Island, where the company hopes to build a store. She frequently crosses state lines to shop at a Wal-Mart in New Jersey. But she does not want one of the company's giant discount stores in her borough.
''If it weren't for all the traffic, I'd be for it,'' Ms. Como said as she packed boxes of disposable diapers into her Lexus at the Wal-Mart in Woodbridge, N.J., 15 minutes from her home. ''But I'd rather come here and not have the extra traffic on Staten Island.'' 
 Ms. Como embodies the problem Wal-Mart has encountered as it attempts to scale the fortress walls of New York City, one of the few places in America where its logo cannot be found. In the past month, Wal-Mart has greatly stepped up its efforts to make New Yorkers warm up to it, running radio spots as well as ads in 70 community newspapers. But even in a city that generally takes pride in welcoming outsiders, Wal-Mart is facing a formidable not-in-my-backyard problem. 
 Whenever there are rumors that the company is contemplating this neighborhood or that, residents begin sounding off that they do not want a super-busy, colossal Wal-Mart near them, with all the expected traffic and pollution. Last February, objections from Queens residents, as well as a storm of opposition from organized labor, helped persuade a major developer to drop Wal-Mart from a large mall planned for Rego Park, Queens.
 Despite that setback, executives with Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, say they are looking at other sites in all five boroughs. They say it is time that a company that has 3,762 stores in the United States and opens 250 new stores a year finally has one in the nation's largest city. 
 Wal-Mart has sought to bolster its cause with clever advertisements, like a full-page one that ran in The Staten Island Advance. The ad read: ''On Staten Island, you can start the Marathon, take a ride on the Ferry, spend a day at Historic Richmond Town, and do just about anything. The only thing missing is every day low prices.''
 Wal-Mart has plenty of enthusiastic backers, even on Staten Island, where, according to government officials and developers, it hopes to open a store at a former Lucent Technologies factory site in Richmond Valley, on the southern part of the island near the Outerbridge Crossing. 
 ''I'd like to have a Wal-Mart right in New York City,'' Evelyn Kwakye, a data entry clerk from Staten Island, said while shopping for school supplies at the Woodbridge Wal-Mart. ''I'd prefer the convenience, and the price is right also.'' 
 Dennis Dell'Angelo, an architect who is president of the Pleasant Plains/Princes' Bay/Richmond Valley Civic Association on Staten Island, said he thought Wal-Mart was focusing its current efforts on his borough because of two factors that might mean less opposition than in other boroughs: it is more suburban and more Republican. 
 Mr. Dell'Angelo said he believed that if Wal-Mart got its foot in the door on Staten Island, that would make it easier for the retailer to expand into the other, more populous boroughs. 
 ''We need this Wal-Mart like a hole in the head because on the south shore of Staten Island we don't need any more retail whatsoever,'' he said. ''And this is a corporation that has a lot of baggage about how it treats its employees. I hope neighborhoods will consider that before they start welcoming Wal-Mart into their neighborhood.'' 
 On a recent afternoon at the Woodbridge Wal-Mart, just three miles from Staten Island and the Outerbridge Crossing, about a quarter of the cars in the parking lot had New York license plates, and a large majority of the New York drivers interviewed said they lived on Staten Island. 
 While shopping for light bulbs and baby bibs there, Lisa Tortosa, a self-described homemaker from the borough's Annadale section, said she would love a Wal-Mart closer to home. ''It would be good for people like my mother, who doesn't drive,'' she said. Ms. Tortosa dismissed concerns that a new Wal-Mart on Staten Island would generate disconcerting new waves of traffic.
 ''There's already a lot of traffic in Staten Island,'' she said. ''At least with Wal-Mart, you can go to one store like this to buy everything you need, instead of going to five stores. That might mean people actually drive around less.''
 Mia Masten, the Wal-Mart official in charge of shepherding its New York hopes into reality, said the company was being singled out unfairly. Wal-Mart's main competitors -- Target, Costco, Kohl's and the Home Depot -- have received permission to open stores in various boroughs, and she said hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were eager for Wal-Marts to be built in the city.
 ''We already know New Yorkers are shopping at our nearby stores, and in fact, last year, New Yorkers spent more than $98 million at our nearby stores,'' Ms. Masten said, noting that many city residents drove to nearby Wal-Marts in Valley Stream, Westbury and Secaucus. ''Our competitors are in New York. They're already successful, and we know it is a viable market for us. And we want to make it more convenient for our customers.''
 Ms. Masten, Wal-Mart's director of corporate affairs for the eastern region, would not confirm that Wal-Mart was seeking permission to build on Staten Island, saying it had not executed agreements on any site. But developers say Wal-Mart is loath to acknowledge that it is looking at any particular site, not only because that could spur a new explosion of opposition but also because Wal-Mart would be greatly embarrassed if it were seen as losing out at a second New York site.
 Ms. Masten said Wal-Mart would bring jobs to New York. ''Each store would bring abut 300 jobs, as well as a broad selection of merchandise at everyday low prices,'' she said. ''Why should New Yorkers continue to have to travel to New Jersey or Long Island to shop at our stores?''
 But opponents -- labor unions, community groups and small businesses -- say that Wal-Mart may take away as many jobs as it creates by driving other retailers out of business. 
 ''Wal-Mart would mean a lot of low-end entry-level jobs, and New York City isn't suffering from a lack of entry-level jobs,'' said Diane J. Savino, a Democratic state senator from Staten Island. ''We're suffering from a lack of middle-income jobs and high-end jobs. In addition, Wal-Mart has a reputation as being not just vehemently antiunion but of violating every labor law in the book.''
 Ms. Masten asserted that small businesses often continued to thrive even after a Wal-Mart opened nearby, noting that Wal-Mart was a general merchandise store. She said that the company's wages and benefits would be competitive. Wal-Mart has acknowledged that some managers have occasionally violated labor laws but said that it vigorously ordered managers to comply with laws and that it disciplined those who violate the laws. 
 Wal-Mart has 98 stores in New York State and says it pays its workers in the state $10.38 an hour on average. But labor leaders say that Wal-Mart's combined wage and benefits package is at least $6 less an hour than at unionized stores. 
 On Staten Island, political officials are divided over Wal-Mart, with some siding with consumer interests and others siding with labor unions, small businesses and community groups concerned about traffic. 
 Borough President James P. Molinaro said he would push for Wal-Mart's approval. 
 ''Anything that develops economic activity in my borough is a good idea -- that is, if it's legal and nonpolluting,'' he said. ''And if it gives people place to shop and prevents them from going to New Jersey, it's a good idea. My responsibility is to give half a million people the best possibilities to shop.''
 Richard Lipsky, the coordinator of the Neighborhood Retail Alliance, the main anti-Wal-Mart coalition in New York, said that the way New York laws are structured, the matter did not come down to how consumers feel.
 ''You'll find a tremendously high number of people who say, 'They're a good store,' and, 'We go there,' but when you ask them whether they want it in their neighborhood, they say: 'Absolutely not. We don't want to be a magnet for traffic that a store of that size will generate,''' Mr. Lipsky said. ''The ultimate decision-making will reflect the site battle more than the generalized goodwill that Wal-Mart can create.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Court Rules U.S. Need Not Pay for Abortion of Doomed Fetus'' (news article, Aug. 19):
Not only is the Ninth Circuit court's decision ''callous and unfeeling'' when ruling that the Navy need not pay for an abortion of an anencephalic fetus, but the United States government is insensitive and stingy in sailors' salaries (in this case, less than $20,000 a year).
 Enlisted sailors' salaries barely exceed federal poverty guidelines, though the military is excluded from these poverty calculations. At a time when military expenditures are enormous and when men and women are killed defending our country's economic interests, are not the lives and psyches of our servicemen and women valuable, too?

HEADLINE: Farms, Rivers Lakes and People

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 We disagree with your Aug. 19 editorial ''How to Poison a River.''
Our family-operated dairy farms, especially the larger ones, are recognized as national leaders in responsible manure management. New York's regulations for concentrated animal feeding operations are among the toughest in the nation and go well beyond what the federal Clean Water Act requires. 
 The economics of dairy farming have forced our farms to grow larger to achieve economies of scale necessary to make a profit on hair-thin milk margins. This growth has evolved in a responsible manner and in full consideration of our neighbors, the land and the water. 
 Contrary to your claims, upstate communities welcome the jobs and economic activity that farm growth generates, especially as other sectors watch jobs flee overseas. 
 We concede the Lewis County incident is a black eye and has damaged our hard-earned reputation for good environmental stewardship. The vast majority of large-scale dairies are making every effort to protect our precious ecology.

HEADLINE: Farms, Rivers Lakes and People

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I completely agree with the message in ''How to Poison a River.'' I have spent every summer of my life on a lake near Lowville, the site of the manure spill from a factory farm, and I am deeply disturbed that one of my favorite places in the world has been marred by such a repulsive tragedy.
The outdoor industry is one of the few hopes for upstate New York's faltering economy. If factory farms continue to be allowed to operate largely unregulated, they will ruin the state's natural beauty for everyone, and upstate New York will continue its sad decline.

HEADLINE: A Touch of 'Indian-ness' Amid the Glass and Steel

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
Driving from the airport into this city that has become India's technology hub, visitors are struck by the gleam of steel-and-glass high-rise office and apartment buildings with names like Golden Enclave and Diamond District. Farther along, dozens of box-shaped, glass-encased buildings carry signboards of the biggest Western high-tech companies. 
 In contrast to these unabashed clones of buildings in Palo Alto or San Jose is a 37-acre campus in the heart of the city whose granite- and terra cotta-adorned buildings are set among decades-old trees and painted in vibrant Indian shades of brick red and deep green. The buildings have names from the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit, while the rooms within are named after the ancient books of learning, the Vedas. Every morning the Indian flag is ceremonially hoisted on a central flagpole, an unusual practice for businesses here. At lunchtime, the chirping of birds mixes with the chatter of workers in the open spaces . Young men in jeans and polo shirts and women in colorful salwar kameez (an Indian tunic and trouser suit) linger along the stone-paved avenues. 
The campus, with its distinctive architecture, is the headquarters of a four-year-old outsourcing company called ITC Infotech. With 4,000 employees and $55 million in revenues, the company's professed philosophy is not to let its workplace be an imitation of countless modern buildings. Flouting the local fashion for buildings with names like Hi-Tech Tower or Software Techcity, the company calls its campus simply the ITC Infotech Park. As its managing director, Sanjay Verma said, ''This campus reflects our Indian-ness.'' 
 The tranquil expanse that blends the old and the new provides relief amid the concrete and glass structures in Bangalore, a city that the World Bank lists as among the fastest growing in the world. The country's biggest domestic outsourcing companies like Infosys Technologies and Wipro are headquartered here, as are the Indian branches of multinationals like Intel and Texas Instruments.
 In the last decade, the boom in the outsourcing of services from Western countries has brought about a construction explosion in the once quiet and orderly Bangalore. Call center and software services companies have grabbed whatever high-rise buildings that have sprouted up, as if overnight, with scant regard to urban planning or design.
 ''Companies say, 'We need a million square feet of space,' then go to their laptops and slap aluminum and glass over the million square feet,'' said Bob Hoekstra, head of the software division at Philips Electronics India.
 Mr. Hoekstra, who is campaigning for the local government to improve facilities like roads, traffic systems and public transport, said multinationals like Intel and SAP AG had given little thought to aesthetics. ''Intel's campus looks like a parking lot with a building in the middle; SAP's resembles the Frankfurt airport,'' he said.
 In the new buildings of Bangalore, and other outsourcing centers like nearby Chennai or Gurgaon in the suburbs of New Delhi, academics see an eagerness to conform to what is perceived here as the Western taste.
 ''Companies psychologically feel that their Western clients want to come here and see something that looks familiar and efficient,'' said Aparna Narasimhan, an architect at the Bangalore-based firm Venkataramanan Associates, which has designed buildings for Infosys and General Electric.
 When ITC Infotech set out three years ago to plan its campus, it bucked such trends. Opportunely, its parent, ITC Ltd., a 100-year-old cigarette maker with interests in hotels, apparel and food products, offered its defunct tobacco manufacturing complex in central Bangalore. But one architect after another suggested the same plan: bulldoze the 36 tobacco warehouses and replace them with glass-and-steel high-rises. Mr. Verma, ITC Infotech's top executive, who first joined the parent company as a young shift engineer at this tobacco complex in 1981, found this idea repugnant. Finally, the company came to the Bangalore-based architect Krishnarao Jaisim, who agreed with Mr. Verma that the old structures and environment were worth preserving.
 Mr. Jaisim, whose firm is named Jaisim Fountainhead, in reference to the Ayn Rand novel, said his work had always been defined by the book's central character, the architect Howard Roark. 
 ''I read the book in the 1960's; it has been my moral guideline ever since,'' he said. The book influenced him to work on his own terms and abhor commercialism, he said.
 For ITC Infotech, Mr. Jaisim said he wanted to come up with a plan that would retain the character of the old warehouses while upgrading them.
 ''When I started, the warehouses stank of tobacco and every road was covered with asphalt,'' he said.
 Three years later, two dozen of the warehouses have been modified to seat hundreds of workers each, and most of the streets have been paved with local stone. The architect retained the shell of the old high-ceilinged warehouses. Besides the strikingly minimal use of glass and steel, these buildings have unusual new touches: walls made of hollow terra-cotta blocks, flat stone tables and acoustic-friendly ceilings that are fashioned out of earthen pots. The giant century-old chimney, ancient trees and even an old fire station have been left standing.
 One jarring note is the unusual number of smokers on the campus. Unlike other outsourcing firms, where smoking is frowned upon, at this subsidiary of India's biggest cigarette maker the practice is not discouraged.
 The distinctive marks of the company's ideas have paid off for ITC Infotech in unexpected ways.
 ''Many employees feel a strong sense of pride in their unique campus,'' said Anirvan Mukherjee, a systems analyst who joined ITC Infotech nearly three years ago.
 ''One of the high points of working here is the campus,'' said Mr. Mukherjee, adding that his workplace was the envy of all his friends.
 Mr. Verma said that in Bangalore, where competition for skilled talent is intense, ''Our campus is a great differentiator.''
 It is a refreshing change from the ''clipped, almost Californian, presentation of the typical campus'' said Simon P. Bentley, vice president for application development at DHL, one of ITC Infotech's customers. Mr. Bentley said it is a ''beautiful oasis in the midst of the daily noise and difficulty'' of life in Bangalore. It was as comfortable and efficient as his own offices in Scottsdale, Ariz., he said, but with a ''more enviable'' natural environment.
 Aesthetic examples such as ITC Infotech are rare, said Kamal Sagar, a Bangalore architect whose firm, Total Environment, prides itself on creating structures that incorporate greenery and local building materials.
 ''Every company wants to outdo the other,'' said Mr. Sagar, citing the spaceship- and Sydney Opera House-inspired food courts at Infosys's headquarters and its plans to build origami-shaped buildings in nearby Mysore. ''Companies like Infosys and Wipro have the power to shape Bangalore's skyline,'' he said, ''and so they should.''

HEADLINE: Online Bettors Find a New Love: Real Estate 

BYLINE: By David Leonhardt

 BODY:
THE world's online betting markets have done quite a nice job of predicting the future lately.
 A kind of futures exchange where participants bet on real- world events, these markets could have told somebody last fall to ignore the talk of a late surge by John Kerry and stick with President Bush. Based on the odds posted at InTrade, one of the biggest exchanges, you could have correctly forecast the presidential winner of all 50 states, and 33 of 34 Senate races.
 The markets also could have told you that Cardinal Josef Ratzinger was neither too old nor too doctrinaire for his red-hatted colleagues. His contract was the most expensive on InTrade in the days before he was chosen to succeed John Paul II, meaning that it had the smallest payoff, because traders considered the cardinal the favorite. 
 In this country's version of a conclave, Carrie Underwood was correctly anticipated as the next ''American Idol'' winner. About 85 percent of recent Emmy winners have been identified by the odds. Even Saddam Hussein's capture was not beyond their powers of prescience. In the days before American soldiers pulled him out of his hole in 2003, the price of a contract tied to his capture more than tripled in price.
 Now one of these markets has turned its gaze to a consumer activity that is a favorite discussion topic these days: real estate. And the bettors see no signs of a bursting bubble anytime soon.
 San Diego? Prices will rise another 5 percent in the third quarter, according to the bettors at HedgeStreet, another Web site. New York? They will inch up 2 percent. In Los Angeles, they will jump 7 percent. In each of the cities, as in San Francisco, prices will be more than 10 percent higher than they had been a year earlier.
 The Internet has allowed these betting markets to flourish, and their predictive power stems from what the writer James Surowiecki calls ''The Wisdom of Crowds,'' in his recent book of that name. When people take the time to study something and then put their money where their mind is, their cumulative intelligence can be cunning. As long as there are enough prognosticators, they gather their evidence independently and their backgrounds are diverse, they often do better than individual experts who have spent years studying the subject.
 HedgeStreet began accepting bets this year on house values in a handful of major cities. In the weeks leading up to the release of new numbers from the National Association of Realtors, bettors can buy contracts that make a payout according to a metropolitan area's average price.
 The higher that average ends up being, the more that the contract pays. So the contract's price tells you what investors, as a group, expect to happen. When the San Diego contract rises in value, it's because traders think the upcoming house prices will be high and the contract's payout handsome.
 With real estate brokers in some cities reporting that home sales have recently slowed, it might be tempting to dismiss HedgeStreet's bullishness as yet another signal that the nation's love affair with real estate has become a dangerous obsession. Many economists -- including Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City, a large mortgage lender, who has compared home values to population and income in every large metropolitan area -- insist that many home prices are irrationally high.
 Even Russell Andersson, a co-founder of HedgeStreet, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., calls the current betting market a reflection of housing euphoria. ''Personally, I think we are cresting,'' Mr. Andersson said. ''I think the market may be more likely to go down by 20 percent than go up by 20 percent.''
 But the recent track record of the betting markets has earned them some deference, and the real estate traders certainly have a coherent argument on their side. Mortgage rates remain low. The economy continues to grow. The nation's biggest cities are much nicer places than they were a generation ago. The sales slowdown reported by brokers looks similar to other recent pauses that proved ephemeral. Even if it busts at some point, the housing market may have some boom left in it.
 The founders of HedgeStreet envision it ultimately as more than a playground for aspiring prophets. If it grew large enough and added contracts with a longer horizon than a quarter, it could allow people to insure themselves against some of life's economic risks.
 Somebody who drives 100 miles a day could buy gas price contracts, which HedgeStreet also sells, to hedge exposure to rising oil prices. A family that had all its wealth tied up in the California real estate market could do likewise with local housing prices. As any good financial adviser will preach, diversification is crucial to smart investing.
 But using the betting markets as an insurance policy will make sense only when they attract enough investors to meet all of the requirements for a truly wise crowd: size, independence and diversity. HedgeStreet housing contracts now trade only a few thousand times each quarter. The crowd is big enough to make its forecasts interesting but small enough to elicit some skepticism from the rest of us.
 At InTrade, the most accurate odds have been the ones based on the largest volume of trades, said Michael Knesevitch, the company's director of communications. The political contracts exchanged hands a few million times before last year's election, for example.
 When the volume dips into the thousands, the markets sometimes produce a Ratzinger and other times an Edith Brown Clement, the federal appeals judge who bettors wrongly thought would be Mr. Bush's Supreme Court nominee. Still, the markets often do a better job than many of the experts who appear in the news media.
 Looking ahead, the markets think Ben S. Bernanke or Lawrence B. Lindsay will succeed Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Hillary Rodham Clinton or Mark R. Warner, the governor of Virginia, will be running in the 2008 presidential election against Senator John McCain of Arizona or Senator George Allen of Virginia. ''Desperate Housewives'' will win the Emmy next month for best comedy. If you believe the traders, you will not want to sell any real estate between now and then.

HEADLINE: Democrats Split on Tactics For Confirmation Hearings

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
Two weeks before senators begin questioning the Supreme Court nominee, John G. Roberts Jr., the debate over his confirmation is becoming a test of Senate Democrats as well.
 The party's liberal base, whose contributions during judicial confirmation fights earlier this year have helped the Senate Democratic campaign fund amass twice as much as its Republican rival, is pressing for another vigorous fight against Judge Roberts as documents from the Reagan administration clarify his conservative credentials.
But as Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and other liberal stalwarts on the Judiciary Committee step up their criticism of Judge Roberts's record, other Democrats are reluctant to join them. 
 ''I am turned off by senators trying to act like they have already found the guy out and they know what he is like,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Democratic committee member from Wisconsin who spent last week focused instead on calling for a pullout from Iraq. ''I am not part of any Democratic effort to 'set the table''' for the hearings by laying the groundwork to criticize Judge Roberts, he said. 
 Several Democratic senators said the hearings on Judge Roberts were shaping up as a risky balancing act. Failing to press him could look weak to their liberal base. But attacking too hard could draw Democrats into a losing battle on the treacherous turf of abortion, race and religion at a time when Republicans appear vulnerable on other fronts. 
 Mr. Feingold said that he considered a Supreme Court nominee too important to evaluate in only political terms, but that in those terms, a protracted confirmation fight ''could take away time from issues where Democrats have a much better position politically, on things like health care, the economy, and, yes, Iraq.'' 
 Former Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said the hearings were a test of his party's independence. ''The interest groups are going to be out there, and this is their issue, and they are going to fight it until the dead warm over, but gas prices, health care costs and Iraq are the things that motivate most people,'' he said. In a Supreme Court fight, ''we are not expanding the base, and even if we get 100 percent of the base, we do not win a national election.''
 Judge Roberts ''is a good family man with beautiful children,'' Mr. Breaux said. ''You have to be very careful about how you approach digging into the background of somebody who appears to be a good guy.''
 The debate within the Democratic caucus over how to handle the nomination has been building behind the scenes for weeks. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, has told his colleagues to ''hold their fire'' until the hearings, his spokesman said, and in a private meeting in July with Republican leaders he indicated reluctance to go to war over the president's choice, according to a draft of a speech about the meeting written by Senator Arlen Specter. Aides from both parties who were briefed on the meeting confirmed the account. 
 Other Democrats were already publicly challenging the White House over access to Judge Roberts's work for Republican administrations. But during final negotiations on the timetable for the hearings, Mr. Reid told Republican leaders that he did not yet see obstacles to confirmation and did not expect Democrats to try to block the nomination on the grounds that the administration refused to release relevant documents, as they did with an appeals court nominee who had less of a public record, according to the draft and the aides. 
 The next day, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, stormed onto the floor, angry over reports that Mr. Reid and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, had agreed to a deadline for a committee vote on the nomination. Mr. Schumer, a member of the committee who had talked openly of blocking the nominee over a lack of information alone, argued that the deadline could limit the Democrats' ability to interrogate Judge Roberts. 
 By the end of the day, the Democratic consent to the deadline and Mr. Reid's assurances about the documents were removed from the announcement of a deal on a timetable. A spokesman for Mr. Reid confirmed the conversation but said the senator had not ruled out a fight.
 But the internal Democratic debate over how to handle the hearings has intensified as the administration has released more documents from Judge Roberts's work under President Reagan.
 ''This is always a process of pulling and hauling, and working this thing through,'' Mr. Kennedy said in an interview. 
 The pressure from both sides is expected to increase this week. Many of the major liberal groups have told Democratic aides that they planned to begin running television advertisements against confirmation, arguing that a more conservative court would threaten federal social programs and protections against discrimination. 
 Officials of the groups have warned Democrats that if Judge Roberts becomes a Supreme Court vote against their causes -- for example, in a New Hampshire abortion rights case expected to be decided before the 2006 elections -- they will hold accountable any senator who votes to confirm him. ''I think it is a big problem for pro-choice senators if they vote to confirm Judge Roberts and he votes to uphold the New Hampshire law,'' said Kate Michelman, former president of Naral Pro-Choice America.
 On Monday, the Democratic Party plans to weigh in with a request under the Freedom of Information Act asking for files relating to Judge Roberts's work during the first Bush administration, according to the party's Web site. Senate Democrats had requested the same files, and the White House refused them.
 Supporters of Judge Roberts have already ramped up campaigns in relatively conservative states to convince Democrats that ''there is a price to pay at the ballot box'' for voting against confirmation, said Gary Marx, executive director of the Judicial Confirmation Network, which helps coordinate the state efforts. 
 In Arkansas, a group of conservative church leaders met with Senator Mark Pryor to talk about the nomination, Mr. Marx said. And in Louisiana, a new state group called the Capitol Coalition is holding a 30-day tour of the state to lobby Senator Mary L. Landrieu.
 Even after the recent disclosures of Judge Roberts's documents, Ms. Landrieu said, ''I am leaning toward supporting him,'' although she said she was reserving final judgment until his hearing. Mr. Pryor also said he was keeping an open mind. He said his constituents ''want me to do something about gas prices before I do something about Judge Roberts.''
 Still, Mr. Schumer, one of the most vocal opponents of Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he would continue to push for a thorough inquiry into Judge Roberts's views. In the most recent disclosures, the campaign committee had $15 million in cash, nearly twice as much as the roughly $8 million of its Republican counterpart. But Mr. Schumer said the gains reflected public reaction to what he called Republican ''extremism'' on many issues, not just nominees. 
 And, he said, the fund-raising played no role in his views. ''I had the same position on judges for three years, before I became D.S.C.C. chair, and I am going to continue to have them after I retire as D.S.C.C. chair,'' he said.
 Asked about debates within the caucus, Mr. Schumer emphasized the unity on Judge Roberts's nomination. ''Not a single person has said they are for him or against him,'' he said. ''Everyone is in sync.''

TALKING IT UP -- The United Automobile Workers' leadership opens a meeting today with the heads of local chapters to consider strategies for a host of issues, including the industry's well-publicized woes. General Motors has been pressuring the union for cuts in medical benefits that cost it nearly $6 billion a year.

CAN YOU SHORT HOUSING STOCKS? -- Expect a lot of interest from the news media in tomorrow's report from the National Association of Realtors on sales of existing homes in July. In June, they shot up 2.7 percent from the previous month to a record 7.33 million. Watch for more attentiveness on Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reports new-home sales, which also rose to a record in June. Much has happened since the previous reports came out, not least the upward march of oil prices that finally showed up in inflation figures for July. Any sharp downward deviation from June's lofty increases is sure to deflate home sellers' hopes.

INTEL'S INSIDE STORY -- Paul S. Otellini, above, chief executive of Intel Corporation, the world's No. 1 chip maker, is expected to give details about a new semiconductor architecture in a speech tomorrow at a company conference in San Francisco. The new design is expected to reflect the company's strategic shift in emphasis from speed to energy efficiency. Intel's microprocessors are in 80 percent of new personal computers.

WORKERS OF THE WORLD? -- An international labor federation is holding a conference in Chicago this week to discuss ways to organize Wal-Mart workers. The conference, the Second World Congress of Union Network International, a Swiss-based organization with 900 affiliated unions in more than 140 countries, will run through Thursday. The Bloomberg news service quoted a Wal-Mart spokesman as saying it would give ''appropriate consideration'' to any dialogue proposed by Union Network.

COOLING DOWN -- The government's report on orders in July for durable goods like computers and kitchen appliances should provide an important clue to which way the economy is heading. Those orders were up 6.4 percent in May and a higher-than-expected 1.4 percent in June. Given July's heat wave, here's betting on strong gains for sales of air-conditioners, at least.

ENIGMATIC, EVEN AT HOME -- There will be plenty for the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to talk about in his speech Friday at the Kansas City Fed's conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. But Greenspan watchers may be scratching their heads trying to figure out what he says. His wife, the NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, said in an interview with Time magazine that was posted on CNN's Web site that Mr. Greenspan ''claimed he proposed three times before I was able to understand. He was so oblique.''

EARNINGS RUNDOWN -- For the most part, the market-moving announcements for the second quarter are behind us, but this week's reports include H.J. Heinz today, Intuit and Semtech on Wednesday and Novell on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Local Politics in Pakistan Offers Hope for Democracy

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE; Salman Masood contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: RAWALPINDI, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Qaim Din Khan hopes a simple message will win him re-election on Thursday in Pakistan's most hotly contested elections in years.
 ''We installed transformers,'' he said. ''Got streets paved.''
Mr. Khan's candidacy, approach and ambitions are revolutionary in Pakistan.
 A burly, straight-talking, 42-year-old car parts salesman with a 10th-grade education, Mr. Khan is one of 218,000 budding Pakistani politicians running in nationwide elections for the coveted new post of ''nazim,'' the rough equivalent of a mayor in the United States. Four years ago, the offices did not exist. Today, they are a bright spot in an otherwise failed Western effort to turn Pakistan into a stable and vibrant democracy. 
 ''It's close to democracy, if not true democracy,'' said Abdul Rashid, a 51-year-old businessman who praised the performance of Mr. Khan and other new nazims. ''Our problems are being solved.''
 Under a system created in 2001, Mr. Khan and each of the country's 79,612 nazims, or ''supervisors,'' receive several thousand dollars in government development funds for their tiny districts, which range from a few thousand to about 30,000 people.
 Then, they face a choice. They can try to win re-election by using the money for the payoffs and patronage that have dominated Pakistani politics for decades. Or they can try to win by improving the government services their constituents rely on: roads, electrical systems, schools and health clinics.
 During his first term in office, Mr. Khan spent $3,500 to pave 40 streets and install 10 new electrical transformers.
 ''It's better,'' he said. ''A person has to make his constituents happy by proposing development programs and actually working on them.''
 Three men are challenging Mr. Khan in a neighborhood district that has a mere 8,000 voters. Bashir Khan, a rival candidate who is not related to the incumbent, vowed to produce even more services. ''Our target is to pave all the streets, provide better sewerage and sanitation facilities and clean drinking water,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 Pressured by nazims, government doctors and teachers are now more likely to be at their posts, according to initial studies. Drugs are also available more often in public health clinics.
 New blood is being drawn into Pa kistani politics as well. Qaim Din Khan, the son of a timber salesman, is the first person in his family to enter politics. Asked if he would like to run for Parliament someday, Mr. Khan, the father of seven, grinned and replied, ''Yes, why not?''
 American officials and Pakistani moderates hope that a more efficient, effective and accountable government will weaken the appeal of militant Islam in Pakistan, an impoverished, nuclear-armed nation of 160 million people. Islamist political parties, which won record support in 2002 national elections, argue that Western democracy has failed in the country. They say only an Islamic government can create the steady jobs, effective policing and quality schools that Pakistanis crave.
 ''In Pakistan, the rich people are getting richer and richer,'' said Faridullah Karimi, a 24-year-old shopkeeper in Mr. Khan's district. ''The poor people, they stay poor.''
 The new system is part of a $650 million Asian Development Bank program to improve local government, schools, the police and courts in Pakistan, the largest program of its kind in the developing world. Known as devolution, or decentralization, the changes are intended to shift power from the central government to local government. Similar efforts have proved successful in Uganda, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
 In Pakistan, the changes include the creation of American-style community school boards and independently elected prosecutors. American officials have advocated similar measures in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 International officials credit the country's American-backed military ruler, President Pervez Musharraf, with putting the nazim program into operation and call it a success. But they accuse General Musharraf and the Bush administration of taking a ''yes-no'' position on broader democratic measures. They say the United States quietly opposes any step that could weaken General Musharraf's ability to crack down on militancy by force.
 ''If it happens to destabilize Pakistan, forget it,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation. ''That's the message of the neo-cons: 'It's security, not development, stupid.'''
 American officials have publicly pledged that a full return to democracy is essential for Pakistan's long-term stability and progress. In an Aug. 2 telephone interview with Pakistani journalists, the American assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs , Christina Rocca, said a ''level playing field'' should exist for the local elections this month and for national parliamentary elections scheduled for 2007.
 Mr. Khan's tiny district in the Soldier's Colony neighborhood of this industrial city of more than one million in northern Pakistan illustrates the need for change in the country. Roughly 35,000 people live on 24 acres of land in the district, crammed into a buzzing urban warren of streets, shops and homes.
 The neighborhood's main thoroughfare, Bokara Road, is a two-lane kaleidoscope of bikes, donkey carts and motorcycles. Sewage runs into open gutters on the street. Garbage is piled on some street corners. Residents say getting clean drinking water is a major concern. In Pakistan, 60 percent of infant deaths are due to preventable water-borne disease like hepatitis, diarrhea and typhoid. Roughly 17 percent of the urban population and 47 percent of the rural population lack access to clean water.
 Mr. Khan said that ''health'' and ''sanitation'' were two of the buzzwords he would use while campaigning.
 Across the street from his home, there is a reminder of another problem. A sparkling new private school with Mickey Mouse paintings on its exterior wall is drawing students away from the country's failing public school system in droves. Mr. Khan says he is trying to build a new elementary school for boys in the district. He also hopes to open a vocational center for women where they can learn sewing and embroidery. 
 Conditions for women in Pakistan, 70 percent of whom are illiterate, remain dismal in poor and rural areas. Under the new system, one third of the nazim seats are reserved for women or the poor, but many men still reject a role for women in politics. Qari Abdul Bari, a 42-year-old government clerk in Mr. Khan's district, dismissed nazims who were women, calling them ''decoration pieces.''
 Discrimination against women feeds another problem, population control, aid workers say. Pakistan has a higher population growth rate its neighbor, India. As a result, increased economic growth achieved by General Musharraf's government fails to meet a surging demand for jobs.
 While residents of Mr. Khan's district complained about living conditions, they praised the new nazim system and Mr. Khan's accomplishments. In street interviews, residents knew Mr. Khan's name and gave detailed evaluations of his performance. Some complained that he was corrupt, but most reviews were positive.
 Ahmed Nabi, a young man selling papayas and bananas from a street cart, credited Mr. Khan with being innovative. ''There was a problem with drinking water,'' he said, referring to a drought two years ago. ''So he brought water tankers.''
 Across Pakistan, the newly elected nazims replaced a system dating from the British colonial-era, in which bureaucrats controlled by a provincial chief minister, the equivalent of an American governor, ran local governments.
 The broad goal of the new system is to engage more Pakistanis in local government. It is also to persuade them to vote for politicians who perform well. For decades in large parts of Pakistan, elections have not been so much referendums on a politician's individual performance as tests of whether they can sufficiently reward the clans, ethnic groups and wealthy families in their political alliance.
 Mr. Khan himself said large numbers of Pakistani voters, particularly in impoverished rural areas, still voted for the candidate backed by their employer or landlord, or the head of their clan, tribe or ethnic group. In some rural areas, nazims are running unopposed, a sign that local landlords still control the process.
 Members of the military, which has ruled Pakistan for much of its history, have cited that pattern as grounds for questioning the legitimacy of any Pakistani election. In private, they say that true democracy cannot exist in a country where 50 percent of the population is illiterate. General Musharraf and his supporters accuse the politicians of looting the country and bringing it near ruin when they ran it in the 1990's.
 Haji Mohammad Nawaz, a 55-year-old driver of an motorized rickshaw, said the new system injected fresh life into Pakistani politics, but only on one level. ''There is more participation at the local level,'' he said. ''But the people sitting at the top, that's not democracy.''
 Campaigning in his neighborhood, Mr. Khan, like any clever local politician, declined to discuss national politics. He identified himself as an independent. 
 At dusk in his neighborhood, Mr. Khan set out about his task -- winning re-election -- and engaged in a local form of campaigning known as a ''corner meeting.'' He and his family sat with supporters in his open-air ''central election office,'' an empty lot on the neighborhood's main thoroughfare with a dozen plastic chairs and a white banner declaring his candidacy.
 Until midnight, Mr. Khan would sip tea and Pepsi with virtually anyone who cared to stop by. He would ask how people's families were faring, try to identify and solve neighborhood problems and do his best to build support. Up and down the street, his three rivals did the same.
 ''This is true democracy,'' Mr. Khan explained. ''People have easy access to their representatives.''

HEADLINE: Computer Majors Adding Other Skills to Land Jobs 

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Jamika Burge is heading back to Virginia Tech this fall to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science, but her research is spiced with anthropology, sociology, psychology, psycholinguistics -- as well as observing cranky couples trade barbs in computer instant messages. 
 ''It's so not programming,'' Ms. Burge said. ''If I had to sit down and code all day, I never would have continued. This is not traditional computer science.''
For students like Ms. Burge, expanding their expertise beyond computer programming is crucial to future job security as advances in the Internet and low-cost computers make it easier to shift some technology jobs to nations with well-educated engineers and lower wages, like India and China. 
 ''If you have only technical knowledge, you are vulnerable,'' said Thomas W. Malone, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of ''The Future of Work'' (Harvard Business School Press, 2004). ''But if you can combine business or scientific knowledge with technical savvy, there are a lot of opportunities. And it's a lot harder to move that kind of work offshore.'' 
 Ms. Burge's research, for example, is in a hot niche called computer-supported cooperative work, which studies the ways people use technology to communicate and collaborate in work groups and social networks. She spent the summer as a research intern for I.B.M., and her job prospects seem bright. 
 On campuses today, the newest technologists have to become renaissance geeks. They have to understand computing, but they also typically need deep knowledge of some other field, from biology to business, Wall Street to Hollywood. And they tend to focus less on the tools of technology than on how technology is used in the search for scientific breakthroughs, the development of new products and services, or the way work is done.
 Not all of them are even headed for computer careers. Many are going into medicine, law, media and arts as well as other scientific fields. 
 For people who stay in computing, the job outlook is brightest for those skilled in the application of technology. While jobs in categories like programming have declined since 2000, according to the Labor Department, the need for information technology experts has not. 
 In fact, jobs that involve tailoring information technology to specific industries or companies, like software engineers who make applications and specialized systems, have grown. Total employment among information technology professionals, the government reports, reached nearly 3.5 million by the end of last year, surpassing the previous high in 2000, when the technology investment boom peaked. 
 At the same time, the march of computing is rippling across all academic disciplines. Even as computer science students are being encouraged to take more courses outside their major, students in other disciplines are finding more often that they need to use, design and sometimes write computer programs.
 Several universities, for example, are developing multidisciplinary courses in ''services science.'' The idea is to combine research in the social sciences, management, engineering and computing to pursue insights, innovations and increased productivity in the huge services sector of the economy, which now employs more than 80 percent of American workers. The University of California, Berkeley will offer a services science graduate course in the coming academic year. 
 Of course, such multidisciplinary shifts are still predicated on a solid grounding in computing. And there are worries that too few students are getting a technical education. While the need for technical expertise is growing, the number of students choosing computer science as a major is 39 percent lower than in the fall of 2000, the last of the dot-com bubble years, according to the Computing Research Association.
 This trend has troubled Bill Gates, the co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, who traveled to several elite universities in a campaign-style tour in the spring of 2004 to stir up enthusiasm for computer science. He plans another campus tour this fall. 
 ''There isn't the buzz and excitement about computer science that there should be,'' he said. ''We're on the threshold of extraordinary advances in computing that will affect not only the sciences but also how we work and our culture. We need to get the brightest people working on those opportunities.''
 To help reverse three years of steep decline in the major at M.I.T., professors there met with freshmen last fall to extol the virtues of computer science. In one such gathering, John V. Guttag, a professor, brought pizza and soft drinks to a freshman dormitory. Professor Guttag spoke and so did a heart surgeon from Massachusetts General Hospital, who had majored in computer science as an undergraduate at M.I.T.
 ''The idea was to give them a sense of what you can do with a computer science degree,'' Mr. Guttag recalled. ''It doesn't mean you're going to turn into Dilbert.''
 Ken Michelson, a computer science major at the University of Washington, is entering medical school at Columbia University in New York this month. Mr. Michelson caught the computing bug early, starting to program simple games and puzzles as a 9-year-old. 
 His computer science training, Mr. Michelson said, will also be useful in medicine, especially ''in the way you learn to attack and break down complex problems.'' 
 Edward D. Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington, points to students like Mr. Michelson as computer science success stories. The real value of the discipline, Mr. Lazowska said, is less in acquiring a skill with technology tools -- the usual definition of computer literacy -- than in teaching students to manage complexity; to navigate and assess information; to master modeling and abstraction; and to think analytically in terms of algorithms, or step-by-step procedures. 
 Educating the engineers who design and build computers and software will remain important, Mr. Lazowska emphasized, ''but we need to be educating everyone else, too.'' 
 For Kira Lehtomaki, it was the advance of digital technology into animation that pulled her toward computing. Ms. Lehtomaki, a 23-year-old post-graduate researcher at the University of Washington's animation research labs, says she recalls wanting to be an animator after being enthralled by ''Sleeping Beauty'' as a 3-year-old. Growing up, she drew constantly, and even took a summer job at Disneyland as ''cookie artist'' -- painting designs and Mickey Mouse faces in frosting -- because that job allowed her to spend a couple of days observing animators at Disney's studio in Burbank, Calif. 
 As hand-drawn animation gave way to computer-generated animation, Ms. Lehtomaki took up computer graphics in college. ''These two worlds of art and computing are really merging, and, if anything, they will blend even more,'' she said.
 The same is true in other fields. In biology, DNA code can be explored and simulated in computer code. Drug discovery and chemical analysis rely on computer simulations, as do weather prediction and oil exploration. Even the automobile -- now largely controlled and monitored by a network of microprocessors and software -- has become a computer on wheels.
 ''Computing has become the third pillar of science, along with theory and experiment,'' observed Daniel A. Reed, director of the Renaissance Computing Institute, a collaboration of researchers from the University of North Carolina, Duke University and North Carolina State University. 
 Having an understanding of information technology has become critical in many jobs that do not involve programming. Brian Randles, 27, for example, is a business consultant at I.B.M. based in Dublin, Ohio, working mostly with banks to use technology to fine-tune their marketing and improve their customer service.
 As part of I.B.M.'s big services unit, he and other team members work on projects that can last up to a year. It is face-to-face work, constantly dealing with both the business and technical experts at the banks. Someone like Mr. Randles, industry analysts say, can make $90,000 a year or more.
 Mr. Randles started playing with a home computer as an 8-year-old, he recalled. He did some programming for a high school science project and took an introductory computer science course at Otterbein College in Westerville, Ohio. He said he enjoyed dabbling with computers, but considered it mostly a hobby. He majored in business. 
 His perspective changed because of a summer job with a retail consultant that was using product tags equipped with radio frequency identification, or RFID, to track goods and streamline the shipment of supplies. ''That's when it started to click for me, seeing how the technology and business blended together and worked,'' he recalled.
 At I.B.M., Mr. Randles has been trained in the basics of banking and insurance as well as in technical fields like databases and data mapping. 
 The lesson he has learned so far in his few years in the modern work force? ''You've got to constantly keep learning,'' he said. ''If I'm with I.B.M. or not, I've got to constantly upgrade my skills. That's what gives you that edge.''

HEADLINE: The Process in Place

BYLINE: By Rose Gottemoeller. 
Rose Gottemoeller, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was responsible for nonproliferation policy at the Department of Energy from 1997 to 2000.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
NEGOTIATORS in Beijing have left the most recent round of the six-nation talks on stability and nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula confronted with a North Korean demand that they could have seen coming. Pyongyang wants to retain the right to build light-water reactors and wants the other parties in the talks -- China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and especially the United States -- to guarantee that right.
 The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty does allow its signatories access to peaceful nuclear technologies, which was an important incentive for the states that do not possess nuclear weapons to join the treaty regime in the first place. North Korea, however, withdrew from the treaty in 2003 and subsequently declared itself to have nuclear weapons, so whether it should benefit from peaceful nuclear technology cooperation with the rest of the world is a legitimate question. The Bush administration quite clearly believes that the North Koreans should not, a position that long predates the current round of negotiations. 
It seems a shame, however, to let this issue produce an impasse, since the North Koreans have reiterated their willingness to eliminate their nuclear weapons program, and the United States has shown new flexibility in its willingness to talk directly to them. This is a basis on which to build progress, not to walk away.
 Sometimes in a difficult negotiation it makes the most sense to point silently to a principle already established and then move to bolster that principle from an entirely new direction. In the case of North Korea, we are lucky enough to have the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or KEDO, which was established under the Clinton administration to build light-water reactors in North Korea. It has been derided by the Bush administration from the outset as a hapless giveaway that only encouraged the North Koreans to misbehave. 
 Despite this sharp criticism, the Bush administration has not killed the organization outright. The current position of the Bush team is that the organization is in a holding pattern, pending developments with North Korea. The light-water reactor construction project has been suspended, but preservation and maintenance work at the site continues. According to the organization, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, ''Suspension implies that KEDO and the D.P.R.K. will continue to observe the applicable provisions of the agreements and protocols concluded between them.''
 The Bush administration would not have to embrace the organization with any new enthusiasm. It would only have to permit this arrangement to continue -- silently allowing the principle to stand. 
 Next would come the interesting part -- building up the principle from another direction.
 The crux of the Bush administration's concern has been that cooperative projects in the nuclear arena would somehow abet Pyongyang in its drive for the bomb. But a lot can be done in the world of peaceful nuclear cooperation that does not involve light-water reactors or technology that might have application to a nuclear weapons program. Medicine, agriculture, industry and mining applications -- these are all nuclear research areas of great utility to the North Korean economy that would not lead to a nuclear bomb.
 Once again, Washington already has a mechanism at hand, a well-established program that would open new directions for peaceful nuclear cooperation with North Korea at very little cost. The Sister Laboratory program was first organized in the 1980's under the Energy Department to fulfill an obligation under the nonproliferation treaty to share peaceful uses of nuclear technology. It brings together experts in American national laboratories with their counterparts in developing countries. In the nine countries where sister laboratories are in place, projects include radioisotope production, nuclear waste management and environmental, safety and health surveillance.
 The point of the Sister Laboratory program is to build mutual confidence and transparency in a low-key way, without major transfers of funds, equipment or materials. The focus is on exchanges between scientists and on developing new areas of collaboration, including longer-term spinoffs. This message should be very welcome to the North Koreans. The United States, in its turn, has been able to leverage the relationships to establish new joint work in the nonproliferation arena -- exactly the goal that Washington seeks with North Korea.
 If the United States decides to introduce the Sister Laboratory concept into the six-nation talks, it need not do so alone. We already have rich and productive scientist-to-scientist cooperation with several of our negotiating partners, which could share the risks of developing such an endeavor with North Korea. Indeed, Russia has particularly good contacts with North Korean scientists, many of whom trained at Russian universities in the Soviet era. 
 When the six-nation talks resume in a week or so, they need to build momentum in a way that does not cost any one participant too much political capital. The United States should be satisfied that no light-water reactors will be built in North Korea for the foreseeable future. The North Koreans, in turn, should be satisfied that they are still in the running for peaceful nuclear cooperation. 
 The trick will be to ensure that this satisfaction quietly grows into mutual confidence, creating the conditions under which North Korea will give up its military nuclear program and join in broader cooperation with its neighbors and the United States.

HEADLINE: Medicare Law Prompts a Rush For Lobbyists 

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
The new Medicare law has touched off explosive growth in lobbying by the health care industry, whose spending on advocacy here far exceeds that of consumer groups and other industries like defense and banking.
 Almost every week the federal government issues new rules or guidelines to carry out the 2003 law, which provides a drug benefit starting in January. To keep track of the new rules and to decipher their meaning is a full-time job for hundreds of lawyers and lobbyists, who regularly seek changes advantageous to their clients.
With hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, health care providers, insurers, drug makers and pharmacies are continually trying to influence rules for the drug benefit and other initiatives authorized by the law.
 ''You see a real surge in health care lobbying because that's where the money is,'' said Frederick H. Graefe, a lobbyist for hospitals and makers of medical equipment. ''Twenty years ago the defense industry was dominant and had the most lobbyists, the big players. Now it's health care.'' 
 Last year alone, the health care industry spent $325 million -- more than any other sector -- in its efforts to influence Congress and federal agencies, according to Political Money Line, a nonpartisan group that studies reports filed with Congress by lobbyists and their clients. 
 Drug companies led the way. They reported spending $86.9 million on lobbying last year, followed by hospitals with $55 million and doctors with $35.4 million. 
 Lobbying Congress nowadays often means persuading lawmakers to make telephone calls to Bush administration officials on behalf of clients concerned about specific issues, like the Medicare payment for a drug or a medical device.
 The pinpoint focus of much lobbying is illustrated by the case of Lexapro, an antidepressant made by Forest Laboratories. The Bush administration has said that Medicare drug plans must cover ''substantially all'' antidepressants, but not necessarily Lexapro, a drug widely prescribed for depression and anxiety among older adults. Claudia Schlosberg, a lawyer with Blank Rome who represents Forest Laboratories, has been pressing Medicare officials to reverse that decision and has obtained letters from several members of Congress supporting the company's position in favor of covering Lexapro.
 ''Every health care interest has a voice on Capitol Hill,'' said Elizabeth J. Fowler, a lawyer who recently left the Democratic staff of the Senate Finance Committee to join a consulting firm. ''What you lose in the process is consumer and beneficiary voices. We heard a lot more from industry interests than from beneficiaries.''
 Chris Jennings, who became a lobbyist after serving as health policy coordinator for President Bill Clinton, said: ''The proliferation of health care lobbyists produces specialization. The broader good is often lost as people focus on next year's Medicare reimbursement rate for a specific group of health care providers, or a regulation to be issued next month.''
 The health care industry is subject to pervasive federal regulation, and the government sets prices for many goods and services provided to the elderly under Medicare. But the Bush administration and the Republican majority in Congress are receptive to advice from the industry, including private insurers who will deliver the drug benefit.
 ''The success of the new Medicare law depends on a robust partnership between government and the private sector,'' said Stacey Hughes, a partner in the lobbying firm established by former Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma.
 Health policy experts and officials said the growth of health care lobbying reflected several trends:
 Congress earmarks more and more money each year for specific hospitals, medical schools and health care projects. Health care providers and local officials have a better chance to obtain such largess if they retain lobbyists to plump for their projects on Capitol Hill.
 Lobbying has become more substantive. To buttress their arguments, lobbyists need data, cost estimates and economic analyses of health policy proposals. They retain expert consultants to prepare such reports.
 Lobbyists have adopted many techniques of political campaigns. They hire pollsters and buy advertising to sway public opinion and pressure Congress.
 Many lobbyists have carved a niche for themselves by focusing on one party, one house of Congress, one Congressional committee or a handful of influential lawmakers.
 Carol A. McDaid, a health care lobbyist at Capitol Decisions, a subsidiary of the Van Scoyoc Companies, said, ''It's become so sophisticated that, in preparation for a critical vote, a big health care or pharmaceutical company will hire a different firm to lobby each key member of an important committee, like the Ways and Means Committee.''
 The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America reported spending $15.5 million on lobbying last year, while two of its members, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, spent $5.6 million apiece and Johnson & Johnson spent $4.5 million. 
 Other heavyweight lobbies included the American Medical Association, which spent $18.5 million last year, and America's Health Insurance Plans, which spent $5.6 million, about the same amount as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. 
 By contrast, AARP, the lobby for older Americans, spent $8 million. The American Cancer Society spent $2.6 million, the American Heart Association spent $1 million and Families USA, the liberal group that calls itself a voice for health care consumers, reported spending $40,000.
 Alan B. Mertz, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, said the advocacy budget for his group had more than tripled, to $2.5 million this year from $750,000 in 2002. ''We had to beef up our advocacy to deal with threats to our Medicare reimbursement,'' Mr. Mertz said, noting that Medicare payments for laboratory tests had been frozen through 2008.
 Lobbyists said it made sense for their clients to pour money into lobbying because so much money was at stake. Health care accounts for more than 15 percent of the nation's economy, and private insurers often look to Medicare as a guide in deciding what services to cover and how much to pay.
 Moreover, the federal role is growing. Medicare and Medicaid will account for 37 percent of all spending on prescription drugs next year, up from 20 percent this year, said Stephen Heffler, an economist at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
 The Bush administration and the Congressional Budget Office say Medicare will spend more than $1 trillion on prescription drugs in the next 10 years, with outlays topping $100 billion a year after 2009. 
 Two linguistic changes show how health care lobbyists have emerged as a potent force. Lobbyists and trade associations, once seen as special interests, are now called ''stakeholders,'' with a legitimate claim to be heard in the policy-making process.
 ''Expanding coverage'' used to mean providing health insurance to people who had none. But lobbyists now use the term in a different sense. When they speak of ''coverage expansions,'' they mean that Medicare should cover, or pay for, new technology like PET scans, implantable defibrillators and drug-coated stents to treat clogged arteries.
 Political campaign contributions are frequently coordinated with lobbying campaigns. Lobbyists often hold fund-raisers at the request of members of Congress, as allowed by campaign finance laws. They are expected to contribute money from their own pockets and to raise money from clients.
 "You increase your influence and access by doing fund-raisers,'' said James C. Pyles, a lawyer and lobbyist for psychoanalysts andhome care agencies. ''If you're not on the donor list, you don't have much access.''
 Ms. McDaid, who lobbies for hospitals and ambulance companies, said: ''In the old days, the requests for political giving went mainly to your clients' political action committees. Now health care lobbyists have to tithe personally. The bigger your client base, the more pressure there is to give. It's not unusual for a lobbyist at a big firm to give $25,000 to $50,000 in personal contributions to Congressional candidates in a two-year election cycle.''
 The growing prominence of health care issues on the national agenda has created an unquenchable demand for lobbyists. New issues include bioterrorism, stem cells, health information technology, the privacy of medical records, television advertising of prescription drugs and the importing of drugs from Canada.
 Republicans are in demand at lobbying firms and trade associations, but so are knowledgeable Democrats.
 John E. McManus, who formed his own lobbying firm after working for Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee, received a total of $620,000 last year from the American Medical Association, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and several drug companies, including Merck and Genentech. Mr. McManus can help them navigate the new Medicare law because, as a Congressional aide, he helped write it.
 On the other side of the political spectrum, David H. Nexon, a health policy adviser to Senator Edward M. Kennedy for more than two decades, stepped down in February to become senior executive vice president of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, the lobby for makers of medical devices like Medtronic and Guidant.
 Charles M. Brain, director of legislative affairs for President Clinton, reported that he got $240,000 last year for representing the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Stephen J. Ricchetti, deputy chief of staff in the Clinton White House, lobbies for Eli Lilly & Company, Novartis and Pfizer.
 Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said health lobbying had become more partisan.
 ''We hire Republicans to lobby Republican members of Congress and Democrats to work Democratic offices,'' Mr. Pollack said. 
 The Generic Pharmaceutical Association has retained Mr. Jennings and Mark W. Isakowitz to lobby for legislation to increase the use of generic drugs. As a White House aide, Mr. Jennings helped devise the Clinton plan for universal health insurance. As a lobbyist at the National Federation of Independent Business, Mr. Isakowitz, a Republican, helped defeat the Clinton plan.
 As the costs of Medicare and Medicaid soar, federal prosecutors and members of Congress are investigating fraud and abuse with new zeal. Many health care companies find they need more lawyers and lobbyists to cope.
 In a recent advertisement recruiting lawyers for its Washington office, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, one of the nation's largest law firms, said its health care practice had ''experienced tremendous growth.''

HEADLINE: City and State Comptrollers Oppose M.T.A.'s Railyard Plan 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The city and state comptrollers of New York have both come out against a plan by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to use most of its surplus to build a big deck over its West Side railyard and then sell a developer the right to build commercial and apartment buildings over the deck.
 Both officials said the proposal, which would represent an unusual foray by the authority into real estate development, involved too much risk. They suggested that the authority instead hold a competition among developers, who would take on the challenge of building the deck as part of their proposals. 
The Jets football team suggested doing just that -- building a deck and putting a new football stadium over it -- but leaders of the State Legislature rejected its plan in June.
 Last month, the authority predicted that because of surging tax revenues and low interest rates, it would have an $833 million surplus this year. Officials warned, though, that neither condition was likely to last, and said that they still planned to proceed with fare and toll increases in 2007 and 2009. 
 In a telephone interview yesterday, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. said that instead of using much of the surplus to build a deck, the authority should pay off some of its debt and delay or reduce any proposed fare and toll increases. Mr. Thompson, in a letter to the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, called the deck proposal, which will not be voted on until December, ''highly speculative.'' 
 ''While it may enhance the M.T.A.'s ability to sell development rights on the site, there is no guarantee that there will be demand for the site at or near the time such a project is completed,'' he wrote. ''As we are all painfully aware, the M.T.A.'s track record on real estate development is not encouraging.'' 
 State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who had a public feud with the authority in 2003 over its financial management, also said the proposal for a deck was too risky. 
 ''I am in favor of the M.T.A. getting the maximum possible benefit from all its unused assets, including the West Side railyard, but the M.T.A. should not be involved in real estate speculation,'' he said in a statement yesterday. Mr. Hevesi first raised such objections in a July 31 interview on WNBC-TV. 
 A spokesman for the authority, Tom Kelly, said the criticisms were premature because its board would not vote on next year's budget for four months. 
 He noted that its executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, had presented a second alternative for use of the surplus: to pay part of an unfunded pension liability. 
 ''Our most ardent critics think the concept is worthy of debate and would provide much-needed capital funds for now and the future,'' Mr. Kelly said of the first proposal. ''We do not intend to build the deck ourselves. It would be put out for a competition, as would any development that went on at the site.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Spending Habit Roils Plan to Sell Big Bank 

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: KOBE, Japan 

 BODY:
Red and white loading cranes loomed like steel sentinels over an empty wharf on a recent afternoon here. Capable of unloading shipping containers at a rate of almost one a minute, these computerized towers often stand frozen for days at a time for lack of ships. 
 Kobe's ranking in world container traffic tumbled to 43rd place last year, from 4th in 1980. Though Kobe's importance as a port started waning in the early 1990's, government bureaucrats responded to the 1995 earthquake here by renovating and expanding the port -- to the tune of $50 billion.
Kobe's idle cranes and deserted wharves are emblems of a broader habit in Japan: spending lavishly on public projects that may or may not have much use, let alone economic return. Given the country's dependence on such building, the proposed sale of Japan Post, a linchpin for government spending, has ignited a political firestorm. 
 Japan Post, which still delivers the nation's mail, is also Japan's largest savings bank, with $3 trillion in assets, and sells insurance as well. The question posed by its sale is, Will Japan take a decisive turn toward free markets and privatize Japan Post, converting the world's largest state-run bank into the world's largest private bank? Or will the country continue as a semi-socialist economy where bureaucrats and politicians make multibillion-dollar investments with little regard to the country's economic health?
 An arcane issue to outsiders, the privatization of Japan Post was volcanic enough in Japan to start a revolt in the country's parliament, the Diet, among members of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has held almost uninterrupted power here for the last half-century. Fearful of losing access to Japan Post's assets, Upper House members rejected a privatization bill on Aug. 8. 
 For Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who first called for postal privatization in 1992, it looked like the defeat of a lifetime dream. But, breaking with Japan's tradition of bland consensus politics, he responded that very day with a huge political gamble. He dissolved the Lower House, called an election for Sept. 11 and kicked 37 legislators who had voted against privatization out of the party. ''The post office has been the big piggy bank for the bureaucrats and the politicians,'' said Alex Kerr, an American who chronicled in his book ''Dogs and Demons'' the long-running love affair between Japan's politicians and concrete. ''The politicians really depended on the flow of these funds.''
 Although Japan's landscape is littered with modern monuments to the construction state, engineers continue to build what some observers lampoon as ''bullet trains to nowhere.''
 In Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture, authorities recently inaugurated a 1.2-mile bridge to Kourijima Island. It is billed as the nation's longest toll-free bridge, and it is easy to see why no one expected to recoup the investment through tolls. The $250 million bridge serves an island with a population of 361.
 In Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost prefecture, work started in May on a 10-year, $4.3 billion project to extend bullet train service north to Hakodate, population 280,000. Running 92.5 miles, the new line is budgeted to cost $46 million a mile.
 After decades of spending on public works, Japan's government debt is 150 percent of its gross domestic product, the highest for a major developed economy. The weight of this debt, compounded by the shrinking of Japan's work force and by politicians' resistance to changes that would enhance productivity, will give Japan, through 2010, the lowest per capita growth rate among 30 major economies, according to an economic forecast issued in May by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 Although Japan's economy is growing at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent, the economy has been in recession for almost half of the 14 years since the stock and real estate bubble burst in 1991.
 ''We have wasted an insane amount of money,'' Robert A. Feldman, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Japan, said in an interview. ''Health care is being starved to keep the postal system, the roads and bridges around. In a country with a shrinking, aging population, this system is going to lower living standards.''
 The bill for those projects will be increasingly difficult to pay. Over the next decade, the number of Japanese workers is expected to decline by four million.
 Yet the building continues. Japan, which is slightly larger than Italy, has 83 airports. Five more are under construction. Although the Kansai International Airport in Osaka has yet to make a profit after a decade in operation, Nagoya recently opened its own $7.3 billion international airport, only 80 miles away. 
 In 2006, Kobe is to open a multibillion-dollar domestic airport about 20 miles away from Kansai. In 2007, Kansai will counterattack with a new runway. Both airports are built on expensive landfill, the kind of base that turned to mush during the 1995 earthquake in Kobe.
 ''Kansai International Airport is a massive economic failure with hardly the number of flights predicted for it,'' Mr. Kerr, the American author, said. ''It has not become the international hub it was supposed to be, and now Kobe is building a new airport right next door.''
 Japanese airports, notably in Tokyo and Osaka, charge the highest landing fees in the world. In this environment, Japanese cities often build their airfields of dreams, only to discover that the passengers do not come. About 75 miles southwest of here, Okayama spent $310 million in 2001 for a nearly two-mile international runway. Today, international service is limited to one daily flight to Seoul and one to Shanghai.
 In Kobe, the overinvestment in the port was obvious on a recent motorboat tour of the harbor, a bay that opened to foreign ships in 1868.
 ''Most of the cranes are up -- up means no ship,'' Takashi Shimada said during one of his last tours as director general of Kobe Port and Harbor Office. After the earthquake, he recalled, ''the facilities were completely restored, but the cargo did not come back.'' 
 Even though Kobe's cargo traffic stagnated in the early 1990's, shipping lines still concentrated regional cargo here for shipping overseas. But when the earthquake halted most operations at the port, Japanese companies discovered they could send their goods to places like Pusan, South Korea, for shipment to the United States and Europe, and it was faster and cheaper.
 ''Idle gantry cranes are the true situation in Kobe,'' Makoto Kobukata, general manager of Maersk Kobe Terminal, said. ''There is about 20 percent usage for each crane.''
 At the time of the earthquake a decade ago, an astute private sector analyst might have warned that Kobe's ship had sailed. In the port's economic hinterland, Hyogo Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture, industrial production had been declining from a 1991 peak. By 2003, the combined production of both areas was down nearly one-third from 1991.
 Today, despite the overbuilding, the construction machine still rolls along, seemingly on autopilot. A massive landfill operation is under way to build new wharves in deep water, betting on what may be slim odds that Kobe will one day attract the new supersize container ships.
 With such white elephants taking shape before the public's eyes, austerity is catching on.
 Despite the political firestorm, Mr. Koizumi's election call has been greeted with advances in Japan's stock market and upticks in polls charting public and business approval ratings for his cabinet.
 ''We are at a turning point of our era,'' Mr. Koizumi said Friday on releasing his party's platform. ''Privatization of the post office is the first step toward the reconstruction of Japan's politics and economy.'' 
 The Democratic Party of Japan, the main opposition party, has jumped on the antispending bandwagon, vowing to cut public spending by $90 billion by 2008, to cut public works spending in half, to cut the salaries of civil servants 20 percent and to cut postal savings deposits in half over the next eight years. The party now says it voted against the prime minister's Japan Post privatization bill because it did not go far enough.
 With voters suddenly focused on public spending, newspaper editorials talk about the need to break up the iron triangle of bureaucrats, politicians and government-dependent businesses.
 ''It is called irrigating your own rice field at the expense of others,'' said Mr. Feldman, the economist. ''But there is actually a much deeper political philosophy debate going on now. It is market-oriented policies versus bureaucratic control.''

HEADLINE: New York to London In Your Private Suite 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
WITH crowds and missed connections, desperation and short tempers, strikes and threats of strikes, the scenes at airports this summer have sometimes resembled the fall of Saigon, to borrow an image often employed by Michael Boyd, the air-travel consultant.
 Beneath the tumult is a treasure of opportunity for airlines that know how to seize it. With international travel booming, there is money to be made in providing comfort and style to business executives who want to be pampered on long voyages.
The most recent example of the race to gain their allegiance was an announcement by American Airlines last week that it was refurbishing first-class and business-class cabins on 767's and 777's starting next year. American said international routes would account for 30 percent of its seat capacity by the end of this year. 
 The trans-Atlantic routes are considered to be the most profitable of all, but the competition for customers is brutal. Now, a start-up airline called Eos says it is prepared to make it a bit more brutal. Starting around Sept. 15, pending expected regulatory approval, Eos plans to start flying Boeing 757's between New York and London outfitted with just 48 seats, about a fourth of the 180 to 200 crammed into the cabins of most long-haul 757's.
 The idea, says David J. Spurlock, the Eos founder and chief executive, is to grab a small chunk of that crucial route. Eos, he said in an interview here last week at the annual convention of the National Business Travel Association, will be ''a premium airline purposely designed to bring value to the international business traveler who demands a high degree of service.''
 ''Southwest Airlines freed the short-haul economy-based traveler from the grip of the traditional airlines,'' he said. ''We seek to do the same thing for the long-haul business traveler.''
 Eos will be compete with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the current favorites of business travelers on the New York-London circuit. The extra space is the major selling point for passengers who want to work or relax in more comfort than even the most popular competing business-class cabins, and at competitive fares. The published round-trip business-class fare is now about $8,000, though big-volume customers can negotiate that down to $6,000 or less.
 But Mr. Spurlock, a former director of strategy for British Airways, indicated that the fare on Eos would start in the $6,000 range. ''We have committed publicly to fares 25 percent below existing rack rates'' on the top carriers, he said.
 Among Eos's attractions are new flat-bed seats in private suites that provide passengers with 21 square feet of space. I tried out the seat last week. There's actually enough room to hold a conference with a colleague sitting in a fold-down seat, without touching knees.
 Eos, with $185 million in initial financing, is now installing the seats in its three 757's. Once in operation, Eos will fly once daily each way between Kennedy International Airport and Stansted Airport outside London.
 The industry has more than a few sad stories of innovative premium start-ups that faltered. The names MGM Grand and Legend Air come to mind. Fly First, a premium carrier based in Scotland that plans to operate between London and Newark, recently postponed its first flight until it could raise more money.
 Last week, Mr. Spurlock announced the departure ''by mutual agreement'' of the Eos president, Bonnie Reitz, a former vice president for marketing at Continental. Colleagues said she was eager to return full-time to a consulting business she runs. 
 Will Eos find a profitable niche? ''I think they're putting their toe in a deep and lucrative market that Dave Spurlock knows real well'' from his background with British Airways, said Robert W. Mann Jr., an industry consultant. He added: ''They will have difficulties with the big network guys who can out-schedule them and out-loyalty-program them. But my take is that the market is sufficiently deep and their need for the crumbs is sufficiently small that as long as they stay on target and deliver the service, I think their prospects are pretty good.''
 Mr. Spurlock said Eos expected to make arrangements with another premium airline to provide preflight access to an airport lounge at Kennedy. Each flight will have four flight attendants, and he said initial expectations were that passenger loads would be in the range of 30 to 35.
 John Lampl, a spokesman for British Airways, which is recovering from several days of delays and backups caused by a recent strike by caterers, was noncommittal. ''It'll be very interesting to watch,'' Mr. Lampl said. ''Actually, competition makes us sharper. We'll just have to see how he does.''

PERSON: Sumner M. Rosen

HEADLINE: Sumner Rosen, 82, Professor Of Social Policy at Columbia 

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Sumner M. Rosen, a prominent political economist and a longtime advocate of social policies to benefit working people, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
 The cause of death was cancer, his family said. 
At his death, Dr. Rosen was emeritus professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, where he had taught social policy for nearly two decades. Among the issues with which he was most closely associated were joblessness, workers' rights, health care policy, the global economy and the economics of disarmament. 
 Dr. Rosen was a founder and board member of the Five Borough Institute, a public policy organization based in New York City that studies urban economic issues and their effect on the lives of working people. He was also a founder and vice-chairman of the National Jobs for All Coalition, which advocates full employment at livable wages.
 Last year, Dr. Rosen, a decorated World War II veteran, helped found Purple Heart Veterans Against the War, which opposes the United States' military involvement in Iraq.
 Sumner Maurice Rosen was born in Boston on June 17, 1923. During World War II, he served with the Army Infantry in Europe and was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge. He was awarded a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts.
 Dr. Rosen earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard in 1948 and a Ph.D. in labor economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959. He married Judith Davidoff, a musician, in 1949; she is a noted cellist and viola da gamba player. Besides Ms. Davidoff, Dr. Rosen is survived by a son, Max, of Manhattan; a daughter, Rebekah Rosen-Gomez, of Jamestown, R.I.; and two grandchildren.
 During the 1960's, Dr. Rosen worked in the research department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and was research director of New York University's New Careers Development Center, which offered job training for the chronically poor. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1975, retiring in 1993. Dr. Rosen also taught at Rutgers University, Brooklyn College and Northeastern University.
 Dr. Rosen edited several books, including ''Economic Power Failure: The Current American Crisis'' (McGraw-Hill, 1975) and, with Aaron W. Warner and Mathew Forstater, ''Commitment to Full Employment: The Economics and Social Policy of William S. Vickrey'' (M.E. Sharpe, 2000).

HEADLINE: As Students Start Shopping for Back-to-School, Denim Rules

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
So far, retail analysts say, soaring gas prices are not putting much of a dent in back-to-school sales. 
 Although August sales data is not in yet, the analysts expect sales to exceed last year's, although they disagreed in their estimates of how much greater they will be. What they did agree on was that students of all ages were stocking up on denim -- jeans, mostly, but also jackets and skirts in dozens of washes, often with colorful designs sewn on.
They added that college students, who account for more than half of the multibillion-dollar sales for back-to-school season, will help bolster revenue with the purchases of computers, MP3 players and televisions, along with furniture and linens to decorate their dorm rooms and apartments. 
 The National Retail Federation, the industry's trade association, offered the most optimistic forecast, saying that sales will be 18 percent greater than last year, driven by the back-to-college sales. 
 Others were more measured in their predictions. Carl Steidtmann, the chief economist at Deloitte Research, said he expected general merchandise and apparel sales to increase by 4.5 or 5 percent, while Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, predicted only a 2 percent rise, translating into average spending of about $372 per child.
 Back-to-school sales are normally the second highest of the year for many retailers, after winter holiday sales, and they offer an indication of what to expect of consumer spending for the rest of the year. One factor this season may be the continued strength in the housing market, analysts said, which makes consumers feel that they can afford to buy plenty of back-to-school items.
 The analysts said July's sales totals were lower than they had hoped, even though retailers, like American Eagle and Abercrombie, which focus on teenagers, had double-digit increases over last July. 
 ''No one feels like it's going to blow the numbers out of the water compared to last year,'' said Kim Picciola, a retail analyst at Morningstar, the financial research company. ''We think back-to-school got off to a pretty slow start in July, but we're expecting retailers will make up some of the lost ground in August.''
 Shoppers at the Stamford Town Center mall in Connecticut this past weekend said the rising gas prices were not forcing them to trim spending on their children's school needs.
 ''We'll try to cut corners somewhere else, probably,'' said Manjusha Kothari, whose daughter will be in prekindergarten this fall. ''It's the first time she'll be going to school. I'm more excited for her than she is.''
 Retailers said that they expected Nike shock shoes, track jackets and blazers to be big sellers this year. But the hottest items, they said, are made of denim, for boys and girls of all ages. 
 ''Denim is always a big back-to-school item classification; it's what high school and college kids wear,'' said Thomas D. Lennox, a spokesman for Abercrombie. ''This year, it's just a much bigger deal.''
 Even The Children's Place, which caters to young children, is displaying lots of denim skirts, skorts, jackets and pants. The retailer said it also expected to see more sales of wheeled backpacks, which have been increasing in popularity against traditional backpacks.
 Pacific Sunwear of California, which caters to teenagers, expanded its blue-jean options after the chain found last year that it did not meet demand for more variety in designs, said Gar Jackson, director of investor relations for Pacific Sunwear. 
 This year's jeans come in dozens of shades and cuts, often with sequins or designs sewn on. Some stores feature jeans with tears and holes while others feature a straight-leg cut. Most of the jeans are selling for $50 to $100, which is substantially more than the cost of an undecorated pair of jeans. 
 Macy's West Coast division has found that shoppers are willing to spend an average of $10 more for jeans than they did last year, said Michelle Monigal, vice president of merchandising young men for Macy's on the West Coast.
 ''I don't know why, but I'm a big sucker for expensive jeans,'' said Stephanie Sara, a 15-year-old shopper from Darien, Conn. 
 She said she would use money from her summer job at a library to buy several pairs of the new jeans.
 Still, many stores are already offering promotions to attract customers. Gap stores are offering a free iTunes download to each customer who tries on a pair of its featured jeans. American Eagle has put all of its jeans on sale.
 Robert F. Buchanan, senior retail analyst for A.G. Edwards & Sons, said that retailers had been starting back-to-school season earlier and earlier each year and that they were starting the sales season before many consumers were ready to buy. This leaves the stores with lots of merchandise on their racks that they are eager to sell, he said.
 Even though high gas prices may not be damping back-to-school spending, the analysts said continued high prices could take more of a toll on holiday shopping.
 Wal-Mart, for one, said in its second-quarter conference call last week that the growth of its sales for the rest of the year might slow in response to the pump prices.
 But college students propel much of the spending in the back-to-school season, using earnings from summer jobs, and they are less sensitive to gas prices, Mr. Buchanan said. 
 The National Retail Federation predicts that 40 percent of the $34 billion in spending on back-to-college items will be done by students. It is forecasting that college-related sales will increase by 33 percent over last year. 
 But the federation said it thought spending on students in kindergarten through 12th grade would decrease by 8 percent because many parents who bought electronics last year would not need to replace them yet. Students heading off to college, by contrast, often need items that duplicate what their families already have, said Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for the group.

HEADLINE: Slight Shift In S.U.V.'s In New Rule On Mileage 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and JOHN M. BRODER; Danny Hakim reported from Chicago for this article and John M. Broder from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
The Bush administration's long-awaited plan to overhaul fuel economy regulations was released yesterday, promising to save gasoline by requiring modest improvements in the performance of sport utility vehicles and other trucks. 
 But the proposal was swiftly condemned by environmental groups and other critics, who said it would do little to slow the nation's swelling oil consumption.
Top administration officials said their plan would save 10 billion gallons of gasoline over nearly two decades, or roughly 25 days' worth of gas under current consumption trends. It is the first sweeping change of fuel regulations covering light-duty trucks, a category that includes sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans. 
 But it also included a broadside against the authority of California and other states, including New York, to move forward with plans to regulate automotive emissions of global warming gases. Efforts by several states on the East and West Coasts to regulate emissions would save significantly more gasoline in those states than the Bush administration's proposal. 
 The administration said its plan would increase the average mileage of light trucks to 24 miles a gallon for 2011 models, compared with 21.2 miles a gallon in today's models. 
 ''This plan is good news for American consumers,'' Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said in a statement, ''because it will ensure the vehicles they buy get more miles to the gallon, requiring fewer stops at the gas station, and ultimately saving them money at the pump.'' Mr. Mineta announced the plan at a news conference in Los Angeles, where he arrived in a silver Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle. 
 But the structure of the new proposal makes it difficult to know exactly how much gasoline might be saved over all, and it could open new avenues for automakers to game a regulatory system already known for its loopholes. 
 ''Making our cars and trucks go farther on a gallon of gas,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global-warming program, ''is the biggest single step we can take to save money at the gas pump, cut oil dependence and curb global warming.''
 After a three-month public comment period, the administration will submit a final rule by April. The news conference yesterday was held at a Mobil station near Los Angeles International Airport, where a gallon of regular gasoline sells for $2.80.
 The administration said the rules would cost automakers about $6.2 billion, but provide $7 billion to $7.5 billion in consumer savings at the gas pump, based on assumed gasoline prices of $1.51 to $1.58 a gallon -- a level that critics said was too low. 
 Ultimately, many analysts say that rising gas prices could supersede regulation as the prod to finally force automakers to produce vehicles that are more fuel-efficient than Lincoln Navigators. This year, the two domestic-owned automakers, General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which makes Lincolns, have been redoubling their efforts to develop a smaller breed of sport utility vehicles to better compete with Toyota and Honda. 
 Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobbying group for G.M., Toyota and most other leading producers, said of the plan, ''It's going to take us weeks to review it and assess it and determine what it's going to mean for automakers.''
 ''Today's announcement represents the sixth straight increase in fuel economy standards, and that's a challenge to automakers even with all the fuel-efficient technologies on sale today,'' she said, adding that for automakers, higher prices at the pump would ease the burden of the rules by pushing drivers to start buying more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
 ''Higher gas prices will be our ally, ironically,'' Ms. Bergquist said. 
 If nothing else, the 169-page plan is complex. Today, corporate average fuel economy regulations -- known in the industry as CAFE standards -- divide each automaker's annual new vehicle production into two categories: passenger cars and light-duty trucks. New cars must average 27.5 miles a gallon and light trucks 20.7 miles a gallon in 2004 models. Rules for cars are not being changed. 
 The administration previously increased the standard for light trucks to 22.2 miles a gallon by the 2007 model year. The new plan would raise it to 23.5 miles a gallon by 2010. 
 More important, it would create a system in which each automaker's new light trucks would be divided into six size classes. Larger size classes would have less demanding fuel economy targets. From 2008 to 2010 models, automakers would have a choice between the current system and the new size-based system. By 2011 models, only the new system would remain.
 The Bush administration rules are modest in comparison with emission regulations proposed by California that would have the effect of forcing steeper fuel economy increases on vehicles sold there, as well as in other states that mimic California's air-quality rules. The industry is challenging California in court, and the administration's proposal said that such efforts by states would ''interfere'' with its plan. 
 A range of people who have studied the structure of the plan say it would alleviate difficulties G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler have under the existing system because they build more heavy S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks than their Asian competitors. 
 One concern among critics is that an automaker could slightly enlarge some vehicles to move them into a less demanding category. For instance, if the length and width of the Subaru Outback were increased by a fraction of an inch, it could move from a category with a fuel target of 28.7 miles a gallon in 2011 to a category requiring 27.1 miles a gallon. 
 Such gaming characterizes the current system; Subaru recently raised the Outback higher off the ground and made other technical design modifications to change its classification from a passenger car to the less-demanding status of light truck. 
 The new approach makes it both easier and harder to reclassify cars as trucks. Much-criticized rules related to seat design have allowed vehicles like the Chrysler PT Cruiser to be counted as trucks, and the loophole would be expanded in the new system. But since the smallest trucks would have mileage targets comparable to cars, there might be less incentive to do so.
 The administration's plan is expected to reopen a vigorous debate about the effects of fuel economy regulations on safety. A leading architect of the plan, John D. Graham of the Office of Management and Budget, has been an author of much-criticized research in the past contending that fuel economy regulations killed thousands of people each year because they gave automakers incentives to make vehicles lighter so they would be more fuel-efficient. Similar findings have been published more recently by the National Academy of Sciences and are at the heart of the plan's structure.
 Consumer groups dispute such contentions and raised concerns about the opposite problem, that increasingly heavy S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks have added risks for other drivers. The proposal, as written, could add to the disputes if automakers made vehicles larger to put them into less stringent categories. 
 In an e-mail message, Mr. Graham said the plan was ''both good for consumers and good for the environment,'' adding that it would ''also reduce the adverse safety effects that motorists experienced under the old CAFE system.'' 
 The proposal does not extend fuel regulations to the largest and least fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks -- those like the Hummer H2 that are more than 8,500 pounds when loaded. The administration said it would seek further comment on whether larger S.U.V.'s alone should be inserted into the final rule.

HEADLINE: July Slowing of Home Sales Stirs Talk of Market Peak

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The nation's long housing boom appears to be losing steam. 
 Sales of existing homes fell more than expected in July and prices were virtually flat compared with the previous month, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday. Perhaps most significant, the price of condominiums, which have recently attracted a growing number of speculators looking to cash in on the boom, fell for the second straight month, while the number of condos on the market rose sharply.
''We could very much be close to the peak at this time,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America's capital markets group. 
 ''There are signs that investors are becoming a little more cautious about the housing market,'' she added. ''Sellers of the higher-price homes are not getting their asking prices, and there is a buildup of inventories.''
 Economists pointed out that house sales remained near record highs and that the slowdown might turn out to be more of a blip than a clear signal that the boom was reaching a peak. The agents' association adjusts its numbers to take into account seasonal variations like summer vacations; the adjustments are only an estimate, however, and the picture will not become clearer until more data is available, analysts said.
 Still, the unexpectedly weak report -- especially the softening of the condominium market -- caught investors off guard and helped push down stock prices early in the day. The market recovered later, but the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed with a slight loss, falling 0.34 percent, to 1217.59.
 The overall number of homes sold last month fell 2.6 percent, to an annual rate of 7.16 million; economists had expected existing-home sales to reach an annual pace of 7.25 million in July. The median price of condos and co-ops fell 1.1 percent, to $219,000.
 ''It's not just that the sales level was down but look at the difference between single-family and condos,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics based in Ohio. Single-family home sales fell 2.3 percent while condo and co-op sales fell 5 percent.
 Compared with July 2004, overall sales were still up 4.7 percent last month. The median sales price -- the price at which half the homes sold for more and half sold for less -- rose only slightly from June but was up 14.1 percent from a year ago, to $218,0000, according to the real estate agents. 
 ''It's still a sellers' market, although I don't know that we are seeing as many multiple offers and huge increase in the list price,'' said Thomas R. Kunz, president and chief executive of Century 21, the real estate brokerage company.
 There were enough condos for sale -- about 404,000 units -- to keep the market supplied for 5.3 months, up from 329,000 units and 4.1 months in June and 3.5 months in July 2004.
 Overall inventories rose 2.6 percent, to 2.75 million homes, in July, a 4.6-month supply of homes. That is the greatest supply since 2003, but still well below historic levels of six months, real estate executives said. The single-family house inventory of 4.5 months was little changed.
 To Mr. Kunz of Century 21, the slowdown in sales was a welcome development, he said, because the market had reached unsustainable highs in some states like California. 
 Often the fastest-growing region in recent years, the West last month experienced the biggest drop in number of homes sold -- 7.5 percent -- and prices in the region were flat. That appears to confirm reports from real estate agents there that growth was beginning to slow.
 Mr. Kunz said sales were coming off a peak in some California markets, but that other areas in the region, like Phoenix and its suburbs, were still strong. ''California just controls such a huge part of the market that it overshadows everybody else,'' said Mr. Kunz, who recently moved to New Jersey from Southern California.
 Even in California, local experts say the market remains robust, with prices up 16 percent from a year ago. That's down from average increases of 18 percent in 2003 and 24 percent in 2004, but faster than the rest of the nation, said Michael Carney, a professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and director of the Real Estate Research Center.
 ''There are lots of people who are trying to find signs of cooling,'' Professor Carney said. ''I don't see it at this time.''
 The South was the only one of four regions not to register a decline in sales, but prices there fell 1 percent. Sales of existing homes dipped 3.3 percent in the Northeast, and median prices edged up slightly. The Midwest had a 1.8 percent dip in sales and a 2.3 percent rise in prices.
 Mortgage rates rose slightly in July, but were still below their levels of a year ago. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate in June was 5.7 percent, up from 5.58 percent in June but less than the 6.06 percent level in July 2004.

HEADLINE: Amid Tight Oil Markets, Protests Cut Back Output in Ecuador 

BYLINE: By CARLA D'NAN BASS and JUAN FORERO; Carla D'Nan Bass reported from Quito, Ecuador, for this article, and Juan Forero from Bogota, Colombia.

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
With protests that virtually halted oil production in this country now quelled, Ecuador's government took grim stock Tuesday of a week's worth of damage that unsettled the oil markets, and began the demanding task of getting production levels back to normal.
 Government officials estimate that losses from the shutdown have prevented the production of 1.5 million barrels of oil, and that the cost could exceed $400 million.
The state oil company Petroecuador said that 420 of the 450 wells it operates in two northeastern provinces stopped production at some point during a week of sometimes violent protests. 
 Some of those wells may have suffered damage severe enough that it may be months before oil production in Ecuador, Latin America's fifth-largest producer and a supplier to the United States, is fully back on line. 
 ''What happened is worse than war,'' the energy minister, Ivan Rodriguez, said on television here Monday.
 All this was hardly soothing to world oil markets, which have reached record price levels in recent weeks. On Friday, oil for September delivery rose $2.08 a barrel in New York, to $65.35. On Tuesday, oil settled at $65.71. Some said that in such circumstances, supply disruptions even in smaller producing countries would be felt in trading. 
 ''The problem right now in the oil market is we're producing close to capacity,'' said Michelle Billig, director of political risk at the Pira Energy Group in New York and a former specialist in Latin American oil markets at the Energy Department. ''The oil market is pushed to the limit. There is no more slack, and so every disruption has an impact.'' 
 Petroecuador's production continued to inch upward Tuesday, with the company pumping about half the 200,000 barrels it normally produces daily.
 Other oil companies quoted in industry reports, meanwhile, put their output in Ecuador at 311,827 barrels as of Tuesday, up from 150,000 last week. These companies, which include Petrobras, EnCana of Canada and Occidental Petroleum, normally pump about 330,000 barrels a day. Worldwide oil use is around 84 million barrels a day.
 The disruptions began a week ago Sunday, when people in two oil-producing but impoverished provinces, Sucumbios and Orellana, began protesting for a larger share of the oil revenue. The protesters dynamited a pipeline, blocked access to oil fields and shut down electrical power to nearly all of Petroecuador's installations.
 Protest leaders, who called a truce on Sunday, are now in difficult negotiations with President Alfredo Palacio's government. They want the oil companies to pave roads, provide more jobs to local residents and funnel 25 percent of income tax payments directly to local governments, instead of having the money go through the central government in Quito. 
 They have also demanded that two of the foreign companies, Occidental and EnCana, be thrown out of the country -- something the government says it will not even discuss.
 ''The negotiations are not dead, although I do not think they have advanced,'' Maximo Abad, mayor of the town of Lago Agrio and one of the protest leaders, said Tuesday on Ecuadorean radio. ''Yesterday, there was a danger that the dialogue was going to end altogether.''
 The threat of more protests has only added to more uncertainty in this country, whose $30-billion-a-year economy depends on oil for 40 percent of export earnings and a third of tax revenue.
 Oil companies have long complained about rampant corruption, the propensity of the Energy Ministry to alter contracts, and chronic political instability. Three presidents have been ousted in the last eight years.
 ''This is an extremely dysfunctional place,'' an executive of a foreign company said. ''You want some measure of stability, some measure of predictability, some sense that when you wake up tomorrow, that things will not be dramatically different.'' 
 Anger has long been brewing at the oil companies and the government in Quito. Oil from Sucumbios and Orellana has filled government coffers for more than 30 years. But the towns near the oil fields remain impoverished, criss-crossed mostly by dirt roads, and with little in the way of clinics or schools.
 Another protest leader from Lago Agrio, Angel Villacis, said: ''This protest was so big this time because we finally said no to this, to the fact that so much money is coming out of here, that the oil companies are destroying the environment, and we don't receive anything for our own development. They take all of our resources and don't leave anything behind.''
 Roger Tissot, a senior analyst at PFC Energy in Washington, said the troubles in Ecuador were analogous to those in Nigeria. There, he said, the delta region where most of the country's oil is produced is destitute and volatile, while the government in Abuja is reluctant to share revenue.
 ''Those people, what they're demanding is not just the road and the jobs, it's a bigger share in petroleum revenues,'' Mr. Tissot said of the protesters in Ecuador. ''The problem is that the money that feeds the Quito bureaucracy would diminish.''
 Mr. Palacio's government, which has promised since taking power four months ago to focus more on meeting social needs, is in a difficult situation. 
 It faces pressure from the International Monetary Fund, which this week sent a mission to discuss the country's economy; growth is expected to be 3.5 percent this year, down from 6.9 percent last year. Fitch Ratings also warned that the oil production cuts could affect the country's credit ratings.
 ''Palacio thought he could pursue a different course, have a greater emphasis on a social agenda,'' said Michael Shifter of Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ''But I think he's encountered real obstacles, not just within Ecuador but in the international community. I think he's wanted to have it both ways, but that's proven to be extremely difficult.''

PERSON: Abraham S. Goldstein

HEADLINE: Abraham Goldstein, Yale Dean, 80

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Abraham S. Goldstein, a former dean of Yale Law School, died on Saturday at his home in Woodbridge, Conn. He was 80.
 His death was announced by Yale University, where he had taken emeritus status at the end of the academic year. It said the cause was a heart attack. 
An expert in criminal law and procedure, Professor Goldstein gained a reputation as a trial lawyer in Washington before he joined the Yale faculty in 1956. He became the 11th dean of the law school in 1970 but returned to teaching full time in 1975, when he was named a Sterling professor.
 He wrote ''The Insanity Defense'' (Yale University Press, 1967), a comprehensive analysis of its history and the controversies about it. He also wrote ''The Passive Judiciary: Prosecutorial Discretion and the Guilty Plea'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1981) and, with Leonard Orland, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Little, Brown, 1974).
 Abraham Samuel Goldstein, a son of immigrants from Ukraine, was born in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. He attended high school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and enrolled at City College.
 In World War II, he served as an Army demolition man and military policeman before transferring into a military intelligence unit. After graduating from City College with a degree in economics in 1946, he entered Yale Law School and received his L.L.B. in 1949. He clerked for Judge David L. Bazelon of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington and worked as a civil and criminal litigator and partner in a Washington firm, Donohue & Kaufmann, before he returned to teach at Yale.
 Over the years he sat on Connecticut state boards and commissions and bar association panels. He was a visiting professor at Cambridge and the University of Tel Aviv, among others. 
 Professor Goldstein is survived by his second wife, Sarah Poleyeff Goldstein, whom he married in 1995; a son, William I., of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Marianne Goldstein of Peoria, Ariz.; a brother, Sidney, of Washington; three stepdaughters, Laura Schafer of North Brunswick, N.J., Sylvia Schafer of Willimantic, Conn., and Amy Schafer Boger of Concord, Mass.; and six grandchildren. His first wife, Ruth Tessler Goldstein, died in 1989 after 41 years of marriage.

HEADLINE: Fields's School Plan Stresses Technical and Vocational 

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president and Democratic mayoral candidate, yesterday proposed overhauling New York City's public schools, seeking to seize the spotlight on one of the major issues of the race and rebut assertions that her campaign has been short on specifics.
 In a speech at Borough of Manhattan Community College, Ms. Fields called for improving vocational education, increasing math and science programs and creating new specialized high schools.
''No major city in the country has attempted to reshape its schools and to respond quickly to the changing demands of the global marketplace, and to focus intensively on math and science education as a way to prepare students for known jobs in the local economy,'' Ms. Fields said. 
 It was one of Ms. Fields's first major policy proposals in weeks. 
 She has been criticized by political analysts and her Democratic rivals for talking about her policy ideas in generalities rather than specifics, and parts of her education plan are indeed light on details. One of the ways her plan addresses vocational training, for example, is to provide students ''with engaging and relevant vocational courses.'' 
 Ms. Fields also did not discuss how her ideas would fit in with many similar programs that already exist, including vocational high schools dedicated to trades like aviation, automotive mechanics and transit technology.
 But over all, her 15-page proposal is one of the most comprehensive she has put forward. Ms. Fields said she would extend the school day and the academic year at low-performing schools, reduce class sizes by reclaiming unused school buildings, and create 3,000 seats at new ''world class'' specialized high schools.
 She suggested rewarding teachers at the most troubled schools with grants to repay college loans and by giving them preference for lower-cost housing. And she proposed creating mentoring programs so female scientists and mathematicians could encourage young women to pursue careers in those fields.
 A survey released last week by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute showed Ms. Fields in a virtual three-way tie for second place among the four Democrats in the mayoral race. The three other candidates -- Fernando Ferrer, who has been leading in the polls, and Gifford Miller and Anthony D. Weiner -- spent much of yesterday afternoon and evening campaigning in Brooklyn.
 Mr. Miller, who has made education a signature issue, unveiled a 30-second television ad on his plan to reduce class sizes and build additional classrooms by extending a temporary tax surcharge on those who earn at least $500,000 a year.
 Ms. Fields declined to estimate the total cost of her education plan, saying it was difficult to do so since some of her initiatives are based on existing programs. She said that aspects of the proposal would cost roughly $350 million, and that she would obtain money for the plan by shifting funds in city and Department of Education budgets and from a court order requiring the state to improve city schools.
 That court order, which Gov. George E. Pataki is appealing, ultimately requires that an additional $5.6 billion be spent on the city's school system annually, along with $9.2 billion over the next five years to relieve overcrowding and make capital improvements.
 Ms. Fields criticized Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, saying he had failed to push the state to comply with the ruling. ''We have not seen this mayor take on that battle to get those dollars into New York City in the same way as we saw him take on the Olympics and fighting for a West Side stadium,'' she said.
 The Democratic primary is Sept. 13. Ms. Fields's three rivals have all laid out education programs in recent weeks and months.

HEADLINE: Fresh Gets Invited to the Cool Table

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
YOU don't usually find a college tour guide showing off the school cafeteria to prospective applicants. But at Middlebury College in Vermont this summer, that was where a student guide made her four-star sales pitch. ''The food here is amazing,'' she said. ''When I went home for spring break, I actually missed it.''
 At a time when many school cafeterias are still serving traditional, mass-produced food, Middlebury has replaced ''mystery meat,'' canned vegetables and other institutional menu staples -- the butt of freshman-year jokes for generations -- with locally raised chicken and lamb, and heirloom tomatoes, emerald green broccoli and plump ripe strawberries grown within a few miles of the campus.
Middlebury is not alone in serving food that did not come from far away and out of Costco-size cans. From the University of Montana to public schools in Tallahassee, Fla., officials at more than 200 universities and 400 school districts are supporting a farm-to-cafeteria movement to build their menus around fresh local ingredients. And students are cheering instead of complaining. 
 In the Owego and Whitney Point school districts in central New York, canned vegetables have been replaced by local farm-fresh tomatoes, broccoli, squash and cabbage. ''Sometimes it costs less, sometimes right around the same price, but the quality is so wonderful,'' said Betsey Bacelli, food service director for both districts, who nine years ago accepted an offer from local farmers to buy their produce. ''The older students really recognize the difference in quality, so we make little steps, like more cabbage in the soup than we used to.''
 The movement among administrators to support local and regional sustainable agriculture, while helping their students eat better-tasting and better quality food, started on the East and West coasts and expanded across the country. 
 But making the transition is not so easy. Food costs are often higher, supplies can be hard to find and it takes more money to pay qualified cooks and install working kitchens. 
 Those who have embraced the concept cite the advantages, from fighting obesity among the young to helping the local economy. And while the Department of Agriculture has provided very little money for farm to cafeteria programs, individual administrators are using sustainable agriculture as part of the new federal wellness initiative, which requires school districts, in consultation with parents, students and schools, to create a comprehensive wellness program, especially nutrition guidelines. 
 Rising oil prices provide an additional incentive. ''This is the perfect time to do it, because fuel costs are so high that distribution companies are interested in the program,'' said Kate Adamick, project director for SchoolFood Plus at Food Change, a nonprofit that helps improve schoolchildren's eating habits in New York City.
 ''Children's obesity issues have highlighted the farm to school program,'' said Marion Kalb, director of the national farm to school program for the Community Food Security Coalition. ''It appeals to taste as well as nutrition and how to get kids to change their eating habits.'' The nonprofit coalition works to build sustainable food systems that ensure access to affordable, nutritious food.
 Doug Davis, food service director for the Burlington, Vt., schools, said that the idea of using local produce in the schools, where 5,500 meals are served each day, was first discussed in September 2003. ''It appeared overwhelming, almost impossible,'' he said. But now the schools are buying tomatoes, lettuce and peppers in season and have developed recipes to use other produce like kale and carrots. This year, for the first time, they bought 500 pounds of zucchini, which was delivered earlier this month and processed for use in zucchini breads.
 ''One of the goals is to get more fiber in the schools, through fruits and vegetables,'' Mr. Davis said. Last year the children ate 10 to 20 percent more vegetables than they did in 2003, and purchases of local produce jumped to 38 percent from 8 percent, he said.
 The farm to cafeteria program in Albuquerque, where schools are on a year-round schedule, featured local peaches, blackberries, watermelon, green chilies, sunflower sprouts and a salad bar this summer. ''Albuquerque and Santa Fe are great markets for the small Hispanic producers I work with,'' said Craig Mapel, a marketing specialist with the New Mexico Department of Agriculture.
 Fred Martinez of Dixon, N.M., has been selling apples to the program from his 18-acre orchard for several years. ''The program has helped stabilize our market,'' he said. ''Before, we could sell only four or five weeks before the big fruit producing districts like Washington took over.''
 Ms. Bacelli's school districts keep increasing their program, too, as she finds creative ways to use more produce, like acorn squash in cookies and muffins.
 ''We're hoping that with the federal government's new wellness initiative, all the districts in our area will do what we're doing and buy local fruits and vegetables, she said. ''My other dream is to get the students to eat rutabagas. I pray every night for world peace and funding.''
 Among all of the nation's school districts, New York City, because of its sheer size, faces the most daunting problems in changing the menus and the culture: it serves 860,000 meals a day at 1,500 locations, said Ms. Adamick, of SchoolFood Plus. 
 ''We are not operating under any delusion that this is a short-term project,'' Ms. Adamick said. Her program, with $3 million funding for its first year, part of it from the Agriculture Department's nutrition education program for low-income people, was designed to improve eating habits at school -- and, through them, academic performance -- while strengthening the state's agricultural economy. 
 ''We talk about this as a 30-year project,'' said Ms. Adamick, an attorney and a former chef. ''We need to change an entire culture, and you know how long it has taken to change the social view on smoking. This is more difficult. We are taking small steps, getting apples, carrots, pears, even broccoli into the schools.''
 At the college and university level, using local food has many pluses, said Dr. S. Georgia Nugent, president of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. As colleges compete for students, locally grown food has become a marketing tool for baby boomer parents, who created the organic food movement, and their environmentally aware children.
 ''You get higher quality food and lower environmental impact,'' Dr. Nugent said. ''You support the local economy. And it is a way of teaching young people about their local environment and connecting it with what happens internationally.''
 It also helps the town and gown relationship.
 ''It's so important for this college to be part of the place,'' Dr. Nugent said over dinner on the eve of the second annual National Farm to Cafeteria Conference, which took place at Kenyon this summer. ''We are perceived as an elite institution on the hill, surrounded by a rural community. We needed to come down off the hill and be good neighbors. We wanted to make a tangible commitment to the local economy.''
 On a smaller scale, the University of Montana in Missoula increased its local purchases to 13 percent from 7 percent of its total in the second year of its program. ''Parents like it; students like it,'' said Mark LoParco, the university's director of dining services. Among the local products are bread made from local wheat; burgers, chili and quesadillas from local beef; granola and tortillas; and potatoes, carrots, cherries, salad, even safflower oil and salsas. 
 In addition to the health and taste advantages, Mr. LoParco said he finds other reasons to buy locally. ''This is a regional sustainability program,'' he said. ''We do it for food security, which is pretty compelling, and for environmental reasons.''
 Some colleges feature occasional seasonal menus with local products. A number of them, including Bates College in Lewiston, Me.; Oberlin in Ohio; Ohio University in Athens; Berkeley College at Yale; and Penn College of Technology, an affiliate of Penn State, as well as Kenyon and Middlebury, offer menus on which 30 percent or more of the food is locally grown.
 Costs, a significant issue in public schools, are less an issue at the college level. Kenyon added $100,000 to its food budget to support its buy-local program. Middlebury College has not earmarked additional money, yet as much as 33 percent of the food it serves in its cafeterias comes from local sources, a figure Nan Jenks-Jay, director of environmental affairs at the college, describes as ''extremely high, considering we only have a 10-week growing season.''
 In the beginning of the farm-to-cafeteria movement, big food-service companies like Aramark and Sodexho, which run many college and university dining halls, made it difficult to buy locally, preferring to make one phone call.
 But John Orobono, the senior vice president of supply chain management at Aramark, said the company no longer tries to discourage its collegiate customers from buying local. He acknowledged that Aramark still has a lot to learn.
 ''Initially there may be costs which Aramark may decide to absorb,'' Mr. Orobono said. ''We can't afford to pass them on because we have to be competitive. Aramark will not be left behind.
 ''We can move product from Chile, from the West Coast, but we are challenged by moving product from Camden to Philly,'' he added. ''Hopefully, this whole program will grow, and then there will be normal profitability. I believe there is a groundswell.''
 Niles Gebele, Aramark's food service director at Kenyon, who helped pioneer the company's participation in such programs, said: ''It's a real departure from the traditional industrial supply source: one phone call and you get all your stuff. Now it's a little more complicated, but there is evidence that good operators can respond to this.'' Serving local foods at public schools and colleges and universities ''is not just a fad,'' said John Turenne, who was with Aramark for 25 years, most recently as the executive chef at Yale's Berkeley College.
 ''This is what we should be doing,'' he said. ''The globalization of food, the hidden costs, the loss of nutrition: it's not healthy for the planet or for the human body.''
 Mr. Turenne, now a consultant, met Alice Waters when she instituted a pioneering food program at Berkeley College, where her daughter lived while attending Yale. She sent Mr. Turenne to work in the Chez Panisse kitchen, and he came out a changed man.
 ''Everything was bottom line and numbers, and now it's about the food,'' he said. ''It was an epiphany.''
 The introduction to fresh local ingredients has been an epiphany for many young people, too. Kate Barney, who had been active in the farm to cafeteria program before graduating from Kenyon this June, talked about one of her fellow students, who clearly had never seen anything as lusciously red as the hydroponic tomatoes being served in the cafeteria.
 ''She asked me if they had been dyed,'' Ms. Barney said.

HEADLINE: Summer Fading, Hollywood Sees Fizzle

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
With the last of the summer blockbusters fading from the multiplex, Hollywood's box office slump has hardened into a reality that is setting the movie industry on edge. The drop in ticket sales from last summer to this summer, the most important moviegoing season, is projected to be 9 percent by Labor Day, and the drop in attendance is expected to be even deeper, 11.5 percent, according to Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office. 
 Multiples theories for the decline abound: a failure of studio marketing, the rising price of gas, the lure of alternate entertainment, even the prevalence of commercials and pesky cellphones inside once-sacrosanct theaters. But many movie executives and industry experts are beginning to conclude that something more fundamental is at work: Too many Hollywood movies these days, they say, just are not good enough.
 ''Part of this is the fact that the movies may not have lived up to the expectations of the audience, not just in this year, but in years prior,'' said Michael Lynton, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which had some flops this summer, including the science fiction action movie ''Stealth'' and the romantic comedy ''Bewitched.'' ''Audiences have gotten smart to the marketing, and they can smell the good ones from the bad ones at a distance.'' 
 Even Robert Shaye, the studio leader behind ''The Wedding Crashers,'' one of the summer's runaway hits, shares the worry about the industry's ability to connect with audiences. ''I believe it's a cumulative thing, a seismic evolution of people's habits,'' said Mr. Shaye, chairman of New Line Cinema. 
 In previous years, he said, ''you could still count on enough people to come whether you failed at entertaining them or not, out of habit, or boredom, or a desire to get out of the house. You had a little bit of backstop.'' 
 With competition from video games, hundreds of television channels and DVD's, that's no longer the case, he said. The problem, these studio leaders and other industry experts seemed to say, was not only that a steady diet of formulaic plots, too-familiar special-effects vehicles and remakes of television shows has, over time, left the average moviegoer hungry for better entertainment. 
 Marc Shmuger, vice chairman of Universal, said Hollywood has been too focused on short-term box office payoff and not focused enough on what he called ''the most elemental factor of all'' -- the satisfaction of the moviegoing experience. 
 ''It wasn't like the last crop of summer movies were that much better than this summer,'' said Mr. Shmuger, whose studio's recent releases included the success ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' and several disappointments, including ''Cinderella Man,'' ''The Perfect Man'' and ''Kicking and Screaming.'' ''This summer has been as deadening as it has been exciting, and there's a cumulative wearing down effect. We're beginning to witness the results of that. People are just beginning to wake up that what used to pass as summer excitement isn't that exciting, or that entertaining. This is vividly clear in terms of the other choices that consumers have.'' 
 The blockbuster hits of last summer, including ''Spider-Man 2,'' ''Shrek 2'' and ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' performed more or less on the same level as this year's hits, including ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith,'' ''Batman Begins'' and ''War of the Worlds.'' But too many big-budget movies, including ''The Island'' and ''Stealth,'' flopped entirely, while other films, from ''Bad News Bears'' to ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' to ''The Great Raid,'' were disappointing.
 The box office numbers have led to intense, broad-ranging conversations across Hollywood about the implications. Many studios have commissioned market research to investigate the causes of moviegoing behavior -- or the lack thereof. At New Line, executives have been talking about the ''sameness of everything'' on movie schedules, one executive said. At 20th Century Fox this week, a half-dozen top executives held an impromptu brainstorming session at the commissary with a reporter, debating the effects of gas prices and marketing missteps.
 Tom Rothman, co-chairman of 20th Century Fox, was one of the few to see no negative trend in the current numbers. ''Everybody keeps saying it's the worst of times; it seems fine to me,'' said Mr. Rothman, whose studio has had some big-budget successes this summer, with ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' and ''The Fantastic Four.'' He noted, for example, that the advent of DVD's has expanded the overall revenues of the movie industry. ''For us the business is healthy, but it requires management,'' Mr. Rothman said. 
 Just about everywhere else, though, the concern is palpable -- and understandable, not only because of the performance of this summer's movies, but also because a decline is discernible over time: overall movie attendance, a figure not affected by inflation, has slid to below where it stood in mid-August 2001. DVD sales, while still robust, are no longer rising exponentially, and some analysts say that a poor box office performance this summer will lead to poor DVD sales this winter. 
 With billions of dollars at stake, nerves are growing understandably frayed. Last week, John Fithian, the president of the National Association of Theatre Owners, accused Robert A. Iger , the incoming chief executive of Walt Disney, of leveling a ''death threat'' at theater owners for having suggested that the lesson to be drawn from the slump is that moviegoers want films to be accessible in theaters and on DVD simultaneously.
 ''The structure of the industry is sound,'' said Mr. Fithian, who believes in maintaining a distance between the theatrical release and the DVD. ''We just need a few more good movies.'' 
 Mr. Iger had observed that studios ignored consumers at their peril. ''We can't allow tradition to stand in the way of where the consumer can go, or wants to go,'' he told analysts this month, warning that ''the music industry learned this the hard way.'' 
 Mr. Iger's conclusion -- that consumers want the choice of seeing movies in their homes at the same time as in the theater -- is being reached by others in the industry as well. But it remains contentious, resisted not only by the owners of theater chains. Mr. Lynton of Sony was adamant that the theatrical experience should be protected, while Mr. Shaye said he was still ''on the fence'' on the subject. 
 Warren Lieberfarb, a former Warner Brothers executive who was a main advocate of the DVD in the early 90's, warned that going to the movies had become too expensive over all, given the excellent quality of home theater. ''It's not just the DVD. It's not just the DVD window,'' he said. ''It's the flat-panel television and the sound system, with the DVD option, that has radically changed the quality of the in-home experience. The home theater has arrived.'' As a result, he said, ''you have to change the business model of the movie business.'' 
 With the task so large, and so very complex, Hollywood is still grappling with how to broach solutions. 
 Mr. Lynton said he would focus on making ''only movies we hope will be really good.'' At Fox, executives said they are looking to limit marketing costs. At Universal, Mr. Shmuger said he intends to reassert ''time and care and passion'' in movie production. Some of his ownsummer movies, he conceded, should never have been made.
 He declined to name them.

HEADLINE: When the Pentagon Wants to Cut

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., Aug. 17 

 BODY:
The just-completed One Liberty Center, in the Ballston section of this Washington suburb, was built specifically for the Office of Naval Research. The design included antiterrorism features that added about 25 percent to the cost of the 13-story building, according to the developer. 
 The huge columns in the garage, for example, are housed in steel plates. The concrete walls are unusually thick, and the laminated windows are not only shatterproof but are anchored to the building by steel rods.
 Yet its $10 million of bells and whistles -- paid for by the Department of Defense -- have not protected One Liberty Center from winding up on the Pentagon's base-closing list. 
 Just nine days before the Office of Naval Research moved in to its new offices, the Department of Defense recommended moving the research agency, as well as a second tenant, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, to the National Naval Medical Center, a government-owned complex in Bethesda, Md.
 The department also proposed transferring the remaining tenant, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, to Fort Meade, Md.
 One Liberty Center is among 102 office buildings nationwide that could lose Defense Department tenants. In its May 13 announcement proposing that 180 military bases be closed or reduced in size, the Pentagon also said it wanted to consolidate its research agencies and ''reduce the department's reliance on leased space, which has historically higher overall costs than government-owned space and generally does not meet Anti-Force Protection standards.'' 
 New Defense Department standards, which differ from those for other buildings with government tenants, call for an 82-foot setback. One Liberty Center, which was built according to the security standards in place in 2002, is only 20 feet from the curb, like most city buildings.
 ''You hate to play the game and find out that they changed the rules,'' said John G. Shooshan, the chairman of the Shooshan Company, a private company in Arlington that developed the building and is a minority owner.
 If the proposals are adopted, Northern Virginia would bear a heavy economic burden. As much as 7.7 million square feet of leased space could empty out and 23,000 jobs could be affected, according to Cassidy & Pinkard, a real estate services company in the Washington area.
 The realignment would occur over several years, however, and the General Services Administration would still be responsible for the long-term leases. The base realignment commission has until Sept. 8 to forward its recommendations to President Bush.
 Uncertainty over the realignment plan caused Equity Office Properties, the large office landlord, to take two buildings off the market in the Crystal City section of Arlington. But the company with the most at stake is Vornado Realty Trust, a large real estate investment trust based in New York that is renting an estimated 2.3 million square feet of space in Arlington to the Defense Department, according to Jim Sullivan, a senior analyst for Green Street Advisors of Newport Beach, Calif. 
 Real estate specialists say the streamlining plan is also likely to ripple through the office market as military contractors search for new offices near their clients.
 ''That's the wild card in this whole issue,'' said Margarita Foster, the director of research for Cassidy & Pinkard. Agencies are generally believed to use one outside contract worker for every employee, but the outsourcing ratio in some cases may be as high as 3 to 1, she said. 
 Mr. Sullivan said the loss of so many contracted jobs would be ''an anchor that will weigh on that market for years to come.'' For Northern Virginia, the threatened vacancies come just as the office market has managed to recover from the technology bust of a few years ago, thanks in large measure to heavy spending by the Defense and Homeland Security Departments.
 More than half the vulnerable space -- about 4.6 million square feet -- is in Arlington County, representing about one-seventh of the privately owned office market, and local officials are fighting back hard.
 They are being aided by influential politicians like Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has said that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld violated the realignment process by basing his proposals on a policy to vacate leased space. (In response, Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman, said the recommendations were consistent with improving ''military value.'')
 The county has also hired a lobbying group led by William S. Cohen, a former secretary of defense, and has proposed that other sites that could provide wider setbacks from the street be considered for the research agencies. The base-closing proposals are yet another blow to Crystal City, a warren of concrete buildings that has been struggling to rebound from the loss of the Patent and Trademark Office, which recently gave up 2.3 million square feet spread over a number of buildings and moved to a new complex of 2.4 million square feet in neighboring Alexandria.
 Another important tenant, US Airways, is also expected to move out of 2345 Crystal Drive, the building that houses the headquarters of the Charles E. Smith Company, which developed most of Crystal City. 
 Steven Roth, the chairman of Vornado, which owns Charles E. Smith, would not allow company officials to be interviewed about Crystal City. But in a letter to shareholders in the company's 2004 annual report -- issued before the base-closing announcement -- Mr. Roth acknowledged that efforts to find new tenants were ''going a bit slower than the self-imposed schedule we established in this letter last year.'' The company has, however, filled some of the empty space with tenants like the Public Broadcasting Service.
 Designed in the so-called brutalist style of the 1960's and 1970's, Crystal City's buildings are linked by the kind of old-fashioned underground retail shopping center that is anathema to today's planners.
 Faced with a need to replace the Patent and Trademark Office, Vornado has spent $43 million to make Crystal City more appealing to nongovernment tenants by putting street-level restaurants along Crystal Drive. Materials like limestone and granite, brightly colored awnings, banners and umbrellas, and landscaping and benches have softened that street's appearance.
 ''We're moving away from the days when benches meant vagrants,'' said Olvia Demetriou of Adamstein & Demetriou, the firm that designed the sleek new building that houses Jaleo Spanish Tapas & Bar and Oyamel Cocina Mexicana.
 The rejuvenation of Crystal City is consistent with Arlington's attempts over the years to create a series of pedestrian-friendly urban villages around its Metro stations. In the Ballston section, for example, scientists at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency regularly walk to the nearby National Science Foundation.
 County officials have warned that employees of the research agencies would be likely to find jobs in the private sector rather than allow themselves to be uprooted. 
 Jay Fisette, the chairman of the Arlington County Board, challenged the Defense Department's policy of requiring wide setbacks when other government agencies do not.
 ''Some day we're going to judge this secretary as having truly overreacted,'' Mr. Fisette, a Democrat, said of Mr. Rumsfeld. ''Speaking as a person who tries to build communities and create a sense of place, this turns that on its head and sends a very strong message of anxiety and fear.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Square Feet pages of Business Day on Wednesday about a proposal by the Defense Department to give up leased office space in Northern Virginia misstated the role of an architectural firm in designing a building in the Crystal City section of Arlington that houses the restaurants Jaleo Spanish Tapas & Bar and Oyamel Cocina Mexicana. The firm, Adamstein & Demetriou of Washington, designed the restaurants; Eric J. Liebmann, a partner in WDG Architecture, another Washington firm, designed the building.

HEADLINE: 9 STATES IN PLAN TO CUT EMISSIONS BY POWER PLANTS 

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Officials in New York and eight other Northeastern states have come to a preliminary agreement to freeze power plant emissions at their current levels and then reduce them by 10 percent by 2020, according to a confidential draft proposal.
 The cooperative action, the first of its kind in the nation, came after the Bush administration decided not to regulate the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Once a final agreement is reached, the legislatures of the nine states will have to enact it, which is considered likely.
Enforcement of emission controls could potentially result in higher energy prices in the nine states, which officials hope can be offset by subsidies and support for the development of new technology that would be paid for with the proceeds from the sale of emission allowances to the utility companies.
 The regional initiative would set up a market-driven system to control emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, from more than 600 electric generators in the nine states. Environmentalists who support a federal law to control greenhouse gases believe that the model established by the Northeastern states will be followed by other states, resulting in pressure that could eventually lead to the enactment of a national law. 
 California, Washington and Oregon are in the early stages of exploring a regional agreement similar to the Northeastern plan. The nine states in the Northeastern agreement are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. They were brought together in 2003 by a Republican governor, George E. Pataki of New York, who broke sharply and openly with the Bush administration over the handling of greenhouse gases and Washington's refusal to join more than 150 countries in signing the Kyoto Protocols, the agreement to reduce emissions that went into effect earlier this year.
 Mr. Pataki, who may be considering a run for the Republican nomination for president, has refrained from criticizing President Bush directly, but he has repeatedly said that the states need to act on their own even if the Bush administration has not made the issue a priority.
 Preliminary details of the region's emission reduction goals were included in a confidential memo circulated among officials of all nine states that was given to The New York Times by a person who supports the enactment of national legislation to control emissions, but who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to have the memo.
 Andrew Rush, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, declined to comment on the draft because it was not a final document. However, he said, ''a tremendous amount of progress has been made and we look forward to continuing to work with the other states so that we can reach a final agreement that will build on the governor's strong record of protecting the environment and reducing harmful emissions.''
 Samuel Wolfe, assistant commissioner for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, who has been actively involved in the negotiations, said that there is still work to be done on the proposal but that ''the states are working very productively to resolve the issues and we have very high hopes of getting a resolution through to all the states by the end of September.''
 In a statement, James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, tried to put the states' initiative in a positive light. ''We welcome all efforts to help meet the president's goal for significantly reducing greenhouse gas intensity by investing in new, more efficient technologies,'' he said.
 In recent years, New York and other Northeastern states have aggressively tried to reduce power plant emissions. Several have joined together to sue coal-fired power plants in Midwestern states that produce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that drift across state borders and cause acid rain in the Northeast.
 The Northeastern region is itself a substantial producer of greenhouse gases. Environmental groups calculate that the region's carbon dioxide emissions are roughly equivalent to those of Germany.
 While any reductions achieved in the region would be significant, environmentalists believe that the real importance of the cooperative effort is in the example it sets for other states.
 ''We're not going to solve the problem of global warming in the Northeastern states,'' said Dale S. Bryk, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council who has been watching the regional effort since it was proposed by Governor Pataki in a letter to the other governors in April 2003. ''but we're showing that we have the American ingenuity to do this and we're setting a precedent in terms of the design of the program.''
 As outlined in the draft, the regional carbon dioxide control plan would set specific caps on emissions that would drop over time. 
 The hope is that by providing long-range incentives for the electric generating companies to comply, the program will make improvements more cost-effective.
 Emissions would be capped at 150 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, a figure that is about equal to the average emissions in the highest three years between 2000 and 2004. Each of the nine states would have its own cap. New York's, at 65.6 million tons, would be the largest. Vermont's would be the smallest, with 1.35 million tons.
 The caps would be enforced starting in 2009. By that time, restricting emissions to levels prevailing now would, in effect, require a reduction of emissions relative to power output, because electric generation is expected to increase between now and then. The 150 million-ton cap would be sustained through 2015, when reductions would be required, reaching 10 percent in 2020. The Kyoto protocol freezes emissions at the 1990 level and imposes a 7 percent reduction in 2012. 
 Environmentalists say there are too many variables involved to directly compare the two programs, but they are believed to achieve roughly the same kind of carbon reductions. However, some environmentalists are disappointed with the draft plan. They argue that much deeper cuts were achievable.
 ''Its good that they are going to be talking about actual reductions,'' said Robert J. Moore, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York. ''However, the targets that are being contemplated, though a positive step, are somewhat less than ambitious.''
 Gavin J. Donohue, president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, said that meeting the proposed caps ''would be very difficult'' for electric generators in New York, especially now that the price of oil has soared.
 Mr. Donohue, who once worked for Governor Pataki in the Department of Environmental Conservation, said that his principal concern was assuring that the limits will not put electric generators in New York and the other states at a competitive disadvantage with states that were not constrained.
 The Bush administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocols has caused deep divisions nationwide, with many local governments attempting to force the administration to taking action by passing their own carbon dioxide rules. 
 Earlier this year, for example, the mayors of more than 130 cities, including New York and Los Angeles, joined in a bipartisan coalition to fight global warming on a local level by agreeing to meet the emissions reductions contained in the international pact.
 One part of the proposal that is not yet final deals with the sale of emission allowances under a cap-and-trade system. Such systems allow generating companies that have not used all of their emission quotas to sell the right to emit more pollution to competitors. In this way, the total amount of pollution can be controlled, while the economic viability of the companies is protected.
 When this system was used in Europe, the carbon dioxide allowances were given to the generating companies. The Northeastern states are considering withholding some allowances and selling them to the generating companies.

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform Redux

 BODY:
For three years, Congress has been staring ostensible success in the face -- the 1996 reform of the old welfare system -- and dithering about what to do next. The tough-edged ''workfare'' plan, which cut welfare cases in half, has expired but has been temporarily extended 10 times as lawmakers have clashed over what kind of balance to strike between toughness and humaneness. 
A showdown moment for two million marginal families is approaching, with hard-line Republicans in the House insisting on a measly $1 billion increase over five years for child care support.
 Fortunately, the Senate has a better plan. Olympia Snowe, the Maine Republican who is a champion of child care, is fervidly defending a proposal for $6 billion more in child care money. That is the minimum, she wisely argues, to realize the goal of guiding people on welfare into the workplace.
Child care has been one of the reform's most critical elements because it frees poor parents to meet work requirements. But the House proposal would not even cover inflation costs in the next five years.
 Hard-liners, posing as budget hawks in advance of the next elections, are making live-within-our-means pronouncements -- as if they haven't been reckless enablers for the Bush administration's record budget deficits and tax cuts for the affluent.
 We urge Senator Snowe and another key supporter, Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican and Finance Committee chairman, to stand fast in the coming welfare fight.

HEADLINE: Relax, Bill Gates; It's Google's Turn as the Villain

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
For years, Silicon Valley hungered for a company mighty enough to best Microsoft. Now it has one such contender: the phenomenally successful Google. 
 But instead of embracing Google as one of their own, many in Silicon Valley are skittish about its size and power. They fret that the very strengths that made Google a search-engine phenomenon are distancing it from the entrepreneurial culture that produced it -- and even transforming it into a threat.
A year after the company went public, those inside Google are learning the hard way what it means to be the top dog inside a culture accustomed to pulling for the underdog. And they are facing a hometown crowd that generally rebels against anything that smacks of corporate behavior. 
 Nowadays, when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and technologists gather in Silicon Valley, they often find themselves grousing about Google, complaining about everything from a hoarding of top engineers to its treatment of partners and potential partners. The word arrogant is frequently used. 
 The news last week that Google plans to sell an additional 14 million shares of stock, adding $4 billion to its current cash reserves of $3 billion, will only provide more reasons to gripe. 
 ''I've definitely been picking up on the resentment,'' said Max Levchin, a founder of PayPal, the online payment service now owned by eBay. ''They're a big company now, doing things people didn't expect them to do.''
 Mr. Levchin, who last year founded a multimedia company in San Francisco called Slide, said Google ''still has a long wick of good will to burn off,'' but he added, ''I'm surprised at how fast the company's reputation is changing.''
 It was not that long ago that Google reigned here as the upstart computer company that could do no wrong. Now some working in the technology field are starting to draw comparisons between Google and Microsoft, the company in Redmond, Wash., that Silicon Valley loves most to hate. 
 Bill Gates certainly sees similarities between Google and his own company. This spring, in an interview with Fortune, Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said that Google was ''more like us than anyone else we have ever competed with.'' 
 Google's success has already spurred Microsoft to develop its own Internet search engine (a project code-named Underdog), but Google has legions of engineers banging away on a range of projects of its own that, if successful, could dislodge Microsoft from the pre-eminent spot it has enjoyed since the early 1980's.
 Of course, Silicon Valley has had past pretenders to the throne. Netscape, which went public 10 years ago this month, and its Web browser, Navigator, were supposed to fell Microsoft -- but it is Netscape that is no longer in business. And while Google is riding high, those closely following the company caution that it is hardly invincible; an inflated stock price, a desire to compete in too many sectors simultaneously or simple hubris might cause it to stumble, they say. Even Microsoft, after all, has had legal troubles.
 Still, similarities between Google and Microsoft are evident to local entrepreneurs including Steven I. Lurie, who worked at Microsoft between 1993 and 1999 but now lives in San Francisco, and Joe Kraus, a founder of the 1990's search firm Excite. 
 ''There's that same 'think big' attitude about markets and opportunities,'' said Mr. Lurie, who has visited the Google campus in Mountain View many times to see friends who work there. ''Maybe you can call it arrogance, but there's that same sense that they can do anything and get into any area and dominate.'' 
 To place Google in context, Mr. Kraus offered a brief history lesson. In the 1990's, he said, I.B.M. was widely perceived in Silicon Valley as a ''gentle giant'' that was easy to partner with while Microsoft was perceived as an ''extraordinarily fearsome, competitive company wanting to be in as many businesses as possible and with the engineering talent capable of implementing effectively anything.''
 Now, in the view of Mr. Kraus, ''Microsoft is becoming I.B.M. and Google is becoming Microsoft.'' Mr. Kraus is the chief executive and a founder of JotSpot, a Silicon Valley start-up hoping to sell blogging and other self-publishing tools to corporations. 
 Just as Microsoft has been seen over the years as an aggressive, deep-pocketed competitor for talent, Internet start-ups in Silicon Valley complain that virtually every time they try to recruit a well-regarded computer programmer, that person is already contemplating an offer from Google. 
 ''Google is doing more damage to innovation in the Valley right now than Microsoft ever did,'' said Reid Hoffman, the founder of two Internet ventures, including LinkedIn, a business networking Web site popular among Silicon Valley's digerati. ''It's largely that they're hiring up so many talented people, and the fact they're working on so many different things. It's harder for start-ups to do interesting stuff right now.'' 
 Google, Mr. Hoffman said, has caused ''across the board a 25 to 50 percent salary inflation for engineers in Silicon Valley'' -- or at least those in a position to weigh competing offers. A sought-after computer programmer can now expect to make more than $150,000 a year.
 David C. Drummond, vice president for corporate development at Google, acknowledged that the company was ''very competitive'' in its pursuit of talent, but added: ''We're very sensitive to how everybody is perceiving us. We think the Silicon Valley ecosystem is critical for Google's success.''
 Google is also making it more difficult for some start-ups to raise funds. In the second half of the 1990's, entrepreneurs frequently complained that the specter of Microsoft hung over their every conversation with venture capitalists. Today, they say the same about Google.
 ''When I meet with venture capitalists, or if I'm engaged in a conversation about going into partnership with someone, inevitably the question is, 'Why couldn't Google do what you're doing?''' said Craig Donato, the founder and chief executive of Oodle, a site for searching online classified listings more quickly. 
 ''The answer is, 'They could, and they're probably thinking about it, but they can't do everything and do it well,''' Mr. Donato said. ''Or at least I'm hoping they can't.'' 
 Google has already added free e-mail, mapping, news aggregation and digital-photo management to its offerings, bringing it into competition in each case with two or more rivals. On Wednesday, it will announce plans for an instant-messaging system. And its plans for a new stock issue are fueling speculation that it is preparing to enter any number of other markets, from services for mobile phone users to an online payment service that would compete with PayPal. 
 Add to that list an Internet-based phone system and several products that would be directly aimed at Microsoft, including a Google browser and a software offering that would compete with Microsoft Office.
 ''If there's a perception that we're exploring lots of different areas, some of which might not be directly related to our core area of search, that's true,'' said Mr. Drummond, the Google vice president. ''It's part of our DNA to be always innovating and exploring lots of different areas.''
 Yet so driven has Google been in its pursuit of new markets that at least a few in Silicon Valley are using an epithet to taunt Google that people here once reserved for Microsoft: ''The Borg,'' a reference to an army of creatures in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' that took over civilization after civilization with machinelike precision. 
 Perhaps an anti-Google reaction was to be expected, given the glowing press the company has enjoyed for several years. Or maybe the carping and complaining is the inevitable reaction to a company so successful that it cannot help stomping on toes, even if accidentally.
 ''Hubris is an issue at every one of these Silicon Valley companies that are successful,'' said Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal who has invested in roughly 15 Internet start-ups in recent years. ''I don't know if it's any worse at Google than it's been at other highly successful technology companies.''
 Aggressiveness is another signal trait among successful companies like Google -- something those in parts of the media world are starting to learn. 
 Google recently announced that it would not talk to any reporter from CNETNews.com, a technology news Web site, until July 2006, after a reporter for the site wrote an article raising privacy questions about the information Google collects about individuals.
 The company also provoked the ire of many within the blogging world -- not to mention snarky comments in Silicon Valley from those thinking Google was behaving like an old-line company that doesn't get it -- when earlier this year it fired a new employee who had joked online that the free meals, the on-site gym and all the other perks were a clever ploy to keep people at their desks longer. 
 ''Google is at that inflection point where it's starting to act like an establishment company, and Silicon Valley is a rebel culture,'' said Gautam Godhwani, a founder and chief executive at Simply Hired, an online employment site. 
 Microsoft, of course, has its hold on the Windows world -- and a market capitalization almost four times Google's. By contrast, switching to a new search engine is as easy as calling up another Web page -- if a new company is able to do to Google what Google did to some of the earliest leaders of search, including AltaVista and Excite. 
 For the moment, at least, Google is aiming for that most coveted position in technology: a platform that, like Microsoft's operating system, is so popular that outside software developers write programs, and Web developers build new Google-related services, that render the Google home page indispensable to the personal computer ecosystem. 
 ''In the day, you'd hear that Microsoft was the evil empire, especially in Silicon Valley,'' said Brian Lent, the president of Medio Systems, a start-up in Seattle working on mobile-phone-based search. ''Google is the new evil empire, because they're in such a powerful position in terms of control. They have potential monopolistic control over access to information.'' 
 Mr. Lent, who worked closely with Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, when all three were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, helped introduce Mr. Brin and Mr. Page to one of the company's earliest investors. 
 ''I like and respect the Google guys,'' Mr. Lent said, ''but let's just say that their ultimate aim seems to me to be, 'One Google under Google, for which it stands.'''

HEADLINE: Board Clears Deal for Tower Downtown

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A state board formally approved a deal yesterday that would enable Goldman Sachs to revive its plan to build a $2 billion headquarters across the street from the World Trade Center site. But it would cost taxpayers even more in subsidies than has been previously disclosed.
 State and city officials announced earlier this month that they had agreed to provide Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, with a bigger incentive package, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to lure it downtown after it had explored a move to Midtown.
But officials confirmed this week that they had also agreed to lower the bank's annual payment in lieu of taxes for the new headquarters, a decrease that could amount to as much as $9 million a year. Some government watchdog groups criticized the extent of government largesse, but state and city officials defended the new deal, saying Goldman Sachs was critical to the commercial future of Lower Manhattan. 
 John P. Cahill, the governor's chief of staff, who negotiated with Goldman executives, said that Goldman's decision to build a 43-story tower in Battery Park City ''reinforces Lower Manhattan's position as the financial capital of the world'' and would help the city's effort to keep American Express and Merrill Lynch downtown.
 The state board that approved the deal, the Battery Park City Authority, agreed to lease the last remaining commercial development site at Battery Park City to Goldman Sachs for 65 years. The bank, in turn, agreed to make a one-time lease payment of $161 million in February.
 ''The economics of our deal have not changed since the beginning,'' said Tim Carey, president of the authority. But the larger deal has changed. 
 ''From what's been reported, you can't imagine a sweeter deal,'' said Bettina Damiani, project director at Good Jobs New York, a government watchdog group. 
 Goldman had abandoned its effort to build a new glass and stainless steel tower across West Street from the World Trade Center site in April out of frustration with the seeming disarray of the state's plans to manage security and traffic in the area. Goldman then began a very public search for an alternative site in Midtown.
 Many public officials and downtown landlords feared that if Goldman migrated to Midtown, Merrill Lynch, whose lease at the World Financial Center expires in a couple of years, and other large employers would follow. Lower Manhattan has been plagued by high commercial vacancy rates since the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. The developer Larry A. Silverstein has nearly completed rebuilding 7 World Trade Center, but so far he has been unable to land an anchor tenant.
 In recent weeks, state and city officials went back to Goldman with new security and traffic plans as well as more enticements. They agreed to increase the value of the tax-free Liberty Bonds available for the project from $1 billion to $1.65 billion. The city's Independent Budget Office estimates that Goldman will save about $9 million a year in interest payments, up from $5.5 million, because the bonds are exempt from taxes. A public hearing on the bonds is the next step in the approval process, followed by final approval from the state.
 ''We felt we had to make an attractive offer that we believed would be compelling enough to make them reconsider Site 26,'' said Adam L. Barsky, deputy secretary to Gov. George E. Pataki, referring to the parcel in question.
 Real estate executives say Goldman was unable to find an alternative location in Midtown that met its requirements. State and city officials say Goldman could have extended its leases at 85 Broad Street, 1 New York Plaza and other buildings downtown. But it would not have had the same impact as a commitment to build a $2 billion tower.
 The state and city are also giving the company $115 million in tax breaks and cash grants, in return for its commitment to maintain its headquarters in Lower Manhattan and more than 9,000 jobs now in New York through 2028. The value of the tax breaks could swell to $150 million if Goldman's work force grows in the coming years. But earlier this year, officials offered tax breaks worth only $30 million to $55 million.
 At the same time, the city reconfigured the payments in lieu of taxes that Goldman would have to make for its new headquarters, an arrangement that officials confirmed only this week. Officials had originally indicated that over time, the yearly payments, arranged when a developer is building on publicly owned land, would never exceed $15.11 per square foot, or $30.2 million. Under the new arrangement, the ceiling was set at a lower rate, $10.71 a square foot, or $21.4 million. 
 Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor, said the state had agreed to reimburse the city for the difference, which he said would be about $40 million between 2012 and 2026.
 Mr. Carey, of the authority, said Goldman would pay about $900,000 a year toward the upkeep of Battery Park City and $3.5 million toward designing and building a new library.

HEADLINE: Weiner Attacks City's Deal on Bronx Market

BYLINE: By ROBIN SHULMAN and DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democratic mayoral candidate, attacked the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday for making what he called a ''sweetheart deal'' with a developer to turn the Bronx Terminal Market into a million-square-foot shopping mall. 
 The southwest Bronx wholesale market, which has been operating since the 1920's, is one of the largest ethnic food distributors on the East Coast. It fell into disrepair, and in 2004 the city signed a deal with the Related Companies and the market's operators to clear up litigation so that Related could develop the site.
At a news conference on the steps of the State Supreme Court building in the Bronx, Mr. Weiner said the deal was colored by Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff's friendship with Stephen J. Ross, the president of Related, the city's largest developer, which paid $42.5 million to take over the lease. 
 The city should have allowed for competitive bidding, Mr. Weiner said, as he called for ''an open process where the community gets a chance to be heard, where other developers get a chance to be heard.'' 
 City officials have said they had no opportunity to accept bids for developing the site because another party, the Buntzman family, controlled the lease. At a separate news conference, the mayor said yesterday that the Buntzmans basically made a private deal with Related. 
 Mr. Weiner also criticized the city's promise to repay Related the $42.5 million if public approvals necessary for a mall did not come through. He also said the developer got a good deal when it agreed to exchange part of the market site for an adjacent city site with a decrepit jail, the Bronx House of Detention for Men. The city wanted the site to build an Olympic velodrome, but because the city lost the Olympic bid, Related could get both properties.
 ''There will be negotiations, and there will be an appraisal done,'' said Michael Sherman, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, which managed the deal.
 Mayor Bloomberg defended the deal yesterday, saying, ''The Bronx House of Detention is not something we can use anymore, and eliminating it will help development in that area, and that's exactly what the city should be doing.''
 ''The Bronx needs a lot of development,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that the area around the market was starved for jobs and housing. ''And I'm just glad that somebody after all these years has seized the opportunity to develop it.''
 Another Democratic mayoral candidate, Fernando Ferrer, also campaigned in the Bronx yesterday, and his campaign released new advertisements, two on radio and one on cable television, that are similar to an earlier biographical spot.
 The new television ad stresses that Mr. Ferrer has connections to middle-class New Yorkers and that his record includes strengthening civilian oversight of police, expanding after-school programs and helping build low-cost housing in the Bronx. The new TV spot comes as some of Mr. Ferrer's rivals, especially Gifford Miller, are running more aggressive ad campaigns on both cable and broadcast stations.
 Nick Baldick, the campaign manager for Mr. Ferrer, took a swipe at Mr. Miller in responding to questions about how much the Ferrer campaign was advertising and whether it was being aggressive enough. ''We have to be careful with all of our dollars,'' Mr. Baldick said, ''because we are abiding under the rules and living under the caps, and we haven't been able to find as much exempt spending as other candidates.'' 
 Mr. Miller has asked the Campaign Finance Board to exempt $1.2 million of his campaign expenditures, an amount high enough to cause opponents and political experts to wonder whether he is trying to get around the spending cap.
 Mr. Baldick added, ''We think that we're doing everything we can within the spending limits to get every vote we can between now and Sept. 13.''


CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about critics' claims that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg erred in promising a developer generous incentives to transform the Bronx Terminal Market into a shopping mall misstated the developer's middle initial in some copies. (The error also appeared in articles last Aug. 25 and on Nov. 19, 2004, and in a correction on Nov. 20, 2004.) He is Stephen M. Ross, not J.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Northwest: Washington: Ruling On Mayor's Recall 

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The State Supreme Court ruled that a petition to recall the mayor of Spokane, James E. West, could proceed. Shannon Sullivan, an unemployed mother, filed the petition in May, shortly after The Spokesman-Review newspaper published articles detailing how Mr. 
West had met men online for sex. Mr. West's lawyer argued that the petition bearing a single abuse-of-office charge was factually and legally insufficient. The ruling upheld a lower court decision. The recall petition accuses Mr. West of using his elected office for personal gain, specifically, that he wrote a recommendation letter to help someone he believed to be an 18-year-old man get a City Hall internship. The teenager turned out to be a computer forensics expert hired by the newspaper.

HEADLINE: Orders Dip for Durable Goods, But Home Sales Set a Record 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The much-awaited recovery in manufacturing appears to have been delayed, at least for a month.
 Weak demand for airplanes, military equipment and computers drove orders for durable goods down sharply in July, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. It was the largest drop in a year and a half and seemed to contradict other reports that have led analysts to predict growing production, which typically follows rising orders.
Separately, another Commerce Department report showed that sales of new homes set another record last month, in contrast to data from a day earlier that showed existing-home sales were slowing. 
 The reports left investors and economists hungering for more clarity. ''Just pure volatility'' is how James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS, the investment bank, characterized the latest data.
 Economists said it was hard to draw firm conclusions from the monthly data, because many variables could be skewing the numbers.
 Still, the durable goods orders probably did include at least some impact from high energy costs and higher interest rates, said Cliff Waldman, an economist at Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy research group in Washington.
 ''It shows me that escalating oil prices, the anticipation that interest rates are rising and will continue to rise, and the anticipation that global and U.S. growth will slow may have introduced some skittishness in business plans,'' he said.
 Orders for durable goods -- products expected to last three or more years -- fell 4.9 percent in July. Economists had expected a 1.5 percent fall. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, which includes commercial planes, orders fell 3.2 percent. Analysts had expected a 0.8 percent dip.
 The decline was broad-based and showed up in nearly every sector: communications equipment, machinery, capital goods and military equipment. Compared with July 2004, orders were up 4.7 percent over all and 5 percent excluding transportation.
 Economists who have been predicting rising manufacturing output in the second half of the year after a slow spring say their optimism is undiminished. They note that consumer demand remains strong, businesses do not have much spare inventory available to fill such demand and surveys like the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index show executives are optimistic.
 ''I still believe, and I believe this quite strongly, that the manufacturing sector will, in fact, recover,'' said Anthony Chan, a senior economist at J.P. Morgan Chase Asset Management. ''This is only one month.''
 David Heuther, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said it would take two or three months of weak orders to shake his confidence. So far, ''there hasn't been a significant downturn in consumer confidence or in retail spending,'' he said.
 As for the nation's housing market, investors and economists struggled to grasp what was happening.
 In July, sales of new homes rose 6.5 percent in July, as the median price -- the point at which half the homes sold for more and half sold for less -- fell 7.1 percent, to $203,800. On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors released a report that said sales of existing homes fell 2.6 percent in July, and prices were largely flat.
 ''I don't think either of them tell the real story,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said. He said that the housing market might have peaked, but it would remain at its current high levels until mortgage rates rose substantially.
 An executive at KB Home, which is based in Los Angeles, said the company had seen no let-up in sales or prices. ''We continue to see very strong demand, no inventory, and we are working hard to supply enough product to meet the demand of the marketplace,'' said Jeffrey T. Mezger, executive vice president and chief operating officer for the company.
 New-home sales and prices can swing, based on what kind of homes are being finished in what regions in any given month. Sales of new homes account for about 15 percent of the housing market. 
 In July, new-home sales were up 36 percent in the West; up 10.1 percent in the Northeast; down 3.5 percent in the South; and down 13.5 percent in the Midwest. Existing-home sales were down in the West, Northeast and Midwest and flat in the South.

HEADLINE: Wiretaps in Velella Case Show Deal-Making Efforts by Ferrer Friend

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
When Fernando Ferrer ran for mayor in 2001, he had a useful ally in Manuel Gonzalez, a Bronx parking lot manager who aggressively raised thousands of dollars for Mr. Ferrer's campaign.
 In this year's mayoral race, however, Mr. Gonzalez is nowhere to be found, and Mr. Ferrer is now reluctant to talk about Mr. Gonzalez, a friend from his youth. Their estrangement follows Mr. Gonzalez's jail term last year on charges that he solicited payoffs from contractors seeking help from Guy J. Velella, a former state senator who pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to take bribes.
But more than Mr. Gonzalez's own troubles, it was what the criminal case revealed about his once-close relationship with Mr. Ferrer that has made him a liability. As investigators in the Velella case listened in on Mr. Gonzalez's phone calls, they discovered he was soliciting mayoral campaign contributions for Mr. Ferrer, then the Bronx borough president, in exchange for promises of help with government contracts and loans. 
 Ultimately, prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office found no evidence that Mr. Ferrer or members of his campaign had done anything illegal, and none of the charges against Mr. Gonzalez involved his fund-raising for Mr. Ferrer. And Mr. Ferrer's aides say donors to his campaign did not receive special treatment in exchange for their support, which would have potentially violated the law. 
 Still, Mr. Gonzalez's efforts on behalf of his old friend's campaign drew the attention of investigators, who at least initially found parallels to his dealings with Mr. Velella.
 ''The benefit to Senator Velella was cash funneled through the Velella law firm,'' an investigator wrote in an application seeking court approval for a wiretap. ''Here, the benefit to Ferrer is the requirement that contractors hold fund-raisers for Ferrer's mayoral campaign. This is no less a quid pro quo.''
 Daniel J. Castleman, the prosecutor who supervised the Velella case, said that some of the more pointed statements in the 1999 wiretap applications about Mr. Ferrer were ''based on the information we had at the time,'' but eventually ''those conclusions were not borne out by the investigation.''
 Mr. Ferrer, 55, is now mounting his third mayoral bid, and this time around, polls consistently show him leading three other contenders for the Democratic nomination to face Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican, in November.
 The transcripts' many revelations about Mr. Velella, and the fact that Mr. Ferrer appeared in them, have been previously reported. But a close examination of the extensive paper trail not only reveals many new details of Mr. Ferrer's cameo role in the Velella investigation, but is also a reminder of his roots in a Bronx political culture where promises of favors and campaign contributions are often intertwined.
 Mr. Gonzalez is overheard plotting to seek Mr. Ferrer's help stopping a city land sale, to benefit one contributor, and securing a bus driver's job for the nephew of another. He asked for Mr. Ferrer's assistance speeding up approval of a government loan for a donor. And he arranged a meeting between Mr. Ferrer and a construction executive who agreed to raise $10,000 -- money that Mr. Ferrer later returned after the donor was indicted in a Mafia case.
 Mr. Ferrer would not be interviewed for this article. Jen Bluestein, a spokeswoman for his campaign, said Mr. Ferrer had done no special favors for campaign contributors named in the wiretaps, and was unaware of any promises that Mr. Gonzalez may have made to contractors. She said Mr. Ferrer had no reason to be suspicious because Mr. Gonzalez was someone he had known, and trusted, for most of his life.
 ''Freddy Ferrer and Manny Gonzalez grew up in the Bronx, and they met each other when Freddy was 16 years old,'' said Ms. Bluestein. ''Freddy was shocked and disappointed when he learned of the terribly bad choices Manny made later in his life.''
 If nothing else, Mr. Ferrer emerges in the transcripts as the grateful beneficiary of fund-raising by Mr. Gonzalez, who often spoke cryptically of his activities on behalf of the campaign. After getting a fund-raising commitment from a contractor looking for assistance with a government loan, Mr. Gonzalez telephoned Mr. Ferrer and said that he had ''moved ahead on a couple of issues'' related to the campaign.
 Mr. Ferrer replied, ''Thank you,'' and then offered some help of his own, saying he could use his power as borough president to get rid of two members of a public hospital board who were causing trouble for an associate of Mr. Gonzalez's: ''If I throw these two people out,'' said Mr. Ferrer, ''I just want to make sure that it helps you.'' He added: ''Because if it helps you, I'll do that.''
 ''Thank you,'' Mr. Gonzalez replied. ''I appreciate that.''
 Ms. Bluestein said Mr. Ferrer never took action against the board members.
 Mr. Gonzalez, who owned a parking lot management business, moved easily among Democrats and Republicans in the Bronx, where party labels often blur in a political economy based on the delivery of government-financed health care to the borough's many poor residents.
 A former aide to Ramon S. Velez, once the politically powerful operator of a social-services empire based in Hunts Point, Mr. Gonzalez has known Mr. Ferrer since the two were teenagers in the South Bronx. Over time, he also developed a working relationship with Mr. Velella, a longtime state senator who was seen within the borough as the Republican equivalent in stature and influence to Mr. Ferrer.
 In 1999, the Manhattan district attorney's office, pursuing a tip that Mr. Velella was taking bribes in exchange for helping contractors get government work, began tapping the phones of Mr. Velella and Mr. Gonzalez. They soon overheard Mr. Gonzalez providing what he called ''consulting services'' to contractors, who paid him to use his connections to Mr. Velella and others to drum up business and fix problems.
 Mr. Gonzalez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to eight months in prison last year. He did not return calls for comment made to his home.
 About a month into the eavesdropping, Mr. Ferrer's name began surfacing in some of Mr. Gonzalez's conversations. On average, the wiretaps, which ran through the last half of 1999 into early 2000, captured Mr. Gonzalez making calls every few days to Mr. Ferrer or members of his staff in the borough president's office. Mr. Ferrer's telephones were not tapped.
 As he did with Mr. Velella, Mr. Gonzalez positioned himself as the gateway for some contractors seeking access to Mr. Ferrer, and he often played up his friendship with the borough president. In one conversation, Mr. Gonzalez noted that he had been to Mr. Ferrer's new apartment in Riverdale and dined with Mr. Ferrer and his wife.
 Mr. Gonzalez did enjoy a certain degree of access. A former senior aide to Mr. Ferrer said Mr. Ferrer and his staff had often agreed to meet with people Mr. Gonzalez brought in who were looking for economic development loans or other government help. But, he said, they were not aware that Mr. Gonzalez was making promises of help in exchange for contributions. The former aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he is still active in city politics and government.
 ''Manny would make a phone call and say he had a business guy, can we have a meeting and talk. It would go to Freddy and they'd check schedules and have a meeting,'' the aide said.
 One of those meetings, in late 1999, was between Mr. Ferrer and Finbar O'Neill, a construction company owner looking for government contracts in the Bronx. Mr. O'Neill later pleaded guilty to helping Mr. Gonzalez launder bribe money for Mr. Velella, and he was also one of 38 people charged, in a separate case, with conspiring with the Luchese crime family to inflate the cost of construction contracts in September 2000.
 In a December 1999 conversation with Leonard Carr, a Ferrer campaign aide, Mr. Gonzalez said Mr. O'Neill could be helpful in raising money from ''the Irish guys'' in the construction trades, and he reminded Mr. Carr that Mr. O'Neill was ''one of my guys.'' Mr. Carr reassured Mr. Gonzalez that ''Freddy knows,'' adding, ''He mentioned that to me.''
 The transcripts show that Mr. O'Neill believed his meeting with Mr. Ferrer went well, and Mr. Carr said Mr. O'Neill ''told Freddy that he's going to put together a quick ten'' for his mayoral bid. Campaign finance reports show that Mr. O'Neill raised $10,000 for Mr. Ferrer; the campaign returned most of it after Mr. O'Neill's arrest in the mob case.
 Mr. Gonzalez's value to the Ferrer campaign was evident in the investigators' affidavits, which said that Mr. Ferrer ''wanted Gonzalez to be more involved in the fund-raising activities'' and had asked Mr. Carr to work closely with Mr. Gonzalez.
 In an interview this month, Mr. Carr, who is currently working for Jon S. Corzine's campaign for governor in New Jersey, characterized Mr. Gonzalez's efforts on behalf of Mr. Ferrer as ''a friend helping a friend.'' He described Mr. Gonzalez as a ''grandfatherly figure who was polite and gentlemanly,'' adding that he never saw him do anything inappropriate.
 When dealing with half-hearted contributors, Mr. Gonzalez could be aggressive.
 In a series of calls in late 1999, Mr. Gonzalez browbeat a reluctant businessman to produce a guest list for a $500-a-head Ferrer fund-raiser. The businessman, Manny Varela, complained that it was too much money to ask from the small-time subcontractors with whom he worked. Mr. Gonzalez, who had offered to help Mr. Varela's construction company get a government contract, warned that Mr. Ferrer was getting impatient: ''I want to pick up that list. I got a call from Mr. Ferrer himself. And he's asking me.''
 Mr. Gonzalez then telephoned another businessman, Victor Cintron, who agreed to come to Mr. Varela's fund-raiser, but said he wanted help speeding up approval of a $500,000 economic development loan. Mr. Gonzalez complied, calling Mr. Ferrer and leaving a message asking him ''to move this thing along.'' A Ferrer aide later called back to report that Mr. Ferrer had asked her to look into it.
 Intrigued by what they were hearing, investigators began devoting space in their affidavits to Mr. Ferrer. The affidavits, filed about every 30 days, accompanied requests for a judge to extend or expand the wiretaps. In a September 1999 submission, an investigator wrote that ''Gonzalez has obtained favorable treatment for some of his 'consulting' clients in exchange for their contributions to Ferrer's mayoral campaign.''
 But while the transcripts show that Mr. Gonzalez did occasionally take steps to help contributors, they do not establish that Mr. Ferrer personally fulfilled favors that Mr. Gonzalez may have promised. For example, although Mr. Cintron eventually received his $500,000 loan, investigators concluded that it had received no special treatment.
 The foot-thick pile of Velella papers is not without its comic moments, as when a contractor, pressed by Mr. Gonzalez to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Ferrer, unwisely scheduled it for Father's Day, touching off a minor panic after only a handful of the 60 invitees said they could make it.
 An agitated Mr. Carr urged Mr. Gonzalez to ''crack the whip'' because the campaign was ''originally counting on this event to raise $15,000.'' Mr. Gonzalez responded: ''We're pushing. We're going to push. By hook or crook, we'll get them, O.K.?''

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Mexico: Corn Syrup Tariff Weighed

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Mexico may impose an import tariff of up to 210 percent on corn sweetener from the United States after the World Trade Organization ruled a Mexican tax on high-fructose beverages violated trade agreements, a Mexican trade official said. Mexico is studying the option of a tariff to protect its sugar industry from United States corn sweetener imports because the United States blocks imports of Mexican sugar exports allowed under the North American Free Trade Agreement, said Hugo Perezcano, the legal director for international negotiations at the trade ministry. 
''We're considering resolving the tax issue and substituting it with an import tariff under the Nafta framework,'' Mr. Perezcano said in Mexico City. ''The W.T.O., for example, allows us to adopt a maximum tariff of 210 percent on fructose imports.''

HEADLINE: In Iraq's Prisons, Try a Little Tenderness

BYLINE: By Scott Gerwehr and Nina Hachigian. 
Scott Gerwehr is a policy analyst and Nina Hachigian a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
WHEN Americans talk about ''the lessons of Vietnam,'' they usually mean failed policies and programs that shouldn't be repeated. But there were some successes in the Vietnam War, including an initiative to win the allegiance of captured and defecting Vietcong and North Vietnamese fighters by treating them generously and reshaping their attitudes. This idea -- that harsh treatment of prisoners can be less effective than showing compassion -- now deserves a test in Iraq.
 The program in Vietnam was called Chieu Hoi, roughly translated as ''open arms.'' While rarely effective against the most hard-core and high-ranking insurgents, Chieu Hoi succeeded in winning the support of nearly 200,000 fighters for the American-backed government of South Vietnam. 
Under Chieu Hoi, defectors and prisoners who proved cooperative received clemency against treason charges as well as good food, health care, vocational training and jobs. At the same time, they were systematically indoctrinated with literature, classes and activities to persuade them to support the South Vietnamese government. 
 Studies carried out during the war by the RAND Corporation found that thousands of those former enemies who participated in Chieu Hoi became good sources of intelligence on the Communist forces, provided American advisers and troops with cultural and linguistic knowledge, enlisted civilians to support the American cause, and even took up arms against their former Vietcong and North Vietnamese comrades. 
 One unidentified Marine officer quoted in a 1973 RAND study said that a Chieu Hoi participant named Truong Kinh, who worked as a scout with his division, killed 55 Vietcong and North Vietnamese fighters in a single day, saving American lives and gaining ''the admiration and respect of every marine in the company.'' 
 Captured enemy documents now in the archives of the Army Special Operations Command discuss the powerful effect of Chieu Hoi on the enemy. One Vietcong report from 1966 says: ''The impact of increased enemy military operations and 'Chieu Hoi' programs has, on the whole, resulted in lowering of morale of some ideologically backward men, who often listen to enemy radio broadcasts, keep in their pockets enemy leaflets, and wait to be issued weapons. This attitude on their part has generated an atmosphere of doubt and mistrust among our military ranks.'' The Vietcong feared the program, and expended a great deal of effort in attempting to thwart it through assassinations, infiltration and counterpropaganda.
 So what does this have to do with Iraq? While Chieu Hoi was geared to counter a Communist threat, it was based on universal principles of counterinsurgency that could easily be applied to the current struggle. In fact, Chieu Hoi was something of an import in its own right: it was the brainchild of three men with long experience battling rebels. One was Sir Robert Thompson, who led the British Advisory Mission in Vietnam and was renowned for his work in Britain's quelling of the Communist insurgency in Malaya in the 1950's. The others were Rufus Phillips, a former C.I.A. official working for the United States Agency for International Development, and Charles Bohannan, a retired Army colonel; this pair had led the American effort in late 1940's to stop the Huk insurgency in the Philippines. 
 They designed Chieu Hoi to focus on changing the underlying attitudes of the subjects, not simply on trying to control their behavior. Empirical research in social psychology reveals that efforts to directly control behavior through coercion or bribery usually leave underlying attitudes intact, or even harden them. Thus putting a gun to a man's head and instructing him to support a particular political ideology will work only as long as the gun is present and he is being watched. The preferred method for long-term change is instilling sincere belief in the new political ideology, making the gun and monitoring unnecessary.
 American forces in Iraq would have nothing to lose in applying this basic psychology and developing a pilot program based on Chieu Hoi. It is an inexpensive and nonviolent approach that can aid the counterinsurgency: there are some 10,000 prisoners being held in Iraq, and ''turning'' even a small fraction of them could reap huge dividends in terms of gaining intelligence for our forces, diminishing support for the insurgents and reducing anti-American sentiment among average Iraqis.
 In addition, running our prisons under the Chieu Hoi model could help reverse the terrible propaganda defeat suffered with the revelations of torture at Abu Ghraib. Nongovernmental groups like the International Red Cross and Amnesty International would praise America, bringing more international support. And prisoners released by our forces would return to their communities with stories of American generosity and tolerance, increasing support for the United States' efforts. 
 Some Americans would undoubtedly criticize a program that treated prisoners and defectors well, arguing that insurgents who kill our men and women do not deserve kindness. This is understandable: during the Vietnam War, Chieu Hoi was often derided as ''rest and recreation for the enemy.'' But we are up against a determined insurgency; a desire for retribution should not be allowed to stand in the way of effective policy and our ultimate success in Iraq.

HEADLINE: In New England, Sighs of Relief as Commission Votes to Save Submarine Base

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY and KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., Aug. 24 

 BODY:
In hearings, rallies, letters and late-night phone calls, they sounded ominous warnings about the consequences of closing the Navy submarine base here: The Pentagon would not save nearly as much as it expected. The national defense would be weakened. The environmental cleanup would be costly. 
 But perhaps the biggest fear of the politicians, retired admirals and business leaders heading the effort was that in losing this historic base and the 205-year-old Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Me., New England and much of the Northeast would be left without any significant military presence, and local economies would be devastated. 
On Wednesday, after an independent federal commission rejected the Defense Department's proposal to include the two bases in the latest wave of closings, there was joy and relief, from whoops in small-town streets to congratulatory calls in Congressional offices. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, joked that the commission's chairman, Anthony J. Principi, had his vote for president. The chairwoman of the Kittery Town Council declared, ''Our town is going to stay intact.'' And the region's military and manufacturing industries, which have seen jobs and the Pentagon's interest shift to bases in the South and West, exhaled deeply after three months of lobbying and worrying.
 Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican whose district includes the Groton base, saluted the commission after the vote. ''New England,'' he said later, ''is fighting back.''
 The region, which stood to lose 13,000 on-site jobs just from closing the Groton and Kittery bases, seemed the unlikely winner on the first day of votes by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, meeting in Arlington, Va. The Pentagon, which announced the planned closings in May, had said that shuttering the Groton base would save about $1.6 billion over 20 years and that closing the Portsmouth yard would save about $1.3 billion -- more than any other naval base on its list.
 Not every New England base was saved. The commission voted to close the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine, against the Pentagon's recommendations. Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod did not come up for a vote on Wednesday. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the decisions to keep the other bases open showed that commission members were ''serious in their concerns that the Pentagon's recommendations leave the Northeast undefended.''
 The commission, also known as BRAC for base realignment and closure, decided to close some smaller bases in Connecticut, and the Army research base at Fort Monmouth, N.J. But in a wrinkle that gave New Jersey politicians hope, the commission said the research base should not be closed immediately if that would hurt the fight against terrorism. 
 For all the worry over the region's economy and military presence, those fighting to keep the bases open appealed to the commission mainly on issues of military spending and national defense -- factors that the commission considers when deciding whether the remove a base from the Pentagon's proposed list.
 ''Military value trumps everything,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''We all knew that.''
 Connecticut officials said the Pentagon had ignored the most distinctive assets of the Groton base: its school for training submariners and its proximity, just a few miles up the Thames River, from Electric Boat, the Navy's primary submarine builder and repairer. They also said that closing the base, officially called the Naval Submarine Base New London, for Groton's neighboring town, would diminish the submarine force while other countries were investing in submarines and nuclear weapons.
 Those arguments seemed to carry weight with the majority of the nine-member commission, which voted 7 to 1, with 1 abstention, to keep the base open. 
 ''The New London submarine base is more than piers and parking spaces for nuclear-powered submarines,'' Mr. Principi, the chairman and a former secretary of veterans affairs, said Wednesday. ''It is truly the center of excellence in submarine warfare'' and ''would be very, very difficult to replicate at another location.''
 He also touched on a continuing debate within the Navy over whether the current fleet of about 54 nuclear-powered attack submarines should be reduced or increased. 
 ''The emerging nuclear threat that we are facing in the world today leaves uncertain the force structure of nuclear-powered submarines of the future,'' Mr. Principi said. ''If we close New London down, we would never get it back. I think it would be a tragic mistake, a tragic loss for this nation.'' 
 The commission vote to keep open the Portsmouth shipyard was also 7 to 1. The yard is on the border between Maine and New Hampshire, and officials from both states fought its closing with an argument rooted in pride, work ethic and economics. They argued that the base consistently fixed submarines under budget and on time, returning them to fleets faster than any other shipyard in the country. It would take nearly a decade, they said, to train nuclear submarine technicians fully with similar skills.
 In July, Portsmouth workers clad in yellow ''Save Our Shipyard'' T-shirts showed up at commission hearings in Boston. At the shipyard on Wednesday, someone hung a large sign bearing that slogan, but tacked a ''d'' onto the ''Save.''
 In Connecticut, state economists had estimated that closing the Groton base could endanger 22,000 private sector jobs, many of them in high-tech businesses, in addition to the 8,500 on the base itself. But on Wednesday, workers across the economic spectrum expressed relief.
 ''Uniforms, dry-cleaning, wash-and-fold -- they're at least 90 percent of our business,'' said Tanya Stonick, an attendant at Pop's Kitchen, Mum's Washtub, just up Route 12 from the submarine base. ''I'm feeling like my job was saved today.''

HEADLINE: Lost in Translation

BYLINE: By Thomas X. Hammes. 
Thomas X. Hammes, a retired Marine colonel, is the author of ''The Sling and The Stone: On War in the 21st Century.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
THERE is an amusing scene in an ''Indiana Jones'' film where a British scholar walks around a train station in a foreign land desperately seeking help by calling out, ''Excuse me, does anyone here speak English? Or Ancient Greek?'' Today our troops in Iraq often find themselves in that same scene -- except it never ends. 
 The widely reported shortages of vehicles, armor and other equipment have demonstrated the level to which the Bush administration has not provided our soldiers or their Iraqi allies with the basic tools needed to do the job. But a less remarked-upon problem, the extreme shortage of translators to help our soldiers communicate with Iraqis, is particularly puzzling.
Without an interpreter, our people are essentially blind to what is happening around them. They cannot tell if the loud argument in the market is over the price of tomatoes or a threat of murder. And because in general we hire local Iraqis to surmount the language hurdle, Americans don't even know if they can trust their own interpreters. Equally important, Iraqis who want to share important information with an American patrol cannot unless there is an interpreter -- a message as simple as ''look behind the grade school'' is impossible to convey in hand signals and pigeon English. How can average Iraqis help us secure the country if they can't speak to us? 
 Yet American forces in Iraq average only one or two interpreters per company (about 150 soldiers or Marines). When I was there on active duty last year, I worked in the department providing all American logistical and maintenance support for the nascent Iraqi armed forces. Our office had two Americans and 22 Iraqis -- and not a single translator. At the various military bases we oversaw, conversation between American advisers and their Iraqi counterparts was catch-as-catch-can. And we were banned from hiring Iraqis on our own because we were told that one American contractor had a ''sole source contract'' with the Pentagon. 
 Why couldn't the contractor provide sufficient translators? While I never received an official explanation, I did get a pretty good hint: the translators we worked with told me they were getting about $400 a month for their services. This is clearly insufficient to encourage many Iraqis to risk their lives to help us. The American businesses in the region, like the oil contractors and even press organizations, paid much more. 
 This is a problem we should be able to solve quickly. One of the great strengths of our immigrant nation is that we have thousands of citizens and aspiring citizens who are fluent in both English and Arabic. Why we have not made use of this talent is a mystery. 
 The Pentagon might try a two-stage approach to capitalize on this Arab-American population. First, appeal to patriotism. Throughout our history, particularly in the two World Wars, new Americans have shown remarkable loyalty to their adopted home. Many Arabic speakers took great risks to become a part of our melting pot, yet since 9/11 the government has often acted as if they cannot be trusted. It is time to recognize their loyalty and ask for their help.
 Second, because they're doing a high-risk job, we must pay interpreters adequately. The Pentagon has used market forces to ensure we have sufficient civilian truck drivers and caterers, and those same forces can ensure we have enough qualified interpreters. 
 If we paid an Arabic speaker, say, $200,000 a year to go to Iraq, and that interpreter prevented a single American casualty, he would have more than paid for himself. That is, even setting aside the human cost of a fatality, the financial cost of the death of a soldier (usually $500,000 in Pentagon-supplied death benefit and life insurance) or a serious injury (often much higher) make interpreters a good investment. Of course, as we do with most contractors we hire in Iraq, we would put much of the salary into a large bonus for completing the tour of duty: say 35 percent for the first 364 days and 65 percent on the 365th day -- all of it tax free. 
 We also need to make greater use of Arabic-speaking Americans at home for accurate translation of captured documents. Former colleagues still serving in Iraq have complained to me of months-long delays in translating captured files. One told me of finding documents that proved some senior Iraqi National Guard officers were working for the insurgents but that went untranslated for more than 120 days; the men were arrested when the translations came back -- but only after doing four more months of damage. 
 There is no reason for such delays: anything captured in Iraq can be quickly scanned and e-mailed to the appropriate government agencies. The problem is that we don't have enough people to translate them at home. In the same vein, federal law-enforcement agencies have hours of audio tapes and piles of documents that need translation from the Arabic. One would assume that if these conversations were important enough to tape, they must be important enough to translate. 
 THE government should approach Arab-American community leaders to help with a recruitment campaign to develop cadres of translators for the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security and our various intelligence agencies. Not only would this give these citizens a way to directly contribute to the war effort, it would also provide new jobs in their communities, many of them economically struggling.
 Insurgencies like that in Iraq are defeated not on the battlefield but by good governance and effective police work. We will not achieve either if we can't understand what our allies are saying, much less what our enemies are.

HEADLINE: Washington Fiddles While Oil Burns

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
HOWEVER painful it is to drive into a gasoline station this summer, it may be just as painful to heat your home this winter. The price of heating oil has nearly doubled since 2003, to about $2 a gallon retail, and natural gas, the heating fuel of choice in much of the country, has tripled since the late 90's. Where prices will be in February is anybody's guess.
 But homeowners shopping for a furnace will do so without benefit of long-awaited federal rules setting minimum standards for efficiency. That may be true in 2006 and 2007 as well.
Call it one very overdue homework assignment. In 1987 Congress gave the Energy Department a deadline of 1994 to set new efficiency standards for home furnaces running on oil and gas, standards that would go beyond simple labeling. Congress is still waiting, along with the millions of Americans who buy furnaces each year. 
 Part of the Energy Department's problem is having to grapple with different heating requirements in different areas: minimum efficiency requirements, because they increase the cost of a furnace, would make more sense in, say, Massachusetts than in Georgia, where an efficient air-conditioner would be a bigger priority. 
 One way or another, however, the standard will be developed, said David K. Garman, the department's under secretary for energy, science and environment, explaining that his new boss, Samuel W. Bodman, ''has lit a fire under us.'' 
 Furnaces are expensive -- thousands of dollars -- but they can last 30 years. So minor increases in efficiency can pay off, especially in cold regions like the Northeast and even more so when fuel prices are high. Furnace makers are already required to post energy efficiency ratings on their products, an aid to consumers trying to comparison-shop. Setting a minimum standard would simply eliminate the least efficient models, which would help address ''on the truck'' syndrome: the tendency of consumers with suddenly deceased furnaces (or water heaters) to take the first replacement model a dealer can deliver, regardless of efficiency. 
 Minimum standards would also help tenants who pay for their own heating and whose landlords might otherwise be tempted to buy a cheap, inefficient furnace.
 Setting such standards for any appliance takes time, of course (about six years, Mr. Garman said: three for the manufacturers, consumer advocates, utility companies and other interested parties to agree on a testing procedure, and three more for carrying out tests and deciding where to set the minimum). 
 The system is cumbersome but was put in place after Congress, unhappy with a previous system for setting standards, imposed a moratorium until the department could come up with something more transparent and responsive to all parties. 
 Now Congress is frustrated with the pace of that effort. The latest energy legislation, signed by President Bush in August, shortens the process for some equipment, either by specifying the testing methodology or by simply codifying a standard that has sometimes already been worked out informally by various parties. But furnaces were not on the list.
 ''They've missed 28 deadlines for 23 individual products,'' said Kit Kennedy, a lawyer and an energy efficiency expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization that relies on private donations. ''This is a problem that has extended through several administrations.''
 ''It's kind of a puzzlement,'' she said. The standards tend to be ''important but obscure issues'' that get lost in the shuffle.
 Comparison shoppers can meanwhile consider a furnace's ''annual fuel utilization efficiency,'' which measures the proportion of the heat in the fuel that actually goes to warm the house and the proportion that goes up the chimney. Efficiencies range from 78 to 96 percent; prices range accordingly. 
 Standard Oil of Connecticut, which serves McMansion-rich Fairfield County, is currently selling heating oil for about $2.45 a gallon and furnaces for $3,600 to $5,000, with larger and more efficient ones clustered at the high end. The higher the efficiency -- and the higher the price of oil -- the faster the investment in a new furnace pays off. 
 Some contractors are reluctant to install the most efficient models because they have less experience with them and fear breakdowns, said Keith Freischlag, the energy efficiency coordinator at Unitil, a utility that serves parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. A natural gas furnace with 80 percent efficiency is typically $500 cheaper than one that is 85 percent efficient, he said, and his company will pay the difference when consumers choose the more efficient model. (He also noted that installation of higher-efficiency models costs a little more.)
 Furnace efficiency is not always high on the customer's list, Mr. Freischlag noted, adding, ''Feds coming in with a minimum efficiency factor, that's a great idea.''
 Furnaces that heat air and blow it through the house also consume electricity. The ones with the best blower motors save about $50 on electricity bills a year. The government does not regulate the efficiency of the blowers in forced-air units, however. 
 Homeowners who replace a furnace should aim to buy the smallest one that will do the job, experts say (because bigger furnaces cycle on and off more often, and they waste a bit of fuel each time they cycle off). Homeowners who have replaced their windows recently may want to consider a smaller furnace when the time comes for a replacement. 
 In an economist's perfect world, buyers would calculate the value of an investment in efficiency and compel manufacturers to drive average efficiency higher. But that doesn't happen if many buyers are builders or landlords uninterested in operating costs, or homeowners in a hurry because the old furnace has quit. 
 ''The market's working, but it's not working for everybody,'' said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group in Boston financed by private foundations. That is one reason his group supports a minimum efficiency standard. 
 In another ideal world, the law might allow the Energy Department to set different standards for different states. It does not, but Mr. Garman said, ''We're looking for a creative way of splitting that baby.''
 ''We want to figure out a way to capture the maximum benefit but not put anybody under a ridiculous economic burden,'' he said.
 He would not elaborate, but energy efficiency experts said that the department might be able to set two standards and let the states choose between them, or perhaps set a standard and specify that it did not pre-empt the states from establishing a stricter one.
 Another issue is how to measure the benefits of increased efficiency. Usually the department multiplies the amount of money saved on fuel by the years of life of the appliance and applies an interest rate to reflect the lower value of savings in the distant future. 
 But efficiency advocates say the potential value of reduced consumption is far higher. Quite apart from slowing the increase in global warming gases, they say that because natural gas prices are generally determined by supply and demand in North America, cutting demand for it in American homes could cut price. 
 If millions of houses cut their consumption by a few percent, the Natural Resources Defense Council argues (along with one major user, DuPont), then total demand would fall, and the price would too, saving the economy billions of dollars. 
 The Energy Department is still considering that argument.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Investigates Hedge Fund For Solvency

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
State and federal officials in Connecticut are investigating the possible collapse of the Bayou Group, a hedge fund and brokerage firm in Stamford that managed an estimated $400 million for its investors, according to two people briefed on the investigation.
 Clients of the Bayou Group apparently grew concerned about the firm's status in recent days, when refund checks it had sent to customers could not be drawn upon for lack of funds, one of the two people briefed on the investigation said. In addition, telephones at Bayou went unanswered.
 ''We are aware that there is a situation with people not being able to be in contact with the company,'' said James Heckman, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Banking. ''We are looking into it. Beyond that, I can't comment.'' 
 Christine Sciarrino, an assistant United States attorney for Connecticut, who leads the financial litigation unit of that office's civil division, declined to comment on the matter. A spokesman for the United States attorney's office did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 Regulatory filings indicate that the Bayou Group is overseen by Samuel Israel III, 46, of Harrison, N.Y. The Web site of the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization of the commodity futures industry, lists Mr. Israel as a member of one of its advisory committees.
 A telephone call yesterday afternoon to the Stamford office of the Bayou Group was not answered. A message left at Mr. Israel's home was not returned.
 According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bayou started four hedge funds in January 2003, expecting to raise more than $250 million from wealthy individuals. The minimum investment in each fund was $250,000. They were called Bayou Superfund, Bayou No Leverage Fund, Bayou Affiliates and Bayou Accredited Fund.
 Hedge funds, which are lightly regulated investment funds aimed at wealthy investors, have grown significantly in recent years. Tremont Advisors, a firm that tracks hedge funds, said that individual hedge fund managers manage $1 trillion today, up from $120 billion in 1994.
 While hedge funds produced stellar returns in the years immediately following the bursting of the Nasdaq stock bubble in 2000, more recently many of them have had difficulty outpacing returns in the overall stock market. Last year, the hedge fund index rose 9.6 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 10.9 percent.
 The explosion in assets under management at hedge funds has worried some market participants, because they are not subject to the intense regulatory scrutiny of other investment advisers.
 In recent months, for example, federal investigators have been trying to unravel the apparent collapse of the KL Group, a hedge fund advisory business in West Palm Beach, Fla. Officials investigating that failure have said that $200 million may have been lost. Two of the firm's principals, who have been sued by the S.E.C., have disappeared.
 According to the people briefed on the investigation into the Bayou Group, its brokerage firm subsidiary, known as Bayou Securities, conducted trades for its hedge funds. The firm's trades were cleared by Bear Stearns, one of the biggest firms in the business of providing administrative and financing services to hedge funds. A Bear Stearns spokeswoman did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 Bayou has had regulatory troubles before. In 2003, Connecticut's banking department filed an administrative proceeding against Bayou Securities, which was started in January 1996, contending that the company's records did not fully reflect the business that it was conducting. Bayou settled the proceeding, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, but paid a $7,500 fine and agreed to provide banking regulators with all complaints lodged against it by Connecticut residents until October 2005. 
 As part of its settlement, Bayou said that it had reviewed and adopted ''supervisory and compliance procedures designed to improve regulatory compliance,'' and that the procedures would ensure that the firm's records would be accurate.
 Also in 2003, Mr. Israel and a colleague, Daniel Marino, were sued by Paul T. Westervelt Jr., and his son, Paul T. Westervelt III, in a breach of contract case in Federal District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs in the case contended that Bayou's management persuaded them to join the firm but failed to provide them with the necessary business documents and financial information relating to the firm. According to the complaint, after the elder Mr. Westervelt joined Bayou, he discovered what he considered to be ''possible violations of S.E.C. regulations governing the operating of hedge funds,'' and other possible violations.
 The case was dismissed from federal court in November 2003 after the judge overseeing it ordered it to be heard by an arbitration panel, under NASD rules. It is not clear whether an arbitration was started. Lawyers representing both the plaintiffs and Bayou did not return phone calls seeking comment last night.

HEADLINE: A $130-a-Week Hotel Survives Near the Beach in Rockaway 

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
If you need a home in a hurry and do not mind salt air and salty neighbors, with $130 and your own roll of toilet paper you can move into the Baxter Hotel in Rockaway Park, a half-block from the Atlantic Ocean.
 That is the weekly rent charged by the owner, John Baxter: $130, with no deposit, no security and no questions asked.
Inside the office, a sign directs new residents to ''please read all the house rules carefully or ask management to read them to you.'' For a $130 check, Mr. Baxter handed a recent visitor the key to Room 27 and said in his Irish brogue, ''I hope you're good at remembering faces,'' adding as he walked away, ''There's no mirror in the room.'' 
 His assistant, Sean Reeder, led the way up creaky stairs to a fourth-floor room. Smoking was permitted out the room window. Asked about the house rules, Mr. Reeder said, ''Just don't do anything to make us kick you out.''
 ''The bathroom's over there,'' he added, pointing to three tiny bathrooms at the end of the hall. Two had stall showers. None had sinks, mirrors or toilet paper. They did provide views of Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic.
 The Baxter is one of three single-room-occupancy hotels huddled together against the world on Beach 116th Street, just down from the end of the A subway line. It sits between a closed S.R.O. called the Hotel Lawrence and the Rockaway Park Hotel, a functioning S.R.O. whose residents include young children and a man who wears outfits made from plastic garbage bags.
 It is also a stubborn survivor of New York's shifting housing picture. Places like the Baxter that offer humble lodgings to people of humble means have been steadily disappearing from the city's landscape, in part to make room for more lucrative real estate. 
 In 1998, the last year for which the city has data, there were 46,744 S.R.O. units, down from 57,128 in 1993. In 2002, a survey by the West Side S.R.O. Law Project, an advocacy group, counted 35,227 units. 
 And while the Baxter may be the only thing standing between its tenants and the street or a shelter, the hotel, like many S.R.O.'s, is reviled and regarded by its neighbors as a fleabag that attracts undesirables. 
 Most residents are acutely aware that many local homeowners and merchants consider them a blight on the community and want their home torn down -- a view stated regularly at community board meetings and in letters to the local newspaper.
 So the Baxter's tenants prefer to avoid conversation by scurrying silently by and squeezing behind their doors. ''It's really 'live and let live' around here,''' explained one resident, Jim Hammond. ''No one wants to be bothered. They know the reputation people have of them and the place. I've learned to just keep my eyes looking straight ahead of me. After all this time, I only know a few people here by name.''
 Mr. Hammond, an administrator for the New York Fire Department, said he had been living at the Baxter off and on for four years while on a waiting list for a studio co-op he could afford in a high-rise nearby. His name had just come up so he was packing up to leave the Baxter for good.
 ''You could fit five of these rooms in it,'' he said, sitting in his hotel room. A lineup of Jockey shorts hung neatly on hangers next to his dress shirts. 
 After telling his story, he spelled his name slowly and added, ''That should make my ex-wife happy.''
 The rooms at the Baxter are smaller than some elevators. The one visited recently had a ceiling and walls painted powder blue. There was a bald light bulb in a ceiling fixture, a dresser, a mini-refrigerator, an itchy bed with mismatched sheets and a television equipped with an antenna, not cable.
 Air-conditioners are banned at the Baxter because its old electrical system could not support them, but with the door open, a salty breeze sweeps through the room and makes even sweltering days tolerable.
 At night, the soundtrack is an overlay of arguments, children chanting, adults making love, a ballgame, talk radio, pop, rap, sitcom laugh-tracks and low-flying jets bound for Kennedy Airport.
 Next door is Annie Kenney, 82, a Brooklyn native who took her disability checks and retired to the Rockaways. She can barely climb stairs because her knees are shot. So Mr. Reeder runs her errands and she stays up in her room for days at a time.
 ''I'm used to it,'' she said. ''I keep busy with the radio and the TV. I like sports and the news.'' 
 ''The people here are all special people,'' she added. ''I say a prayer for every one of them.''
 Across the hall is a young man who works in the kitchen of a Pizza Hut in Midtown. He said he was just passing through, and when he walked away, Mrs. Kenney said, ''That's what everybody says when they come here.''
 Most people wind up at the Baxter because of loss, either of family, friends, job, home, or all of the above.
 Richie Veneziano, 51, who lives on the second floor, said he was ''living a normal life'' as a banker in Manhattan with an apartment in Brooklyn and a place in Florida. Then he had a stroke, stopped working and was evicted by his aunt.
 ''My family used to have big Sunday dinners, but when I hit the skids, they all disappeared and so did my friends and my apartment,'' he said. ''No one wanted to know me anymore.''
 Living on disability checks, he moved in with another aunt in Rockaway, who eventually evicted him, too. So he came to the Baxter.
 ''It's better than sleeping on the street,'' he said. ''I had no place to go and very little money. To find a room a half-block from the beach is a bargain. I'm in limbo, but it's a comfortable limbo.'' 
 Mr. Baxter and his wife have a nice house several blocks away, but he spends most of his time around the hotel and keeps a suite of rooms for himself on the second floor. 
 In the afternoon, he drinks with the working stiffs and holds court at the Sand Bar, on the boardwalk next to the Park Inn psychiatric home, one of the many nursing homes and mental health facilities that are clustered nearby. 
 The open-air bar is the center of the circus that is Beach 116th Street: a busy commercial strip that attracts vagrants, drunks, mental patients and battalions of beachgoers. 
 Mr. Baxter grew up on a farm in County Cavan, Ireland, and came to New York in 1954. He has run for the New York City Council, published a local newspaper and is a fixture at community board meetings, speaking his mind and videotaping them for use on his monthly Queens cable television show. 
 On the show and in plays and revues he produces in the small theater on the Baxter's ground floor he skewers local politicians, whom he blames for letting the city turn the Rockaways into ''the toilet of New York City.'' 
 The peninsula has a high unemployment rate and more than its share of housing projects and psychiatric and nursing homes. 
 Luxury co-op apartments are being built across the street, and rumor has it that the developer is offering the Rockaway Park Hotel's owners $3 million to sell. Whatever happens, Mr. Baxter says he is not selling.
 ''This is all I have, fighting these bums,'' he said. ''They're going to have to carry me out in a tin box.''

HEADLINE: To Preserve Its Way of Life, Island Seeks Independence

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: CHEBEAGUE ISLAND, Me. 

 BODY:
The ferry to this peaceful island takes only 15 minutes. But by other measures, the mainland of Maine and the few-frills enclave of Chebeague Island are many miles apart. 
 Commerce here consists mostly of a small grocery store, a shoebox-size gift shop, an inn and a clam shack on Tom Calder's front lawn. Unpaved roads course by white clapboard houses, stacks of lobster traps and rocky coves.
 ''That community and this one just look at things differently,'' Philip Jordan, a retired college president and longtime Chebeaguer, said of the mainland town of Cumberland, to which the island legally belongs. ''This place is more traditional, it's more rural, it maintains the traditional occupation of fishing. Cumberland has become an increasingly suburban upscale bedroom community to mainland Portland. We have just had a series of disconnects on a number of issues.'' 
 Now, many of the 350 year-round residents of Chebeague want to make the disconnect permanent. They are trying to secede from Cumberland and form their own town, and are preparing for a long fight that will ultimately be decided by the Maine Legislature. These islanders believe secession would let them control their way of life by helping them hold the line on galloping property taxes and encroaching development caused by wealthy summer vacationers, and by allowing them to ensure that the island keeps its school. 
 Chebeague's campaign goes against a tide of consolidation as other villages in the United States have joined larger towns to cut costs. It also breaks from the more traditional story of wealthy communities' leaving large cities, often contending that their taxes disproportionately support programs for urban ills.
 Chebeague, with its lobstermen, tradesmen and sizable elderly population, has a per capita income of $32,000. Cumberland, once a farming town, now has 7,500 residents, and it is one of Maine's wealthiest, with a per capita income of $85,000, said Bill Shane, the town manager. 
 ''It's really a dying way of life that they're trying to preserve and protect, a way of life that isn't so fast-paced, if you can call Maine fast-paced,'' said Mr. Shane, who opposes secession but understands the motivation. ''We went our way, and Chebeague Island stayed Chebeague Island.''
 Chebeague (pronounced shuh-BIG), a 200-acre island in Casco Bay about 5 miles from mainland Cumberland and 10 from Portland, is one of only 15 islands in Maine with year-round residents. The island's unofficial historian, Donna Damon, said half the residents trace their island ancestry back 250 years, many to the Hamilton clan and an era when streets were paved with clam shells. 
 Beverly Johnson, a plumber and a leader of the secession movement, said Chebeaguers' uses for the mainland include groceries, medical needs that cannot be handled by the physician's assistant on the island, and sports, with some teenagers bunking in mainland hotels to attend twice-daily soccer practice. 
 Few Chebeaguers participate in the town government because it spends ''only a small percent of the time on issues that concern Chebeague,'' Ms. Johnson said. 
 Chebeaguers have often done what the town did not, raising money to put plumbing in their meeting hall and to build a library, an assisted living center and a recreation center. 
 ''That transient type of community on the mainland doesn't have the same understanding of rootedness,'' said Ms. Damon, Chebeague's representative on the Town Council. ''You have people coming into Cumberland on what I call the 12-year plan -- to educate their children and move on, sell their house and make a good profit.''
 But Chebeague, with its desirable waterfront property, has not escaped the gold rush. While some old-timers have preserved the island's character by deeding property to land trusts or selling it cheap to relatives and friends, sometimes land sells, for whatever the market will bear, to some of the 1,400 summer people from New York and elsewhere.
 Indeed, when Hartley and Diane Brewer decided recently to sell the island's only boat yard, islanders were amazed at the $2 million asking price. A group of lobstermen is trying to buy it, but residents worry that developers will buy it instead. 
 Bob Dayton, of the Dayton's department store family and one of the wealthiest longtime summer residents, said that this month a newcomer suggested buying his 13 acres and turning it into condominiums. 
 ''I said, 'Like hell you will,''' Mr. Dayton said.
 Rising property values have driven up taxes. Leon Hamilton, 57, a ferry captain, said his taxes had jumped to nearly $8,000 from under $2,000 in the last three years, and he said he hoped an independent Chebeague might limit taxes by spending less. 
 But for many, the secession movement was triggered by two events: an effort by Cumberland to put a liquefied natural gas terminal on a neighboring island, and a proposal by the school district this year to eliminate one of the two teachers in Chebeague's 23-student school and require children in the two highest grades, fourth and fifth, to attend school on the mainland. 
 The proposal failed, but islanders fear that the attempt was a prelude to closing the school. ''Without a school on the island you won't have young families, and without young families you won't be able to secure the future of the island's year-round community,'' said Mr. Calder, the clam shack owner, who is Chebeague's fire chief and school bus driver, and has three children.
 Having its own school district could cut Chebeague's taxes significantly. In fact, although creating a district requires even more steps than forming a town, many islanders say that without a separate school, seceding is pointless. 
 Not every islander is sold on secession. Dianne Calder, 68, Mr. Calder's mother, said she thought relations with the town had improved, and she was wary of self-governance because ''neighbor pitted against neighbor might create animosity.''
 Jim Phipps, a former town councilor, said that if the effort failed, the island would end up ''burning bridges without accomplishing anything other than alienating the people that we're going to ultimately have to do business with.'' 
 To secede requires a referendum, a vote of the Town Council and a vote of the state Legislature, which can override the council. [On Monday, a petition with 273 islanders' signatures was presented to the town, enough to start the process.] To form its own school district, the island must win over the state education commissioner and the Legislature. 
 One mainland member of the Town Council, Jeff Porter, was supportive of secession until he learned that Chebeaguers, saying they wanted to preserve their fishing area, proposed taking 13 other small islands and parts of two more with them. 
 Mr. Porter, who said he believes that Chebeaguers want the islands, most uninhabited, for their $100,000 in property tax and to control development, is now so opposed that he argued against giving Chebeague its first new fire truck in 33 years, saying, ''Why would I buy my wife a minivan if she was divorcing me?'' 
 Bill Stiles, the council chairman, opposes losing what he sees as a unique island and said secession will not prevent ''what's going to happen eventually as these properties are purchased as summer vacation places and families are going to find it too expensive to live there and raise their children.''
 But Philip Conkling, president of the Island Institute, which studies and supports Maine's islands, disagrees. ''If Chebeague stays part of Cumberland, the dynamic will be inexorably rising property values that are controlled by Cumberland,'' he said, ''and the year-round community, the traditional fisheries and small-business-based economy will be extinguished.''


CORRECTION-DATE: September 23, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 25 about efforts by residents of Chebeague Island in Maine to secede from the town of Cumberland included an erroneous label from the town manager for relative income figures -- $32,000 in Chebeague and $85,000 in Cumberland. The figures were for household income, not per capita.
An article on Aug. 25 about efforts by residents of Chebeague Island in Maine to secede from the town of Cumberland misstated the island's size. It is more than 1,860 acres, not 200.

PERSON: Vito J. Pitta

HEADLINE: Vito Pitta, Former Hotel Trades Council President, Dies at 78 

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Vito J. Pitta, a former president of the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council and longtime leader of its core Local 6, died on Sunday at his home on Staten Island. He was 78 and also had a home in Sunny Isles, Fla.
 The cause was complications of lung cancer, his family said. 
One of the city's most forceful labor leaders, Mr. Pitta was credited with improving the economic standing of workers who, often unseen, keep one of its key industries running.
 He was business agent and then chief executive of Local 6 for 35 years, retiring in 1995, a year before he stepped down as president of the umbrella trades council.
 Local 6 of the Hotel, Motel and Club Employees Union represents more than 25,000 employees in private clubs and hotels, where they provide housekeeping, laundry services, and food and beverage services. Starting in 1961, as its business agent, Mr. Pitta worked as an organizer who helped change the state's Labor Relations Act to allow employees of nonprofit organizations, like the Y.M.C.A., to unionize.
 In 1978 he was elected president of the Hotel and Motel Trades Council, an umbrella organization for nine locals. Under his guidance, the council won pension improvements and the largest wage increases in its history. In 1985 he led council members in the first citywide hotel strike, lasting 28 days and resulting in further wage, pension and benefit increases. 
 Mr. Pitta, a native of Sicily, arrived in Brooklyn in 1929 and settled in Red Hook. He took a job in a shoe factory and was elected a delegate to the United Shoe Workers of America from Local 54. In World War II he served in the Navy in the Pacific, as he did again in the Naval Reserve in the Korean War.
 Returning to New York, he worked as a busboy at the Plaza Hotel and took up his career with the hotel employees' union. Among the benefits he helped win for hotel workers were a prescription drug program, dental and insurance benefits for domestic partners and a scholarship program. 
 He was a past vice president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a board member of the New York City Labor Council. Gov. Hugh L. Carey named him to the New York State Commission on Tourism.
 Mr. Pitta is survived by a son, Vincent F. of Staten Island, who is the general counsel to Local 6 and the Hotel and Motel Trades Council; two daughters, Tina Marie Bauman of Tampa, Fla., and Debra Ward of Staten Island; two sisters, Mary Porcelli of Brooklyn and Aimee Conti of East Meadow, N.Y.; a brother, Thomas, of Hicksville, N.Y.; and eight grandchildren. His wife, Albertina, died 22 years ago.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy Plan Bypasses California to Help Out Detroit 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
The silver Lincoln Navigator used Tuesday by Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta to travel to a news conference at a Los Angeles Mobil station would cost $78 to fill up. With regular, that is. Premium gas at the station goes for $3 a gallon, so replenishing the vehicle's 28-gallon tank could cost as much as $84.
 The secretary said a sweeping fuel economy proposal unveiled Tuesday by the Bush administration would lower gas bills for sport utility vehicles like the Navigator and other trucks. It would save $800 million to $1.3 billion over nearly two decades when the higher upfront costs for more efficient vehicles are included. 
But the plan conflicts with air quality rules passed by California. The administration supports legal efforts by automakers to turn back the rules, which sharply curb tailpipe emissions of global-warming gases. 
 Because such emissions are related to how much gas a vehicle uses, California's rules would save far more at the pump for the state's residents than the White House plan. That would also be the case in states in the Northeast and Northwest that follow, or plan to follow, California's car rules. For California alone, the state projects annual net gas savings of more than $1 billion by early next decade. 
 The competing federal and state proposals use similarly low projections for gas prices -- just over $1.50 in the administration's proposal -- that environmentalists say woefully understate the potential benefits of fuel efficiency. 
 The administration's proposal is aimed at model year 2008-to-2011 light duty trucks, a category that includes sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans. The administration projects 10 billion gallons of gas savings over nearly two decades, about what is consumed in 25 days. 
 The plan aims to increase the fuel efficiency of light trucks sold nationwide to 24 miles per gallon in 2011 models from 21.2 m.p.g. today. How much it would actually increase efficiency is hard to say because of the plan's structure, which could encourage production of larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. 
 By contrast, California's emissions regulation would effectively force automakers to have a combined fuel economy for cars and trucks of about 33 m.p.g. by the 2016 model year and save 1.7 billion gallons of gas in California alone in just five years, the state's Air Resources Board projects.
 But the California plan faces an uphill battle; it is being challenged in court by automakers, and the administration's new fuel economy proposal says it would interfere with its own regulatory authority. The administration's vision for the American automobile is a far more likely regulatory future. 
 The White House plan is intended to help the struggling domestic automakers, General Motors and Ford Motor. They could use the help -- Moody's cut the debt rating of both companies to junk on yesterday. 
 On the other hand, some analysts and environmentalists say lax fuel economy regulations in the past have not helped Ford and G.M., because they have permitted the companies to become largely dependent on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which have shown weakness as gas prices have risen. 
 For three decades, fuel economy regulations have divided each automaker's annual production into two categories, cars and light duty trucks. Each automaker must meet a sales-weighted average mileage for cars of 27.5 mpg and another for trucks of 21.2 mpg in 2005 models. Domestic automakers have argued that this works against them, because they build a greater number of heavy sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks than their Asian rivals. 
 In an averaged system, less-fuel-efficient vehicles must be balanced against more-efficient ones. Honda has relatively little trouble complying with the current system because it makes relatively lightweight and fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles and only one pickup truck. 
 The new Bush system would break the light truck category into six classes determined by a vehicle's dimensions. Each class would have a different fuel economy target, with lesser targets for larger vehicles like Chevrolet Suburbans and Lincoln Navigators. The largest and least-fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks, like Hummers and Ford F-Series trucks, remain unregulated in the proposal, a major point of criticism by environmental groups. By 2011 models, automakers would be required to adopt the new system. 
 In an interview yesterday, Jeffrey W. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the administration would still consider regulating Hummer-size S.U.V.'s eventually. He also said the current system put too much burden on domestic automakers. ''Under the old system, only G.M. and Ford incurred the costs,'' he said. ''Under the new system, every manufacturer will have to make improvements.''
 Critics see the new system as potentially ripe for exploitation, because automakers have shown they can be extremely creative in shifting between lines in the sand drawn by the government. When the current regulatory system was created three decades ago, 80 percent of the vehicles automakers produced were cars. Today, more than half are light trucks, partly a result of the category's lesser fuel requirements. 
 ''No one could have imagined 30 years ago that vehicles categorized as trucks would be the most common passenger vehicles on the road today,'' said David Friedman, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ''It's amazing what the auto companies can do. They have found lots of innovative ways of meeting the letter, but beating the spirit, of regulations.''
 More categories could open more doors for manipulation. For instance, Ford could add less than an inch to the dimensions of its Explorer Sport Trac and move it from a class with a fuel target of 24.5 m.p.g. to one with 23.3 in 2011 models. 
 But Mr. Runge said he thought the system would be at only modest risk of such gaming and said that the administration could further tweak its structure before a final rule is proposed by April.

HEADLINE: RENTS HEAD UP AS HOME PRICES PUT OFF BUYERS

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Carolyn Marshall, in San Francisco, and Vikas Bajaj, in New York, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Rents are rising again across the country, squeezing tenants who are already coping with high gasoline prices and improving returns to landlords after a deep five-year slump.
 The turnaround appears to be another sign that the boom in house prices and sales is finally slowing, as homes have become so expensive in many metropolitan areas that some people have decided to rent instead.
A government report yesterday also offered new evidence that the housing boom could be reaching a peak. The median price of a newly built home fell to $203,800 in July from $219,500 in June, after having risen in the winter and spring, the Commerce Department said. 
 Still, the number of new homes that were sold continued to grow, and economists cautioned that the recent housing slowdown could turn out to be a pause.
 But rents have clearly changed direction, even if the increases have been relatively small. With the economy growing and mortgage rates inching up, more people are looking to rent apartments and homes rather than buy them. At the same time, many buildings are being turned into condominiums, reducing the supply of rental property.
 ''It seems like the tide has finally turned,'' said Michael H. Zaransky, co-chief executive of Prime Property Investors, which owns 15 buildings in Chicago.
 Rents in about 85 percent of large metropolitan areas have climbed in the last year, according to Global Real Analytics, a research company in San Francisco. Late in 2003, rents were falling in 85 percent of markets.
 Only in the hottest markets like New York, Southern California and South Florida have average rents been rising generally. 
 In Chicago, people who moved into a small brick building on the leafy corner of Sherwin Avenue and Paulina Street two years ago had it very good. They did not have to put down a security deposit, the $50 application fee was waived and, best of all, they got to live rent-free for two months.
 By last summer, the enticements had shrunk to one month of free rent. Today, all that a new tenant receives for signing an $1,100-a-month lease are the keys to the front door.
 Throughout the South, in cities like Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., fewer apartments are empty, building managers say. Nationwide, the vacancy rate for rentals fell to 9.8 percent in the second quarter after having climbed early in 2004 to 10.4 percent, the highest level since the Census Bureau began keeping statistics in 1956.
 Even in Northern California -- where average rents dropped about 25 percent after the dot-com crash, according to RealFacts, a research firm there -- prices have reversed direction. ''I'm appalled at the rents and what they are asking in relation to what they are giving,'' said Shari West, 47, who lives with her 13-year-old daughter and has been looking for a two-bedroom house in Castro Valley, about 25 miles east of San Francisco. ''You're not getting what you pay for.''
 The apartments she has seen cost almost $1,800 a month, about $100 or $200 more than they did when she briefly looked last summer, she recalled. The buildings still offering concessions, like a month's free rent or a reduced security deposit, are in neighborhoods where Ms. West said she did not want to live.
 In most places, the rent increases have been smaller than the ones Ms. West found -- smaller in fact than inflation in the rest of the economy. The average rent nationwide rose 2.5 percent from the spring of 2004 to this spring. It had fallen 4.5 percent from 2001 to 2003, according to Global Real Analytics.
 Outside the San Francisco Bay Area, many of the biggest declines occurred in cities like Dallas, Denver and Memphis, where abundant land and light regulation allowed home builders to put up thousands of new houses. Rents have continued to drop in those cities over the last year. But they have begun rising in metropolitan areas including Seattle, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Kansas City, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Washington. 
 ''It seems to us that the market bottomed last year,'' said V. James Marfuggi, chief operating officer of EPT Management in El Paso, which owns 70 properties around the country. ''This will be the first year that concessions have not increased.''
 Some apartment owners have raised the effective rent on their apartments by cutting back on concessions while keeping the announced monthly rent roughly the same. On North Bosworth Avenue in Chicago, the rent for a two-bedroom apartment in a building near the elevated transit line has increased only slightly in the last year, but the landlord is no longer offering a free month to new tenants. 
 Other landlords have become pickier about which tenants they accept, no longer signing leases with those who have spotty credit records or who must stretch to afford the rent, said Paul Magyar, director of leasing at Chicago Apartment Finders, a listing service.
 The surge in condominium conversions is also helping to push up rents by taking rental buildings off the market. Looking at weak rents and high sales prices, many owners have decided that their buildings are not worth keeping.
 Still, the market remains worse for landlords and better for renters than in much of the last two decades, in large part because home sales remain healthy. Mortgage rates are low, and many people are using creative loans that hold down their initial payments, like interest-only mortgages, to become first-time home buyers.
 The number of existing homes sold in July rose 4.7 percent compared with July 2004, the National Association of Realtors said this week. But the pace of sales slowed from June to July, according to the trade group, which adjusts its numbers to account for normal seasonal variations.
 ''The bottom line is housing is not plunging and it's not soaring,'' said James O'Sullivan, an economist at the investment bank UBS. ''There are signs that housing is peaking, but there is no evidence that housing is weakening sharply.''
 Chris R. Howard, a 28-year-old computer technician at the University of Chicago, has suffered the consequences of rising rents, but he is about to become one reason that the profits of rental companies remain weak. In the spring, the rent on the two-bedroom apartment Mr. Howard shares with his girlfriend increased to $1,000 from $975. ''They didn't give any real justification,'' he said, ''other than the rent was low and it needed to be raised.''
 In October, though, he plans to move to an apartment near the university that they are planning to buy. They could not afford anything in their neighborhood, Ravenswood, but their new apartment on the South Side will be almost twice as big as their current one. 
 Mr. Howard said they were able to buy the place because mortgage rates were still extremely low.

HEADLINE: Technology Levels the Business Playing Field 

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
ACCORDING to the Small Business Administration, ''small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all firms, they create more than half of the private nonfarm gross domestic product, and they create 60 to 80 percent of the net new jobs.''
 When we think about the economic impact of information technology, the first companies to spring to mind are the industry giants like Amazon, eBay, Google and Yahoo. But the biggest impact on the economy may well show up in small and medium-size enterprises.
The reason is that information technology is a great leveler. As computers get cheaper, more powerful and more connected, technologies that were only available to the Wal-Marts of the world become available to the small fry. 
 Think about the lowly cash register. There was a big innovation in the 1880's, when manufacturers added a bell that sounded when the money drawer opened, so owners would know when someone had access to the cash. But after that, the technology barely changed for almost a century.
 The big chains like Wal-Mart could use satellite networks and mainframe computers to track purchases, manage inventory and record customer behavior. But the little retailer had to do with the old mechanical registers, scrolling through the paper tape in the evening by hand and punching numbers into an adding machine to balance his books.
 Then along came the personal computer. By the late 1980's cash registers had become just another computer application. They could add up receipts, compare sales with inventory, create order lists -- in short, they could do just about everything that the big chains could do. In the 1990's, cash registers became networked, allowing the small stores to download records in a form suitable for spreadsheet analysis and accounting software.
 These intelligent cash registers allowed small companies to adopt business models that had previously been available only to large enterprises. Equipped with a scanner, a cash register could be used to verify the sale of each item, allowing companies to share data on revenue with the supplier. Some ice cream manufacturers effectively contract for space for a freezer in a store and share the revenue from purchases each time a sale is made. 
 Even the success of the big Internet companies rests, in large part, on the fact that they provide advertising and sales platforms for small enterprises. EBay, Amazon, Google and Yahoo all make it possible for small businesses to reach national, and even global, markets, that were previously inaccessible.
 The Internet has not just affected the selling side of small businesses; it is also having a big impact on the production side. I met recently with two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. One, Rashmi Sinha, told me her software company had six employees: two in the United States and four in New Delhi. The other, Cosimo Spera, started a company to develop applications and services for mobile phones; his company has five employees in the United States, eight in Spain and two in Italy.
 Both of these micro-multinational companies work pretty much the same way, using e-mail, Web pages, voice-over-Internet phone services and other Internet technology to coordinate their far-flung operations. ''Just think,'' said Ms. Sinha, ''my little six-person operation is now a global business.''
 American workers complain about big businesses sending jobs offshore to India and China. Economists say that the benefits from international trade outweigh the costs, which is great as long as you are not one of the costs.
 But offshore work means something quite different to the micro-multinationals. These companies simply would not exist without access to foreign labor. If they succeed, they will certainly hire more American workers as they grow. 
 The internationalization of small and medium-size enterprises has got to be a big plus for the American economy. It allows the small players to have access to labor markets that only the big boys could afford a few years ago.
 It is no surprise that many of these small, high-tech, international entrepreneurs are foreign-born. They have the contacts, the connections and that most critical ingredient, the ambition, to assemble the pieces needed to start a business.
 It is almost impossible for an entrepreneur to put a foreign development team together without some strong connections on the ground. Even large multinationals have found out that outsourcing is not the panacea it was proclaimed to be. Paradoxically, it is easier for the micro-multinationals to deal with the inconvenience of outsourcing than it is for the big international corporations. Entrepreneurs are willing to do things that big international corporations will not do -- like staying up until 11 p.m. and using cheap voice-over-Internet technology rather than expensive international telephone service.
 Constant supervision, constant communication and constant coordination are necessary to make small business grow. But it is just these things -- the ability to supervise, communicate, and coordinate at a distance -- that have become so much cheaper in the last 20 years. Big enterprises were the first to reap the benefits of this technological progress. But the impact of information technology on small and medium-size enterprises may yet turn out to have the most impact on the economy.

HEADLINE: The Smithsonian's Newest Exhibits: Water Stains 

BYLINE: By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
It may not be obvious to the throngs of tourists who flock daily to its famed museums, but the Smithsonian Institution is falling apart.
 Ominous drips from strained expansion joints have sprinkled down amid Asian artifacts in the institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. The historic Arts and Industries Building is closed to visitors to protect them from metal panels dropping from its beautiful but dilapidated ceiling. At the National Air and Space Museum, a water stain mars the Lilienthal hang glider that inspired the Wright Brothers to fly. Even the 1940's prototypes of what was to become seemingly indestructible Tupperware were irreparably damaged in a plumbing breakdown.
The world's largest museum complex, the Smithsonian includes 18 museums and galleries, 10 science centers and a zoological park. It is charged with conserving and displaying the country's treasures, both grand and whimsical -- the Star-Spangled Banner that flew over Fort McHenry, bits of moon rock from the earliest space missions, the ''puffy shirt'' worn by Jerry Seinfeld in his hit television series. 
 But years of inadequate financing and maintenance have led to widespread disrepair that is imperiling the collections, institution officials say. 
 This month, Congress slightly increased appropriations for the federally supported institution to $621.3 million for fiscal year 2006, up from $615.2 million this year. 
 But Smithsonian officials say that is not enough to address what a recent audit by the Government Accountability Office determined was a ''broad decline in the Smithsonian's aging facilities and systems that pose a serious long-term threat'' to its countless artifacts. 
 Smithsonian officials estimate that it will take a total of $2.3 billion over the next nine years to solve the most pressing problems. The Board of Regents, the institution's governing body, has considered charging entrance fees to compensate for the budget shortfall. Since it was established in 1846, the Smithsonian has never charged for admission, and Sheila P. Burke, the institution's deputy secretary and chief operating officer, said that so far the recommendation had been voted down.
 ''These are the nation's treasures,'' she said. ''Ultimately we feel protecting them is a federal responsibility.''
 Private donations have increased over the last decade, officials said. But donors tend to direct money toward exhibitions and programs or, in the case of major contributors, special projects that can be named for them. In September 2000, Kenneth E. Behring, a California developer and philanthropist, gave $80 million to the National Museum of American History, which now has ''Behring Center'' attached to its name. But the money was primarily earmarked for the design of major new exhibition areas, including a hall devoted to military history that opened last year. ''It is difficult to raise money for plaster and plumbing,'' Ms. Burke said.
 ''Everyone is holding their breath,'' said Mark Goldstein, director of the yearlong audit, whose results were published in April. ''They have been relatively lucky so far, but who is to say they will be so lucky in the future if they are unable to fix the damage they are currently presented with?''
 The vast Smithsonian complex contains more than 136 million objects and specimens. The institution owns and leases buildings in New York, Massachusetts, Arizona, Florida and Panama, but for now, officials said, maintenance concerns are confined to its centerpiece attractions in Washington.
 While not always immediately apparent, many of the problems are in plain view. An eight-foot-deep trench splits the gardens covering the underground Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, where an engineering and construction team is working to stop expansion joints from leaking. At the National Zoo, a hundred-year-old sloth bear enclosure and the flight cage for birds of prey were demolished last year because they posed a danger to animals and visitors.
 The Arts and Industries Building, completed in 1881 and listed as a national historic landmark, was closed to visitors in January 2004 because of falling metal panels. A day care center and children's theater were hastily relocated following the closing, but several other administrative departments, including the institution's archives and central computer system, are still housed there while new office space is secured. Scaffolding covers doorways to protect staff members from falling bits of plaster and metal. 
 ''It requires a behavior of constant vigilance,'' said Tammy Peters, acting director of the archives division. ''When it rains, we walk around nervously with the wet vac.''
 Smithsonian officials concede that they are partly to blame for the advanced state of disrepair. Lawrence M. Small, the institution's secretary, testified at a government hearing soon after he was installed in January 2000 that his staff had ''hesitated to represent to Congress the full scale of the need.'' 
 Congress responded that year by requiring the Smithsonian to submit to an evaluation by the National Academy of Public Administration, a review board chartered by Congress to analyze financial and management structures of government-financed organizations. Reviewers concluded, in a report published in 2001, that need had, in fact, exceeded budget requests. They also recommended a restructuring of the Smithsonian buildings' management. 
 ''There is always a battle for resources between programs and facilities,'' said Clair F. Gill, deputy director and chief of staff of Facilities Engineering and Operations, an institutionwide maintenance department set up in response to the review's recommendations. ''It's been a combination of people not wanting to express the true need and not feeling able to express it because of budget caps.''
 The 2006 appropriation to the Smithsonian includes $99.5 million for repairs and restorations. Of that amount, $14 million is for renovations at the National Zoo, $12.8 million for repairs at the National Museum of Natural History and $5.8 million to relocate staff, collections and the computer center from the Arts and Industries Building. 
 Congress also requested the recently completed audit.
 ''We wanted an independent review to determine not only the efficiency at the Smithsonian but also the depth of its budget problems,'' said Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House subcommittee on economic development, public buildings and emergency management, which oversees the Smithsonian.
 Slowly, some repair projects are nearing completion. The Patent Office Building, home to the National Museum of American Art and the National Portrait Gallery, has been closed since 2000 to repair a damaged roof and an outdated heating and cooling system. A $166 million renovation, financed over the past five fiscal years, is in its final stages. The building is to reopen next July. 
 Still, while Congress and Smithsonian officials debate who is responsible for what, some treasures have been lost for good. Among them is the collection of snapping lids and tools developed in the 1940's by Earl Tupper as the earliest prototypes of the now ubiquitous Tupperware. 
 Attentive to leaks and humidity from an old steam heating system, curators in the Museum of American History, where the items were housed in a collection room, kept the treasured bits of Americana in a glass case covered with two layers of plastic sheeting. During the waiting period for financing and management restructuring after the 2001 government review, a rusty pipe ruptured, blasting the case with an acidic burst of water that penetrated the sheeting and glass. 
 ''It was the most catastrophic leak we have ever had,'' said Steven Turner, a physical sciences curator at the museum. ''The samples deformed, just kind of curled up. A plastic handle looked like it just exploded. We go to great efforts to protect things. These things are part of the national heritage. But it just wasn't enough. It was really traumatic.''
 A portion of the heating system was finally replaced early this year.

HEADLINE: Rising Price of Oil Pushes S.&P. to Negative Territory 

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Oil prices climbed to another record yesterday, driving stocks lower and leaving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down for the year.
 All three major market gauges closed lower yesterday; the S.&.P.'s loss meant that for the first time since July 7, all three were in negative territory for the year. Bonds, meanwhile, were little changed with the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note at 4.17 percent, from 4.18 percent on Tuesday. 
Oil prices rose sharply late yesterday afternoon, a rally stoked in part by worries that a tropical storm near the Bahamas may disrupt production in the Gulf of Mexico.
 ''Once oil decided that it was going to move higher and stay higher, that just took the starch out of any buyers in the stock market,'' said Joseph Liro, the chief equity strategist at Stone & McCarthy, an economic research firm in Princeton. ''Oil is just the biggest single depressant on the market except for the oil stocks.''
 Stocks ticked upward during early trading yesterday morning as unexpectedly high housing sales figures for July were released by the Commerce Department. Sales of new homes rose 6.5 percent, to 1.4 million, last month, contradicting the suggestion on Tuesday from July data on existing-home sales that the housing market was cooling.
 But as oil began what turned out to be a 2.45 percent rise, to $67.32 a barrel, on the day, stocks began falling. Big retailers and manufacturing companies including Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depot and Procter & Gamble that are sensitive to economic pressures related to higher energy costs declined. Also among the biggest losers yesterday were large financial companies including Citigroup, the American International Group, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 8 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,209.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 84.71 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,434.87. And the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.34 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,128.91. For the year, the S.&P. is down 0.19 percent, the Dow is down 3.23 percent and the Nasdaq is down 2.14 percent.
 The markets' decline could have been accelerated by relatively low trading volume. With low volume, which is common during the late August doldrums, it does not take much activity to cause large swings in the stock market either way. 
 Mr. Liro said he was worried that higher oil prices would make it difficult for consumers to continue to dip into their savings to fuel spending and economic growth.
 ''You can only do that for so long,'' he added. ''With oil absolutely resisting any corrective move below 60 a barrel, that is going to undermine the consumer sector, overall economic growth and in turn corporate profit growth in the new year.''
 He said he expected data on personal income for July, which is due out next Thursday, to show a strong increase in consumption but also a negative savings rate.

HEADLINE: States to the Rescue

 BODY:
It's been obvious for some time that state governments are taking the problems of global warming and oil dependency much more seriously than the Bush administration is, and have been far more creative in devising solutions. Hardly a month goes by without another example of the gap between palpable alarm at the state level and Washington's stubborn passivity. This week provided two more. 
 Exhibit A was the disclosure in The Times that New York and eight other Northeastern states have reached a tentative agreement on a regional plan to reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global-warming gas. The plan would establish a cap on these emissions as well as a market-based system for trading pollution permits. That system would be aimed at helping utilities meet mandatory targets as cheaply and efficiently as possible.
The plan is the first of its kind in the nation dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, though a similar approach has already been successfully applied to acid rain pollution. The plan is based on a regulatory regime that has explicitly been rejected by the Bush administration in favor of a softer voluntary approach, which has yielded little progress so far. The architects of the new plan, including Gov. George Pataki of New York, hope that it will encourage other states to follow suit, and, ideally, persuade a hitherto reluctant Congress to adopt the kind of unified national strategy embraced in Europe but not here.
 Exhibit B was the administration's long-awaited proposal for overhauling fuel economy standards for vehicles like S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickups, which are classified as ''light trucks.'' These vehicles account for half of all new automotive purchases, much of the country's increasing demand for imported oil and a significant percentage of its greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal was a major (though not unexpected) disappointment, calling for only a modest increase in fuel efficiency and, by the administration's own testimony, a tiny reduction in oil use -- about 10 billion gallons of gasoline over nearly two decades, or less than one month's current consumption. 
 Assuming that the automobile makers do not find new ways to ''game'' the rules, they would increase the average mileage of light trucks to about 24 miles per gallon in 2011 models, from the 21.2 miles per gallon for today's models. That is less than what the National Academy of Sciences says is achievable with existing technology. It is also far less than the efficiencies that will be required by a new California law aimed at a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by cars.
 Several other states, including New York, have said they will adopt California's rules. The automobile companies have challenged the rules in court, advancing the argument that they constitute a backdoor, illegal usurpation of federal authority to set mileage standards. The Bush administration made much the same point in announcing its new rules on Monday. That raises a question: What are states to do when the federal government does so little?

HEADLINE: Iran Pledges to Offer New Proposals in Nuclear Talks With Europe

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
Iran will soon offer new proposals for negotiations with Europe over its nuclear program, its president said Wednesday. The Bush administration responded that the European diplomatic process ''still has legs.''
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran said that he had instructed the Supreme National Security Council to write new proposals on Iran's uranium enrichment program. 
 ''Iran will soon offer proposals about the cycle of nuclear fuel for peaceful use of nuclear energy,'' he said on state-run television.
 ''We want to continue talks with all,'' he said. ''We will continue dialogue.'' But he did not say if that included the United States. Iran has said it does not see any role for the United States as long as it remains hostile toward Iran.
 The comments by Mr. Ahmadinejad suggest that he wants to begin a new dialogue in the hope of persuading Europe to recognize Iran's right to enrich uranium. Europe has been urging Iran to give up its uranium enrichment program in return for economic incentives, a proposal Iran has rejected.
 Enrichment is one of the final stages in the nuclear fuel process. It can produce either the fuel needed for a power reactor or material used in making a nuclear bomb. Iran says its program is peaceful, aiming only to produce electricity. The United States accuses Iran of secretly pursuing a weapons program.
 Iran suspended enrichment activities and other parts of its nuclear program last year as a gesture in negotiations. But this month, Iran ended the freeze on a preliminary part of the nuclear cycle, uranium reprocessing.
 Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy of France said Wednesday that the European Union still believed that negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program were possible, even though the negotiation group called off a meeting scheduled for Aug. 31 in response to the resumption of reprocessing.
 ''We think it is still possible to talk to them,'' Mr. Douste-Blazy said on France Inter radio. ''We want to write a new page in relations between the European Union and Iran.''
 In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said the European diplomatic process ''still has legs.''
 ''We would encourage the Iranian government to engage with the E.U. 3 negotiators in a serious and constructive way,'' Mr. McCormack said Wednesday, referring to France, Germany and Britain, the three European countries involved in the talks. ''And we would encourage them to take an offer that is on the table. I think that the E.U. 3 offer is comprehensive, it's constructive and it addresses the issue.''
 Iran claimed victory on Tuesday after tests by the United Nations nuclear agency concluded that traces of highly enriched uranium found on centrifuge parts at two sites in Iran were from imported equipment -- rather than any enrichment activities by Iran.
 The findings by the International Atomic Energy Agency support Iran's contention that the material entered the country with centrifuge parts provided by Pakistan.
 The discovery of the traces was cited by the United States as evidence Iran had been experimenting with producing highly enriched uranium, which is used only in nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: War Service Is Taking Toll on the Self-Employed 

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Olson

 BODY:
WITHIN months of James J. Maddix's departure for Iraq, his Big Daddy Taxi service in Kalamazoo, Mich., bit the dust.
 Big Daddy, which specialized in driving people home from bars, was bringing in about $175,000 a year when Mr. Maddix, 30, was sent on active duty in December 2003. Without him at the helm to orchestrate an operation that paid part-timers to operate his 10 vans, the business quickly fell apart. ''I hired a manager, but within a month, it wasn't working out,'' Mr. Maddix said.
When he came home in February after 14 months overseas, mostly at Camp Anaconda northwest of Baghdad, he found himself $110,000 in debt. Now, he says, his only way to survive and start a new business is probably to declare bankruptcy. 
 In ways that do not make headlines, the war on terror is taking a rising toll on small business, and Congress is aiming to do something about it.
 Reserve call-ups were rare before the 1991 gulf war, but in the three years leading up to last November, 410,000 of the soldiers who were deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq were reservists. About 9 percent, or 55,000, were self-employed and 18 percent worked in companies with fewer than 100 employees, according to statistics from the United States military. 
 Typically, the small businesses that lose owners or essential employees to active duty face financial setbacks from recruiting, hiring and training new workers, from retraining current workers, from unrealized business or from insolvency. 
 ''We need to find a way to reduce the hardships,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee. Not only does Maine have a huge proportion of small businesses, it also has one of the highest percentages of National Guard soldiers on active duty. That prompted Senator Snowe to ask the Congressional Budget Office to look into the situation.
 In a report that it issued in May, the office said that as many as 15,000 businesses led by deployed reservists may have had financial losses or significant problems in managing schedules or workloads. (Other experts estimate that anywhere from 8,000 to 30,000 mobilized reservists held crucial jobs at their small businesses.)
 ''The current trend toward longer and more frequent reserve deployments raises questions about the ability of civilian employers, particularly small businesses, to absorb the costs they experience when their reservist employees are called up,'' said Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the office's director.
 The usual notice of two weeks (and sometimes less) before deployment, and the uncertainty over the length of service, can worsen the problems small businesses face, according to the 31-page report. Temporary workers can be expensive to recruit, hire and train. And sometimes, as in the case of the manager Mr. Maddix employed, they do not work out.
 Among the ideas being considered to help small businesses are tax credits, subsidized loans and insurance and the exemption of certain workers from being called up for military service.
 Senator Snowe also wants to increase the financing for a program run by the Small Business Administration that provides low-interest loans of up to $1.5 million for small businesses when owners or employees are deployed. The S.B.A. Office of Veterans Business Development approved $6.6 million in such loans in 2003, almost double what it approved in 2002. Reflecting increased call-ups, the loans rose again last year, to $7 million.
 The ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator John Kerry, favors giving businesses with 50 employees or fewer up to $21,000 in tax credits to cover salary shortfalls for mobilized reservists and the hiring costs for temporary replacements.
 He also proposed up to $25,000 in economic-injury disaster grants for small businesses when a crucial employee is called for active duty. In addition, his legislation, called the Military Family Bill of Rights, would set up a task force to examine how to aid small-business owners with management, financial planning, contracting and marketing issues during employee deployments.
 ''It simply shouldn't be the case that people who have spent their lives building up a business and volunteer to serve our country have to wonder if their businesses will be there when they return home,'' Senator Kerry said. 
 Meantime, entrepreneurs who are pulled away from their businesses by military duty continue to struggle against the odds. Sandra Buckles had just started Lockhart Technology, a firm in Oak Hill, Va., that provides security analysis for companies, when she was called up from the Navy Reserve's ranks on Sept. 11, 2001, in the middle of the night.
 It was just a three-week stint to help with air defense, but it ''certainly put a hold on the momentum'' of getting her business going, Captain Buckles said in an e-mail message from Iraq, where she has been serving, as she put it, a ''permanent recall to active duty'' since December 2002.
 This time, she has not been so lucky. In 2003, she said, ''my company stayed afloat with my constant intervention.'' But military work pressures made it impossible to continue that, so Lockhart ''now is more or less on the shelf,'' she said, because ''I am not allowed to work on security contracts or marketing due to conflict of interest.'' 
 All but one of her seven employees has been able to find other work, Captain Buckles, 50, said.
 The tale is not always so grim. Some people, like Mark Auer, who runs Entec Services, a heating and air-conditioning contractor in Peoria, Ill., got lucky. When his Illinois Air National Guard unit was called up in February 2003, and Mr. Auer was sent to fly fighter jets at a secret Middle East location, his boss, who was the owner, stepped in to take over his management duties.
 Entec's workers -- minus one reservist who was also called up -- also pitched in, doing double duty, in Mr. Auer's words. Before his departure, Entec had also cross-trained some workers for a greater variety of jobs.
 While he was gone, the company ''didn't lose any big clients,'' Mr. Auer, 41, said. On the other hand, he said, ''patriotism lasted just a few days'' for some fellow companies, which bumped Entec off construction projects when it fell temporarily behind on deadlines because of a worker shortage. ''It's a lot different than a Fortune 500 company,'' Mr. Auer said. ''When 2 out of 32 are called up, it is a lot more difficult for those left behind.''
 At a small company, the most careful planning can come to naught. Larry Audet, a 30-year Army National Guard veteran, hired a professional to take over as funeral director at his Greenlawn Memorial Funeral Home in Bangor, Me., while he ferried the military brass around Afghanistan.
 But four months later, the man he hired died of a heart attack. So, Mr. Audet's son Joel took up the slack and kept the business running smoothly, handling as best he could problems like billing errors made by a new employee. ''Actually, I didn't find out about the problems until I came back,'' Mr. Audet said. ''And that was a good thing. I had to keep focused on the job I was doing there because we were being shot at and landing on unimproved airfields.''
 Even so, he calculates that his absence cost his business $65,000, mostly in payments to other people to do building and vehicle maintenance that he would have done himself.
 Entrepreneurs are used to adversity, of course, and have a habit of bouncing back from it. When Captain Buckles finishes a coming tour in Japan and retires from the Navy in 2009, she says, she and her remaining part-time employee plan to rebuild Lockhart Technology.
 ''I did itonce,'' she declared. ''I can do it again.''

HEADLINE: Present at the Creation of a Memorably Loud, Thrashing Sound

BYLINE: By NED MARTEL

 BODY:
When a chunky guitar player called D. Boon first jammed in his mom's house with his teenage buddy Mike Watt, the neighbors complained. ''Well, I know where my son is,'' the mom retorted. The noise made by these two Angelenos, from San Pedro, led to a brief but intense burst of fame in the area's early punk scene, and a tribute rockumentary, ''We Jam Econo,'' keeps studiously to the sweaty, messy ethos of their best-known band, the Minutemen. 
 Their legacy is lovingly and erratically encapsulated by the director Tim Irwin, relying on archival film of Minutemen concerts in places like the 9:30 Club in Washington. The crowds are in a frenzy and, we are told, the spitting from the mosh pit, presumably a form of praise, led to many colds for the frontmen.
 Mostly, these shots are from a fixed position, with a little zooming in and out on D. Boon's improbable bounces across the stage. (Think of a heavier, pogoing Frank Black of the Pixies.) Even though the Minutemen were known for long sets of short, thrashing songs, the director lets the old scenes run for long reverential stretches, missing the opportunity for some unusual editing.
 When it comes to interviewing there-at-the-creation insiders, Mr. Irwin can boast many respectable gets, including the rockers Thurston Moore, Ian MacKaye and John Doe. (Even the spectral artist Raymond Pettibon allows a sit-down in his scrappy atelier.)
 Most moving of all are the monologues of Mike Watt himself, who has much wisdom to impart to any musicians graduating from high school 30 years after he did. (They may know his band's cacophonous blare from the theme music of ''Jackass.'') His main point: do it yourself, because the distance between garage rehearsals and packed arenas is shorter than you think.
 Mr. Watt compares today's wider access to guitars to the breakthrough when clay skateboard wheels gave way to the durable, bouncy plastic kind. ''We were more kept in our place,'' he says. ''Nowadays you're more kept in your place by your mind, more by the herd mentality than by actually having the material and wherewithal to do things.''
 The film is far from aphoristic, and Mr. Irwin avoids any maudlin impulse that D. Boon's death in a 1985 car crash might have dictated. Mr. Watt compellingly recalls details of road trips and passionate arguments he shared with his bandmate, and a result is a nostalgic portrait of a prototypical and productive male friendship. Two guys sounded out the chords to ''Smoke on the Water'' and kept at it for a decade of hard work and innovation. The spiky documentary in their honor keeps alive the echoes of their slapdash, Smithsonian-worthy sound.

We Jam Econo
The Story of the Minutemen
Opens today in Manhattan.

Directed by Tim Irwin; produced by Keith Schieron; released by Rocket Fuel Films. At the Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village. Running time: 85 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Drop in Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
The number of people receiving unemployment benefits reached a four-year low last week.
 The number of laid-off workers receiving jobless benefits averaged 2.58 million over the four weeks ended last week, the lowest four-week average since March 2001, the Labor Department reported Thursday. 
 For just last week, the number of newly laid off workers applying for benefits fell by a steeper-than-expected 4,000 from the previous week, to 315,000, the lowest level for new claims since the first week in August.
 Analysts said both the drop in total benefits being paid and the decline in new benefit applications pointed to an economy that was continuing to create jobs.
 So far this year, a strong economy has generated an average of 191,000 new jobs a month, better than last year's average of 183,000. Employers created 207,000 jobs in July, which helped to keep the unemployment rate at a low level of 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Energy Prices Vex Americans On All Fronts 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Katie Zezima, in Boston; Gretchen Ruethling, in Chicago; and Vivian Medina, in Miami, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
It might still be 80 degrees outside, but, four months before the first days of winter, many Americans are already facing the prospect of keeping warm while having to stay within their budgets. Instead of the short spike in energy prices that most expected, it now appears that a variety of high energy bills -- for heating oil, propane, natural gas and electricity, as well as gasoline -- will be around for a long while.
 Near Chicago, a health care administrator expects her natural gas bill to double and has cut back on her cable TV subscription. A school district in Maine will lower the thermostats in classrooms. And the treasurer of the Union Church of Proctor, a small community near Rutland, Vt., faces a $10,000 shortage this winter because of soaring fuel oil costs.
''You can turn the heat down a little and wear an extra sweater,'' said Gary Fay, the church treasurer, ''but in the end you really need to heat yourself.'' 
 With energy costs rising substantially for a second year, and reaching another record on oil markets yesterday, how consumers and businesses respond this winter -- whether they curb their energy consumption or not, whether they keep spending on other goods or not -- will be critical as higher energy prices slowly ripple through the $11.7 trillion American economy. 
 ''This is going to hit on every side,'' said Davis Bookhart, a researcher at the Consumer Energy Council of America. ''On just about everything that is energy-intensive, you're going to feel higher costs. People are more concerned about their bills, and realize that this winter will be more expensive.''
 Economists generally seem convinced that the higher energy prices will not derail the economy. But they may cause it to wobble a bit: Americans will spend $600 billion this year on oil purchases -- everything from gasoline and diesel to jet fuel and heating oil. In two years, the national oil bill has jumped by $210 billion, or 54 percent, according to Larry Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. In addition, the nation spent $120 billion on natural gas in 2004, according to the American Gas Association. That is expected to increase to about $167 billion this year.
 ''High energy prices act like a consumption tax and consumption taxes eventually hurt the economy,'' Mr. Goldstein said. 
 That extra burden has already shaved three-quarters of a percentage point off American growth, he estimated, but has not put much of a dent in the expanding economy.
 The cost of oil is stirring larger waves in the economy now. 
 As a direct share of the gross domestic product, oil accounted for 8.5 percent of the economy in 1980. As energy conservation measures took hold, and as Americans grew wealthier, that fell to a low of 3.1 percent in the mid-1990's.
 Last year, it was up to 4.2 percent. This year, oil is expected to account for 4.8 percent of the economy, according to Mr. Goldstein.
 ''We've insulated ourselves from higher oil prices, but we're not immune to them,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
 Americans are not completely helpless, Mr. Bookhart said. ''Most homes are very energy-inefficient. There are many small things that can be done that will lead to pretty significant cost savings.''
 Sheryl Andersen, who lives in Crete, Ill., has followed that advice. She has been weatherproofing her new house in expectation of paying higher heating bills: fixing leaks, putting weather stripping around doors, tuck-pointing the chimney and fixing cracks in the fireplace. Last year, she paid $150 a month on her heating bill. This year, she expects to spend twice that.
 Ms. Andersen, 57, a senior administrative assistant for a health care provider, said she and her husband had cut back on television channels and now subscribe only to basic cable service. They have not taken out their 18-foot fishing boat this summer because of the higher fuel costs. She does not know yet what other expenses may have to be eliminated or reduced.
 ''We don't know how bad it's going to be this winter,'' Ms. Andersen said. 
 The most visible signs of higher energy costs have been gasoline prices, which have touched $3 a gallon in some parts of the country -- and have led to a spate of fuel thefts at service stations.
 On Wednesday, Hawaii, with the highest prices in the nation, said it would limit wholesale prices of gasoline in an effort to restrict further increases. Critics say the measure may backfire because it fails to address a cause of higher prices: higher demand.
 Crude oil prices, lifted by strong growth in the United States and in China, have risen 54 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange over the last year. Yesterday, the next-month futures contract settled at $67.49 a barrel, up 17 cents, after touching $67.70 midway in the trading session. 
 These highs are causing concern around the world. The International Monetary Fund said that Asia's rapid economic growth was at risk from the energy prices.
 Still, according to the I.M.F.'s managing director, Rodrigo Rato: ''There is very strong demand, and we don't see that demand receding. Prices are not going back to the levels seen at the beginning of 2004.''
 This may be little comfort for people like Stan Sawyer, a school district superintendent in Westbrook, Me. 
 Mr. Sawyer said that the district had rerouted its buses over the last months, condensed runs, and is now considering curbing field trips for the year and extending the walking distance to and from school.
 In addition to trying to curb gasoline consumption, Mr. Sawyer faces another problem: His district budgeted heating oil purchases at only $1.60 a gallon -- well below even the current commodity market price for delivery next month, which is above $1.80 and climbing. 
 ''There isn't any wiggle room,'' Mr. Sawyer said. ''Something like this, we're going to try to do cost estimates about how much it will cost and make it up somewhere else in the budget. It's not only a hardship in Westbrook. It's a hardship in schools throughout the country.''
 One thing the school will probably do is turn the thermostat down a couple of degrees. ''We were around 67 or 68 last year,'' he said, ''and we'll probably turn it down two more degrees and encourage students to wear sweatshirts and sweaters.'' 
 The Energy Information Administration, a branch of the Energy Department, projected that retail heating oil prices would be, on average, 17 percent higher this winter than last year, at about $2.20 a gallon.
 Natural gas, used by more than half of all households for heating, is expected to rise 16.5 percent, to $12.97 for each thousand cubic feet, while the price of propane, a liquid gas, is forecast to jump by 16 percent, according to Dave Costello, an analyst at the energy administration. 
 And these estimates may prove low. Last year, heating oil and natural gas prices increased by about a third over the winter. This year, heating oil contracts are up 51 percent while natural gas has risen 55 percent.
 ''We are going to have to look into more creative solutions,'' said H.E. Broadbent, vice president for institutional advancement at Dowling College, in Oakdale, N.Y., which mainly uses natural gas for its heating. ''We might be looking at alternative energies, or solar energy. But this year is going to be very hard on our budget. We might have to postpone renovations, or buying new equipment. The whole process of deciding what to give up is going to be very, very difficult.''
 Many analysts predict more increases in prices through the end of the year, as well as into 2006.
 ''Heating is a visceral necessity; you've got to heat your home,'' said John Felmy, senior economist at the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group. ''This is when we might expect more of a sticker-shock reaction than with gasoline prices. I'm holding my breath for when I have to fill up my own propane tank.'' 
 So far, American consumers have proved surprisingly resilient to the higher energy prices. Despite the rise in gasoline costs, in recent weeks they have still been buying Detroit's gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, in large part because of deep discounts offered by American automakers. Consumers have not visibly reduced spending, the housing boom has slowed only somewhat and interest rates, while rising, are still relatively low. 
 According to Goldman Sachs commodity analysts, there is little chance that crude oil prices will drop quickly. The firm now expects oil to average $68 a barrel and does not see it dropping below $60 a barrel for years. Many others on Wall Street are looking for oil around $50 a barrel in 2006.
 There is also little relief to expect on natural gas markets. While the use of fuel oil is mostly concentrated in the Northeast, natural gas is the heating source of choice for some 61 million households across the country.
 While much of the attention has been focused on crude oil and gasoline, natural gas markets have boomed as well in recent years. Through the 1990's, prices remained fairly stable, averaging about $2 a thousand cubic feet for the benchmark spot price in the United States. 
 But in early 2000, prices began to rise, averaging $5 a thousand cubic feet from 2000 to 2005. Yesterday, natural gas futures settled at $9.77 in New York after briefly trading above $10 on Wednesday.
 ''A lot will depend on consumer behavior and whether they will be overwhelmed by the higher prices and cut on their consumption,'' said David N. Parker, president of the American Gas Association. ''We don't see any reduction in the heating costs in the next two to three years. Beyond that, there will be a flow of additional supplies. But we will never go back to $2 gas. We might settle between $5 and $5.50.'' 
 Higher costs have also translated into higher electricity prices. In Miami, Juan Pablo Constain, a 26-year-old business administration major at Florida International University, said his last electric bill was $216, up 45 percent from the previous month. He rides his bike to school more often to save on gasoline, has stopped attending soccer games, and has cut back on social activities. 
 ''I don't get together with my friends for happy hour at the bar,'' Mr. Constain said. ''I'm trying to save as much as I can on everything.''

HEADLINE: Mass. Appeal

BYLINE: By John P. Gregg. 
John P. Gregg, a speechwriter for Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1995, is a reporter for Valley News in West Lebanon, N.H.

DATELINE: Westminster West, Vt. 

 BODY:
BILL Weld, the former Massachusetts governor who now wants to succeed Gov. George Pataki in Albany, enjoys both chess and pool. Both -- obviously -- are tactical games. Chess calls for seeing the board several moves ahead and pinning down an opponent. Pool requires execution and a vision of where to leave the cue ball to set up the next several shots. 
 Such maneuvering has long served Mr. Weld well in another game he enjoys -- politics. Though he might appear to be a long shot in New York, his latest move is exactly the sort of attention-grabbing challenge he relishes. ''I love the five-carom shot in pool,'' he told The Boston Globe in 1996. 
Want an example of flawless execution? In 1988 Mr. Weld quit as head of the Justice Department's criminal division to protest what he considered to be ethical conflicts by Attorney General Ed Meese. Conveniently, his departure also gave him a golden glow as a Republican candidate for governor in liberal Massachusetts two years later. As they say around the pool table, it was a ''nice leave.'' 
 I first encountered Bill Weld in 1991, when I took a job writing speeches for him. A summa cum laude classics major from Harvard, Mr. Weld was as exacting as any professor. After a sloppy typographical error in a speech, he sent me a note that read, simply, ''of it = its not it's.'' When I wrote that the welfare system had ''devolved'' into a social disaster, he marked up the text with an off-the-cuff etymology. And when he joked at a staff meeting about the ''maw'' of the speechwriters, I sent him the William Blake quotation; ''Rome and Greece swept Art into their maw and destroyed it.'' He shot back, ''If you think I wasn't thinking of Blake, then you seriously underestimate me.'' 
 Will the news media in New York underestimate Bill Weld? Doing so would be up there with thinking he didn't know his Romantic poets. Bill Weld is a master at working the press. In fact, his novel, ''Mackerel by Moonlight'' is a virtual primer on the subject. 
 Part of the key to Mr. Weld's success comes from a keen grasp of mutual self-interest. The book's protagonist, a district attorney named Terry Mullally (remember, Bill Weld had been a prosecutor), says that ''of all the people in public office, prosecutors probably like the press the most, because we're all trying to knock down the same temple walls.'' 
 But he also practices a deeper craftiness, too. The book offers detailed instructions on how a politician should put on a ''most lugubrious face'' when commenting on a rival's misfortune, or how to play it safe -- ''Be boring. No stories.'' -- when in the lead. Like a good pool player, you don't want to leave your opponent any easy shots. 
 Of course, Bill Weld's real specialty is to use his playfully naughty personality to dominate news coverage and soften his patrician background. 
 In early 1993, when he was trying to raise his profile for a potential White House bid, I heard Mick Jagger, in an interview, say he preferred Friedrich von Hayek's laissez-faire economics to Bill Clinton's more Keynesian views at the time. Bill Weld was a big Hayek fan and told me to put it in some remarks. When he made the speech, he added the flourish: ''I've always been a Stones man, and this confirms my faith,'' which proved the lead anecdote in a favorable story in The Economist. 
 Now 60, Mr. Weld has had to re-rack the political pool table in New York after alienating Massachusetts voters by leaving office early when Mr. Clinton nominated him as ambassador to Mexico in 1997 -- a bid that failed because of Senator Jesse Helms's opposition.
 So what will his first shot be? He is all-but-certain to highlight his childhood surrounded by farms on Long Island and his continuing bond with the Adirondacks. I imagine, too, that he will talk, with genuine knowledge, about rooting for Frank Gifford and the Giants. 
 As someone who has run for governor twice before, expect Bill Weld to draw on this experience to find ways to confound the Democratic front-runner, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is campaigning for the job for the first time. Running for governor is different than running for attorney general. 
 Do not expect Mr. Weld to do any heavy lifting for the Republican effort to unseat Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who faces her own election in 2006. For starters, the two worked together on the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate. More to the point, Bill Weld needs support from the senator's supporters, especially women and suburbanites, to stand a chance.
 To that end, the Weld platform for New York is likely to be similar to the one he wanted to take to the White House before the Gingrich revolution got in the way. Preparing for a speech he was planning to give to a group of Republicans in New York in 1991, he told me he wanted to be seen as a new breed of Republican, ''squishy'' (his word) on social issues like abortion and the environment, but tough on crime and taxes.
 My guess, then, is that his first ads will probably center on his tax-cutting record in Massachusetts, with his love of the outdoors sprinkled in to appeal to upstate voters. But after that, it's anyone's guess. Bill Weld is unpredictable -- and he likes it that way. As he once said in a staff meeting in 1993: ''We don't need to be logical about this. This is politics.''

HEADLINE: Talk to the Animals

BYLINE: By Bernd Heinrich. 
Bernd Heinrich, emeritus professor at the University of Vermont, is the author of ''The Geese of Beaver Bog.''

DATELINE: Burlington, Vt. 

 BODY:
THERE they came trudging along, straight upright on stubby legs, shoulders swinging back and forth with each step. Fuzzy at first, their dark silhouettes started to come into focus on the screen just as I was eating my first bite of popcorn. Hobbits, maybe? No. We already knew from the movie's title that they would be birds. Then Morgan Freeman's otherworldly voice informs us that these beings are on a long and difficult journey in one of the most inhospitable places on earth, and that they are driven by their ''quest for love.''
 Since the documentary ''March of the Penguins'' has become one of the sleeper hits of the summer, I guess I'm not the only one to have been mesmerized. I've long known the story of the emperor penguins, having told it to generations of biology students as a textbook example of adaptation, but to see the sheer beauty and wonder of it all come into focus on the screen still took my breath away, because film technology has finally allowed us to (virtually) enter an exotic world, and yet one that is real. 
As the movie continues, everything about these animals seems on the surface utterly different from human existence; and yet at the same time the closer one looks the more everything also seems familiar. Stepping back and viewing from the context of the vast diversity of millions of other organisms that evolved on the tree of life -- grass, trees, tapeworms, hornets, jellyfish, tuna, green anoles and elephants -- these animals marching across the screen are practically kissing cousins to us. Like many others who loved the movie, I admired the heroics of both the birds themselves and the intrepid camera crew that braved the inhumanly hostile environments of the Antarctic. But as a research biologist who has spent half a century studying the behavior and cognition of animals other than ourselves, I also admired the boldness of the filmmaker, Luc Jacquet, to face down the demon, if not the taboo, of anthropomorphizing his subjects.
 Which brings me back to Mr. Freeman's use of the word ''love'' in the context of the penguin's behavior. The unspoken rule is that this four-letter word is to be applied only to one creature on earth, homo sapiens. But why? A look at the larger picture shows this presumption of exclusivity is utterly unproved. In a broad physiological sense, we are practically identical not only with other mammals but also with birds -- muscle for muscle, eye for eye, nerve for nerve, lung for lung, brain for brain, hormone for hormone -- except for differences in detail of particular design specifications. 
 Functionally, I suspect love is an often temporary chemical imbalance of the brain induced by sensory stimuli that causes us to maintain focus on something that carries an adaptive agenda. Love is an adaptive feeling or emotion -- like hate, jealousy, hunger, thirst -- necessary where rationality alone would not suffice to carry the day. Could rationality alone induce a penguin to trek 70 miles over the ice in order to mate and then balance an egg on his toes while fasting for four months in total darkness and enduring temperatures of minus-80 degrees Fahrenheit and gusts of up to 100 miles an hour? And bear in mind that this 5-year-old penguin has just returned to the place of its birth from the sea, and thus has never seen an egg in its life and could not possibly have any idea what it is or why it must be kept warm. Any rational penguin would eventually say, ''To hell with this thing, I'm going back for a swim and to eat my fill of fish.'' 
 And that, of course, would be the immediate end to the evolution of rationality in emperor penguins (and perhaps to the evolution of the penguins as a species). Adaptation and adherence to an unconscious genetic program driven by passions and appetites are as vital as they are often incredible. Even humans, the most rational of all species, require an overpowering love to do the remarkable things that parents do for their children. 
 The penguin's drives to persist in proximally bizarre behavior in the face of what must otherwise be overpowering temptations to do otherwise also suggests that they love to an inordinate degree. Where they differ from us is that they can ''love'' an egg as much or more than a peeping fuzz-ball of a hatchling.
 In the last half-century, the hidden reality of nature has been revealed as never before. Our general perceptions, though generally lagging behind, are now catching up. We are becoming weaned from the make-believe world of Walt Disney's ''Bambi.'' Is that why high-tech documentaries like ''Microcosmos,'' ''Winged Migration,'' ''March of the Penguins'' and, in a slightly different vein, Werner Herzog's new ''Grizzly Man'' are catching on? I suspect that the new breed of nature film will become increasingly mainstream because, as we learn more about ourselves from other animals and find out that we are more like them than supposed, we are now allowed to ''relate'' to them, and therefore to empathize. 
 Paradoxically, the cartoonish anthropomorphism of ''Bambi,'' although it entertained the youngsters, blocked rather than promoted an understanding of animals. In ''Bambi'' we do not see other creatures. Instead, we are presented humans with antlers, and with our thought and speech. This is what the traditional idea of anthropomorphizing is -- expecting animals to feel and behave like humans, which they never will. One look at that penguin with the egg on its toes shows the inadequacy, the outright folly, of wishing they ''were more like us.''
 Nature is the greatest show on earth, and reverence for life requires acknowledging the differences between ourselves and the animals as well as seeing our relatedness. Sometimes that involves walking a tightrope, and missteps can result in tragedy. Take grizzly bears. Most of us rightly fear them (no less an instinct than love). Those who don't feel fear and consort with them -- like Timothy Treadwell, the subject of ''Grizzly Man'' -- stand a good chance of being eliminated from the gene pool.
 There are so many stories to tell. Furthermore, the ''actors'' in these dramas do not perform for any money. They are at home in the most inhospitable (for us) places on the planet, and not only do they behave as if they are oblivious to the camera, they probably are oblivious. If we gain more exposure to the real -- and if the producers and studios invest half as much care and expense into portraying animals as they do into showing ourselves -- I suspect the results will be as profitable, in economic as well as emotional and intellectual terms -- as the ''March of the Penguins.''

HEADLINE: Taps Plays for a Hospital That Tended All Ranks

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
For much of the last century, Walter Reed Army Medical Center was considered the Harvard of military medicine. Monarchs, generals and senators sought its care. President Dwight D. Eisenhower died in one of its beds. Soldiers wounded in combat, including thousands from Iraq, went there to replace shattered limbs and rebuild broken lives.
 But for Arthur Gang, it was also a neighborhood hospital. 
Mr. Gang, a retired soldier and government lawyer who died in 1998, delighted in going to Walter Reed for his medical care because he might encounter a congressman or ambassador there -- or be mistaken for one himself, his daughter recalled. He once received flowers intended for Senator Bob Dole, who was in a room down the hall.
 ''He felt very honored to be there,'' said his daughter, Sharon Gang, the press secretary for Mayor Anthony A. Williams.
 But the hospital's 113-acre campus in northwest Washington may soon be no more. On Thursday, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission voted to close the center and merge it with the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., three miles to the northeast. There, unless the plan is disapproved by President Bush and Congress, a new 300-bed hospital will be named the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. 
 Though the institution will live on, many in Washington have already begun grieving the loss of the current center, with its Georgian-style buildings, wooded lawns and storied past.
 ''Walter Reed is more than a building,'' said Peter B. Esker, secretary of the Walter Reed Society, a nonprofit group. ''It's an almost 100-year tradition of the best of military medicine.''
 The hospital was named after an army major from Virginia who spent the 1880's treating soldiers in frontier outposts and led a commission that confirmed the theory that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes. The breakthrough helped eradicate the disease and paved the way for completion of the Panama Canal. 
 The hospital opened in 1909 on farmland near the Maryland border with a staff of 65 to care for 10 patients. But with World War I, its patient load ballooned and it established the programs that made it famous, providing prosthetic limbs and rehabilitative therapy for soldiers wounded in combat. ''Warrior care'' it was called. 
 ''It's more than just treating people who lost limbs,'' Mr. Esker said. ''You name a medical specialty needed by the military, it's there at Walter Reed.''
 Between the world wars, the campus became home to a research center and a military medical school. World War II, like Korea and Vietnam after it, brought huge new waves of patients. The care evolved and the prosthetics improved, though the injuries remained much the same. 
 Throughout those years, the center became the hospital of choice for an array of luminaries. In the 1950's, Winston Churchill could be seen visiting Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who was undergoing cancer treatment. On his deathbed at the hospital, Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur counseled President Lyndon B. Johnson to avoid sending troops to Southeast Asia, according to the historian William Manchester. 
 And when Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi was shot twice and critically wounded by a robber in 1973, he told the ambulance attendants, ''Please take me to Walter Reed.''
 King Hussein of Jordan and the exiled shah of Iran went there for care. But so did unheralded potentates from less strategically important nations. More often than not, they were pleased with the results, prompting one commander to quip that providing health care to visiting dignitaries was better for diplomacy than selling them battleships. 
 In recent years, however, presidents and congressmen have often gone to Bethesda for routine health care. And Walter Reed's 900-bed hospital shrank to a 225-bed capacity as outpatient services expanded. 
 But the war in Iraq revitalized its mission. Since combat began, the hospital has treated 4,355 people for war-related wounds or illnesses.
 Dawn Halfaker, 26, was among them. In June 2004, Ms. Halfaker, then an Army first lieutenant, was brought to the hospital with a grenade wound to her right side.
 ''I was on a ventilator, in a coma, with my arm and my life hanging in the balance,'' she said.
 Her arm was removed, and she entered a year of wrenching physical and occupational therapy. The hospital staff taught her not only how to use her prosthetic limb, but also how to pay for groceries and blow dry her hair -- with one arm.
 ''They put me back together,'' said Ms. Halfaker, who retired from the Army as a captain. ''Literally, piece by piece.''
 With its 5,600 employees, Walter Reed has provided an economic boost to merchants along nearby Georgia Avenue. Many residents also felt secure knowing it was nearby for medical emergencies. 
 Now, they must begin worrying about what the government will do next with the sprawling campus. New development could be good if the surrounding community is consulted, said Councilman Adrian Fenty, who represents the area.
 ''But that said, the majority of people still feel we should fight to keep it,'' he said. ''It has represented stability. It represents the good things about the federal government in the District.''

HEADLINE: Summer of Our Discontent

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

 BODY:
For the last few months there has been a running debate about the U.S. economy, more or less like this: 
 American families: ''We're not doing very well.''
 Washington officials: ''You're wrong -- you're doing great. Here, look at these statistics!'' 
The administration and some political commentators seem genuinely puzzled by polls showing that Americans are unhappy about the economy. After all, they point out, numbers like the growth rate of G.D.P. look pretty good. So why aren't people cheering? 
 Some blame the negative halo effect of the Iraq debacle. Others complain that the news media aren't properly reporting good economic news. But when your numbers tell you that people should be feeling good, but they aren't, that means you're looking at the wrong numbers. 
 American families don't care about G.D.P. They care about whether jobs are available, how much those jobs pay and how that pay compares with the cost of living. And recent G.D.P. growth has failed to produce exceptional gains in employment, while wages for most workers haven't kept up with inflation.
 About employment: it's true that the economy finally started adding jobs two years ago. But although many people say ''four million jobs in the last two years'' reverently, as if it were an amazing achievement, it's actually a rise of about 3 percent, not much faster than the growth of the working-age population over the same period. And recent job growth would have been considered subpar in the past: employment grew more slowly during the best two years of the Bush administration than in any two years during the Clinton administration.
 It's also true that the unemployment rate looks fairly low by historical standards. But other measures of the job situation, like the average of weekly hours worked (which remains low), and the average duration of unemployment (which remains high), suggest that the demand for labor is still weak compared with the supply.
 Employers certainly aren't having trouble finding workers. When Wal-Mart announced that it was hiring at a new store in Northern California, where the unemployment rate is close to the national average, about 11,000 people showed up to apply for 400 jobs. 
 Because employers don't have to raise wages to get workers, wages are lagging behind the cost of living. According to Labor Department statistics, the purchasing power of an average nonsupervisory worker's wage has fallen about 1.5 percent since the summer of 2003. And this may understate the pressure on many families: the cost of living has risen sharply for those whose work or family situation requires buying a lot of gasoline.
 Some commentators dismiss concerns about gasoline prices, because those prices are still below previous peaks when you adjust for inflation. But that misses the point: Americans bought cars and made decisions about where to live when gas was $1.50 or less per gallon, and now suddenly find themselves paying $2.60 or more. That's a rude shock, which I estimate raises the typical family's expenses by more than $900 a year.
 You may ask where economic growth is going, if it isn't showing up in wages. That's easy to answer: it's going to corporate profits, to rising health care costs and to a surge in the salaries and other compensation of executives. (Forbes reports that the combined compensation of the chief executives of America's 500 largest companies rose 54 percent last year.)
 The bottom line, then, is that most Americans have good reason to feel unhappy about the economy, whatever Washington's favorite statistics may say. This is an economic expansion that hasn't trickled down; many people are worse off than they were a year ago. And it will take more than a revamped administration sales pitch to make people feel better.
 Corrections: In my column last Friday, I cited an inaccurate number (given by the Conyers report) for turnout in Ohio's Miami County last year: 98.5 percent. I should have checked the official state site, which reports a reasonable 72.2 percent. Also, the public editor says, rightly, that I should acknowledge initially misstating the results of the 2000 Florida election study by a media consortium led by The Miami Herald. Unlike a more definitive study by a larger consortium that included The New York Times, an analysis that showed Al Gore winning all statewide manual recounts, the earlier study showed him winning two out of three.

 CORRECTION:
 CORRECTION 
In describing the results of the ballot study by the group led by The Miami Herald in his column of Aug. 26, Paul Krugman relied on the Herald report, which listed only three hypothetical statewide recounts, two of which went to Al Gore. 
There was, however, a fourth recount, which would have gone to George W. Bush. In this case, the two stricter-standard recounts went to Mr. Bush. A later study, by a group that included The New York Times, used two methods to count ballots: relying on the judgment of a majority of those examining each ballot, or requiring unanimity. Mr. Gore lost one hypothetical recount on the unanimity basis.

HEADLINE: After Fort Monmouth Is Hit, Merger Plan for 3 Other Bases

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; John Holl, in Eatontown, N.J., Jonathan Miller, in Jersey City, and David S. Cloud, in Washington, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A federal panel voted yesterday to combine three existing Army, Navy and Air Force bases in New Jersey into a joint ''mega-base'' under one command, but local officials said the move would barely soften the blow from the commission's decision, a day earlier, to close Fort Monmouth and send thousands of jobs to Maryland.
 The action yesterday by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission would combine the efforts of Fort Dix, McGuire Air Force Base and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst under a central commander at McGuire, the largest of the three installations in central New Jersey. Few if any jobs would be added.
 Members of the state's congressional delegation had sought but failed to persuade the commission to include Fort Monmouth in the new joint base, and yesterday they were still reeling and trying to make sense of the decision to close the installation. In particular, they were puzzled by a small caveat introduced into the decision that seemed to offer a sliver of hope that Fort Monmouth could still be kept open. 
 The vote on Wednesday to close Fort Monmouth was definitive: 7 to 1. But just before making the decision, the commissioners passed an amendment that said the facility could not be closed until the Army proved that the move would not hurt military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 No one seems clear on how long it might take the Army to meet the required condition. Nor are officials sure of who will make that decision.
 ''This kind of amendment looks like a first,'' said Vice Admiral Paul Gaffney, retired, who is president of Monmouth University, a former head of research and development for the Navy and chairman of a commission formed to protect New Jersey bases. ''No one really knows what it means.''
 Officials said they were particularly confounded by the vote-caveat combination because commission members, in their remarks at Wednesday's hearing, seemed to recognize that Army research done at the base -- including work on devices that combat improvised explosive devices in Iraq -- would be disrupted if the Pentagon's proposal to move its operations to Maryland was approved. 
 ''When we first heard them talking about their concerns, we were thinking this is great, they will vote to keep it open,'' said United States Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat from Monmouth County. ''Then they said, 'We'll close you, but ---- ' I don't know how else to describe it except as strange.''
 ''It made no sense,'' said Maria Gatta, mayor of Oceanport, which has jurisdiction over a third of the base's roughly 1,100 acres. ''They adopted all our positions, then turned around and said we're going to close the fort.'' 
 Officials with the base closing commission did not respond to e-mail and telephone messages seeking clarification.
 The Department of Defense, in its recommendation that the base be closed, said that Fort Monmouth's Communications and Electronics Command should be transferred to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, where research efforts could be consolidated. It estimated that closing Fort Monmouth would save $1 billion, the Army's largest money saver in the current round of proposed realignments. Local advocates dispute the figure.
 If President Bush approves the closure nominations next month, nearly 5,200 jobs, both civilian and military, would be lost at the base. He can makes changes to the list of nominations before submitting it to Congress for an up-or-down vote, but neither the President nor lawmakers are expected to overturn the commission's decisions. 
 In another decision announced yesterday, the base commission approved a 600-job expansion at Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, but local businessmen and officials said that would not offset the economic blow to the largely working-class towns near Fort Monmouth. The Department of Defense has estimated that an additional 4,465 jobs would be lost indirectly with the fort's closing.
 Tony Couzo, 55, the owner of Guido's Famous Pizza, a restaurant on Lewis Street, a few blocks from the base's entrance, said that his lunch business could be devastated if his military customers moved on. 
 The commission's decision and its additional conditions seemed to only deepen the community's limbo, he said. ''It's tough to be a businessman during a time of uncertainty.'' 
 Several advocates for the base said that there might still be a chance of keeping the base open -- if they could force the Army to do a detailed review. 
 ''What we would like to do,'' Mr. Pallone said, ''is go through Congress or the Government Accountability Office and make them set forth some kinds of benchmarks so this isn't open to the Army just writing a perfunctory letter saying we meet all the conditions.''
 Mr. Pallone, along with other members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation, including Representative Christopher Smith, a Republican, said they were most concerned with Fort Monmouth's role in the war. They said that it was too risky to close the base because several weapons and communication systems were being developed and maintained at the installation. 
 A particularly important program based at Fort Monmouth, they said, disrupts the remote controls that are used in Iraq to detonate improvised explosive devices. 
 Tim Snyder, a spokesman for Fort Monmouth, said that there are about 80 engineers, in addition to other civilian and military employees, at Fort Monmouth who worked on the system, which is called Warlock. 
 He said that the base also developed, bought and maintained a wide range of battlefield communication systems, including radios, cellphones and hand-held devices that use mapping software to identify troop movements and reduce the likelihood of death by friendly fire. 
 Still, some officials said they saw no ambiguity in the decision to close the base. ''There was no process or procedure put in place to accommodate the conditions,'' said Gerry Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown,, where most of Fort Monmouth is located. ''I suspect that the final decision was made yesterday and that Fort Monmouth will be closed.''

HEADLINE: As School-Building Plan Fails, New Jersey Is Left With Slums 

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
With its gangs, police shootings and struggles to modernize, this city seems to have enough problems. Now it has one more.
 Dewey Street used to be a proud middle-class neighborhood, a chamber of peace and quiet in Newark's gritty heart.
But last year when the state cleared out tracts of land to build a school, most of the families were driven away. And now that the money for the school has evaporated, more than three dozen lots sit abandoned, one after another. 
 James Searcy is one of the last residents here, a 74-year-old man with milky eyes and slow speech. At night, his porch light is a lonely light on a dark and empty street.
 He misses his old neighbors. But worse, he fears his new ones: the prostitutes, drug dealers and hangers-out beginning to creep in.
 ''There's no one here but me and my wife, and most times she's gone,'' he said.
 Across New Jersey, hundreds of people have been pushed out of their homes for school projects that, it turns out, were only dreams. They were displaced as part of a once-celebrated $8.6 billion program that, instead of creating new schools, has in several instances created new slums.
 In Irvington, Gloucester City and Passaic, and in other towns to a lesser degree, school officials rushed to get residents out. Now that the schools are not coming anytime soon, no one seems to know what to do with all the vacant property.
 No neighborhood slid as far and as fast as Dewey Street, a stable community of owner-occupied homes, which until last year resisted the blight that has claimed much of this city.
 ''The state has created a monster,'' said Newark's mayor, Sharpe James. ''We now have a concentrated, abandoned front in the heart of Newark. And I've been asking: If you don't have enough money to build a school, then why you do have enough money to bring down a neighborhood?''
 The state agency facing that question is the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation, an ambitious program built for speed. It was established three years ago to bring new schools to the state's poorest districts, but recent investigations have exposed millions of dollars wasted on excessive bonuses, exorbitant fees and design errors.
 Gerald Murphy, the agency's chief operating officer, described Dewey Street as a ''lesson learned.'' He said that in the effort to build schools quickly, state officials streamlined the process so that property acquisition, design, surveying and other tasks were all moving ahead at the same time -- and at the same time, school funds were disappearing.
 ''Moving that fast has its risks,'' he said. ''In the future, we will not proceed with any project unless there is sufficient money in the budget to finish it.''
 That is limp consolation to Mr. Searcy, who came here in 1961 to work at a scissors factory.
 Back then, Dewey Street, about 10 minutes south of downtown, was one of Newark's few integrated neighborhoods, a mix of black and Jewish families.
 It was not fancy. But it was respectable, a tree-lined enclave for accountants, teachers, ministers, working-class people and one almost-famous Negro League baseball player.
 On Saturday mornings, people gathered by the curb with brooms in their hands and talked about their rising property values and which colleges their children would go to.
 ''Everything used to be so lovely,'' Mr. Searcy said. That was the word he kept coming back to: lovely.
 During the 1967 riots, great swaths of Newark burned to the ground. But not Dewey Street. Neighbors banded together to protect their homes and formed a powerful community organization.
 ''It was like what they used to say about E.F. Hutton,'' Mayor James said. ''When the Dewey Street people talked, everybody listened.''
 In the early 1990's, gangs and crack began to seep into Newark. But Dewey Street stayed clean. Homeowners did not even put bars on their windows.
 But in the late 1990's, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the state to decrease the disparity between city and suburban children by building more schools. In 2002, James E. McGreevey, then the governor, established the Schools Construction Corporation, which he promised would save money through economies of scale.
 Within a year, Dewey Street residents started getting letters saying they had to move.
 When Minnie Sapp opened hers, she thought it was a mistake.
 ''We were such a vibrant neighborhood in a city with so much vacant land,'' said Ms. Sapp, who had lived there since 1975. ''Why would it make sense to move us out?''
 Officials had designated Dewey Street and two surrounding blocks between Nye and Hawthorne Avenues as the site of a new $27 million high school, New University, promoted as a 21st-century magnet school for 1,000 students. After it was built, students would be moved from two decaying elementary schools into the current high school, which was supposed to be renovated.
 Meetings were called. Officials explained eminent domain. Reality began to sink in.
 At first, residents talked about getting lawyers. Then they talked about trying to move together. But in the end, each negotiated separate deals, and after decades together, the members of the Dewey Street gang held one last cookout and went their separate ways.
 Ms. Sapp moved to Dover, Del., where she lives with her husband, who has Alzheimer's disease.
 ''He keeps saying he wants to go home,'' she said.
 Then, last month, school officials announced that because of budget problems, they needed to cancel 207 projects, including Dewey Street.
 The news made Ms. Sapp sick.
 ''You tore my neighborhood apart, you took my home, you put me in debt,'' she said. ''For nothing?''
 Urban renewal critics say this happens often. In Chicago, Detroit and other cities, countless homes have been bulldozed, only to have nothing built on them, said Scott Bullock, senior attorney for the Institute of Justice, a nonprofit law firm in Washington.
 ''It's been called the field of dreams approach: if you demolish it, they will come,'' Mr. Bullock said. ''But that doesn't always happen. Deals fall through.''
 In Passaic, about 10 miles north of Newark, a healthy working-class neighborhood was gutted to make way for the expansion of Roosevelt Elementary School. When school starts next month, children will wheel their backpacks past a new strip of abandoned homes.
 ''They've created a dead zone,'' said Robert Holster, the superintendent of Passaic schools. 
 In Gloucester City, near Camden, the schools agency turned out residents and boarded up more than 60 homes and businesses to build a middle school.
 ''We're constantly going down there to check on vagrants and things,'' said the city clerk, Paul Kain.
 At least 10 school districts plan to sue state authorities for backing out of school plans and creating blight in the process.
 In Newark, Ronald L. Rice, a Democratic state senator, says he will ask for special funds to demolish the nearly 40 boarded-up homes in the Dewey Street area before winter, when he worries they could become crack dens and fire hazards. School officials say they do not know when the Dewey Street school will be built. There are no plans for it now.
 Meanwhile, the project has become another source of turmoil for the school construction agency, which was criticized in April by an inspector general as ''vulnerable to mismanagement, fiscal malfeasance, conflicts of interest and waste, fraud and abuse.'' In May, the chairman of the board was forced out, and last week the chief executive officer announced he was quitting.
 On Wednesday, the agency announced that its chief financial officer would temporarily serve as chief executive. To date, the Schools Construction Corporation has built 30 schools, with 43 under way and 59 more to come.
 Mayor James said that the agency was a disaster and that he did not believe it would ever deliver a school to Dewey Street.
 The timing could not be worse for Mr. Searcy. A few months ago, he had settled on moving out and had entered into a contract to buy a little house in Georgia, near where he grew up. But then school officials announced they had run out of money and could spend no more on Dewey Street, leaving Mr. Searcy and a few other elderly homeowners marooned. On Monday night, somebody broke into his shed and stole his tools and lawn mower.
 On Wednesday, school officials said they would allocate the money to buy the last houses in the neighborhood, though it is not clear when this will happen.
 Until it does, Mr. Searcy plans to sit on his porch, listening to a transistor radio with a foil speaker, watching the boys in white T-shirts take their posts on the corner.
 ''I just wander in and out, in and out,'' he said. ''I don't know who to turn to. I don't know what to do.''

HEADLINE: Easy Credit In Mortgages May Backfire 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IF housing prices fall, will mortgages cushion the decline, or make it worse? Put another way, will more overstretched homeowners be forced to sell?
 At issue is whether financial innovations that have made it easier for Americans to buy homes have also made the system less stable and more subject to shocks that could drive many from their homes.
Traditionally, home mortgages, unlike loans to buy stock, have had a calming influence during tough times. If you buy stock with borrowed money, a decline in prices can bring on margin calls, and you must either put up cash or sell. 
 But homeowners have been able to hold on because mortgage loans -- unlike margin loans on stocks -- do not become due just because the value of the property declines. Your mortgage will not be foreclosed so long as you meet the monthly payments, even if the house is now worth less than you owe.
 In the old days, the mortgage in question was probably a 30-year fixed-rate loan, and the monthly payment stayed the same for the life of the mortgage. Someone who lost a job might be unable to make the payments, but most homeowners could keep doing so. 
 Now, however, mortgages that were unknown in years past have become common in some areas. They feature variable interest rates that can leap if market rates do, and some allow payments of only the interest owed, or even less, for several years. Such loans made it possible for people to buy houses they otherwise could not afford, and helped to propel the housing boom that continued through the 2001-2 recession even as the stock market plunged.
 But those mortgages are designed to allow monthly payments to rise rapidly. Rising interest rates, or the end of five-year teaser periods, can cause such increases, which would leave some homeowners unable to meet the payments. They expect to refinance, but that is impossible if the house is not worth the amount owed. The result could be forced sales into a weak market.
 For now, all the talk about bubbles may be just talk. In the late 1990's stock market, those who warned that prices were too high were discredited by the final huge rise in 1999 and early 2000. Only after most bears were silenced did they become right. 
 THE housing bears now are anything but silent, and there is little sign of the economic news -- soaring interest rates or recession or both -- that would bring down home prices.
 But if and when a fall comes, watch the volume of home sales, particularly of existing homes. In the early 1980's recession, annual sales of existing homes fell 50 percent, to two million homes.
 This week there was talk of a weakening housing market because sales of existing homes seemed to slip in July. But that was more a matter of seasonal adjustments than reality. Over the last 12 months, 6.1 million single-family homes were sold along with nearly 1.3 million new homes. Both figures are records.
 Housing is, of course, a collection of regional markets, with widely varying prices. The most expensive areas, and the ones that have risen the most in the last five years, are concentrated on the coasts, and are presumably the most vulnerable if prices do start to fall.
 When that does happen, watch the volume of sales of existing homes. If it falls rapidly, that will be an indication that not much has changed, and the damage is likely to be limited. 
 But if sales volume stays high, that could indicate that the mortgage innovations are hurting. Then we could see rising numbers of foreclosures as homeowners discover they cannot sell their homes for what they owe but also cannot pay their suddenly higher monthly mortgage bills.

HEADLINE: There She Isn't: Miss America Pageant Leaves Atlantic City

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
After more than 80 years on the very boardwalk that she helped make famous, Miss America is taking her tiara and ducking out of Atlantic City, pageant executives announced yesterday.
 The beauty contest, once a staple of mainstream American culture, has recently been blemished by low television ratings, increased competition from reality shows and a financial situation that is not pretty.
After ABC, which had broadcast the pageant since 1997, dropped it last year, pageant officials said they could no longer afford to produce the elaborate annual show in Atlantic City, which, even after public subsidies, still cost more than half a million dollars each year. 
 ''The days of getting the big money are sadly over,'' said Art McMaster, president of the Miss America Organization. ''We realized to survive we needed to take this show on the road.''
 Pageant officials would not say where the contest was headed. Mr. McMaster said he had received offers from many cities around the country and was weighing them carefully. The next pageant will be in January.
 Pageant fans say the beauties could march down to Nashville, home of Country Music Television, which bought the rights to broadcast the next two contests. Mr. McMaster would not comment on that, except to say that Nashville had made no firm offer.
 He also said the contestants could become nomads.
 ''We're considering moving this thing around the country,'' he said. ''After all, Miss America belongs to all of America.''
 To leave Atlantic City, the pageant had to get permission to break its contract with the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority; that was granted yesterday afternoon. One catch, though, is that the reigning Miss America must continue to appear 10 times a year on behalf of the visitors' bureau for the next five years.
 ''I don't care what people say about Miss America,'' said Jeffrey Vasser, executive director of the visitors' bureau. ''She remains a great selling tool.''
 Pageant officials said casting off Atlantic City was part of a larger effort to give the pageant a new image, perhaps one that better resembles the heartland, not a casino town in New Jersey.
 Atlantic City officials said the issue boiled down to money. Each year, the visitors' bureau kicks in $720,000 to turn a historic hall on the boardwalk into a temporary television studio for the contest. Apparently, that was not enough.
 ''Miss America needs to go somewhere that will give them a site fee and pay all the costs and put a million dollars in their pocket,'' Mr. Vasser said. ''We were not going to do that.''
 City officials acknowledged that losing the contest would hurt. The question is: How much?
 ''No doubt, it has a certain cachet to it,'' said Benjamin R. Fitzgerald, the city's business administrator. ''But as far as an economic bonanza, Miss America has certainly been eclipsed by the casinos.''
 It's true that Atlantic City has a street named Miss America Way, uses the pageant's sparkling tiara logo for promotions and has built a good chunk of its identity around a contest that city fathers started in September 1921 as a gimmick to stretch out the summer season.
 But, at the same time, Atlantic City has begun to outgrow its saltwater taffy and beauty queen roots to become the Las Vegas of the East, with 12 casinos, 18,000 hotel rooms and dozens of clubs, bars and fancy restaurants.
 ''Miss America will always be part of us,'' Mr. Vasser said. ''But this is the new Atlantic City, and we're rebranding ourselves as well.''

HEADLINE: A Blast of Rain but Little Damage as Hurricane Hits South Florida

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER; Reporting for this article was contributed by Asra Jawaid, Neil Reisner, Kelli Kennedy and Terry Aguayo.

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Hurricane Katrina pushed ashore north of here as darkness fell on Thursday, laden with heavy rain but not packing much of a wallop. 
 Sustained winds of 80 miles per hour with gusts up to 92 m.p.h. bent palm trees and rattled windows, but there were no reports of heavy damage as the hurricane made landfall between North Miami Beach and Hallandale Beach shortly before 7 p.m.
By late Thursday, as much as 12 inches of rain had fallen in some areas, according to estimates by the National Weather Service. More than a million homes and businesses had lost power, The Associated Press reported. 
 Two deaths were reported by Miami television stations. One person was struck by a tree, the other was electrocuted by a downed power line. 
 The storm turned to the southwest after making landfall, passing just northwest of Miami. Its winds were 75 m.p.h., just above minimal hurricane force, at 11 p.m. Thursday.
 All of the four storms that hit Florida last year packed winds of well over 100 m.p.h., some gusting to well over 140 m.p.h. Several carried strong winds reaching more than 150 miles from the center. 
 By contrast, tropical force winds of about 40 m.p.h. to 70 m.p.h. extended about 80 miles from the Hurricane Katrina's center, said Trisha Wallace, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center here.
 Colin McAdie, another meteorologist at the center, said that once the storm moved over the gulf today, it was expected to wheel north, pick up speed and hit the Florida Panhandle on Sunday. 
 As the storm approached South Florida, residents took the usual precautions of stocking up on flashlight batteries, water and snacks, and as night fell few drivers were on the windswept streets. 
 For the most part, they seemed to be taking the hurricane in stride.
 ''I feel pretty comfortable that this is a minor event,'' said Mark Golden as he bought flashlights and water at a Home Depot in Boca Raton, about 40 miles north of here. Mr. Golden said he was not even planning to cover his windows with plywood.
 Officials cautioned against overconfidence. 
 ''People tend to not take these types of storms very seriously because it's not a major hurricane,'' said Lt. j.g. Jennifer Pralgo, a meteorologist at the hurricane center. ''But they need to. We're urging people to stay home. Most of South Florida is going to get a lot of rain.''
 Although there were no mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas, most businesses closed early, and Fort Lauderdale International Airport was closed at 7 p.m.
 In Miami, one public school in a low-income neighborhood was opened as a shelter.
 Although major damage was not expected, Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, an insurance trade group, said the hurricane could still ''produce hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.''
 The damage is expected to be light but widespread. Instead of hundreds of roofs being ripped off, Mr. Hartwig said, it was more likely that tiles would be blown away, permitting rain to pour into homes. By comparison, the four powerful hurricanes that hit Florida last year cost insurance companies $23 billion. 
 Strong winds from one of those storms brushed South Florida, but no major hurricane has hit the area since 1992, when Hurricane Andrew pummeled vast residential areas on the southern flank of Miami and several towns south of Miami, including Homestead. The damage from Hurricane Andrew came to about $22 billion in today's dollars.
 Since Hurricane Andrew, Florida officials have imposed strict building codes intended to make homes and offices more wind resistant. 
 In July, the state's first hurricane of the year, Dennis, hit the Florida Panhandle. It caused about $900 million in damage in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. 
 Grocery stores, hardware stores and gasoline stations were busy on Thursday, but the pace was measured. Jugs of water moved off the shelves in ones and twos rather than by the case, as often happens when hurricanes threaten.
 There were no lines at gas stations or hardware stores. 
 A grocery bagger at a Publix grocery store in Hollywood, north of here, said, ''There's no panicking, just shopping.''

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Mr. Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub. Directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the show feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt, despite the presence of a top-flight cast led by Nathan Lane. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)

'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint in Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'THE DEAR BOY' An uptight English teacher learns to cut loose, at least a bit, when he's confronted with an unflattering portrait written by a gifted but troubled student. Capably acted but lacking in real substance (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)246-4422, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)

'DEAR DUBYA: PATRIOTIC LOVE LETTERS TO WHITEHOUSE.ORG' Peevish, pathetic and plain unhinged, the e-mail messages rendered reader's-theater-style in this brief, seldom cheap, often funny show demonstrate that President Bush has no shortage of credulous, humor-impaired fans and foes (45 minutes). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)907-6189, closing Sunday. (Rob Kendt)

'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Stevens)

'IVANOV' Jonathan Bank's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb)

'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' The hand of fate reaches all the way into a steaming hot tub filled with cranky women in this seriocomic lesbian soap opera from the Five Lesbian Brothers. A richly funny Sapphic sex comedy, it is also a serious inquiry into the unforeseen extremities of despair that can attend the search for a lasting love (1:30). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)

'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap with Natasha Richardson about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)

'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)

'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970's, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)

'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)

'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)

* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)

'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)

'THE CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) ''The Century of the Self,'' a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Freud's seminal theory of the subconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Dana Stevens)

'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)

'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-top dog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

* 'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. (Scott)

'DEUCE BIGALOW: EUROPEAN GIGOLO' (R, 77 minutes) In a sequel to the 1999 hit, the schlubby escort lands in Amsterdam to make lovelorn ladies feel whole, but the entire ordeal is mockery disguised as self-help. The insulting comedy is out of step with the culture, the times and the rebranded Adam Sandler, who was a producer and bit-player in this mess. (Ned Martel)

'THE DUKES OF HAZZARD' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Yee-haw? Naw. (Scott)

'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael Gonzalez (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be made floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela) is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)

'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)

'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out with Steve Carell in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)

'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Stephen Holden)

'THE GOEBBELS EXPERIMENT' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English and German) Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft's fascinating documentary provides a chilling glimpse into the brilliant but toxic mind of Joseph Goebbels via his extensive diaries. Careening from soggy sentimentality to maniacal extermination fantasies, the entries reveal a supremely theatrical man whose manipulation of mass political opinion was unprecedented. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie, which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)

'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry. (Dargis)

'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)

'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)

'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)

'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is in many ways less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation, and how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)

'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)

'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)

'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)

'9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)

'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)

'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)

'REEL PARADISE' (R, 110 minutes) Steve James's untidy but absorbing documentary follows a family of New York cineastes to Fiji, where they show free movies to the people, and experience mild culture clash and domestic disharmony. (Holden)

*'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) This is a relentless assault on the senses about three hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul ), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Laura Kern)

'THE SKELETON KEY' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Kate Hudson in a T-shirt and underwear, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South -- all this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too. (Dargis)

'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)

'SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE' (No rating, 121 minutes) In this exploitation flick from Park Chanwook about two men who each set a course for bloody vengeance, the violence carries no meaning beyond the director's ego. (Dargis)

'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, it is about a lonely man who at 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)

'2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)

'THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL' (No rating, 70 minutes) Keith A. Beauchamp's lean, harrowing documentary about the 50-year-old murder that catalyzed the civil rights movement offers new evidence that the crime was a broader conspiracy than originally thought. (Holden)

'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in this movie's cartoon voiceovers. (Holden)

'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)

'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

AMERICAN ANALOG SET (Tuesday) This Austin band plays wistful, conspiratorial whisper-pop that's more hum than drone. Playing in the cocoonlike Joe's Pub should make this stop on the band's farewell tour especially intimate. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $15. (Laura Sinagra)

KEYSHIA COLE (Wednesday) The Oakland-born R&B singer Keyshia Cole presents a tough-cookie brand of diva soul that focuses less on fashionista posing than righteous recrimination. On her single ''I Changed My Mind,'' she rides Kanye West's hard-clapping track with sultry grit. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20 in advance, $22. (Sinagra)

ALICE COOPER, CHEAP TRICK (Monday) School's been out forever, but the snake-toting father of glammy, hard-rock horror, Alice Cooper, still manages to growl out adolescent complaints like ''Eighteen'' and ''No More Mr. Nice Guy.'' Seminal 70's power-popper Cheap Trick, still in fine form, enjoys regular praise from younger bands both pop-punk and emo. 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $43. (Sinagra)

DEAD BOYS, FLIPPER (Tonight and tomorrow) Their history bound with CBGB's, the living members of Cleveland's Dead Boys, whose ''Sonic Reducer'' is a punk epic, reconvene to play a benefit for their former manager Hilly Kristal's imperiled club. Tonight with San Francisco's ooze-punk band Flipper, known for the hard-core sludge howler ''Sex Bomb.'' Tomorrow, with the dirty Anti-Nowhere League, the Nihilistics, and SFA, 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $35. (Sinagra)

HILARY DUFF (Thursday) With the teen-pop singers Kelly Clarkson, Mandy Moore and, of course, Lindsay Lohan all deciding to ditch their halos, good girl Hilary Duff (television's Lizzie McGuire) benefits from hanging back in virgin territory. 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $36 to $46. (Sinagra)

GREEN DAY (Thursday) Since the mid-90's, these pop-punkers have moved from couch-surfing anthems to smackdowns of exurban cluelessness. The trio's ''American Idiot'' (Reprise, 2004) rejected both a ''redneck agenda'' and sleepwalking worship of the ''Jesus of Suburbia.'' 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., Ticketmaster.com, $35. (Sinagra)

DARYL HALL & JOHN OATES, TODD RUNDGREN (Tonight and Tuesday) The Philadelphia platinum pop duo has always relied on the blue-eyed-soul crooner Daryl Hall's ability to emote within tight, rhythmic constraints while John Oates harmonizes urgently above. Mr. Hall has recently been fighting Lyme disease but is reportedly still in fine voice. The 70's pop powerhouse Todd Rundgren is a perfect addition to the bill. Tonight at 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $50. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $50. (Sinagra)

COREY HARRIS, HUBERT SUMLIN (Sunday) Mr. Harris is a traditionalist fingerpicker who finds new insights in classic country blues. Playing lead guitar behind Howlin' Wolf for more than two decades, Mr. Sumlin defined the jagged, asymmetrical attack of classic Chicago blues guitar. His spiky aggression echoes through blues and rock. These two artists are highlights of a Sunday-afternoon blues and barbecue bill that includes Guitar Shorty and Candye Kane. Mr. Harris plays at 3:45 p.m., Mr. Sumlin at 7:45. Festival runs from 2 to 9 p.m., Hudson River Park, Pier 54, (212)627-2020, free. (Jon Pareles)

HOOTIE & THE BLOWFISH (Sunday) The slick, bluesy frat-pop of this band was made more memorable by the singer Darius Rucker's gooey baritone on songs like ''Let Her Cry'' and ''Only Wanna Be With You.'' 7 p.m., North Fork Theater, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $44. (Sinagra)

ICE-T, KOOL KEITH & THE ULTRAMAGNETIC MC'S (Tuesday) The Los Angeles rapper Ice-T's styles have run the gamut from dance-floor pimping to the rap-metal squall of his band Body Count. The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in rap's late-80's golden age, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany, rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Ice-T and Kool Keith have recorded together in the past as the Analog Brothers. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $18 to $20. (Sinagra)

INSTITUTE FEATURING GAVIN ROSSDALE (Tuesday) The handsome Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale has decided not to go the Rob Thomas route and become a solo crooner. His latest entity is influenced by its producer, Page Hamilton, of the rock band Helmet. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $25. (Sinagra)

JOURNEY (Tonight and Sunday) Despite the absence of Steve Perry's soaring vocals, the 80's pop band responsible for anthemic keyboard-driven schmaltz like ''Don't Stop Believin''' and ''Faithfully'' soldiers on for crowds singing along way too loud to notice. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $63. Sunday at 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $65. (Sinagra)

ANGELIQUE KIDJO (Tonight) In her recent music, this Benin-born world beat singer explores the nexus of African, Cuban and Brazilian styles. 8 p.m., Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, 63rd Street and Broadway, (212)875-5766, free. (Sinagra)

AVRIL LAVIGNE, GAVIN DEGRAW (Tomorrow) The pop skater-girl Avril Lavigne is keeping her surf cred by hanging tight with Sum 41's singer, Deryck Whibley. But she's maturing into a tough-minded careerist, teaming up here with an opening act sure not to overshadow her, the likable pianist Gavin DeGraw. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $46. (Sinagra)

TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS, I AM KLOOT (Tomorrow) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and falsetto also recall the 70's arena rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. The Manchester indie-poppers I Am Kloot open. 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17 (Fulton Street), Lower Manhattan, (212)219-3910, free. (Sinagra)

LOUIS XIV, THE IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Thursday) The lads in the exaggerated glam outfit Louis XIV are sloppier and rockier than the Darkness and significantly less sincere. To paraphrase their hero T-Rex, they think they're champs, but they're not. The Minnesota bar rocker Ike Reilly is more clever and slightly less suspect. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $15. (Sinagra)

THE NEVILLE BROTHERS (Tonight) The Neville Brothers have been at the center of New Orleans funk since the 1950's, and apply all their experience in syncopation to their own songs and, lately, cover songs like ''Ball of Confusion.'' 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $33 in advance, $35. (Pareles)

RAINER MARIA (Monday) This Midwestern emo band's best asset is the bassist Caithlin De Marrais, who screams eloquent diary entries over pointy, distorted guitar pop. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $10. (Sinagra)

LOU REED, KEREN ANN, BEN TAYLOR, NICO MUHLY (Sunday) Music may be kept to a minimum at this benefit for the East Village's Howl! Festival. There will be readings by the punk emeritus Lou Reed, the cosmopolitan poet-chanteuse Keren Ann, the troubadour Ben Taylor and the composer Nico Muhly. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $50. (Sinagra)

SHAM 69 (Sunday and Monday) This English working-class 70's-punk band plays for the CBGB's cause. Sunday with Flipper (see Dead Boys entry above), Cheetah Chrome and the Black Angels and Walter Lure and the Waldos; Monday with the Radicts and Youth Brigade, 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $25. (Sinagra)

THE USED, (Tuesday and Wednesday) This catchy pop-punk band falls into the screamo category. It gained some fame a few years back when its hard-partying singer dated Kelly Osbourne. 5:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212)485-1534, $30. (Sinagra)

CARLOS VIVES, DADDY YANKEE (Tomorrow) The Colombian singer-songwriter Carlos Vives made his name weaving Bogota balladry, Andean traditional music and accordion-heavy coastal vallenato into rock and pop. Lately he incorporates Cuban son and hip-hop. Daddy Yankee is the Puerto Rican reggaeton artist behind the thumping hit ''Gasolina.'' 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)307-7171, $70 to $105. (Sinagra)

BOB WEIR AND RATDOG, BRUCE HORNSBY (Thursday) Mr. Weir, the Grateful Dead's rhythm guitarist, leads his six-piece band Ratdog through rock standards and his own Dead songs. Mr. Hornsby, who tours as Weir's pianist, also plays from his own catalog, which reaches deep into jazz and gospel as he examines the modern South. 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)360-2777, $40. (Pareles)

WIGSTOCK (Tomorrow) Fabulous drag regalia carries the day at this enduring festival celebrating East Village gender-bending performance.

SONNY FORTUNE AND RASHIED ALI (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Fortune, a tenor and soprano saxophonist, and Mr. Ali, a drummer, share a connection to the explosive late-period music of John Coltrane; this duo performance should bear at least a small resemblance to ''Interstellar Space'' (Impulse!), the 1967 album on which Mr. Coltrane and Mr. Ali went head to head. 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)

TIERNEY SUTTON (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer; her fine new album, ''I'm With the Band'' (Telarc), was recorded at Birdland in the spring, making this a return engagement. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

LEW TABACKIN'S SPIRITS OF NEW YORK (Wednesday through Sept. 3) A gutsy tenor saxophonist and deeply lyrical flutist, Mr. Tabackin has a woefully low profile among the jazz public, but he has no problem attracting ace sidemen like the trumpeter Tom Harrell, the drummer Victor Lewis and the bassist Ray Drummond. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Anne Midgette)

Classical Music

AMERICAN ACCORDIONISTS ASSOCIATION MASTER CLASS AND CONCERT SERIES (Tonight through Sunday) There is more to accordion music than you may think, or at least, there is when the accordionist William Schimmel is in charge of the proceedings. The concerts in Mr. Schimmel's annual series offer everything from serious concert commissions to madcap transcriptions and works in punk, Goth and world music styles, played by Mr. Schimmel, Rembert Block, Ray Rue, Kamala Sankaram, Marnie Rice and others.

MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow) The Russian composer Dmitry Stepanovich Bortnyansky, born five years before Mozart, was a Mozart devotee who presented Mozart's Requiem and other Mozart works at the Russian imperial court. In his own music he emulated Mozartean qualities of clarity and elegance. The connection between the two composers, however thematically tenuous, was enough to prompt Louis Langree, the music director of the Mostly Mozart Festival, to pair Bortnyansky's little-known ''Te Deum'' on tonight's program with Mozart's Mass in C minor for the final weekend of the festival. The singers of the Russian Patriarchate Choir, an all-male ensemble that specializes in Russian liturgical chant and 19th-century Russian choral works, will perform, along with the Concert Chorale of New York and a roster of strong vocal soloists. Tomorrow night the festival concludes with a far more traditional all-Mozart program. The Mass in C minor will be repeated, this time preceded by the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, with the pianist Jonathan Biss as soloist. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $32 to $52. (Anthony Tommasini)

Tomorrow night at 8 (jazz), Sunday afternoon at 3 (pre-concert event, ''The Little Guild of St. Francis,'' at 2), Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126, $25, $12 for students under 24. (Midgette)

SKANEATELES FESTIVAL (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Since most other festivals are beginning to fold their tents, it may be time to dig out the map and do some exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, N.Y., near Syracuse, this event presents an attractive chamber concert tonight and a concert by the Festival Chamber Orchestra, including wonderful wind serenades by Mozart and Dvorak, tomorrow. The excellent violinist Hilary Hahn appears in a free children's concert on Wednesday morning at 11 and in another chamber concert on Thursday. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 8; tonight and Wednesday at First Presbyterian Church, 97 East Genesee Street; tomorrow at Brook Farm, south on Route 41A; Thursday at Skaneateles High School, 49 East Elizabeth Street, (315)685-7418; tonight and Thursday, $16 and $21, $13 and $18 for students and 65+; tomorrow, $18 and $24.

On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Janowski leads Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus joined by Hillevi Martinpelto, soprano; Susan Platts, mezzo-soprano; Kurt Streit, tenor; and Alastair Miles, bass-baritone.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $17 (lawn) to $96. (Eichler)

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent, and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Sifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,' through Sept. 11. A selection of fair to good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to an organization called Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CEZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cezanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

THE NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HELION, through Oct. 9. Helion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or his weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)

NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)

NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)

QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 31. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)

UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)

WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)

Galleries: Uptown

'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)

'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook where he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)

IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)

LIU ZHENG: 'THE CHINESE' Under the influence of Sander, Frank and Arbus, this Chinese photographer set out to document his society with a focus on the dark and wild side.

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400, closing Monday. (Kimmelman)

'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop-culture imagery.

HEADLINE: China Preparing to Tax Vehicles With Large Engines 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Alarmed by high world oil prices and sporadic shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel in big cities this summer, China's leaders are drafting plans to impose steep taxes on cars and sport utility vehicles with gas-guzzling engines.
 The taxes would add as much as 27 percent to the price of vehicles with big engines, notably sports cars and S.U.V.'s, auto industry officials and people advising the government on the plan said. At the same time, taxes may be cut slightly for models with the smallest, most efficient engines, though the details of these cuts are still under discussion, they said.
 The taxes follow China's adoption on July 1 of fuel economy standards that are more stringent than those in force in the United States. The Bush administration announced plans on Tuesday to phase in tougher fuel economy rules for light-duty trucks in the 2008-11 model years, but the Chinese have already imposed stiffer standards to take effect in 2008-9. 
 Since the 1970's, the United States has had a so-called gas-guzzler tax up to $7,700 on cars that get very low gasoline mileage. The tax falls mainly on sports cars with huge engines, like Ferraris, because S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and minivans are exempt from the tax -- an exception that has contributed to a shift away from cars and toward these trucklike vehicles in the American market.
 The planned taxes in China are part of a much broader effort to improve the nation's energy security. Efforts by state-controlled oil companies to buy foreign businesses have drawn the most attention, particularly Cnooc's unsuccessful $18.5 billion bid this summer for Unocal, and China National Petroleum's $4.18 billion deal on Monday to buy PetroKazakhstan.
 But China has also been focusing on energy efficiency. Zhang Guobao, vice minister of the State Development and Reform Commission, said last week that China's next five-year plan, for 2006 through 2010, would put energy conservation ahead of expanding supplies, the official New China News Agency said.
 The State Council, or cabinet, is in the final stages of drafting the new automobile taxes, a complex process involving many government agencies, said He Dongquan, the transportation program official in the Beijing office of the Energy Foundation, a nonprofit group that has worked with the government on the issue. ''I'm quite sure it will be adopted in the next one or two months,'' he said.
 Feng Fei, director of the industry department at the State Council's Development and Research Center, said in June that his agency had submitted a plan calling for steep increases in excise taxes from automakers on vehicles with big engines that burn more gasoline, The China Daily reported then.
 ''The taxation change is mainly aimed at encouraging car owners to consume less oil and at cushioning environmental pressures,'' Mr. Feng said in June. A call to his office on Thursday was not answered. 
 With rising gasoline prices already pushing consumers toward more fuel-efficient models, auto manufacturers appear to be offering little resistance to the planned new tax.
 ''The move is consistent with energy conservation plans, and we believe it is the right way to go in achieving energy efficiency in society,'' said Li Fengzhen, chief financial controller of Great Wall Automobile Holding, a manufacturer of medium-size S.U.V.'s that would face slightly higher taxes under the plan. 
 China currently imposes an excise tax of 3 percent, 5 percent or 8 percent on cars -- those with larger engines pay higher rates -- while taxes on S.U.V.'s and minivans are 3 percent or 5 percent. Under the new rules nearing completion, the taxes would range from 1 or 2 percent for vehicles with the smallest engines to 20 percent for vehicles with engines of four liters or more, said An Feng, director of the Auto Project on Energy and Climate Change. That group is a nongovernmental organization in Beijing that has advised officials on fuel economy policy, though it has not been directly involved in drafting the new tax regulations.
 (While a four-liter engine is considered quite large in most of the world, it is typical for an American sport utility vehicle. For example, the standard six-cylinder engine of the Ford Explorer, the best-selling S.U.V. in the United States, displaces 4 liters, though a larger 8-cylinder, 4.6-liter engine is available.)
 In addition, the Chinese government has been working on a gas-guzzler tax similar to the American tax but covering S.U.V.'s and minivans in addition to cars, Mr. An said. Mr. He of the Energy Foundation said that the tax would vary from 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on engine size, and would apply to vehicles that fell short of the fuel economy standards imposed on July 1.
 Chinese vehicle taxes largely exclude pickup trucks, which are separately regulated and sell in tiny numbers. Minivans in China tend to have medium or small engines and may not face much of a tax increase.
 The track record of gas-guzzler taxes on vehicles in promoting energy efficiency has been mixed in other countries, said Paul Blokland, director of Segment Y, a consulting firm in Bangalore, India, that tracks automakers in Asia. Very affluent consumers who can afford big vehicles with large engines tend not to be discouraged by extra taxes on the initial price of the vehicle, he said.
 Yale Zhang, an analyst in the Shanghai office of CSM Worldwide, a global automotive consulting firm, said that most Chinese buyers, unlike Americans, already chose vehicles with smaller engines. So increased taxes will fall on just a small share of the market.
 The multinational company that may face the biggest burden from the taxes is likely to be DaimlerChrysler, which sells Jeeps and big Mercedes sedans in China. Grand Cherokees with 4-liter and 4.7-liter engines, not especially large by American standards, would fall in the highest category of excise taxes. Trevor Hale, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman in Beijing, said the automaker had not seen the details but supported the government's general desire to improve fuel economy.
 Chinese officials had talked earlier this year of imposing a fuel tax once world oil prices started to decline, so as to hold domestic gasoline and diesel fuel prices at whatever peak they might reach. High prices would then encourage long-term attention to efficiency, the officials reasoned. But they have lately been silent on the matter of a fuel tax, having had to cope with dissatisfaction from taxi drivers in particular over fuel price increases that have already occurred.
 The government-regulated retail price for gasoline in China has risen to $1.73 a gallon this month from $1.29 a gallon two years ago, an increase that has lagged behind the steep climb in global crude oil prices. 
 Many service stations in southeastern China ran out of gasoline and diesel fuel a week ago, shortages the government attributed to shipping disruptions resulting from a passing typhoon and a tropical storm. 
 But shipping executives said that the storms had no effect on deliveries by tankers. China's main refiner, Sinopec, has blamed hoarding for the shortages, as businesses and drivers keep an eye on oil prices and top up tanks now in anticipation that Chinese retail prices, adjusted only once a month, will rise next month.

HEADLINE: The Pain Begins at the Ticket Booth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Summer Fading, Hollywood Sees Fizzle'' (Arts pages, Aug. 24) does not mention the most glaring disincentive for moviegoers: the high cost of a ticket.
 On hot summer days, people were always game to spend $5 or $6 on even a middling studio effort. But with ticket prices exceeding $10, who wants to waste two hours on a dud? 
 Especially for parents, whose movie, popcorn and babysitter costs easily exceed $50, many better, inexpensive options abound.
 Surely, inflation doesn't account for the bulk of these ballooning costs. Can't Hollywood reverse the direction of ticket prices?

HEADLINE: For Merck, Global Legal Woes

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Patients worldwide who suffered heart attacks or strokes while taking the painkiller Vioxx are preparing to sue its maker, Merck, exponentially increasing the company's potential liability.
 Last week, a jury in Texas found Merck liable in the death of Robert C. Ernst and voted to award $253.5 million to his widow, Carol. Jurors said they concluded that Merck was long aware of Vioxx's potential heart risks but concealed them. 
About 4,000 lawsuits are pending in the United States, but there are potentially many more around the world, especially in Europe, where Vioxx, used to relieve the pain of arthritis, was extremely popular.
 Merck withdrew it last September, after a study showed a link between long-term use of the drug at high dosage and heart attack or stroke.
 In the Texas case, state rules on punitive damages would limit Mrs. Ernst's total award to $26.1 million, and that could be reduced further on appeal. Still, if other cases go against Merck, the litigation could collectively become the biggest medical product liability action in history, exceeding in scope and economic effect the thousands of lawsuits associated with silicone breast implants in the 1990's, which drove their American manufacturer, Dow Corning, to file for bankruptcy protection.
 Lawyers are collecting data on thousands of cases, trying to assess whether they should sue Merck in the United States, where rewards are expected to be higher, or in their home countries, where there are likely to be fewer legal hurdles.
 Christine Peckham, 52, an Englishwoman who had two strokes in 2001 while taking Vioxx, has already filed court papers in New Jersey.
 ''Merck has to be made accountable since they knew about this problem at least seven months before I had my first stroke,'' said Ms. Peckham, who is now legally blind and uses a wheelchair. ''I can't work again, and there's no reason why British taxpayers should cover my costs.''
 It is difficult to tally the exact numbers of suits being filed outside the United States. Lawyers are working on cases in Italy, France, Britain and Australia; in each of those countries, hundreds of thousands of people took Vioxx.
 Richard Meeran, special counsel with the law firm of Slater & Gordon in Australia, said the firm had at least 100 strong cases against Merck.
 But he expressed concern that huge verdicts in the United States might mean that clients abroad would not have time to pursue their claims effectively. 
 ''Our main concern,'' he said, ''is that Merck will run out of money, given the number of claimants and the size of the U.S. award.''
 After Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection in 1995, European women who contended that their silicone implants had ruptured and caused autoimmune diseases and other ailments received less money than Americans under a compensation plan established by a United States court.

Merck May Consider Some Settlements As Vioxx Lawsuits Rise, Executive Says
With the number of Vioxx-related lawsuits increasing, Merck may consider offering settlements to plaintiffs in a few cases, the company's general counsel, Kenneth C. Frazier, suggested. Merck had previously said that it planned to defend every personal-injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx, a painkiller and arthritis medicine that has been shown to raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes. But Mr. Frazier said that Merck would consider settling suits by people who took Vioxx for long periods of time and had few other risk factors for heart disease. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Democrats May Stress Schools but Can't Attack the Mayor 

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
From his earliest days in office, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has invited voters and political opponents to judge him on the issue of public education. ''I was hired to make the schools better,'' Mr. Bloomberg has said. ''Hold me responsible.''
 But in an election year that many expected to be dominated by debate over Mr. Bloomberg's handling of the schools, the Democratic contenders have been unable to use the issue of public education to their advantage.
 The consensus among political and education experts is that a sharp increase in reading and math scores for elementary school students this spring essentially neutralized the issue, even though the significance of the scores is far from clear. 
 ''The spike in fourth-grade test scores immunized the mayor against criticism from his opponents and has taken the education issue off the table,'' said the writer Diane Ravitch, a historian of the city school system who has expressed doubts about the scores.
 Rather than mounting a wide-ranging case against Mr. Bloomberg's efforts to transform the school system, the four Democrats have focused narrowly on proposals intended to highlight what they view as the mayor's chief failings on education. 
 Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, has seized on low graduation rates, saying his priority would be preventing dropouts. But his plan to pay for this and other education initiatives by taxing stock trades has been sharply criticized as antibusiness. 
 Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, has pledged to reduce class sizes. But he, too, has been criticized for wanting to pay for this with a tax surcharge on people who earn more than $500,000 a year, a plan state officials will almost certainly reject. 
 Neither raising graduation rates nor lowering class size is a novel proposal, and the other Democrats have not gone out on a limb, either. Representative Anthony D. Weiner has said he would crack down on students' bad behavior and raise teacher pay. C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, has promised better math and science instruction, wider vocational training and new specialized high schools. But she has offered scant details. 
 Even some supporters of Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, say they are disappointed by the lack of substantive discussion about the school system.
 ''There has been no effective public debate on the issue of where the schools were, where they are now and where they should be heading,'' said Merryl H. Tisch, a member of the State Board of Regents and a Democrat who backs Mr. Bloomberg. ''For a mayoralty that has staked its entire being on fixing the schools,'' Ms. Tisch said, ''it would seem to me that someone would want to talk about the schools.'' 
 The school-related issues that have bubbled to the surface in recent days have not been substantive. 
 Earlier this week, Mr. Ferrer's staff was forced to explain a joke press release -- a spoof portraying Mr. Bloomberg as a mock contestant in a recent student essay contest -- after the mayor's campaign said it made fun of the children who entered the contest. 
 In a debate, Mr. Miller, the Democrat who has focused his campaign most squarely on education, stumbled over the question of whether he would send his sons to public school.
 Although it seems likely that his boys will go to private school, Mr. Miller dodged, putting himself on the defensive even though none of the last three mayors sent their children to public school -- not Mr. Bloomberg, Rudolph W. Giuliani nor David N. Dinkins.
 Mr. Bloomberg can boast of having kept the biggest promise of his first campaign: He won control of the school system and essentially abolished the Board of Education. 
 ''Nobody even imagined that was possible,'' said Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of public policy at Hunter College. ''So what you have is different candidates trying to distinguish themselves from each other and distinguish themselves from the mayor. But they are basically seen as nipping at the mayor's heels. There is no grand vision because we have already had that change.'' 
 Should he win the nomination, Mr. Ferrer, in particular, will have to explain his opposition to mayoral control of the schools during the 2001 campaign. 
 Dr. Viteritti and other experts said that Mr. Bloomberg was vulnerable to criticism, but that voters were unlikely to be interested in a debate over the significance of test scores. 
 ''You can argue about the validity of the kinds of tests they are using, you can argue about the validity of the curricula they are using, you can ask are they focusing on middle schools enough,'' Mr. Viteritti said. ''These are all very legitimate things to hold the mayor accountable for, but they don't seem to be resonating in the campaign.'' 
 What has resonated? ''Test scores have moved,'' he said. ''And people like that.''
 The Democrats have done little to court Mr. Bloomberg's critics. Carmen Colon, the president of an association of the school district parent councils, said that Mr. Miller alone had offered help in battles with the Education Department. 
 In interviews, each Democrat expressed commitment to the schools. 
 Mr. Ferrer, whose wife, Aramina, has been principal of Public School 46 in the Bronx for 21 years, and Mr. Weiner, whose mother, Fran, was a city teacher for 31 years, seemed to grasp the challenges facing city educators more intuitively.
 Ms. Fields expressed the most concern for how parents and children were treated. And Mr. Miller described the schools as being of paramount importance to his campaign and the city's future. 
 On many points, the Democrats sound identical. 
 They all doubt the validity of this year's test scores, noting that scores rose statewide, not just in the city. Mr. Ferrer was perhaps most forceful on this. ''From the most experienced educators, there's no dancing in the streets,'' he said. ''They know what I know.'' 
 All pointed to lackluster eighth-grade reading scores as evidence that Mr. Bloomberg had neglected middle and high schools. All criticized the mayor's promotion rules, which threaten to hold back children with low scores. 
 All four have pledged to replace Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein, a lawyer by training, with a career educator. And all have faulted Mr. Bloomberg for not fighting harder to get the State Legislature to comply with a court order requiring an additional $5.6 billion a year for city schools. 
 Official statistics say only 54 percent of city students graduate from high school after four years, and some studies suggest the number is far lower. Mr. Ferrer has pledged to help 50,000 more students graduate during his first term. He has proposed a centralized student tracking system, smaller classes, higher teacher pay, expanded after-school programs and free laptop computers for students. 
 But he has not proposed specific academic programs -- such as intensive summer school or a ''bridge year'' between eighth and ninth grades -- to address the main reason students quit: the failure to earn course credits needed for promotion. 
 In a speech in June, Mr. Miller made perhaps the most comprehensive case against Mr. Bloomberg, criticizing virtually every aspect of his education record and deriding what the mayor called an ''era of hope'' in the schools as an ''era of hype.'' 
 If elected, Mr. Miller has promised to teach a class, once a week, in a city school. 
 While campaigning, however, he has mostly stressed a plan to reduce class sizes to 17 students in kindergarten to third grade, to 20 students in Grades 4 and 5, and to 23 students in middle school. He joined a coalition of parent and advocacy groups in supporting a ballot referendum that would earmark 25 percent of any new state money generated by the court order for reducing class sizes.
 The Bloomberg administration blocked the effort by placing other questions on this year's ballot. But so far Mr. Miller had been unable to paint the mayor as an opponent of smaller classes. 
 Of the candidates, only Mr. Weiner is a graduate of city public schools. 
 He has emphasized higher salaries and greater respect for educators, implicitly jabbing at Mr. Bloomberg's failure to build a rapport with the city's 85,000 teachers. To pay for the raises, he has proposed slashing ineffective city programs. And he said he would grant teachers more autonomy. ''Let teachers be creative,'' he said in an interview. ''Let them teach.'' 
 While this would normally win praise from the United Federation of Teachers, the union has stayed on the sidelines. It is in contract talks with the mayor and seems reluctant to anger him, given his strength in opinion polls. 
 On Tuesday, Ms. Fields laid out her education agenda promising to ''make our schools an instrument of our economic growth,'' but she offered a haphazard menu of ideas with few specifics. She advocated better vocational training, but made no mention of 18 existing vocational schools that serve 25,000 pupils. 
 She proposed better math and science instruction, and she proposed helping teachers find affordable housing but offered few details.
 Ms. Tisch, of the Board of Regents, said she was disappointed by the Democrats. ''Either they haven't done their homework,'' she said. ''Or they really just don't get the big picture.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Overshadow Modest Gain in Shares

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks managed modest gains yesterday as investors saw a series of corporate acquisitions as a chance to pick up bargains in an otherwise difficult market. Another record high for oil prices muted the gains.
 The $1.6 billion investment by General Electric in a Turkish bank and the takeover of York International by Johnson Controls assured investors that corporate America was still willing to spend money to expand, even in uncertain economic times.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,450.63. Broader stock indicators also closed slightly higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.78 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,212.37. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 5.46 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,134.37. 
 But oil again weighed on investors. Crude futures reached $68 a barrel overnight and settled at a record high for a second consecutive session -- feeding Wall Street's concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending and economic growth. A barrel of light crude settled at $67.49, up 17 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 ''Oil prices at these levels are providing all kinds of dislocation issues for stocks,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company. ''Earnings and the economic data are O.K., but with oil where it is, the market is unable to make a decision, long or short, and there's certainly no real catalyst for buying.''
 A drop in unemployment claims helped spur buying. The Labor Department reported that first-time unemployment claims dropped by 4,000, to 315,000, last week. It also reported that the four-week average of claims fell to its lowest level in four years.
 Yet oil remained a focus and some analysts wondered whether the markets could stage any kind of substantive rally with crude futures at record levels and the Federal Reserve undeterred in its policy of slow, steady interest rate increases.
 ''Oil is a huge concern, interest rates are a huge concern, and you have to be concerned about the two of them together,'' said Chris Johnson, manager of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. 
 While investors kept a wary eye on oil, G.E.'s purchase of a 25.5 percent share in Garanti Bank, Turkey's third-largest privately owned bank, was seen as a positive as the company expands its consumer finance business overseas. Rising oil prices pressured industrial stocks, however, and General Electric fell 4 cents, to $33.50.
 York International surged $15.04, to $56.79, after Johnson Controls announced a $2.4 billion, or $56.50 a share, cash buyout of the company, which would double Johnson's presence in building heating and air-conditioning markets. Johnson Controls climbed $2.76, to $59.53.
 Eastman Kodak said it would eliminate 900 jobs in Rochester and in China as it consolidates manufacturing of its color photographic paper. Its Rochester plant will close by October, the company said, and the total effort will result in a $173 million write-off. Kodak fell 4 cents, to $25.
 The amusement park operator Six Flags jumped 72 cents, to $7.26, after the company announced it would put itself up for sale. The company said it would invite a shareholder, Daniel Snyder, the millionaire Washington Redskins owner who has been critical of Six Flags' performance, to participate in an auction, though it said it would oppose Mr. Snyder's efforts to wage a proxy battle for more seats on the board.
 In earnings news, the luxury home builder Toll Brothers beat Wall Street's earnings forecasts by 8 cents a share in the third quarter, with profits doubling from a year ago as the demand for new homes continues apace. Toll Brothers fell $1.90, to $48.10.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, to 100 24/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.16 percent, from 4.17 percent Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Yes, He's Swiss, But Not Neutral

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Growing up in Switzerland, Josef Ackermann once dreamed of a career in politics. Now the chairman of Deutsche Bank, Mr. Ackermann has gotten his wish -- though hardly in the way a budding Swiss politico could have imagined.
 As the leader of Germany's flagship financial institution, Mr. Ackermann, 57, has found himself, and his bank, at the heart of a searing debate over the country's economic future. More often than not, Deutsche Bank is held up as an example of all that has gone wrong here.
But these days, three weeks before Germans go to the polls to elect a new government, Mr. Ackermann detects a change in the political wind. His weathervane is the mail he receives: many of the letters, he says, have shifted from hostile to favorable in the last few weeks. 
 ''Maybe we are in a grace period,'' Mr. Ackermann said in an interview here this week, reflecting on a turbulent year in which he has been lambasted for everything from his paycheck ($12 million in 2004) to his plans to lay off 6,400 employees at a time of rising joblessness.
 While Mr. Ackermann knows he is likely to remain a target for criticism of Anglo-American-style capitalism, he believes that there is growing support here for his drive to transform Deutsche Bank from a hidebound German institution into a globally competitive financial player.
 In many ways, he says, Deutsche Bank's struggle to remake itself mirrors that of Germany as a whole.
 ''People are more open to reforms now because they know things have to change,'' he said. ''They feel that if we don't change, we're going to lose, and no one likes to lose. Germans like to win.''
 Mr. Ackermann's sense that his views are becoming more mainstream also stems from polls that show voters appear ready to push out the Social Democratic government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder in favor of his conservative challenger, Angela Merkel.
 On Thursday, a German court affirmed Mr. Schroder's plan to hold elections on Sept. 18, a year ahead of schedule.
 A change in government could open the door to a radical overhaul of the economy, edging it toward more business-friendly policies, like lower taxes and less regulation of the labor market, which would make it easier for employers like Deutsche Bank to hire and fire.
 The bank has not waited for Berlin to act. Since Mr. Ackermann took over in 2002, it has shrunk its payroll to 63,000 from 90,000. The latest layoffs, which affect 1,900 jobs in Germany, were announced early this year, not long after Deutsche Bank's profits jumped 87 percent and the number of jobless people in Germany rose above five million.
 That prompted a firestorm of criticism, with some politicians calling on Germans to close their accounts at the bank. Franz Muntefering, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, described the layoffs as ''asocial.'' Party officials put Deutsche Bank's name on a list of locusts -- investors that it claimed were plundering the economy.
 To Mr. Ackermann, however, the cutbacks were necessary to make Deutsche Bank competitive with Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and other peers. He is not shy about saying that Germany's leaders should borrow from his playbook in preparing their country for the global economy.
 ''I hope that Deutsche Bank can prove that if you do certain things the way that modern companies are doing them, it could be a little bit of a role model for what can be done macroeconomically,'' he said.
 Already, there is evidence that German business is on the mend. Corporate profits are up as companies reap the benefit of relatively lower labor costs. The broader economy is recovering more slowly, though unemployment -- the bane of Mr. Schroder 's government -- may have peaked.
 Mr. Ackermann is not backing a party in the election; as a Swiss citizen, he notes, he is ineligible to vote. He also goes out of his way to praise Mr. Schroder for trying to shake up Germany's calcified labor market. The two speak regularly, he said, sometimes over a glass of Bordeaux.
 Still, his preference for a change is clear. Mr. Schroder, he said, is too hampered by the unions and other interest groups in his party to force through the kinds of changes that he believes Germany needs.
 ''Whatever the coalition will be, I hope it will be one which has the power to implement what is needed,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, within the existing coalition, he didn't have enough support.''
 Though there is debate about just how much of a reformer Mrs. Merkel would be, Mr. Ackermann likes the early signs. She recently named Paul Kirchhof, an academic known for his advocacy of a 25 percent flat tax, as her economic adviser and potential future finance minister.
 Mr. Ackermann is clearly comfortable with the choice: Mr. Kirchhof sits on Deutsche Bank's supervisory board. 
 Beyond the to-and-fro of party politics, Mr. Ackermann said Germany needed to rethink its concept of the social market economy. A credo of the post-World War II era, the social market economy seeks to balance the forces of the market with a commitment to social justice.
 In recent decades, Mr. Ackermann contends, that balance has tilted in favor of social protections over the market. This has strangled the country's competitiveness, he said, leaving it with high costs, an inflexible, immobile labor market, and a chronic high unemployment rate.
 With China and India emerging as economic rivals, and with the United States continuing to outpace Europe in growth, Mr. Ackermann said Germany had reached a point of reckoning.
 ''We have to turn the clock a little bit back, not giving up social elements, but putting more emphasis again on market forces,'' he said. ''The question is, How do you achieve that without losing the support of your people?''
 One might equally ask, What qualifies a Swiss investment banker to opine about the future of Germany?
 The answer is that the chief of Deutsche Bank has always wielded great political influence in Germany, owing to the bank's role as the primary lender to German industry. Deutsche Bank still owns sizable stakes in some of the nation's major companies, among them DaimlerChrysler, though the bank is now selling those positions.
 Moreover, far from shunning the spotlight, Mr. Ackermann has embraced his role as a kind of industrial statesman. Last June, he appeared before a studio audience in Berlin for a one-on-one interview with one of Germany's most prominent television journalists, Maybrit Illner.
 When Ms. Illner asked Mr. Ackermann, half in jest, whether it mattered to him who served as chancellor under him, he scarcely blinked, saying he got along well with both Mr. Schroder and Mrs. Merkel.
 Recalling the exchange, Mr. Ackermann said he relished the public stature that came with his position. ''I'm a little bit of a politician,'' he said with a smile as dazzling as Mr. Schroder 's. ''I always liked that.''
 There have been times, however, when the scrutiny has been merciless. Last year, Mr. Ackermann was put on trial on charges of defrauding shareholders of the telecommunications giant Mannesmann, when, as a board member, he awarded a lucrative severance package to its outgoing managers.
 On the opening day of the trial, he was roundly rebuked in the press for flashing a V-for-victory sign -- a gesture he says was an inside joke rather than a thumb in the eye of the legal system. Though he was acquitted last summer, he remains bitter at what he views as the ''strong political element'' in the prosecution. A German appeals court may yet order a new trial on the charges.
 For all this influence in Germany, Mr. Ackermann remains an outsider. He views that as a double-edged sword. 
 ''I have benefited from a cultural background,'' he said, ''which has shown me the strengths and weaknesses of the German situation clearer than probably someone who has grown up in the German context.''
 On the other hand, he added, ''you can be used as a scapegoat.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Will Leave No Road Map to His Successor

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan was at the height of his success as chairman of the Federal Reserve in November 1999: the economy was booming, inflation was negligible and people at all levels were becoming wealthier.
 But even as Mr. Greenspan was being celebrated as the economy's ''maestro,'' he sounded far less omniscient behind closed doors.
''We really do not know how this system works,'' he told members of the Fed's policy-making committee in Washington, according to transcripts released earlier this year. ''It's clearly new. The old models just are not working.'' 
 Now, as he nears the end of his 18-year tenure in the job, Mr. Greenspan is leaving a brilliant record but a murky legacy.
 Despite numerous economic shocks and financial excesses, unemployment and inflation are both lower now than many economists considered possible when Mr. Greenspan took office in 1987. But whoever moves into his spacious office on Constitution Avenue early next year faces a near-impossible task in replicating Mr. Greenspan's success in managing monetary policy.
 That is because Mr. Greenspan abhorred rules, was skeptical about economic models and jettisoned practices that were enshrined by the likes of Paul A. Volcker, his predecessor, and Milton Friedman, a winner of the Nobel in economic science. If Mr. Greenspan stood for anything, it was flexibility and the freedom from dogma.
 ''The Greenspan standard has for the most part meant what Greenspan wanted to do,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 Mr. Blinder will be one of many economists at a Federal Reserve symposium beginning here Friday that will be devoted to discussions about the ''post-Greenspan era.'' Before that, however, the gathering will open with what is expected to be Mr. Greenspan's swan song speech as chairman of the Fed.
 Mr. Greenspan, whose term as a Fed governor expires in January and cannot be renewed, is thought likely to devote his speech to the lessons he learned running the central bank longer than all but one of his predecessors, William McChesney Martin Jr. Expected to be listening particularly closely at the conference are three of the leading candidates to succeed him: Ben S. Bernanke, President Bush's chief economic adviser; Martin S. Feldstein, an economist at Harvard; and R. Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University. 
 But for all his triumphs, Mr. Greenspan also presided over a stock market bubble that burst and, in helping minimize the damage from that fiasco, laid the groundwork for the housing boom -- and potential bust -- that followed.
 Moreover, the United States has run up heavy foreign debt partly because the Federal Reserve drove interest rates so low that Americans borrowed more and saved less.
 Mr. Greenspan's approach to such challenges was to roll with the punches, basing his management of the economy on a refusal to believe in firm rules, doctrines or models.
 ''A surprising problem is that a number of economists are not able to distinguish between the economic models we construct and the real world,'' he remarked back in 1984, when he was still head of a private consulting firm.
 As Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan has celebrated the hunt for ''anomalies'' or trends that seemed to defy what the models predict. He had little faith in widely accepted concepts like the ''natural rate'' of unemployment, which many economists long believed to be about 6 percent.
 He jettisoned the practice of basing policy on growth in the money supply, a concept enshrined by Mr. Friedman as the best way to prevent inflation.
 And though he has cultivated the reputation of a hard-liner on reducing inflation, Mr. Greenspan has often put more emphasis on driving up employment.
 At 78, his hair is thinning and his gait is becoming stiffer. But he may be as famous as any pop star; he is certainly a larger-than-life figure for political leaders and economists. At a hearing in July before the House Financial Services Committee, lawmakers from both parties showered him with so much praise that they began running out of accolades.
 ''All the adjectives have been used up,'' complained Representative Steve Pearce, Republican of New Mexico, who then declared that Mr. Greenspan was a ''handsome man.''
 By almost all accounts, Mr. Greenspan has been an exceptionally successful steward for the economy. In the last 18 years, the nation has endured only two recessions, one of them quite mild. There were four downturns in the previous 18 years.
 The core rate of inflation has edged down to about 2 percent from 4 percent when he took office. Unemployment has averaged 5.5 percent over the last 18 years, compared with nearly 7 percent in the previous 18 years, and it is now down to about 5 percent.
 Mr. Blinder, a Democrat who battled with Mr. Greenspan over the Fed's communication policy, said his former boss might well be the best central banker who ever lived.
 Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics, pointed to one reason Mr. Greenspan was so willing to rely on his gut instincts. ''He didn't go to one of the top schools: Harvard or M.I.T. or Stanford or Northwestern,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''I think that was an advantage. He didn't get brainwashed into one of the doctrines.''
 A devout believer in free markets and at one time a disciple of Ayn Rand, the libertarian philosopher, Mr. Greenspan -- who studied at New York University -- served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Gerald R. Ford. As head of Townsend-Greenspan, the forecasting firm he ran both before and after his White House years, Mr. Greenspan made his reputation by poring through vast amounts of industry data to tease out economic trends.
 Named by President Ronald Reagan to succeed Mr. Volcker as Fed chairman in 1987, Mr. Greenspan brought both his passion for detail and a cool head for crises.
 The first crisis arrived barely two months after he arrived when the stock market crashed more than 500 points on Oct. 19, 1987.
 Mr. Greenspan, initially mistrusted as a weak successor to the iron-willed Mr. Volcker, quickly soothed the economy by assuring banks that the Fed would provide enough money to keep financial markets functioning. With the Fed offering money to all takers, interest rates edged down, markets recovered and the crash turned out to be little more than a pause in the bull market.
 Years later, Mr. Greenspan said one of his proudest achievements was the fact that he had been able to sleep the night after Black Monday.
 But Mr. Greenspan gradually ushered in a host of more enduring changes at the Fed. With memories of the 1970's era of soaring prices still strong, he initiated ''pre-emptive'' changes in interest rates to head off inflation before it actually arrived, calling the practice ''leaning against the wind.''
 By relentlessly raising interest rates in 1989, the Fed contributed to an unexpectedly sharp economic downturn that played a major role in the election defeat of the first President Bush in 1992. The second attempt, a sharp rise in rates in 1994 and 1995, went more smoothly: inflation remained low, the economy cooled briefly and then began its biggest growth spurt in decades.
 Many economists say Mr. Greenspan's signal triumph was being among the first to recognize that starting in the mid-1990's, the United States had entered a sustained period of faster productivity growth. The increase had profound implications, because it meant that the economy could grow faster and unemployment could fall lower than had ever seemed possible without fueling inflation.
 The productivity shift was not apparent in official government statistics, and Mr. Greenspan found himself bucking his own staff economists as well as Fed governors like Janet Yellen and Laurence H. Meyer.
 At the time, most economists assumed inflation would heat up once unemployment dipped below 5.5 percent. But Mr. Greenspan, convinced that investments in computers and information technology were finally paying off in faster productivity, was content to let unemployment sink to less than 4 percent. ''He was confident in his judgment and he was right,'' Mr. Blinder said. ''The lesson is that sometimes you can't wait for the data to be definitive.''
 Some economists point to an even broader legacy for future Fed policy. Before Mr. Greenspan took over, they note, policy makers focused almost entirely on changes in demand as the determinant of inflation. The surge in productivity showed that changes on the economy's supply side could be equally, if not more, important.
 Critics of Mr. Greenspan contend that he has relied too heavily on his own judgment and not enough on consistent principles.
 ''We've moved further away from a rules-based system,'' said Brian S. Wesbury, chief investment strategist at Claymore Advisers. ''We have a Greenspan standard, but we don't have any kind of a Fed standard.''
 If the Fed had adopted an explicit numerical inflation target -- something that many other central banks use but that Mr. Greenspan has rejected as too restrictive -- Mr. Wesbury contended that the Fed might have avoided much of the volatility since 2000.
 With little inflation in sight, the Fed might have raised interest rates less than it did in 1999, which might have softened the downturn that followed. That in turn might have made the Fed less eager to drive down rates when the stock market fell sharply in 2000, causing less of a potential bubble in housing prices today.
 Other analysts contend that Mr. Greenspan's judgment has generally been correct, but that the Fed cannot afford to rely on the individual judgment of future chairmen.
 ''If you are Alan Greenspan, it's hard to make a rule that would do any better,'' said Allen H. Meltzer, professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and author of a history of the Fed. ''On the other hand, we have had 12 chairmen at the Federal Reserve since 1913, and some of them have made massive blunders.''
 Mr. Greenspan remains convinced that the economy is simply too complex and fast moving to be subject to a single policy rule or predictable with any single economic model. If he has one consistent message, it is that nothing is permanent.
 While many economists warn that the United States has become dangerously loaded up with foreign debt, Mr. Greenspan has argued that the globalization of finance and other changes may have created a global ''savings glut'' that allows the United States to borrow much more than would have been possible 20 years ago.
 His alternative to firm rules is ''risk management,'' a strategy of making policy based on a range of possible outcomes. The clearest example came in 2003, when the Fed worried about the slim possibility of a broad deflation, a downward spiral in consumer prices.
 Though Fed officials viewed deflation as highly unlikely, they figured the damage would be heavy if it did occur. Mr. Greenspan cut short-term rates to 1 percent in 2003, then promised to keep them at that level for a ''considerable period'' that turned out to be a year.
 The biggest risk for his successor could turn out to be a collapse in housing prices after the frenetic run-up that has resulted in part from the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates so low. But another key principle of the Greenspan Fed, which most experts have come to accept, is that the central bank should focus on economic fundamentals and not try to prematurely pop a market bubble in stock prices or real estate prices.
 After the stock market bubble burst in 2000, Mr. Greenspan argued that the Fed would have made a mistake if it had tried to curb speculation by raising interest rates or making it harder for investors to buy stock with borrowed money.
 It was better, he argued, to fix things afterward by cutting interest rates. With evidence of speculative excess in many housing markets, Mr. Greenspan is now warning that investors may be overconfident that interest rates will stay low and that housing prices will continue to soar.
 But if housing prices do turn out to be a bubble that bursts, trapping homeowners who used exotic new mortgages to borrow far more than was once allowed, Mr. Greenspan will no longer be around to take the blame -- or clean up the mess.

HEADLINE: '63 Tapes Reveal Kennedy and Aides Discussed Using Nuclear Arms in a China-India Clash 

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: MUMBAI, India, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
In May 1963, President John F. Kennedy and his aides discussed the feasibility of using nuclear weapons in the event China attacked India for a second time, according to newly declassified audio recordings that were released Thursday by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.
 Over the crackle of the decades-old tapes, President Kennedy and his advisers can be heard discussing how to prevent India from becoming, in the popular idiom of the day, another domino to fall to Communism.
 On the tapes, Robert S. McNamara, who was President Kennedy's defense secretary, is heard to say: ''Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given, we should recognize that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack, we would have to use nuclear weapons. Any large Chinese Communist attack on any part of that area would require the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S., and this is to be preferred over the introduction of large numbers of U.S. soldiers.'' 
 Mr. McNamara said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he could not remember the conversation, ''but it is probably correct.''
 Minutes later, after hearing from Mr. McNamara and two other advisers, President Kennedy says, ''We should defend India, and therefore we will defend India'' if attacked. It is not clear from the tapes whether Mr. Kennedy was speaking of using nuclear weapons or of defending India in more conventional terms.
 ''The context is that Kennedy was very, very pro-India,'' said Stephen P. Cohen, a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington and an expert on India, Pakistan and South Asian security.
 ''He saw India as a natural balance to China,'' Mr. Cohen said of Mr. Kennedy. ''That was not true of his advisers. My guess is that they didn't want to see American ground troops get involved in a war.''
 Mr. Cohen recalled the political climate of the time and suggested that Mr. Kennedy's aides might have had another motive for bringing up the possible use of nuclear weapons. ''We were tied up in Korea; we were worried about the Russians,'' he said. ''And, conceivably, they said 'nuclear' because they didn't want him to do anything for India; that this was a way of raising the stakes so high as to make it not an option.''
 Indian analysts said they were stunned by the disclosure of the tapes.
 ''I do not recollect in the public domain such an explicit commitment to nuke China,'' said C. Uday Bhaskar, a commodore in the Indian Navy who heads a research organization in New Delhi financed by the Indian Defense Ministry. ''I'm sure it will have antennae up in China.''
 Analysts of South Asian affairs said they saw parallels to questions that confront the United States and Asia's two most populous countries, which still maintain their own mixture of competition and cooperation.
 ''Obviously, there are resonances between 1963 and 2005,'' said Sugata Bose, a professor of South Asian history at Harvard University. ''How to contain China is the common thread.''
 In 1963, the United States believed that China might have ''expansionist designs,'' Mr. Bose said in a telephone interview from Calcutta, while in 2005 ''the United States knows the Chinese leadership is consciously pragmatic and is eager to avoid the perception of being expansionist.''
 At the same time, Mr. Bose said, ''The reality is that China is a much stronger power today, because the economic dimension has been added to the military and strategic one.''
 The deliberations in May 1963 are especially striking in light of their timing. They came just seven months after two events that shook geopolitics: the Cuban missile crisis and an invasion of India by China, which sought to acquire disputed border territories.
 On one stretch of the tape, Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is heard telling Mr. Kennedy: ''This is just one spectacular aspect of the overall problem of how to cope with Red China politically and militarily in the next decade. I would hate to think that we would fight this on the ground in a non-nuclear way.''
 Also on the tapes, Dean Rusk, Mr. Kennedy's secretary of state, counsels that the use of nuclear weapons would have to have support from America's allies.
 ''I think we would be hard pressed to tell our own people why we are doing this with India when even the British won't do it or the Australians won't do it and the Canadians won't do it,'' Mr. Rusk says. ''We need to have those other flags flying on these joint enterprises.''
 George W. Ball, then an under secretary of state, warned Mr. Kennedy that the use of nuclear weapons against China could create a perception of American hostility toward East Asians.
 ''If there is a general appearance of a shift in strategy to the dependence on a nuclear defense against the Chinese in the Far East, we are going to inject into this whole world opinion the old bugaboo of being willing to use nuclear weapons against Asians,'' Mr. Ball says.
 Analysts pointed out that the so-called nuclear option, even if it was considered in the spring of 1963, would have been dismissed the following year, when China first tested its own nuclear weapon.

HEADLINE: Avast! Pirates Steal Hearts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
It was a strange day in Hollywood when someone decided that a costume drama based on an amusement park ride would sell lots of tickets. Stranger still was Johnny Depp's swishy performance in ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,'' which, inexplicably, translated into a cascade of doubloons at the box office. A pile of gold, an ancient curse and lots of swordplay, it seems, can still do the trick, 70 years after Errol Flynn slashed his way through ''Captain Blood.'' Mr. Depp, greatly enriched by his high crimes on the high seas, has agreed to reappear as Jack Sparrow in two ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' sequels. 
 Hollywood is not alone in its lust for pirate gold. Readers have been served a double helping of pirate books in the last couple of months, for reasons that defy analysis. The cowboy and the gangster, twin pillars of America's self-image, continue to inspire screenwriters and novelists, although the cowboy, these days, seems to be limping as badly as Walter Brennan. But what can explain the allure of pirates? Their role in American history was negligible. As a shaping force in the national culture, they barely exist. Nevertheless, nearly 200 years after the last pirates gave up the trade, readers still hanker, like Jim Hawkins in ''Treasure Island,'' for stories about ''hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main.''
One reason for the perennial appeal of the pirate may be the sheer variety of pirate types, reflected in the wildly different performances of Mr. Depp and his nemesis, played by Geoffrey Rush, or the drastically different pirates who, in their own ways, defined pirateness for the baby-boom generation. Cyril Ritchard, in the 1960 television production of ''Peter Pan,'' played Captain Hook as a Restoration fop with curled wig, yards of lace and a beauty patch. Robert Newton, as Long John Silver in the Disney version of ''Treasure Island,'' virtually created the downscale pirate captain, with a parrot on one shoulder, a broad pseudo-Cornish accent and a vocabulary that leaned heavily on a single, highly expressive monosyllable: arrr.
 ''Arrr'' may be pure fiction, but pirates did come in many varieties, as the English historian Peter Earle makes clear in ''The Pirate Wars.'' His highly entertaining survey of piracy begins with the Elizabethan era of Sir Francis Drake and moves, quite rapidly, to the Barbary pirates of North Africa, whose raids in the Mediterranean did not end until the 1830's. 
 Each era had its own brand of pirate and its own definition of piracy. The English pirates of the 16th century seized enemy ships with royal permission. They were, Mr. Earle writes, ''the illegal but often much admired fighting extension of militant Protestant English expansion and not yet 'real' pirates.'' Like their Spanish and Dutch counterparts, they carried out foreign policy, amassing great fortunes when they succeeded. In time, and especially after peace treaties threw many a crew out of work, privateers turned into pirates, attacking any ship that sailed. Often, their activities were supported by powerful nobles in coastal towns. These shady grandees helped bankroll pirate voyages and reaped a healthy percentage of the profit when the booty was unloaded and sold. 
 Early on, in the Jacobean period, pirate society was rigidly hierarchical and class-ridden, with poorly rewarded common seamen laboring under well-born officers who took home most of the prizes. Gradually, however, piracy became egalitarian. Captains ruled only so long as they enjoyed the support of their men, and prizes were shared equally. Here lies another clue to the popularity of pirates: the seductive picture of a band of outlaws, free as the wind and governed by their own democratic rules in a world of kings and princes. 
 Mr. Earle points out, however, that the ''Treasure Island'' brand of pirate existed in a specific time (the 1650's to the 1720's) and a specific place, in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. These pirates, he writes, ''were indeed virtually the only pirates in history to exhibit those characteristics which we expect 'real' pirates to have.'' 
 ''The Pirate Wars'' sheds light on many of those characteristics. The black flag, we learn, was first observed flying over the ship of Emanuel Wynn in 1700, but not all pirate ships adopted the color, although many did decorate their flags with skulls, crossbones, hourglasses, bleeding hearts and other symbols of impending death. Walking the plank, far from being standard practice, did not make an appearance until the 1820's, an invention of Cuban pirates. Mr. Earle makes no mention of parrots, peg legs or hooks. 
 Legendary pirates like Blackbeard, Henry Morgan and Jean Lafitte were pests, but the nameless Barbary pirates constituted a real threat to the United States in the early 19th century. Frank Lambert, in ''The Barbary Wars,'' gives a concise overview of the centuries-long depredations of the state-sponsored pirates of Algiers, Tunis, Morocco and Tripoli, who not only seized ships but enslaved their crews. (It was the so-called Sallee Rovers, or pirates operating from Sale in Morocco, who put Robinson Crusoe on his island.) 
 For the petty states of North Africa, piracy was purely business. Their economies depended on it. If they could have acted in concert, the European powers could have eliminated the threat, but mutually suspicious, they preferred to buy off assorted pashas and beys, hoping to buy immunity and steer the pirates in the direction of their competitors. 
 The United States, once independent, lost the protection afforded by Britain's treaty with the Barbary states, and when an American ship was seized in Tripoli harbor in 1805 and its crew enslaved, Thomas Jefferson faced an international crisis. The first American troops were sent abroad, in a wild expedition described by Richard Zacks in ''The Pirate Coast.'' 
 The hero of Mr. Zacks's tale is William Eaton, a military officer turned ambassador, and, spiritually, more than a bit of a pirate himself. For years, Eaton chafed at the attacks on American merchant ships, and the craven European response to piracy in the Mediterranean. On first arriving in North Africa, he sent a smoking letter home to America railing against the dey of Algiers. ''Can any man believe that this elevated brute has seven kings of Europe, two republics and a continent tributary to him, when his whole naval force is not equal to two line of battle ships?'' he fumed.
 Eaton's response to the Tripoli crisis was to organize an armed force, including eight marines, and set off across hundreds of miles of desert. His intent was to topple the pasha of Tripoli and replace him with his deposed brother, who had agreed to a no-tribute policy toward America. He nearly succeeded, before wishy-washy diplomats struck a deal with the pasha and paid him off.
 Eaton's derring-do, against all odds, makes for a stirring tale whose only legacy has been the ''shores of Tripoli'' reference in the Marine Corps Hymn. That may change. Until war in the Middle East put the project on hold, Ridley Scott was set to film Eaton's mad campaign, with Russell Crowe in the starring role. 
 The Barbary pirates were not the only ones to take an unsentimental, businesslike approach to the job. The Lafitte brothers, too, seem curiously modern in their temperament, at least as described in ''The Pirates Lafitte,'' William C. Davis's meticulously researched history of the two brothers, Jean and Pierre, whose legend is far more romantic than their actual deeds. 
 The Lafittes, who made their way from Bordeaux to Louisiana after the French Revolution, struggled as merchants but prospered as illegal slave traders and traffickers in stolen goods. Buried treasure, blood oaths and the black spot played no role in their activities. Expert in the art of evasion and concealment, they set up a black market in the swamps and islands near New Orleans and, after the War of 1812, on Galveston Island. 
 The Lafittes seem much more like slick operators than buccaneers. Perhaps their smoothest bit of deception was convincing Andrew Jackson to finagle a pardon for them and their pirate brethren as a condition for fighting on the American side when the British closed in on New Orleans in December 1814. The Lafittes did a brilliant job of overselling their potential contribution, which amounted to very little. American victory brought the promised pardon, and the Lafittes, who were finding New Orleans less welcoming day by day, shifted their operations elsewhere and continued to ply their trade. 
 All the color missing from the Lafittes can be found in ''Pirattitude!,'' a helpful guide for those who wish to adopt the pirate lifestyle. The book traces its origins to International Talk Like a Pirate Day, a stunt dreamed up by the authors, John Baur and Mark Summers, who prefer to be known as ''Ol' Chumbucket'' and ''Cap'n Slappy.'' If those nicknames strike you as hilarious, ''Pirattitude!' should be a nonstop yuckfest. 
 First step: mastering the five A's. These are the building blocks of piratese, and they are, apparently in reverse order of importance, avast, ahoy, aye, aye-aye, and the amazingly flexible arrr, which, the authors claim, can mean, among many other things, ''Yes,'' ''I agree,'' ''I'm happy,'' ''I'm enjoying this beer,'' ''My team is winning'' or ''My team is losing'' and ''I am here and alive.''
 Having absorbed the five A's, students can move along to the very useful mix-and-match guide to formulating pirate curses. By selecting an adjective from column A and affixing it to a noun from column B, the apprentice pirate can coin such terms of abuse as ''barnacle-bottomed bilge monkey.'' Slappy and Chumbucket may be on to something here, another clue to the perennial appeal of the pirate. Unlike the tight-lipped tough guys and monosyllabic cowboys who let their guns do the talking, pirates, once they get past arrr, exploit the resources of the English language. Even their parrots have colorful vocabularies. 
 Pirate blood runs strong. Morgan Cooke, the docile accountant at the center of Keith Thomson's comic novel ''Pirates of Pensacola,'' discovers it running through his veins when he's reunited with his father, a direct descendant of the infamous Henry Morgan. In no time, he's battling bad guys like Emildeau and Faldeau Lafitte, descendants of guess who, and chasing after buried treasure. 
 Alex Hawke, the hero of Ted Bell's thriller ''Pirate,'' can also trace his ancestry to pirate royalty, the mythical Blackhawke. British and very Bondlike, Hawke lends his considerable talents to his own government and to the United States, as need requires. He was, the author writes, ''rather like one of those 18th-century scoundrels from whom he was directly descended, adventurers who plundered ship and shore in the name of the king.'' 
 Hawke needs every bit of pirate DNA in his system. The Chinese are in cahoots with the French, now ruled by Luca Bonaparte, a radical leftist descendant of Napoleon who has wrested control of the state by having a gay Chinese assassin murder the French prime minister and president. Germany is up to its neck in this too, as well as the Mafia. Hawke has his hands full, as will readers, who will find that, at more than 500 pages, ''Pirate'' has one virtue: it will last for the full length of a flight from New York to Los Angeles. 
 Marlon Brando, too, fell under the spell of the pirate life. With a film in mind, he collaborated with the British director Donald Cammell on ''Fan-Tan,'' a blowsy, overheated novel set in 1920's Hong Kong. It's a vanity production, in which a Brando-like figure stumbles aimlessly, speaking a strangely contemporary language, as he embarks on a search for plunder in the China Sea and has exotic ''Last Tango'' sex with a dragon lady straight out of Charlie Chan. There is no buried treasure, but pearls find a very unusual hiding place. Like many of Brando's later roles, ''Fan-Tan'' dwells in a strange land beyond the reach of criticism. There's only one possible reaction.
 Arrr.

HEADLINE: Big at Home, but Not Much Heft Globally

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
His job title alone makes Josef Ackermann an imposing figure in German industry and politics. But when Mr. Ackermann travels to New York or London, he must grapple with the reality that Deutsche Bank remains a bantam among global heavyweights like Citigroup or HSBC. 
 Ranked by sales and assets, Deutsche Bank sits comfortably among the world's 10 largest banks. But with a market capitalization of $47.8 billion, it ranks 28th, behind Societe Generale of France.
That is a crucial weakness, because in a consolidating industry, market value gives banks a currency to use to finance acquisitions -- allowing ambitious ones to keep pace with hungry giants like Citigroup.
 ''To be a world-class player, they need a market cap of at least $70 billion,'' said Stuart Graham, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch in London who has a neutral rating on the bank's shares.
 Much of Mr. Ackermann's strategy has been aimed at lifting Deutsche Bank's market value. He is likely to achieve another goal, a 25 percent pretax return on equity. But Mr. Ackermann used to talk a lot about vaulting into the Top 10. These days, he is playing it down.
 ''We don't want to jeopardize our creation of shareholder value in order to have a larger market cap,'' he said.
 The shift in emphasis, while subtle, is important. Analysts say Mr. Ackermann may recognize that it would be hard to double Deutsche Bank's value without a blockbuster deal. And it is hard to see such a deal on the horizon, given the political obstacles that he faces.
 Merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Citigroup in 2003 went nowhere because the two could not conceive a combination in which Citigroup would not end up swallowing Deutsche Bank.
 ''Would we do a transforming transaction yet? No,'' he said. ''It's very difficult to find a partner which adds value.''
 But that does not mean Deutsche Bank is treading water. Mr. Ackermann said he was open to buying banks in emerging economies. He is currently negotiating to buy a stake in a Chinese bank, Huaxia, which could be a platform for a major push into China.
 Mr. Ackermann is also careful not to rule anything out. The recent acquisition of Germany's second-largest bank, HVB Group, by UniCredit of Italy has strengthened his hand, he said, by forcing politicians to recognize that the independence of even their big banks cannot be taken for granted.
 The politicians ''didn't do their homework,'' he said. ''I say, 'Let us do the homework, and we will be successful out of Germany.''' MARK LANDLER

HEADLINE: Demand for Oil Insight Is Spiking, Too

BYLINE: By ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
A prophet has no honor in his own country, but that is no longer the case with oil analysts, who have received unusual attention in recent months as the price of crude makes a spiraling ascent to new highs. 
 ''This all goes in cycles,'' said Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil consulting firm, and the author of ''The Prize,'' a history of oil and international politics. ''With oil at almost $70, the interest is intense and emotional and keeps coming from every direction.''
That intensity was evident in late March, when Arjun N. Murti, a Goldman Sachs analyst, issued a report that said the oil market had entered the early stages of a ''superspike'' period of strong demand and tight supplies that could drive prices as high as $105 a barrel. (At the time, oil was about $54 a barrel; $105 would exceed by far the inflation-adjusted record of $86 a barrel, set in early 1981.) 
 Mr. Murti's prediction roiled the market. 
 An elder statesman among oil analysts, Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Company, has seen oil analysts' stars rise and fall before in his 19-year career.
 ''Like anything else in life, it's supply and demand,'' he said of his recent popularity. ''When you're in demand, you're really in demand. If oil was at $10, do you think you'd be sitting across from me? No broker or trader would even answer my calls.''
 Lately, however, ''it's been incredibly hectic,'' said Mr. Gheit (pronounced gate) during an interview in his corner office in Lower Manhattan overlooking the Statue of Liberty. 
 While Wall Street is typically sleepy in August, with the stock and bond markets in the doldrums, the oil market has been on a tear. The most active contract for crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange has risen 11 percent so far this month. As a result, Mr. Gheit, 59, has been busier than ever, trekking uptown to advise Oppenheimer's sales force, spending time with major institutional clients and appearing on news programs. 
 Mr. Gheit, who has a degree in chemical engineering and worked for Mobil before leaving for Wall Street in 1986, covers 26 energy companies. At the beginning of the year, he recommended that investors buy shares in all of them: from major integrated oil companies like Exxon Mobil to refiners like Tesoro and independents like Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. The stocks on his list have gained 45.5 percent so far this year.
 ''Most other analysts can do only one or two things well,'' said Michael Hoover, manager of the Excelsior Energy and Natural Resources Fund, an Oppenheimer client. ''Fadel has all the important perspectives -- modeling, calculating reserves and having sources in politics.''
 Mr. Gheit, a native of Egypt, said that ''there are better stock pickers, but I think I know what goes on in the hearts and minds of people'' in the oil-producing Middle East.
 In that respect, Mr. Gheit is a bull on oil and a bear when it comes to American foreign policy, which he contends has added more than $10 to current crude oil prices.
 ''Politics is above my pay grade,'' he said, ''but the Iraq war has been a fiasco. It has disappointment written all over it, especially from the oil standpoint.''
 He says the Bush administration has failed to secure the country in a way that would attract badly needed foreign investment and expertise to its corroding oil infrastructure. ''Iraq,'' he said, ''should be producing triple what it is now.''
 What is worse, he added, is all the ill will the Iraq campaign has engendered across the Middle East. He worries that the crucial Ras Tanura refinery, the nerve center of Saudi Arabia's oil industry, may be in the cross hairs of terrorists -- a target that, if successfully attacked, could cause oil prices to double in a matter of hours.
 ''We are not insulated from the rest of the world, like it or not,'' Mr. Gheit added.
 He predicted that high demand and low spare capacity will have oil prices continue to hit higher highs and lower lows and in the process convince more investors that energy stocks no longer deserve their boom-and-bust trading discounts. 
 As for that famous Goldman ''superspike'' forecast, Mr. Gheit said: ''It was cute, he said $105. Give the guy credit, but that's like saying that the snow will fall at exactly 6:31.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 2005

HEADLINE: In Atlantic City, Missing Miss America, but Moving On

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLL

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Everyone here, it seems, has a Miss America story -- though for many on Friday their stories were more like eulogies. 
 On Thursday, the Miss America Organization announced that the pageant would leave Atlantic City, its home for the last 84 years, and seek a new location for a show that has suffered from lack of interest and low television ratings in recent years.
''It will be so strange next month when pageant time rolls around and there won't be a parade, the gowns, the excitement,'' said Becky Waters, 29, of Atlantic City. For the past 20 years, she and her grandmother have attended the annual shoe parade on the boardwalk, in which the contestants ride by in convertibles showing off shoes they have decorated themselves. She is sad, she said, that ''I won't be able to share the experience with my daughter.'' 
 Down the street from Boardwalk Hall, where the pageant took place, at the White House Sub Shop, locals sat under photographs of dozens of Miss Americas who have passed through the sub shop since the 1940's.
 ''It's the end of a tradition, and I'm not sure the news has really sunk in for us,'' said Joann Gallagher, a waitress who has met and had her picture taken with many of the beauty queens during her 28 years at the restaurant.
 Joe Walters, 36, was eating a sandwich and remembering fondly when, in 1992, he chauffeured the winner, Carolyn Sapp of Hawaii, for several days. 
 He said that one night, when Ms. Sapp had the next day off, they went dancing at several clubs in the area. ''My fiancee wasn't too happy about me going out dancing with Miss America,'' Mr. Walters said. ''But, my friends were so jealous and mad that I didn't call them to come out with us. It's a great story to tell.''
 Jeffrey Vasser, the executive director of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority, said he and other city officials had ''heavy hearts'' on Friday because of the ''emotional impact'' of the pageant's decision to move on. But from an economic standpoint, he said, the city would survive and almost certainly thrive.
 ''She is family, a part of the Atlantic City history, but she doesn't necessarily define the city anymore,'' Mr. Vasser said of the pageant. The bureau is promoting the city as an ''entertainment destination.'' And, he said, ''the pageant was, frankly, cutting into some other events.''
 The pageant occupies four weeks of the city's time during its peak season, mid-August through mid-September, Mr. Vasser said. The casinos regularly donate rooms and suites to contestants and their entourages that would otherwise go to high-rolling customers. Scores of residents and emergency workers volunteer their time, and the city has also been paying $720,000 annually to the pageant to offset its costs.
 ''We will miss it, but we have new things to focus on,'' said Mr. Vasser, who has his own Miss America story.
 His mother, Marilyn Ross, was crowned Miss Atlantic City in 1954 and was the host of that year's Miss America pageant, the first year it was televised. She then passed the baton to perhaps the show's most famous host, Bert Parks, who held the job for more than 25 years. 
 Officials have not said where they will move the pageant, though Jenni Glenn, a spokeswoman for the organization, said several cities had expressed interest in sponsoring the pageant in January.
 At the Sheraton Hotel, which displays Miss America memorabilia, from gowns and crowns to shoes and scepters, Marge Nowmos, 59, of Bensalem, Pa., spent several minutes looking at the items. 
 ''The city and the pageant have always been together,'' she said. ''I'm not sure it will feel right having it someplace else.''

HEADLINE: Denver Airport Saw the Future. It Didn't Work.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Ten years ago, the new Denver International Airport marched boldly into the future with a computerized baggage-handling system that immediately became famous for its ability to mangle or misplace a good portion of everything that wandered into its path.
 Now the book is closing on the brilliant machine that couldn't sort straight. Sometime over the next few weeks, in an anticlimactic moment marked and mourned by just about nobody, the only airline that ever used any part of the system will pull the plug. An episode bowing equally to John Henry, Rube Goldberg and Hal from ''2001'' will end.
People will be fully back in charge. 
 ''Automation always looks good on paper,'' said Veronica Stevenson, a lead baggage handler for United Airlines and president of the union local that represents United's 1,300 or so baggage handlers in Denver. ''Sometimes you need real people.''
 The handoff in baggage handling also illustrates how much has changed in airline economics since Denver's grandiose dream was envisioned in the early 1990's. Airlines that were flush then are struggling and looking for ways to save money now, as United will do by shutting down computerized baggage-moving.
 Technology, too, has brought change. Back then, the big-brained mainframe doing it all from command central was the model of high tech. Today the very idea of it sounds like a cold-war-era relic, engineers say. Decentralization and mobile computing technology have taken over just about everything, allowing airlines, warehouse operators and shippers like FedEx to learn with just a few clicks the whereabouts of an item in motion, a feature that was supposed to be a chief strength of the baggage system.
 The premise of Denver's plan was as big as the West. The distance from a centralized baggage check-in to the farthest gate -- about a mile -- dictated expansive new thinking, planners said, and technology would make the new airport a marvel. Travelers who arrived for check-in or stepped off a plane would have their bags whisked across the airport with minimal human intervention. The result would be fewer flight delays, less waiting at luggage carousels and big savings in airline labor costs.
 Tours that preceded the system's debut led invariably to an airport basement where 26 miles of track, loaded with thousands of small gray carts, sped bags up and down inclines as conveyor belts minutely timed by the computer deposited each bag in its cart at just the right moment. 
 ''They were so proud of it,'' said Raymond Neidl, an airline-aerospace analyst with Calyon Securities in New York. ''It's the one thing they wanted to show you.''
 But then the price tag ballooned along with glitches. Construction costs of $186 million were compounded at a rate of $1 million a day for months in 1994 when the airport's opening was delayed by baggage-handling failures. Tens of millions more have been spent in the years since for repairs and modifications.
 United, Denver's busiest airline, has been using a stripped-down, simplified version of the network for its outgoing flights since the airport opened in 1995 -- though ''enduring'' is probably the better word, since regular breakdowns have continued despite years of tinkering.
 Automation never worked for incoming flights, whose baggage has been moved by handlers from the beginning. And no other airline ever tried to use the error-prone system at all.
 United's general manager for customer service in Denver, Jim Kyte, says the pressure to cut costs as the airline struggles to emerge from bankruptcy, along with sharply rising fuel prices this year, ultimately forced the issue. Turning off the computer and reverting to the old-fashioned use of human beings who drive luggage carts from gate to gate -- the way things are still done at most airports -- will save $1 million a month in maintenance costs, which have far exceeded expectations.
 The change might also bring new terms to a lease that now provides for United to pay the city, the automated system's owner, $60 million a year until 2025. Asked about the prospect of trying to renegotiate with Denver, a United spokesman, Jeff Green, said, ''We are reviewing all options.''
 Those kinds of costs aside, the error rate among baggage handlers is lower than the befuddled computer could ever achieve, Mr. Kyte said. A test run this summer using workers to handle baggage for transfer flights through the airport has already proved its value, he said, with the number of mishandled bags down sharply in July from the corresponding month a year ago.
 ''We're going back to the future,'' Mr. Kyte said.
 Workers with hand-held scanners, checking baggage bar codes at every juncture of transit, will give managers far better information and control than could have been imagined when the automated system was designed, officials at United said.
 One expert who has studied the sad sack arc of baggage movement in Denver said the designers had invested too much belief in the wizardry they thought was at their command.
 ''It wasn't the technology per se, it was a misplaced faith in it,'' said Richard de Neufville, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professor de Neufville said the builders had imagined that their creation would work well even at the busiest boundaries of its capacity. That left no room for the errors and inefficiencies that are inevitable in a complex enterprise. 
 ''The main culprit was hubris,'' he said.
 Sharp corners, for example, were too much for the system to deal with. The whirring baggage carts, programmed to pick up and drop off bags in a perfectly coordinated ballet, often just tipped over and dumped their loads.
 Then there was the lizard tongue, formally known as a telescoping belt loader, which was designed to shoot out from the track system's maw directly to an airplane's luggage doors. It, too, was a flop.
 BAE Automated Systems of Carrollton, Tex., which designed the system, has since been liquidated, and no one associated with the effort could be reached for comment.
 The abandonment of computerized baggage transit is hardly the only step that United has taken to cut costs. The airline, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002, has repeatedly asked employees to share the pain, and many current and former workers could lose some pension benefits. Even the death of the automated system is not expected to result in additional jobs, since an increase in baggage handlers will be offset by a decline in the number of maintenance workers.
 Industry analysts say recapturing and maintaining the good will of the workers will be crucial to the airline's ultimate recovery. ''If they can keep the peace,'' Mr. Neidl said, ''they have a chance of becoming a powerhouse in the industry again. If the employees declare war, the company will probably go the way of Pan Am.'' 
 In any event, managers at the airport say the failure of big-thought baggage transit does have a plus: lots of room in the basement. Denver has 33 baggage scanners the size of minivans that, as required by federal security regulations in the wake of 9/11, screen every piece of luggage. No one envisioned those regulations when the airport was built, or imagined where such machines might be put.
 ''When the federal government mandated that airports screen all luggage, some airports had to set them up by the ticket areas,'' said Chuck Cannon, a spokesman for Denver International. ''We just took out some of the old system that had never become operational. We had the space.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Falls For First Time in Three Months

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell for the first time in three months in August as Americans paid record prices at the gasoline pump.
 The University of Michigan said yesterday that its index of consumer sentiment declined more than forecast, to 89.1 from July's 96.5, the first drop since May and the largest decline since February 2004. A preliminary estimate of the survey on Aug. 12 put the index at 92.7. 
 ''Up until now, we haven't seen any backlash to record prices at the pump from consumers, but now the story is changing,'' Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York, said in an interview. ''We've passed the complaining stage and entered the actionable phase.'' 
 The average retail price of a gallon of regular gasoline increased to a record $2.61 this week, the latest Department of Energy figures showed. While job and income growth are supporting consumer spending and the economy, higher fuel costs threaten to slow both.
 The current conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to buy big-ticket items, fell to 108.2 in August, from 113.5 in July. The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, was 76.9, down from 85.5 last month.
 ''It's got to be gasoline,'' Paul Finkelstein, chief executive of the Regis Corporation, the hair salon operator, said in an interview. ''There's no question that people are worried. They're shopping less and staying home more because of gas prices and that affects everyone.''
 Americans have so far weathered a 46 percent surge in gasoline prices this year because companies are hiring and incomes are keeping pace.
 Fuel costs are showing through in President Bush's approval ratings as well. His 40 percent rate is the lowest of his presidency, according to a Harris Interactive poll. 
 ''Clearly, the consumer is under a lot of pressure, a lot of stress,'' said William McLaughlin, chief executive at the Select Comfort Corporation, yesterday from Minneapolis.

HEADLINE: Divorced From Fiscal Reality 

BYLINE: By M.P. Dunleavey. 
M.P. Dunleavey writes about personal finance for MSN Money.

 BODY:
AS someone who has been married for only two years, I don't spend much time dwelling on divorce. It's just that three friends' marriages are ending, and what they're going through is nasty.
 Not the bitter words and ugly revelations -- the money. You'd think both members of a couple would strive to protect their finances during a divorce, but lawyers and financial advisers say that even the most well-educated women are less likely to protect themselves financially. And the seeds of this financial failure are often planted long before her lawyer calls his. 
''What astounds me,'' said Gayle Rosenwald Smith, a lawyer in Philadelphia and author of ''Divorce and Money: Everything You Need to Know'' (Penguin/Perigee, 2004), ''is that people spend two years on wedding cakes and bridesmaids' dresses. But do they sit down and ask: How are we going to handle our accounts? What about retirement?''
 Though men can certainly suffer for their lack of financial awareness, women seem to pay a higher price. A divorced woman's standard of living will drop by as much as 27 percent (for men it tends to rise about 10 percent), according to the Marriage Project at Rutgers. Single mothers, many of them divorced, suffer some of the highest bankruptcy rates.
 Too many women avoid the financial realities of marriage until it's too late, said Marian Green, a divorce financial analyst in Billings, Mont., who works exclusively with women. ''One of the biggest mistakes women make is not knowing their financial picture, and not having the documents to prove it,'' she said.
 Even during a split many women avoid dealing with money, she said: ''They'll say, 'I don't care what I get, I just want this over with.' And they sacrifice their financial security.'' 
 Despite what I've seen among my friends, I was hesitant to believe women get worked over more than men do -- until I listened to experts. 
 Harlene Miller, a bankruptcy lawyer in Santa Ana, Calif., who works on many divorce cases, said women suffer disproportionate economic consequences. ''And by far they are smart, they are educated, they are professional -- and they have done nothing to protect themselves,'' she said.
 When her marriage unraveled last year, Rebecca Anderson, 37, was in a precarious position. Despite having a successful career in the financial sector -- and despite being the primary earner -- ''I just sort of ceded financial control to my husband.''
 Like a lot of suddenly single women, Ms. Anderson had a nerve-racking time regaining financial control. She vividly remembers how her hands shook when she went to open her own checking account. She moved to a smaller home, swapped her BMW for a Toyota and in bleaker moments, wondered how she would be able to send her son to college.
 Her biggest folly, Ms. Anderson now feels, was not ''being engaged'' in the family's finances all along. Ms. Green would agree. Regardless of how secure your marriage seems, she said, ''Be proactive from Day 1 or even before.'' That means:

GET INVOLVED -- Know where all accounts are, where statements are kept, how to gain access to the safe deposit box and make sure that you're a signatory on everything. ''Learn to read a tax return,'' Ms. Smith added.

ESTABLISH YOUR OWN CREDIT -- If all your cards and accounts are joint, obtain some in your name only.

RUN THE NUMBERS -- Do an income and expense sheet so you know exactly how much is coming in and where it's going. If you need help, go to a financial planner. This can give you a valuable overview of your spouse's financial status as well.

CLAIM WHAT'S YOURS -- ''Your name should be on the title to all real property,'' Ms. Miller said. Keep copies of inheritance checks or large gifts from your family.
 If a separation or divorce is imminent, it's even more vital to act in your own best financial interests, Ms. Smith said. Her ''don't leave your marriage without this'' list includes making copies of three years of statements and tax returns; taking an inventory of valuables; and copying important records and correspondence from your home PC. All that can be valuable to a lawyer.
 After a year's separation, Ms. Anderson and her husband may reconcile, but she says that either way she won't give up her hard-earned savvy about financial matters. She's bought her own home, manages her budget and with some modesty admits that she is learning how to rebalance her retirement portfolio. ''There's no better person to manage your money than you,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Dreams of a Korean Summer: School and a New Cell

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
JUST as she did during the school year, Jeong Hye Jin, 15, spent the long, sweltering summer commuting to her high school by day and to private classes in the evening.
 Summer school was mandatory, not for students who had fallen behind, but for those who, as she put it, ''have a chance of getting into good universities.'' Not attending was never an option for Hye Jin, who is ranked 17th out of 430 students in the 10th grade at Young Hoon High School, in a working-class neighborhood here in the capital.
 A desktop calendar in her bedroom states in her bold, clear handwriting: ''Korea University Department of English Language Education. Class 2008.'' (In Korea, the year you enter college is your class year.) But if getting into what is considered the third best university is her long-term ambition, there is also something closer at hand: a new mobile phone. 
 ''I've been asking for a new phone forever -- since last year!'' Hye Jin said, raising her left index finger. Good grades had earned her mother's promise to buy her a new model that was supposed to go on sale in a matter of days.
 Hye Jin, who has had a mobile phone since the seventh grade, sends text messages without even glancing at the keypad. In class, she looks straight ahead, holding a pen in her right hand, punching away messages with the left on her phone under her desk. (Some boys have taken this rebelliousness further by carving holes in their desks, through which they look down at their phones.)
 A new phone, a good university -- goals shared, no doubt, with an equal degree of burning intensity by her peers -- set the rhythm of Hye Jin's summer. In a country where every teenager's existence seems centered on entering a top university, which can determine one's future here much more than in the United States, such conformity is to be expected.
 At the same time, hers is a generation coming of age in a fast-changing society. At 15, Hye Jin has only the slightest knowledge of the military governments that ruled South Korea until the 1980's. South Korea, especially since the financial crisis and deepening democratization of the 1990's, has transformed itself into the world's most wired society and the leading pop culture exporter to the rest of Asia.
 Longstanding assumptions about women's roles, marriage, South Korea's relations with North Korea and the United States have been upended in half of Hye Jin's lifetime. The dizzying changes have created new possibilities, but they have also made Hye Jin's mother worry whether her daughter is tough enough for a radically different world. 
 The principal of Hye Jin's high school says her generation demands more freedom -- as evidenced by its fight to choose its hairstyles, which are restricted by most schools. In keeping with the country's democratization, Young Hoon High School now allows students to select some of their summer school teachers; and this school, like others, no longer inculcates the fierce anti-Communist attitude that was standard until a few years ago.
 As for Hye Jin, she thinks North Korea is a ''poor country,'' not a ''bad country.'' Like most South Koreans of her generation, though, she is against the peninsula's reunification as too heavy a financial burden on the South.
 ''We'll become poor,'' she says.
 AFTER classes recently, Hye Jin and two of her friends skipped the $1 kimpap at a Korean restaurant and the 30-cent ice cream at McDonald's. Since they were being treated to lunch, they chose ''Italian Fresco,'' opting for pizza and pasta. On a street near the school, Hye Jin bowed to an older classmate.
 Hye Jin avoids being the center of attention, so she and another friend, Byun Hee Jeong, 15, sat at the ends of a booth, flanking Yoo Ji Hyun, 16. Ji Hyun is Hye Jin's best friend. ''When I met her in the seventh grade,'' Ji Hyun said of Hye Jin, ''I thought she was a goody-goody. But now I think she's open-minded and hysterical.''
 While her friends choose their summer school teachers based on competence, Hye Jin judges them on how nice they are. Her crushes on boys, including the current one, often mystify her friends.
 ''I've gone to see him play soccer,'' Hye Jin says. ''He's not that good. His grades aren't that good, either. But he's nice to everyone and well mannered and kindhearted.''
 ''My mother says good-looking and smart guys are better,'' she added.
 A week later, at home in one of the 25-story high-rises in her housing complex, her mother, Lee Yang Ja, 40, said: ''I'd like to see my daughter with a good-looking and tall friend. They're not getting married anyway.''
 It was one of the rare occasions when the whole family was home: the mother, who recently retired from her job as a bank teller; the father, Jeong Byeong Sam, 43, a union organizer at the bank; sister Yu Jeong, 12; and Hye Jin, still waiting for her new phone.
 Except on Sundays, Hye Jin usually comes home around 11 p.m., after her private evening classes. Going to sleep around midnight, she awakens at 6 a.m.
 ''Since everyone else is sending their kids to private classes,'' the father said, ''we can't leave her out.''
 The private classes for both daughters cost about $1,200 a month -- a hefty sum that dissuades many South Koreans from having more than one or two children.
 ''I invest in my kids and expect to see returns reflected in good grades,'' the mother said. ''I'm not satisfied. I don't think she's trying her best.''
 AFTER coming home at night, her mother explained, Hye Jin just watched television or updated her blog on the popular Cyworld site, where about a quarter of South Koreans have blogs. The family computer was recently moved to the living room so the mother could keep track of how her daughters were using it.
 ''She's too nice,'' her mother said. ''She's not persistent enough. Given the world we live in, I'm a bit concerned.''
 Hye Jin's father, though, saw possibilities for his daughters in a society where women's standing has risen considerably. A change in the centuries-old family registry system in the next two years will even allow women to become the legal heads of households.
 ''This is the era of women,'' Mr. Jeong said. Hye Jin, who wants to become an English teacher, is aware that opportunities will be greater for her than they were for her mother.
 ''When we start working,'' she said, ''there will be fewer instances of men asking women to pour tea or calling you 'Miss so-and-so.'''
 But work is years away, at least six or seven, half a lifetime for a 15-year-old. More pressing are Hye Jin's new phone, which was still a day or two away. She would get a new number. She would have to take new photos to replace the ones in her old phone, of herself in different poses, her family, her uncle serving his two-year military service, her dog, Min.
 A couple of days later, Hye Jin sent a text message with her new number. She could still type messages without glancing. 
 ''Since the keypad is the same,'' her text message went, punctuated by emoticons expressing effusiveness and embarrassment, ''I can write the same way ;;''

This article is part of a series examining the challenges and aspirations of young people in countries around the world.

HEADLINE: Memo to U.S.: Pay Attention To Canada 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
I'M a lucky guy. Every summer I get to spend a month or more at a house my wife and I own on a wonderful lake in the Laurentian mountains of Quebec. For more than 25 years, I've been coming up here to this little slice of paradise, and in that time, I've come to know a lot of the people around the lake, many of whom, of course, are businesspeople. I've become friends with a Toronto hedge fund manager, a Montreal chemical company executive, an Ottawa lobbyist and a general counsel for a Canadian multinational, among many others.
 Naturally, whenever we get together, the subject turns to business -- Canadian business. We invariably hash over the latest trade frictions with the United States, which always garner front-page play in the Canadian papers and no play at all in the American papers. Although you probably haven't heard about it, there is an unusually nasty dispute going on now over softwood lumber, a major Canadian export that the United States believes is unfairly subsidized by the Canadian government. 
Unfortunately for our side, the North American Free Trade Agreement arbitrators have consistently ruled in Canada's favor. After the latest -- and supposedly final -- such ruling a few weeks ago, the United States trade representative, Rob Portman, announced that the United States would ignore it and refuse to refund $5 billion in tariffs it has collected in the last five years. (The American position is that the ruling is pre-empted by a parallel proceeding at the World Trade Organization.)
 THE stance has made our friendly neighbors to the north a lot less friendly -- in fact, the country is absolutely up in arms. Canada's trade minister even walked out of softwood lumber negotiations recently, to the universal applause of his countrymen. ''What is there to talk about?'' asked Senator Pat Carney, a former trade minister who now represents British Columbia. ''We won. The Americans won't abide by the rule of law.'' That pretty much sums up the sentiment of the entire country.
 Senator Carney doesn't want to slap duties on goods imported from America. ''That would hurt our consumers,'' she correctly noted. She has another form of retaliation in mind. She wants the Canadian government to begin ''scrutinizing'' American investment in Canada. She pointed in particular to a pending $6.9 billion acquisition of Terasen, a Canadian natural gas pipeline company, by Kinder Morgan, based in Houston.
 Memo to American business: Pay attention to this. It could cause trouble. That goes double for you, Richard Kinder. As a Texan, and president of Enron in the mid-1990's, you are on friendly terms with President Bush. You should whisper in his ear to settle this thing fast. It's in everyone's best interest.
 Here are a few other Canadian business topics that my friends and I have been discussing this summer:
 A TALE OF TWO BANKS -- Did you know that a handful of Canadian banks were up to their necks in the Enron fraud? Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, known as C.I.B.C., was one of Enron's ''Tier 1'' banks, which meant it was pretty much willing to do anything Andrew S. Fastow asked it to, including violate the law. (According to prosecutors, an unnamed C.I.B.C. banker once remarked that Mr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, would someday be ''led away in handcuffs.'' Good prediction.) And Toronto Dominion also did plenty of deals with Enron. Now, both banks are paying the piper.
 This month, C.I.B.C. settled its involvement in the big Enron shareholder suit for an absolutely crushing amount: $2.4 billion, which is more than either J.P. Morgan or Citigroup, even though C.I.B.C. is a much smaller institution. Thanks to the settlement, C.I.B.C. recently reported a loss of nearly $2 billion in its latest quarter.
 Then came Toronto Dominion, which last week announced that it was paying $130 million to settle claims with Enron itself and was also putting aside $300 million to $400 million as it girded for coming negotiations with William S. Lerach, the lead lawyer in the shareholder suit. During a brief conference call with analysts, however, Toronto Dominion's chief executive, W. Edmund Clark, made it clear that he felt the whole thing was terribly unfair. 
 ''No one at T.D. did anything wrong,'' he insisted, ''but we have been swept up in a system which is causing even innocent participants to pay. This is a real economic cost to the bank, and for that I am truly sorry.''
 Not so fast, Mr. Clark. As the Enron bankruptcy examiner pointed out, your bank did six transactions, called prepays, that generated about $2 billion for Enron. Prepays may have been legal, but they were incredibly sleazy, their primary purpose being to fool investors. What appeared to be complex commodities swaps were actually disguised loans to Enron. The Toronto Dominion prepays also helped create the illusion of $1.5 billion in cash flow, which was critical for Enron to maintain its high credit rating.
 Did the Toronto Dominion bankers working with the company know how Enron was using these transactions? ''The swap transaction is effectively a two-month loan to Enron,'' reads one of the Toronto Dominion e-mail messages reprinted by the bankruptcy examiner. He had a dozen e-mail messages making similar remarks.
 Memo to Mr. Clark: When you finally do settle with Mr. Lerach, you ought to apologize to a different group of beleaguered shareholders -- Enron's.
 AIR CANADA, MODEL AIRLINE -- What's this? Air Canada, that perennially troubled airline, is making money? It's true. Last summer, ACE Aviation Holdings, Air Canada's parent company, reported a second-quarter loss of 510 million Canadian dollars ($427 million at current rates). This summer, ACE reported second-quarter profits of 168 million Canadian dollars. Michael J. Linenberg of Merrill Lynch calls it ''among the most profitable of all North American carriers.''
 What happened? In a word, bankruptcy. ACE Aviation filed for bankruptcy in April 2003. When it emerged 18 months later, it had eliminated $12 billion in debt and lowered its labor costs by $1.2 billion. It also shifted some of its less profitable routes to its low-cost regional carrier, Jazz. (ACE is now planning to spin off Jazz to shareholders.) Recently, I flew on Air Canada, and mentioned to one of the attendants that the company finally seemed to be doing well. ''Ah, yes,'' she replied. ''That's because they cut our pay and benefits in half.'' She smiled as she said it. (Hey, she's Canadian.) 
 Memo to Delta: What in the world are you waiting for? Bankruptcy is a pain, but it's your only way out.
 WHO NEEDS THE SAUDIS? Did you read that article last Sunday in The New York Times Magazine about how Saudi Arabia might not have the oil reserves we think they have? And how, as a result, a full-blown energy crisis might be a lot closer than most people now think? Pretty scary.
 But my Canadian friends keep telling me not to worry. Why? Because of the oil sands in Northern Alberta, which, they say, now have proven recoverable reserves of around 175 billion barrels -- second only to the Saudis -- and may in fact wind up having more reserves than any other spot on earth, especially as the technology to extract it improves.
 This oil is not pumped from the ground, however. It's mined, and the oil is then extracted from the sands in an enormously expensive process. At $10 a barrel, this extraction process is uneconomical, but at $60 a barrel, it is a highly profitable enterprise. (Break even is around $20 a barrel.) Many of the major oil companies have made multibillion-dollar investments in the oil sands, which are now producing about one million barrels a day, most of that going straight to the United States. Neil Camarta, who heads up Shell Canada's efforts, told me that he expected production to rise to three million barrels a day by 2010.
 Not having heard much about this before, I was a tad skeptical, so I called T. Boone Pickens, the 77-year-old former raider who knows more about oil markets than just about anyone I know.
 Mr. Pickens turned out to be quite excited about the oil sands. ''That oil is the jewel of North America,'' he said. He says he thinks that production will never approach the 10 million barrels a day the Saudis currently export -- ''it's just too expensive to develop'' -- but that it could eventually get as high as 6 million barrels a day, which would cover more than half of America's oil import needs.
 He also said that it would be a very long time before the oil sands would face the ''declining yield curve'' that the Saudis will soon have to deal with. And although the Chinese have made some small investments in Northern Alberta, it is logistically impossible to ship the oil to China. So the United States is the logical market.
 Mr. Camarta told me that Vice President Dick Cheney would visit the oil sands next month. Memo to Mr. Cheney: Can you settle the softwood lumber dispute while you're there? With all that oil, do we really want Canada mad at us?

HEADLINE: Play With Our Name

BYLINE: By Jim Shore. 
Jim Shore is general counsel of the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

DATELINE: Hollywood, Fla. 

 BODY:
EARLIER this week, the National Collegiate Athletic Association reversed its recent decision that would have forced Florida State University to drop the use of the ''Seminole'' name and related symbols. But it continued to ban the use of Native American mascots and nicknames in postseason N.C.A.A. tournaments, a decision that affects 17 other universities.
 As a member of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, I believe the N.C.A.A. should encourage those colleges that have Indian mascots and nicknames to build better relations with the Native American community. Perhaps each university could establish a relationship with a reservation, involving programs like internships, scholarships and tribal history and culture classes. 
Here in Florida, the relationship we have with Florida State goes beyond the football field. Florida State encourages members of the Seminole Tribe to apply for admission and spreads information about Seminole culture and history. 
 Too many Americans, including Native Americans, get caught up in the debate over the tomahawk chop and miss the opportunity that comes in having a tribe in a close alliance with a major university. While the Seminole Tribe of Florida gets no financial compensation for the university's use of the Seminole name and related symbols, the richness of the relationship brings a variety of social and economic benefits to our tribe.
 The use of Indian nicknames and mascots by colleges and universities started in the early 1900's. Many of these names were generic -- Braves, Chiefs and Warriors -- but some were the names of tribes like the Chippewas, the Hurons, the Sioux and, of course, the Seminoles. Eventually, there were more than 100 colleges with Indian mascots and some 2,500 high schools. Professional sports teams joined in, too.
 In the 60's and 70's, however, activist groups began challenging the use of some of these names, calling them offensive. Around that time, officials from Florida State University approached the Seminole Tribe to make sure their use of certain symbols was accurate and respectful. We requested they stop using the ''Sammy the Seminole'' caricature, and they did. Sammy was replaced by Chief Osceola, who was a great tribal military leader and a brilliant battlefield tactician. This was long before anyone at the N.C.A.A. even cared about the use of Indian names and symbols.
 The university also reached out to the tribe in other ways. For years, Florida State University has invited Seminole Tribe high school students to visit its Tallahassee campus. The university organizes an annual summer trip to encourage young Seminoles to apply for admission. And the program is working. This fall, four new Seminole students will join four already enrolled there.
 The school also uses printed materials and statewide television broadcasts to share with the public the history and culture of the Seminole Tribe so that our non-Indian neighbors have a better sense of who we are, where we came from and how deep our historical roots are in Florida.
 And then there's the university's impact in Tallahassee. Hundreds of Florida government officials are Florida State graduates and supporters. We deal with these people every day, working with them to clean up the Everglades, to improve the roads that lead to our reservations and to support the public schools that many of our children attend.
 For all these reasons and more, our five-member Tribal Council voted unanimously to support the university in its efforts to keep the Seminole name. It's a shame that other colleges and tribes aren't finding a way to make similar accommodations.

HEADLINE: Hiring Freeze And Cost Cuts At Time Inc. 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Time Inc., the publishing unit of Time Warner, which includes Fortune and People magazine, announced a hiring freeze yesterday and clamped down on spending for travel and customer gifts to meet profit goals.
 ''Every division of the company has been asked to cut costs for the rest of the year,'' the acting chief financial officer at Time Inc., Howard Rosen, wrote in a memorandum to senior managers this week. A spokeswoman, Ali Zelenko, confirmed yesterday that the memo was sent. 
 The memo, among other things, told employees that they may no longer give theater tickets or spa trips to clients without approval and that they should take the subway or taxis in Manhattan instead of a car service and should cancel all nonessential travel. 
 Employees were also told to fly in economy class in the United States and abroad. The cuts are part of an effort to combat a ''challenging year'' in publishing, Mr. Rosen said in the memo.
 ''The thinking is, If the revenue isn't as high as it used to be, what can they do to keep margins at 20 to 30 percent?'' said Samir A. Husni, a journalism professor who directs the magazine program at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. ''The lifestyle they were living was not comparable with any other media industry worldwide.''
 Time's first-half profit fell from a year earlier, hurt by lower advertising sales at Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune. The unit also missed analysts' estimates in the second quarter, reporting a 3 percent drop in profit, in contrast to predictions of a 6 percent rise.
 The chief executive of Time Warner, Richard D. Parsons, is being pressured to deliver returns to shareholders by the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn. 
 Ad sales at Fortune have slipped 7.1 percent this year through Aug. 4, according to Publishers Information Bureau, which tracks magazine advertising. Sports Illustrated slumped 12.4 percent and Time magazine declined 13.5 percent, the bureau said.
 At the same time, Mr. Husni said, the division has created several new magazines, leading to higher expenses. Time restarted Life magazine last year and introduced the monthly women's magazine All You and the home-decorating publication Cottage Living.

HEADLINE: Patriotism And the Taxpayer

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Golden Goldman Sachs'' (editorial, Aug. 25):
It is not shocking that Goldman Sachs received a sweetheart deal to stay in Lower Manhattan. After all, New York has often capitulated to corporations threatening to move out of Manhattan by awarding them tax credits, favorable debt financing and property tax abatements to stay put. 
 What makes this case particularly shocking is that Goldman Sachs wasn't planning on leaving Manhattan, its home for 136 years, for a more lucrative retention deal across the river or in the suburbs. It was considering a move to Midtown. Such a move would be akin to a reshuffling of the city's economic deck of cards.
 This announcement has more to do with the symbolic pride all New Yorkers feel about the rebuilding of downtown after 9/11. Are we to believe that the financial power brokers couldn't figure out a way to rebuild in the country's financial center without large government handouts? 
 The answer, of course, is consistent with post-9/11 America: lower the tax burden for those who can most afford it, while the costs to the public for increased security, counterterrorism and intelligence continue to escalate. How patriotic!

HEADLINE: Credit: For Those of You Keeping Score at Home 

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
Email: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Come Sept. 1, debt-laden Americans everywhere can find out what creditors really think of them.
 On that date, residents of the Northeast will be able to order free copies of their credit reports by logging on to annualcreditreport.com. People on the West Coast got access last December and the availability has been rolling eastward since.
But a credit report, in all its mind-numbing detail, is not what most people will be looking for. They want the quick snapshot of their creditworthiness. They want the FICO score, and it's not free. 
 FICO is short for the Fair Isaac Corporation, which created the score.
 Just as any college-bound student knows that his or her SAT score determines whether an Ivy League or a community college will be welcoming, the FICO score tells how eagerly creditors will give you money. The three-digit number from 300 to 850 is used by mortgage brokers, credit card companies, retailers and auto dealers to determine how much you can borrow and at what interest rate. The higher the score, the better.
 You need to know that number, but you should not obsess about it. That can be hard, though, because the credit agencies and Fair Isaac would very much like you to monitor it closely. Andy Jolls, a vice president for Fair Isaac, said, ''The more people who know about it the better.''
 That is certainly true for Fair Isaac, a Minneapolis company that last year sold $706.2 million worth of financial data to companies that want to sort out the deadbeats. Over the last four and a half years, it has sold more than 10 million scores to consumers at $45 each. Revenue generated from the company's MyFico.com Web site jumped 33 percent, to $32 million last year. The FICO score, invented in 1988, has in a very short time become the single most important indicator used by lenders to predict whether you will repay your debt. The company used to cloak the score in secrecy, but in recent years it has become quite open about its prized possession.
 The score, it says, is largely based on just two factors: history of paying off debt and ''credit utilization,'' or the amount of debt you have in relation to your credit limits. Fair Isaac measures this, along with three other factors, applies an algorithm to compare that data with the payment patterns of millions of other Americans and generates the FICO score.
 Any number below 500 and you are a financial pariah. Get above 750, where 40 percent of Americans are, and the credit card companies will never stop plying you with offers. 
 So, of course, you want to know what your score is. It is human nature to want to know that you, with your FICO of 816, rank in the top 3 percent of Americans. If your mortgage broker does not share it with you free of charge, by all means, buy it. Fair Isaac and each of the credit bureaus will be glad to sell versions of it to you. (It does not come with any credit report, free or otherwise.)
 Here's the first rub: the credit score you get is not really the score that a lender will use. Fair Isaac sells a variety of scores aimed at various markets. Its computers slice the data it purchases from credit bureaus any number of ways for clients. Some scores calculate the odds of a bankruptcy filing, while others help a collection agency predict the likeliness one will make good on a debt. Some lenders even have their own algorithm to generate a proprietary score.
 ''There are thousands of options and creditors choose which one they want,'' says Maxine Sweet, vice president for consumer education at Experian, one of the three major credit agencies. In fact, FICO uses Experian data to generate the score that is very similar to what the majority of mortgage lenders ask for, but Experian also sells a version to consumers called Score Plus. 
 You can also obtain a credit score called Empirica from TransUnion, and one called Beacon from Equifax, that closely approximate the FICO score. All the numbers are different, but are not supposed to vary much.
 You really only need to look at one score. But MyFico.com and each of the credit agencies not so subtly urge you to buy more with a variety of products, including some that will give you constant updates of your score. If you are checking your credit report three times a year as you should, watching your score change every few weeks is complete overkill. 
 They also urge you to buy products to improve your scores. It is not unlike the way Kaplan, a unit of the Washington Post Company, or Princeton Review Inc. exhort people to improve their SAT or GMAT scores. ''It's a nice analogy,'' Mr. Jolls said. The difference, he says, ''is that not everyone goes to college and most people in this country use credit.'' 
 But does everyone need to obsess over this score? Suze Orman, the financial health evangelist, says they do. She sells a $50 product on MyFico that tells you how improve it. The advice is sound, but the truth is, nearly the same advice is found free elsewhere on the MyFico site. (Where the Orman package has real value is a feature to check your credit report for errors and automatically generate letters to the credit bureau to correct them.) ''My advice is targeted to people who are broke,'' said Ms. Orman, whose latest book is titled, ''The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous and Broke.'' ''These are the people who need to get their scores up.'' 
 She is right. But if you have excellent credit, you already know it. If you have bad credit, you also know that, too, and you should know what to do about it: pay your bills. It is everyone else who could benefit by knowing the score.
 The people with scores in the 600's could profit the most by nudging it into the 700's. In that lower range, a difference of only a few points can mean paying thousands of dollars more in interest. In some regions like California and the Northeast, where home loans of more than $350,000 are the norm, anyone with a score below 660 will have trouble qualifying for a mortgage. 
 Widening the gap between your credit card limits and what you owe will pay off. Mr. Jolls says that a score can be raised 10 to 15 points in only a few months with a little discipline. 
 It seems fairly pointless to go through all that trouble if your score is already above 720. Since half of the credit score is determined by the length of time you have paid your credit card bills and mortgage payments on time, there is really little you can do to improve it except more of the same. 
 And if your score is above 780? Says Lara Blake, senior associate at Holmgren & Associates, an Oakland, Calif., mortgage brokerage firm, ''It just means that you can frame the score and put it on the wall.''
 Some companies will charge you $50, even $100 for this advice. We give it to you for just the cost of today's newspaper. 
 The credit score is determined by five factors, some weighted more than others. If your score is anywhere above 700, do not sweat it. Keep doing what you are doing.
 For everyone else, here's where to apply a little discipline so you look less like a credit risk: 

PAYMENT HISTORY (35 PERCENT) Pay your bills on time. The longer you do that, the faster your score goes up. It is that simple.

AMOUNTS OWED (30 PERCENT) If you have balances, start paying them down to zero starting with the cards carrying the highest interest rate. Consolidating debt onto one card can lower your score because a high ratio of debt to your credit limit, what the industry calls ''credit utilization,'' looks like you are about tapped out.

LENGTH OF CREDIT HISTORY (15 PERCENT) This category trips up people who think they are improving their credit by tearing up their credit cards. Do not close any accounts. It does not hurt to let them sit there, because the longer you have accounts open -- assuming you pay on time -- the better your score gets.

NEW CREDIT (10 PERCENT) Ignore the come-ons from stores offering a discount if you open a charge account. Taking out more credit makes you look short of cash. But do not worry about shopping around for a loan. Inquiries from potential lenders hitting credit bureaus within a 30-day period aren't harmful.

TYPES OF CREDIT USED (10 PERCENT) Crazy as it sounds, if you have some debt you look better than someone who has none. So do use a credit card. If you have some small amount of installment debt -- as dumb as that is to do -- it can help to raise your score a bit.

How to Request Free Credit Report
 Every American is entitled to one report from each of the credit agencies -- Experian, TransUnion and Equifax -- each year under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. 
 A lot of Web sites, including those of the big credit reporting agencies, will try to lure you in to sell you those reports, but that is a good way to spend money needlessly. At annualcreditreport.com, the reports are available free. (Those who are uncomfortable submitting their Social Security number online can mail a request to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, Ga., 30348-5281 or call (877)322-8228.) If you order a report from one agency, then come back in three to four months and order from another, you can keep on top of any credit changes. 
 The reports can be difficult to read, but you first want to check for accounts that are not yours. Next, make sure the report is clear of any erroneous information like a bill turned over to a collection agency or a credit card balance that was not paid off. 
 If there is a mistake, write a letter to the credit bureau and correct it. Then immediately order free copies from the other two agencies to make sure the error is not repeated on their reports. 
 Remember, asking for a report directly from a credit bureau never hurts your credit score. DAMON DARLIN


CORRECTION-DATE: September 13, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Aug. 27 about credit scores referred incorrectly to two services available from credit agencies. The Empirica score from TransUnion and the Beacon score from Equifax use a formula developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation and are available only to businesses like mortgage companies. They are not an approximation of the credit scores that TransUnion and Equifax do offer to consumers. Because of an editing error, the article also referred incorrectly to the prices of scores sold. Fair Isaac has sold more than 10 million scores to consumers at various prices -- not just $45, which is the cost for a set of three from the largest credit scoring agencies.

BYLINE: By Holly Brubach. 
Holly Brubach is the former style editor of The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Washington Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs apologized yesterday for calling Dallas Cowboys fans ''the ugliest people in the world.''
 ''It didn't come out probably like a joke or like it should have,'' he said. ''If anybody took it the wrong way other than a joke, when you make a mistake like that, you've got to apologize.'' -- The New York Times, Aug. 7 
TERRELL Owens, wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles, issued a statement yesterday through his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, regretting what he said was ''the way other people misinterpreted'' his comments after the Eagles' loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX. He insisted that his remark -- ''I wasn't the one who got tired'' -- was intended as a joke, not as a criticism of quarterback Donovan McNabb's performance. ''If Donovan's feelings were hurt,'' said Owens, ''then he needs to get his sense of humor checked.'' 
 Bill Belichick, coach of the New England Patriots, asked the Eagles' forgiveness today for defeating them in the Super Bowl. ''For us, it was just one more Super Bowl,'' he said, ''but they've never even won one. It would have meant a lot to them. I guess we should have let them have the ball more often. What can I say? We just lost sight of how it felt to be an Eagle.''
 Mike Singletary, the Chicago Bears' defensive captain for Super Bowl XX, came forward on behalf of his former teammates to say they were ''sorry'' about the 1985 music video, ''The Super Bowl Shuffle.'' A player with a conscience who once declared, ''I like to hit people, but I don't like to hurt people,'' Singletary acknowledged that the video was ''painful to watch.'' 
 Terrell Owens's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, issued a statement in which the player ''thought better of'' his decision to appear in a controversial commercial for ''Desperate Housewives'' before a Monday Night Football game last season. In it, the actress Nicollette Sheridan dropped the towel she was wearing, persuading him to skip the game. ''This may have created the mistaken impression that T.O. would put sex before football,'' Rosenhaus explained. ''But naked women throw themselves at T.O. all the time, and it's not every day he gets to play for the Eagles.''
 In the spirit of contrition, New Orleans Saints wide receiver Joe Horn, who in 2003 placed a call on his cellphone from the end zone after scoring a touchdown, embarked on a series of personal appearances at area high schools. ''Remember,'' he told the student audience, ''talking on a cell phone in public is annoying and rude, and a distraction to those around you.''
 Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Tice made public his apology for scalping Super Bowl tickets, a violation for which the N.F.L. fined him $100,000. ''In a free-market economy,'' he said, ''which is what we have in this great country we live in, price is determined by demand. In the case of the Super Bowl, you've got fans who will pay anything. I asked myself, 'Is it wrong to make them happy?' Am I sorry now that I sold those tickets? You bet I am.''
 Recalling his notorious breach of football etiquette in 2002, when he pulled a pen from his sock after scoring the game's winning touchdown and autographed the football in the end zone, Terrell Owens announced that, upon reflection, he ''regrets'' using a Sharpie. According to Drew Rosenhaus, Owens's agent, negotiations for a Sharpie endorsement have come to a standstill.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Chides Investors

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Even as he was being praised for fostering two decades of rising prosperity, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned on Friday that people have been unrealistic in believing that the economy has become permanently less risky.
 In the first of two speeches at a Fed symposium about the ''Greenspan legacy,'' the Fed chairman implicitly took aim at both the torrid run-up in housing prices and at the broader willingness of investors to bid up the prices of stocks and bonds and accept relatively low rates of return.
Both trends reflect what Mr. Greenspan said was the increased willingness of investors to accept low ''risk premiums, a willingness based on a complacent assumption that the low interest rates, low inflation and strong growth of recent years are likely to be permanent.'' 
 ''Any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and, as a consequence, lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt that supported higher prices,'' he said. ''This is the reason that history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums.'' 
 Mr. Greenspan also noted that consumers were more willing to spend money based on an apparent increase in wealth, rather than increases in their earnings, when part of that wealth was based on gains from stocks or real estate that could readily disappear.
 The Fed chairman, who is set to step down after 18 years when his term ends at the end of January, made his remarks as economists and central bankers from around the world gathered to debate the hallmarks of his tenure and the transition to his successor.
 Many Fed officials are expecting President Bush to decide on a successor this fall to give financial markets time to prepare and to allow the confirmation process to be completed in the Senate by the time Mr. Greenspan's term expires.
 The anxiety about a new Fed chairman reflects worries about Mr. Greenspan's nearly mythic reputation as the most powerful and effective central banker of modern times. But it also reflects the challenges that he will be leaving behind, among them issues being much discussed here like the United States' large current-account deficit and rapidly rising foreign indebtedness; the possibility of a major plunge in the dollar; and the prospect of today's big deficits swelling in the absence of fiscal discipline by either the White House or Congress. 
 President Bush has given no hint of his intentions. Almost all of the most widely rumored candidates were in Jackson Hole: Martin Feldstein, an economist at Harvard; R. Glenn Hubbard, a top former economic adviser to President Bush; and Ben S. Bernanke, a former Fed governor and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Another possible candidate, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former director of Mr. Bush's National Economic Council, did not attend.
 In his comments on Friday, Mr. Greenspan did not appear to be signaling a new desire by the Fed to pop a potential bubble in housing prices or to curb other forms of risk-taking. But he and a growing number of Fed officials do appear more intent on talking investors down from what they see as a potentially dangerous level of optimism and complacency.
 Housing prices have climbed far faster than overall inflation and far faster than household incomes for the last five years, partly in response to the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates low but also because of speculative behavior that is increasingly reminiscent of the frenzy over technology stocks just before the market bubble collapsed in 2000.
 But Mr. Greenspan was also alluding to a much broader pattern of economic behavior, an increased hunger among investors to look for higher profits wherever they might be and to pay higher prices for everything from bonds of Latin American nations to shares in risky hedge funds. 
 Mr. Greenspan's remarks also hark back to what he has called the ''conundrum'' of long-term interest rates declining even as the Federal Reserve has been systematically raising the overnight federal funds rate on loans between banks.
 The conundrum has been somewhat less in evidence lately, as interest rates on long-term 10-year Treasury bonds have edged higher. Still, long-term rates are no higher now than they were just before the Fed began raising overnight lending rates in June 2004.
 Mr. Greenspan has adamantly insisted, despite criticism from some economists, that the Fed's job is not to pop speculative bubbles because bubbles are extremely difficult to define and because the Fed's tools -- like a sharp increase in interest rates -- could cause more damage to the economy than they might prevent.
 But his comments nevertheless did suggest that the central bank wants to preach a new gospel of caution that might damp what Mr. Greenspan once called the ''irrational exuberance'' of investors.
 As he has many times in the past, but with somewhat more urgency in this speech, Mr. Greenspan pleaded for policy makers to resist the temptation to set trade and financial barriers to protect jobs from foreign competition. 
 The openness and flexibility of the United States, he said, had allowed it to weather the shocks of terrorist attacks in 2001 with only a mild recession and had thus far allowed the country to endure the escalation of oil prices with little disruption.
 ''The more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct in response to the inevitable, often unanticipated disturbances,'' he said.
 The symposium here this weekend, a select gathering of about 100 economists and central bank officials, attracted an unusually stellar crowd, in part because it is the last such gathering before Mr. Greenspan steps down. 
 Xiaochuan Zhou, governor of China's central bank, spent much of the day huddled in meetings with American and European officials. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, and Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, were here as well. Robert E. Rubin, Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, sang Mr. Greenspan's praises at lunch.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transcription error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about a speech by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in which he warned against making unrealistic assumptions about the economy, incorrectly rendered part of a sentence as a direct quotation. Mr. Greenspan did indeed refer to an increased willingness of investors to accept low ''risk premiums,'' but he did not go on to say that this was a ''willingness based on a complacent assumption that the low interest rates, low inflation and strong growth of recent years are permanent.'' Those words were the reporter's own.

HEADLINE: Reputations Are Mostly at Stake as Talk on C.I.A. Report Turns to How Much to Reveal

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
With a report this week apportioning blame at the C.I.A. for intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the fight over who did what before the hijackers struck is increasingly about history. 
 Most of the central figures faulted in the C.I.A. inspector general's report, notably George J. Tenet, the former director, retired last year. In response to previous reports on the 2001 attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency has been subordinated to a new director of national intelligence in the biggest reorganization of spy agencies since the C.I.A.'s creation in 1947.
''At this point, it's really about reputations,'' said Gregory F. Treverton, a former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council and now a senior analyst at the RAND Corporation. 
 Yet leaders of the families of those who died in the attacks repeated their demand for individual accountability, which is what prompted Congress to ask John L. Helgerson, the C.I.A. inspector general, to begin his investigation nearly three years ago. On Thursday, the September 11 Advocates group demanded the immediate declassification and release of Mr. Helgerson's report, whose harsh conclusions have been disclosed only in limited leaks.
 ''To shield C.I.A. officials from accountability and to continue to cover up deficiencies in that agency puts the safety of our nation at risk,'' the group said in a statement. ''Four years post-9/11 this is truly unacceptable.''
 Far from being punished for his agency's failure to prevent the attacks, Mr. Tenet was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bush in December, eight months before the inspector general's assessment of his record went to Capitol Hill.
 ''I'd like to see public accountability hearings, and I'd like to see him return the Medal of Freedom,'' said Kristen Breitweiser, whose husband died at the World Trade Center and who is an organizer of September 11 Advocates. 
 Ms. Breitweiser said her study of the government's conduct persuaded her that Mr. Tenet showed ''reckless and abysmal judgment'' before the attacks.
 On the other side, Mr. Tenet and some of his colleagues have been fighting for months behind the scenes to soften the report's tough judgments, which they consider unfair, distorted and uninformed. His supporters will not speak for the record because the report remains classified, but they point to a finding of the national 9/11 commission last year: ''Before 9/11, no agency had more responsibility -- or did more -- to attack Al Qaeda, working day and night, than the C.I.A.''
 Mr. Tenet has written a lengthy response to Mr. Helgerson's report. That response, which has not been made public, may take on more importance now that he has abandoned a plan to publish a memoir. Mr. Tenet had negotiated to sell a book on his C.I.A. experiences for a reported $4.5 million, but he decided early this year not to sign the contract. A close associate said on Friday that Mr. Tenet might still write a book but was not working on one at present.
 Mr. Tenet's supporters say the inspector general report is seriously flawed because his investigators never talked to policy makers to get their views on the C.I.A.'s performance. Even some key people inside the agency were not interviewed, they say, including Charles E. Allen, whose title in 2001 was assistant director of central intelligence for collection.
 In 1998, after Al Qaeda's bombing of two American embassies in East Africa, it was Mr. Allen whom Mr. Tenet assigned to organize the agency's efforts against the terrorist network, according to testimony Mr. Tenet gave last year. He said that at the advice of Mr. Allen, he created a special unit with officers from the C.I.A., the eavesdropping National Security Agency and the satellite photo agency to meet daily and focus on Al Qaeda's leaders and headquarters in Afghanistan.
 Officials who have seen the report or been briefed on it said Thursday that it faulted Mr. Tenet as failing to develop a strategic plan against Al Qaeda and carry it out. His backers are asking how the inspector general could reach such a conclusion without interviewing the top aide responsible for such a plan. Mr. Helgerson and his assistants said through the C.I.A. public affairs office that they would not respond to criticisms of the report.
 Frederick P. Hitz, who served as the agency's inspector general from 1990 to 1998, said that, while he had not seen the report, he thought it was important to have a full accounting of individual responsibility for any failures.
 ''My only regret is that it's taken so long,'' Mr. Hitz said. ''It's a long time to keep those people who are being subjected to criticism in limbo.''
 Mr. Hitz noted that his report on how the agency failed to detect the treachery of Aldrich H. Ames, the C.I.A. officer who sold the agency's secrets to the Soviet Union, was completed in October 1994, just eight months after Mr. Ames was arrested.
 To criticize Mr. Tenet and others now for failures that occurred four, five or six years ago may seem unfair but is still necessary, Mr. Hitz said.
 ''It's an impossible situation,'' he said. ''But what they ought to do is declassify the report, release it and let the chips fall where they may.''
 Mr. Treverton, the former National Intelligence Council official, said he thought it would be pointless now to punish Mr. Tenet and other retired and still-serving officials, saying, ''It wasn't malfeasance, after all.''
 But he, too, said the report should be declassified and made public.
 ''The more we get out, the more we'll understand about what really happened,'' Mr. Treverton said.

HEADLINE: Shares Slip as Investors Fear Oil Prices Will Slow Growth

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Stocks fell this week as investors continued to focus on oil prices.
 For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.2 percent, to 1,205.10, below where it started the year. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.69 percent, to 2,120.77, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 10,397.29, down 1.53 percent.
The market has been struggling for weeks, despite a strong earnings season. Crude oil prices have increased about 52 percent this year, and investors are increasingly looking for signs that high oil prices might lead to decreased discretionary spending and harder times for consumer goods companies and other cyclical sectors. 
 ''Investors are just worried that oil at a certain price is going to start to slow down the economy,'' said Mark Arbeter, chief technical strategist for Standard & Poor's Equity Research. ''There's got to be a breaking point here where eventually it starts to hit people.''
 Crude oil prices closed at $66.13 a barrel yesterday, up from $65.35 the week before. Hurricane Katrina is headed into the Gulf of Mexico, where about 30 percent of the oil Americans use is produced. Crude oil hit a record high close of $67.49 a barrel on Thursday.
 Investors also reacted to a report that found consumer confidence fell in August for the first time in three months as Americans paid more at the pump and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that the period of low-risk premiums that investors have become accustomed to could end.
 In his speech at a Federal Reserve symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Greenspan said that interest rates could rise if investors became hesitant about the economic outlook and that could cause the value of assets, like houses, to decrease. 
 ''Any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and, as a consequence, lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of debt that supported higher prices,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
 Bond prices dropped in reaction to his speech, which some investors interpreted as a warning of inflated housing prices. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note closed at 10017/32, down 7/32 from Thursday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was 4.18 percent, up from 4.16 percent Thursday. 
 Also driving stock prices downward, the University of Michigan reported yesterday that consumer sentiment in August declined nearly 8 percent, to 89.1. Economists had been expecting a decrease from July's level of 96.5, but only to 92.5, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Another piece of bad news was the durable goods report released on Wednesday that showed the largest drop in orders since January 2004. The Commerce Department reported that orders of these goods dropped 4.9 percent in July.
 The Commerce Department also released a report Wednesday that showed that new-home sales increased 6.5 percent in July. But that followed news on Tuesday that sales of previously owned homes decreased to an annual rate of 7.16 million in July, from 7.35 million in June, according to the National Association of Realtors.
 Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was low yesterday at 1.18 billion shares, the lowest this week and well below the 1.5 billion daily average for the year. The dollar held its ground versus the euro and the yen. 
 The stock market's decline follows weeks of strong second-quarter earnings reports. About 96 percent of companies in the Standard & Poor's index have reported earnings for the second quarter, and, collectively, companies had 11.9 percent growth in earnings compared with the second quarter last year, said David Dropsey, a research analyst with Thomson Financial. 
 ''When it's all said and done, the earnings are still there,'' Mr. Dropsey said. ''The companies are making money hands down.''
 Even so, some companies acknowledged that rising gasoline prices were taking a toll. The national average for gasoline was $2.61 a gallon as of Monday, up 6.2 cents from the week earlier, and up about 73 cents from a year earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration.
 Petco Animal Supplies, for example, cut its full-year forecast because of rising gas prices and weaker-than- expected customer traffic in the second quarter, the company said Thursday. Also on Thursday, Dollar General, the discount retail chain, said high oil prices would hurt its earnings. Wal-Mart made similar statements on Aug. 16.
 Some investment advisers say this week's downturn in stocks presents an opportunity for investors. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said he thought oil was overpriced by about $20, and that the stock market was underpriced because investors were worried about high oil prices and a possible housing bubble.
 ''Why is it that in every reference to housing, it's a bubble but in every reference to oil, it's fundamental?'' Mr. Paulsen asked. ''In other words, housing is up because of wild speculation, and oil is up because of a fundamental shortage of oil in the world. Why couldn't it be the other way around? Why couldn't it be housing is fundamental and oil is a bubble?''

 BODY:
Gov. M. Jodi Rell said Friday that she would go to court to oppose the planned transfer of fighter jets from the Bradley Air National Guard base, saying that the 15 A-10 Warthogs affected were crucial to the state's homeland defense and that federal law required her permission to make the transfer.

 An independent federal commission that is reviewing Pentagon plans to close or realign hundreds of bases nationwide, including major bases in the New York metropolitan region, voted Friday to approve the Pentagon's plan to transfer some planes at Bradley, about 20 miles north of Hartford, to bases in other states and to take others out of service.
The plan includes moving a maintenance unit to Bradley as well as a unit capable of scrambling jets from other bases. But the base, which would have a net loss of about 70 jobs out of 926 total positions, no longer would have active aircraft. 
 ''It makes no sense to close an Air National Guard base when we are doing so much every day to promote and enhance homeland security,'' the governor said in a written statement.
 ''I continue to believe that a base like this cannot be closed without my permission,'' she said, ''and I have not, and will not, grant that permission.''
 Several governors have made similar claims and filed lawsuits. On Friday, while commissioners were deliberating over the air bases, a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the Pentagon did not have the right to deactivate the Air National Guard's 111th Fighter Wing without the permission of Gov. Edward G. Rendell. That ruling left some people unclear on whether the commission's decisions could be overruled.
 The Bradley base reduction came on the third day of votes by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
 In New York, the commission voted to keep open the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, the second-largest employer in Niagara County. Home to eight C-130 Hercules aircraft and eight KC-135 tankers, the base employs more than 640 people full time. The Pentagon had planned to close the base.
 ''What we saw on the map today is that the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station remains in business, planes stay here and there is a flying mission,'' said Neil E. Nolf, public affairs officer at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station.
 On Thursday, the commission overruled a Pentagon plan to close a finance and accounting unit at the Griffiss Business and Technology Park, in Rome, N.Y., a move that threatened as many as 400 jobs. Instead, it decided to expand work in Rome with as many as 600 new jobs.
 Connecticut, despite the removal of planes from the Bradley base, was perhaps the region's biggest winner in the base closing process. On Wednesday, the commission voted to keep open the Navy submarine base at Groton, preserving its 8,500 jobs and as many as 22,000 more that economists say are linked to it. 
 The commission also voted to close three small Army reserve centers, which the Pentagon said employ 56 people.
 New Jersey was less fortunate than Connecticut and New York. On Wednesday, the commission voted to close Fort Monmouth, an 88-year-old Army base that now employs 5,085 civilian workers and 467 military personnel. About 1,500 of the jobs at the base will be eliminated under the commission's plan; the rest will be moved to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
 Some New Jersey bases, including Picatinny Arsenal and Fort Dix, gained jobs through the transfer of units from elsewhere. But over all, New Jersey will give up more than 4,900 jobs.
 Some experts said the decision to keep open the Groton base, along with the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Me., was important to recruitment efforts and public support of the military in the Northeast.
 The Pentagon has closed or reduced several bases in the Northeast in recent years while expanding bases in the South and West. 
 ''When you're really looking long term at the future of the all-volunteer force and the future of the military, you really do want to attract from all parts of the country,'' said Eric Wertheim, a military industry consultant and author.

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Take Different Paths on Discouraging Gas Guzzling 

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
AS a long, hot August was drawing to a close, there were beginnings, endings and extensions. 
 Merck, facing thousands of lawsuits over Vioxx, hinted that it would offer settlements, but only in a few specific cases. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, began a four-month goodbye. And General Motors decided to extend its employee pricing to some newly arriving 2006 models. 
China and the United States took diverging paths. Still smarting from Unocal, China sought to satisfy part of its energy needs through a deal with a Canadian company. It also proposed stiff taxes on inefficient cars and trucks, on top of recently imposed fuel economy standards. The United States finally came ahead with its own (modest) overhaul of fuel economy standards for light-duty trucks.

LEGAL SHIFT? -- Merck does not plan to enter a broad global settlement in Vioxx cases, but its general counsel, Kenneth C. Frazier, suggested in an interview that it would consider settling lawsuits brought by people who took the drug for long periods and had few other risk factors for heart disease.
 Vioxx is a painkiller and arthritis medicine that has been shown to raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A week ago Friday, a jury found Merck liable for the death of a Texas man and ordered it to pay millions of dollars. It was the first personal injury lawsuit filed to reach trial, with possibly tens of thousands more waiting in the wings. 
 Mr. Frazier said Merck had not changed its position -- it had vowed to defend every suit. But now, he said, ''We would look at the facts of the case and make reasonable decisions.''
 Despite the whiff of a potential shift in strategy, Mr. Frazier repeated that Merck would appeal the Texas case. Hints of a settlement could lead to a rush of new cases, here and overseas. Citing the publicity after the Texas verdict, Merck sought postponement of a Vioxx lawsuit next month in a state court in New Jersey. A judge in New Orleans, meanwhile, set trial dates for four federal Vioxx cases, including one in November and three in early 2006.

A FOND FAREWELL -- With possible successors in the audience yesterday at a Federal Reserve symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Alan Greenspan gave what some considered to be his swan song speech.
 Mr. Greenspan, 78, is nearing the end of an 18-year tenure, which brought two recessions (compared with four in the previous 18 years), a stock market crash, ''irrational exuberance'' leading to a technology bubble and bust, and now a ''frothy'' real estate market.
 In the speech, ''Reflections on Central Banking,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''The performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, despite shocks that in the past would have surely produced marked economic contraction, offers the clearest evidence that we have benefited from an enhanced resilience and flexibility.''
 The biggest risk for his successor could be a possible collapse in the housing market since the Fed has kept interest rates low for so long. Among those said to be in the running are Ben S. Bernanke, President Bush's chief economic adviser; Martin S. Feldstein, an economist at Harvard University; and R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School. 

POWER PLAY -- To Westerners, China's move for energy assets this week may seem nothing more than a consolation prize after Cnooc's unsuccessful $18.5 billion bid this summer for Unocal. On Monday, China National Petroleum, the country's biggest state-owned oil company, agreed to pay $4.2 billion for PetroKazakhstan, a Canadian company.
 To India, however, the play signaled the most direct competition yet for energy between Asia's most populous countries. India's state-owned company, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, came up short as the asking price for PetroKazakhstan escalated beyond the $3.6 billion it was said to be willing to pay. 
 PetroKazakhstan has a complicated history. It is based in Calgary, Alberta, but managed from London with substantial reserves in Kazakhstan. Its shares are traded in New York. Six years ago, the company, then called Hurricane Hydrocarbons, was in bankruptcy protection. Now it stands to benefit from a deal that offers a rich premium.
 It is unclear whether Oil and Natural Gas will try to outbid its Chinese rival or if Kazakhstan will approve the deal. Kazakhstan has the right to pre-empt the sale of any oil property in the country. Even so, the company's chief executive, Bernard F. Isautier, says the law of the land cannot block the sale of the company itself. 

TALE OF TWO COUNTRIES -- While the Bush administration was unveiling a modest overhaul of fuel economy regulations for light-duty trucks, China drafted plans to impose steep taxes on cars and gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. Already this summer, China has adopted tougher fuel economy standards than those in the United States.
 Washington this week proposed increasing the average mileage of light trucks, including S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and minivans sold nationwide, to 24 miles a gallon for 2011 models, up from 21.2 miles a gallon in today's models. The rules would cost automakers an estimated $6 billion, officials said, but would save consumers $7 billion to $7.5 billion, based on prices of $1.51 to $1.58 a gallon.
 The administration will submit a final rule by April. The three-month comment period is certain to include discussion about the government's assumptions about gasoline mileage. Administration officials announced the proposal at a Los Angeles gas station, where regular gasoline was selling for $2.80 a gallon. In China, where the government-regulated retail price for gasoline averaged $1.73 a gallon this month, the planned taxes are expected to be adopted in the next couple of months.

DISCOUNT HEAVEN -- Back in Detroit, General Motors said it would extend employee discounts to 2006 models of large S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks. (Sorry, Hummer loyalists, your favorite vehicle has been excluded.)
 In the face of rising prices at the pump, could Americans finally be tiring of gas guzzlers like the Chevrolet Suburban and the Cadillac Escalade?
 The new discounts come on top of price cuts G.M. made on some models this month, which will further erode its profit margins. G.M. joins Ford Motor, which has been offering such discounts on some of its 2006 models. For their trouble, the two companies were rewarded with a junk debt rating by Moody's.
 Even though G.M.'s new marketing chief sought to move the company away from heavy discounts, weaning Americans from them proved harder than predicted. And if consumers are shying away from big trucks and S.U.V.'s, redesigned models will not begin appearing until next year.

U.A.W. President Suggests a Pay Reduction For Chief Executive of General Motors
Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, should take a pay cut as part of any deal for the United Automobile Workers to make concessions to help the company return to profitability, the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, left, said yesterday. The automaker, which expects its health care costs to total nearly $6 billion this year, has been in talks with the U.A.W. since April to try to pare some of the union medical benefits that Mr. Wagoner blames for hurting its ability to compete with Asian rivals. The union has also told G.M. that it wants the carmaker to take back as many as 7,000 workers from the Delphi Corporation as part of three-way talks aimed at helping Delphi improve its financial situation. Delphi, which was spun off by G.M. in 1999, employs about 24,000 U.A.W. members. A G.M. spokesman, Stefan Weinmann, said he was unable to comment on whether compensation for Mr. Wagoner and other executives had been discussed in G.M.'s negotiations with the U.A.W. (Reuters)

Precision Castparts to Buy Special Metals
The Precision Castparts Corporation said yesterday that it would buy the privately held Special Metals Corporation for about $540 million in cash. Special Metals, which emerged from bankruptcy two years ago, had revenue of $474 million in the first six months of the year, with operating profit of $26.5 million. Based in Huntington, W.Va., it is a leading producer of high-performance nickel-based alloys, which Precision Castparts uses in many of its forged jet engine and industrial turbine products. (Reuters)

D&M Holdings to Leave Portable Digital Player Market
D&M Holdings, the Japanese maker of the premium audio-electronics brands Denon, Marantz and McIntosh, said yesterday that it would exit the market for portable digital audio players, because poor sales of its Rio line were a drag on the bottom line. D&M said it would stop making the pocket-size music players by Sept. 30. D&M, which is 51.6 percent owned by RHJ International, a holding company linked to the buyout firm Ripplewood, will retain the Rio brand and trademark and will continue to provide service and sales support to retailers and customers of its Rio brand. D&M reported yesterday that its net loss widened to 717 million yen ($6.5 million) for the first quarter ended June 30, from 530 million yen in the period a year ago. Sales fell to 18.75 billion yen, from 19.22 billion yen. (Reuters)

 British Economy Expanded Faster Than Expected 
The economy of Britain expanded 0.5 percent in the second quarter, a faster clip than initially estimated, even though consumer spending rose at its slowest pace in a decade, a government report showed yesterday. Analysts warned that the results could cause the Bank of England to hold back on any further interest rate cuts. Earlier this month, the central bank lowered its benchmark rate to 4.5 percent, the first cut in two years. (AP)

 S.E.C. Starts Formal Inquiry Into Immucor 
Immucor, which makes blood-test products, said the Securities and Exchange Commission had stepped up its investigation into payments made by the company's Italian unit to people with ties to government medical facilities. The agency elevated its informal inquiry to a formal investigation, Immucor said, a legal move allowing the commission to compel testimony and subpoena documents. The investigation began after Immucor reported a violation of requirements under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company, which is based in Norcross, Ga., said in a statement. Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the S.E.C. can punish a company with United States-traded shares that pays bribes to secure business in other countries. (Bloomberg News)

 Hyundai to Add a Sport Utility Vehicle and a Wagon
The Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea said yesterday that it would not sell a minivan in the United States. Instead the company plans to add a seven-passenger sport utility vehicle that is larger than its Tucson and Santa Fe models in late 2006, and a large wagonlike utility vehicle about two years later. Hyundai, based in Seoul, more than doubled its United States sales in the last five years and plans to sell 485,000 cars and light trucks this year, a 16 percent increase from 2004. (Bloomberg News)

 Spain Plans to Reduce Dependence on Coal and Oil
Spain approved a five-year 23.6 billion euro ($29 billion) plan yesterday to increase the use of renewable energy. The country is seeking to reduce its dependence on coal to cut pollution levels and limit its exposure to oil prices. The plan, which runs through 2010, aims for renewable energy to produce 12.1 percent of the total demanded by then, the Industry Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. With the new plan, Spain wants to reach 20,155 megawatts of wind energy capacity in five years, compared with a previous goal of 13,000 megawatts. The government will finance 2.9 percent of the plan and the rest will be financed by companies, the statement said. (Bloomberg News)

Eaton Offers to Acquire Domnick Hunter
The Eaton Corporation made a bid yesterday for Domnick Hunter of Britain, challenging an offer from the Parker Hannifin Corporation for control of the company, which makes filters and has a growing business protecting against biochemical weapons. Eaton offered $:242 million ($436 million) for Domnick Hunter. Parker Hannifin had offered $:232 million ($418 million). Domnick Hunter, which had sales of $280 million last year, did not comment. (Reuters)

 Earnings Soar at Royal Bank of Canada
Third-quarter profit at Royal Bank of Canada jumped 32 percent, driven by domestic banking and capital markets operations, the bank said yesterday. Net income at the bank, based in Toronto, rose to 979 million Canadian dollars ($816 million), or 1.48 Canadian dollars a share, in the three months ended July 31, from 743 million Canadian dollars, or 1.12 a share. Analysts had expected the bank to earn 1.42 Canadian dollars a share. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: The Party's on the Best Sidewalks of New York

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEE NUTTER

 BODY:
AS Lori Coats dropped into a folding chair near the stoop of her apartment building on West 21st Street, she let out a deep sigh. ''This is fabulous,'' she said, cradling her 18-month-old baby, Cate, in one arm and a plastic cup of sangria in her other hand.
 Her neighbor Robert Walker nodded agreement as he appraised the picnic table set up with plates of focaccia and pasta salad next to a giant pitcher of homemade sangria. Two neighbors from 10th Avenue maneuvered awkwardly through the crowd perched on the stoop or on chairs. When Mr. Walker heard a favorite disco classic on the iPod hooked up to computer speakers, he said, ''That's my song.'' 
 Long a tradition in Harlem, Brooklyn and working-class neighborhoods throughout New York City, the summer stoop party has been a rarity on streets of $3,000-a-month apartments and single-family brownstones in the heart of Chelsea. 
 But lately residents of that neighborhood, as well as of Greenwich Village, SoHo, NoLIta, Gramercy Park and even the Upper West Side have been taking inspiration from uptown to give stoop parties of their own.
 ''I'll run into one about once a week,'' said Stephen Heighton, an owner of the restaurant Elmo in Chelsea. ''This is the first summer I've seen anyone really partying on their stoops downtown like they do uptown. Hanging out in the open with your friends, watching the world go by, is usually done in a more formalized way down here, like in outdoor cafes and outside of gallery openings.''
 Merely sitting on a stoop to take in the cool of the evening, as people in many neighborhoods do in summer, does not qualify as a stoop party. A party needs music, food, chairs and drinks in some combination. And while the details of the traditional uptown stoop party tend to be more uniform -- rap and salsa music, barbeque grills and beer are staples -- Lower Manhattan versions include entertaining friends with bossa nova and expensive beer in paper bags, apartment building get-togethers with finger food on picnic tables and classic disco. 
 ''Part of the appeal is that it's real and out in the open,'' said Tim Ranney, a party promoter and publicist, who has friends over on Thursday nights to drink margaritas on his stoop outside the landmark Colonnade Row on Lafayette Street in NoHo. ''It's like a salon. Everyone is invited.''
 Why stoops in Harlem are peppered on summer nights with barbeque grills and boomboxes while the stoops of Lower Manhattan are used more as Carrie did in ''Sex and the City'' -- as a platform for the occasional late-night talk with a friend, good-night kiss from a date or to smoke the solitary cigarette -- is an old story that is mostly about economics.
 ''Up until the mid-19th century serving refreshments and socializing on the stoops was done by every income group all over the city,'' said Charles Lockwood, the author of ''Bricks and Brownstone: The New York Row House 1783-1929.'' ''But in the late 19th century the tenement districts became hugely overpopulated by immigrants swarming on the stoops. That created a stigma to the stoop, and by that time it became obligatory for the upper classes to leave the city for the summer anyway, so partying on the stoop went out of favor.'' 
 Similar social currents continue today. In affluent neighborhoods with an air-conditioner in every window, plentiful sidewalk cafes and ready access to a summer getaway, the social potential of the stoop is minimized. Rare is the Upper East Side brownstone stoop used for a summer party. 
 But in neighborhoods with fewer air-conditioners or sidewalk restaurants, families in need of a large communal space naturally find the stoop ideal. 
 ''In Harlem your whole extended family just winds up spilling out on the street because you need the space, and it doesn't cost anything,'' said Joaquin Maceo Rosa, 31, an actor, who grew up on 105th Street and still lives in the neighborhood. 
 The increased social traffic in the last five years between Harlem and Lower Manhattan, as downtowners have moved uptown and in some cases, like Mr. Walker's, moved back downtown, has helped reintroduce the stoop as a place for a small party. 
 ''Living up in Harlem, I used to look at all the stoop parties and think, oh my God, they are having so much fun,'' said Mr. Walker, the author of a comic book series called Delete. ''That's partly why we started doing them.''
 Recently gentrified neighborhoods like Chelsea, full of stoops from pre-World War I construction, have also had time to mature, so that enough people have lived there long enough for neighbors to know one another well. Although these neighborhoods are high rent, they are often less pretentious, residents say, than other affluent areas of the city, and people are more comfortable visiting on a stoop. Many residents boast of loving New York in August and of having no need to flee to the Hamptons or upstate. 
 It is not even necessary to have a stoop proper to have a sidewalk party. Josh Hughes and Brian Ermanski began inviting friends to daily afternoon outdoor parties in NoLIta in the spring, with seating on trash bins and benches. They crank up the Velvet Underground on a jam box and crack open their Negra Modelo beer in paper bags. 
 ''In the middle of all those models and filmmakers and rich women heading off to eat at Cafe Havana, it definitely creates a small scene,'' said Mr. Hughes, the author of ''Punk Shui: Home Design for Anarchists,'' scheduled for publication next year by Three Rivers Press. ''But that's a part of the statement we're making, that we're not above it.''
 Both Mr. Hughes and Ms. Coats said that passers-by at the gatherings on their blocks have sometimes muttered that partying on the street is ''ghetto.'' 
 One who passed by and formed that thought, Ron Robinson, a beauty-trend consultant, said it was not meant as a derogatory comment. ''Growing up in the outer boroughs,'' Mr. Robinson said, ''this seems to me like a long-gone pastime which is reoccurring.''
 ''I miss it,'' he added.
 With stoop parties popping up in new neighborhoods, they raise not just the occasional eyebrow but also questions about legality and propriety. Will a neighbor complain to the building management or to the police about loud music? What about drinking alcohol on a stoop? (It is illegal, though the law is not widely enforced if no disturbance is taking place.) And what is the proper etiquette for passers-by?
 Robin Lynn, the director of Municipal Art Society tours, said she recently walked through a stoop party on the Upper West Side three times in one night and did not know how to react. ''Each time for a few seconds I was in their party,'' she said. ''Do I stop and comment? Am I breaking into their party? Was it private or public?''
 Ms. Lynn said she simply walked on by, quietly envious. ''It made me wish I had a stoop,'' she said. ''Maybe I'll just start traveling around with chips.''

BREAD AND ROSES
Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle
for the American Dream.
By Bruce Watson.
Illustrated. 337 pp. Viking. $24.95.
 It's one of the legends of the American labor movement: how 20,000 immigrant workers of some dozen nationalities, led by colorful figures like Big Bill Haywood and the Rebel Girl, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, shut down the textile mills of Lawrence, Mass., in the winter of 1912, and came away with large raises and better working conditions. The romance of their victory is captured in the slogan ''bread and roses'' -- a demand for ''a sharing of life's glories,'' in the words of a poem by James Oppenheim. Bruce Watson's book about the Lawrence strike takes the title of the poem (later set to music and sung by, among others, Judy Collins and Ani DiFranco), but Watson is no romantic. As he points out in his epilogue, Oppenheim's poem originally appeared a month before the strike, and the supposedly inspirational photograph of a Lawrence woman carrying a sign that read ''We want bread, but we want roses, too!'' has never been found. ''The strike belongs not to the realms of poetry or politics but to the people who waged or witnessed it,'' Watson writes. 
 In place of romance, Watson offers a fast-paced, well-researched narrative. He finds room for sketches of the central players, like Angelo Rocco, an Italian former weaver who invited the Industrial Workers of the World, in the person of the organizer Joe Ettor, to Lawrence, as well as of the radical orators Haywood and Flynn and the millowner William Wood. He provides information about textile manufacturing and immigration in New England. He relies heavily on contemporary accounts, including those from the immigrant press, and he carefully sorts through rumors. ''Bread and Roses'' is packed with facts, but Watson, a journalist who has written for Smithsonian and The Boston Globe, makes it an exciting read. 
 He shows how the different nationalities came together -- the strike settlement was read in a dozen languages, from Arabic to Portuguese -- though he does not explain how unusual this was or what the organization of unskilled, ethnically diverse workers meant for the future of the labor movement. The strikers invented or developed new techniques -- the soup kitchen that served as a community center, the constant singing, the publicity-grabbing gesture (borrowed from the Italian labor movement) of sending hundreds of strikers' children to safety and security in New York and other cities.
 ''Bread and roses'' may not have been the strike's slogan, but it is easy to see how the mistake arose, because women were in the center of things, from Flynn's speeches to women's takeover of the picketing to the financial contributions of wealthy New York women, who were learning, in the aftermath of the Triangle fire, to connect their fight for the vote to the struggles of women workers. The strike was a sort of ''Where's Waldo?'' for the politics of the next decade: in this corner, Margaret Sanger, a nurse, examines the refugee children of Lawrence as they arrive in New York City; over there, Calvin Coolidge, a state senator from Northampton, Mass., heads a commission investigating conditions in Lawrence. 
 Now the mills at Lawrence house boutiques and high-tech companies, while America is once again home to thousands of low-paid immigrant workers. But in 1912, unlike the present, national opinion was beginning to turn against the worst abuses of an unregulated economy. In the following decade, many states would attempt to eliminate child labor and mandate a minimum wage. President William Howard Taft, no friend of labor, greeted a delegation of boys from the Lawrence mills and gave them $1,000 for the soup kitchen. Mrs. Taft, resplendent in a feathered hat, attended the Congressional hearings on the strike. You might call that compassionate conservatism.

HEADLINE: How Nicolas Got His Groove Back

BYLINE: By Cathy Horyn

 BODY:
Nicolas Ghesquiere likes his models at Balenciaga to race down the runway. He feels it gives his clothes the energy of sports, though Ghesquiere, the son of a former swimming coach and golf-course manager, isn't athletic himself. He is slight of build, with black hair, fashionable stubble and light-blue eyes that essentially tell you everything, from intense interest to rapid disenchantment. Last March, after his fall show -- a streak of camel coats and jackets piped in fur that put editors in a good mood and announced a more mature sensibility -- Ghesquiere was backstage greeting guests. Among the first to arrive was Francois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of the French luxury and retail group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and technically Ghesquiere's boss. As a rule, backstage moments yield little information; if anything, they tend to reinforce the impression that the fashion world is insincere, the tepid congratulations offered in exchange for an advertising page. But in the several minutes that Ghesquiere and Pinault talked with each other, with Pinault speaking quietly and without gesture, it was apparent that the warmth between the two men was genuine. 
 Five years ago, Ghesquiere had the fashion world in the palm of his hand, his ultrathin pants and romantic high-necked tops defining a generation of sullen waifs as surely as Saint Laurent's pea coat and saharienne projected the battle lines of the late 1960's. ''I do worship his pants,'' gushed the girl of that moment, Chloe Sevigny, in Vogue in March 2001, saying that once she found his pants, ''my life definitely got a lot better.'' That summer Gucci bought Balenciaga, securing, it seemed, the future of the house as well as that of the then-30-year-old Ghesquiere. Finally he would have the financial support of a big luxury group and the brand know-how of its chief executive, Domenico de Sole, and creative director, Tom Ford. Then came Sept. 11, transforming everybody's sense of security. Within a year of the Gucci deal, Ghesquiere had acquired a reputation for being difficult. It was said he refused to work with certain Gucci Group executives. It was said he snubbed Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, by not showing up at one of her events. It definitely did not help his reputation as fashion's new messiah when he was caught copying, line for line, a patchwork vest by the late Kaisik Wong, a California designer of the 70's.
 By the summer of 2003, as Ford and de Sole were in the middle of fervent contract negotiations with Gucci's majority owner, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, executives of PPR wanted to shut Balenciaga down. Despite its magical name and best-selling handbag, the house suddenly appeared to be less viable than Gucci's other brands: Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen. And Ghesquiere himself seemed closed down, engulfed by some oppressive force, a mood reflected in the flower- and lingerie-inspired dresses he showed in October 2003. He says now: ''I loved that collection, but if you look at the clothes, everything is overfitted. It was a suffering moment.'' He smiles and, with a laugh, adds, ''And I was determined to suffer!''
 Today, all has been drastically reversed. Balenciaga, according to Pinault, expects to be profitable by early 2007, and it could come even sooner, say people close to the house, based on strong sales of the last two seasons. The company has recently added several new collections, including a selection of moderately priced separates, and Edition, demicouture dresses based on originals from the Balenciaga archive. Ghesquiere has expanded the shoe line; this fall it will include a chic, low-heeled boot inspired by a style he found in the archive. 
 He has also designed a new handbag, a compact shoulder style with silver hardware that suits the more sophisticated look of his recent collections, which, not surprisingly, have found a wider audience -- not just the model waifs but also women like the 52-year-old actress Isabelle Huppert. And next year, the designer will collaborate in a Balenciaga exhibition at the Musee de la Mode et du Textile in Paris, the first major retrospective of Cristobal Balenciaga's designs in more than 30 years.
 But the most conspicuous change is in Ghesquiere himself. He is happier, lighter in spirit and, when I saw him in April in Paris, utterly candid about how he acquired the ''difficult'' rap and how the legendary house he rebuilt nearly came apart. As he said one afternoon in his apartment, a rental overlooking the Bon Marche department store in the same Left Bank neighborhood where, 15 years ago, he was peddling African statues to galleries, ''I feel I'm in a very good moment of my 
 life -- my real life.'' His boyfriend of five years, James Kaliardos, the makeup artist and a founder of Visionaire, says that success made a difference. ''It was really about the numbers changing and the company backing him up more,'' Kaliardos says. ''He didn't care why. He was just happy they did.'' Myriam Schaefer, who gave Ghesquiere his first big job in fashion, as her assistant at Jean Paul Gaultier, in 1991, and who today works with him on handbag design at Balenciaga, agrees. ''I think Nicolas grew up, really,'' she says. ''And he's a businessman -- or, let's say, he has a special nose for business now. He's so sure. And that's really why he's more peaceful and less anxious now.''
 And to think it all could have gone very differently. In the last days of October 2003, while Ford and de Sole were in the throes of negotiations with PPR, Ghesquiere had made up his mind to leave Balenciaga. He felt that de Sole and Ford saw Balenciaga only as a niche brand and didn't fully appreciate that in a short time it had connected with a generation of women. He was convinced that the Balenciaga clothes coming out of Gucci factories in Italy looked too ''industrialized'' for a French label. And to compound matters, he had barely spoken to Ford and de Sole in months. On a Monday, a despondent Ghesquiere called his father. When Ghesquiere was in his teens, the two had gone through a bad patch, a classic war of wills, but in recent years they had grown close. Now he told his father: ''I want to quit. I'm too unhappy. I feel my clothes are not selling. I feel the environment is not correct.'' His father agreed that he should leave. Ghesquiere said, ''All right, I'm going to call Domenico.''
 He never got the chance. The next day, Ghesquiere received an urgent message from Gucci headquarters in London, telling him to call de Sole. He switched on his television, where he heard the news that the rest of the luxury-goods world would learn in a matter of hours: Ford and de Sole were leaving Gucci. After a year of contract negotiations, they had failed to save their own jobs. One career move had been averted by the unexpected turn of two others. And neither Ford nor de Sole knew of Ghesquiere's plan until they were reached for this article.
 Although Ford and de Sole were regarded as fashion's great communicators -- communicating desire and urgency but also the idea that creative success was inseparable from commercial success -- they seemed oddly constricted where Ghesquiere was concerned. 
 Under the terms of a separation agreement with PPR, Ford and de Sole are not permitted to speak publicly about Gucci. Both sides, though, were eminently frustrated, especially by 2003. There were extenuating factors: on top of the negotiations, de Sole and Ford were dealing with the economic fallout from Sept. 11. Gucci, the group's moneymaker, became their focus. And while they understood Ghesquiere's desire to protect Balenciaga's image, they didn't believe the industrial process was anathema to a modern brand, and they urged him to spend more time at the factories to get the look he wanted.
 When I spoke with Kaliardos in July in Paris, he said: ''I don't think there was a miscommunication with Domenico and Tom. There was a lack of communication.'' Given the promise of strategic support, he was surprised to see Ghesquiere doing so much on his own, and from what he could tell, Balenciaga didn't seem that much better off than it had been under its former owner, especially after Gucci gave Ghesquiere the choice of doing either shows or advertising. ''The only thing they could say to him was, 'No,''' Kaliardos told me. ''The business strategy was, 'We've got to cut the budget.' Every single day, I swear, Nicolas would have some shocking business disaster to deal with. Things just didn't make sense.'' More troubling to Kaliardos was that he started to hear gossip about Ghesquiere. ''There was a moment when it was suddenly 'Nicolas is difficult,''' he says. ''I know Tom was saying that around, to Anna Wintour and other people. And it's not true. Nicolas is very clear about things. He doesn't play games.'' (Ford had no comment.) Truth be told, Ghesquiere was playing a game of his own. Referring to some wisdom he often heard from his father -- ''To live happy, you have to hide'' -- he says now: ''I was not helping myself at all. Really, I was hiding -- and not being happy.'' He says that some of the blame for the impasse at Balenciaga rests with de Sole and Ford, ''but I played a big role in that, too.''
 It was perhaps inevitable that Ghesquiere would run into problems at Gucci, but it was also surprising. His career has been characterized by extreme vigilance, as people who know him point out. Marie-Amelie Sauve, the stylist on his shows since he took over Balenciaga, in 1997, says: ''He can see the future, a point very far away, and he wants to get there. For me, this is Nicolas -- seeing an idea very far away and having the character to get to that point.'' And Schaefer recalls Ghesquiere's telling her, when he left Gaultier after two years: '''You had better go, too. Because you're not going to stay here.' And I was surprised when he said that, because I was a good friend of Jean Paul's. Why should I leave? But Nicolas knew. I left 10 years later, when Jean Paul fired me.''
 So, was it success at Balenciaga that helped Ghesquiere get his groove back, or was it -- as Robert Polet, the new chief executive at Gucci, suggests -- something else?
 Ghesquiere was born in a suburb of Lille, but spent his childhood in Loudun, a medieval town in the Loire region, close to his mother's home in Saumur, which was the birthplace of Chanel. At 15, Ghesquiere announced to his parents that he wanted to work in fashion, and with his father's help, he composed a letter to several designers. That summer he spent a month at Agnes B. in Paris. ''I watched, I photocopied, I made the coffee,'' he says with a laugh. The next summer, he pressed his case further, and was taken on by the designer Corinne Cobson. When he informed his parents that he was quitting school to work full-time for Cobson, a battle broke out with his father. He did finish high school, leaving soon after graduation, but the rift with his father remained. Ghesquiere recalls the departure scene: ''I said to him: 'I'm going into fashion. I'm not going to become an athletics teacher, the thing you want. I'm going back to Paris, and I'm never coming back.''' Many an artistic career has been launched on similar words. Still, he was just 18. ''I mean, it was like a movie,'' he says. ''The mother crying and me crying also. The station with the luggage. I'm arriving in Paris.''
 I ask Ghesquiere how much money he had, and he guesses $500. His mother had slipped him a credit card for emergencies (''It's always the mother''), and he stayed with a friend from Loudun who was having a moment as a transvestite. ''He was not a boyfriend,'' Ghesquiere says with a quick smile. Ghesquiere was still several years away from sorting out his own sexuality, which would be clarified when he met the shoe designer Pierre Hardy, his partner until Ghesquiere met Kaliardos. ''I had a girlfriend, before Pierre, but I realized very late that it was not for me so bon!'' He laughs. His humor, I saw, is vastly overshadowed by the severity of his clothes. 
 After six months selling his statues, he met Schaefer, then Gaultier's right-hand person. She hired him on the spot. ''He was absolutely charming -- cute, polite, delicious,'' she says. ''As soon as I saw him, I wanted him as my assistant and not anybody else. He was intelligent, and he knew what he wanted to do.''
 Gaultier was then at the height of his creative powers, and working for him, Ghesquiere told me, had been his dream. At the same time, he says: ''I was totally disappointed by the human relations in the studio. It was horrible. People were insulting me because they hated Myriam. It was that extreme thing you find in fashion -- 'You are doing right, you are doing wrong, you have good taste, you have no taste.' I discovered all that in a short time.''
 Over the next two years, Ghesquiere supported himself as a freelance knitwear designer, regularly taking the train at 6 a.m. to factories in the east of France, where he learned to deal with the blunt demands of provincial buyers (''Stretch doesn't sell!'' ''No black!''). When a position opened at Balenciaga, he jumped at it, though the job was actually a step down. He would be designing, among other things, funeral clothes for the Japanese licensing market. Ghesquiere was then 23, and Balenciaga little more than a distinguished name, its assets mainly consisting of some perfumes and an archive. I ask Ghesquiere what he saw in Balenciaga. ''I was looking at other designers -- there was so much Balenciaga in Yohji,'' he says. ''I thought, This is a modern brand.'' Two years later he was given the main line to design -- by default; the house's owner, Jacques Konckier, had wanted Helmut Lang.
 Those first collections were highly conceptual, as Sauve knows firsthand. ''It was all about the shape, these skinny pants with these bubble tops,'' she explains. ''Actually, it was just about seeing the legs, like a drawing. With Nicolas, he likes to keep trying and trying something until he is surprised.'' Schaefer was not impressed. She told Ghesquiere she didn't understand the clothes, nor the way the models looked -- without makeup, their hands in their pockets as they walked pitched forward on high heels. ''I said: 'What kind of woman dresses like this? It's not fashion. Do you know one girl like this?''' By the time Ford telephoned Ghesquiere in December 2000 and invited him for a drink, there was an army of women walking pitched forward, as if into a fierce wind.
 When I saw Polet, Gucci's new chief executive, in July at the men's shows in Paris, he said this account of the events at Gucci squared with his first impression of Ghesquiere. ''You had someone who wasn't in sync with his environment, the environment wasn't appreciating what he did and he was distinctly unhappy as a reaction,'' Polet told me. Although Ghesquiere says he now has more direct communication with Gucci executives, and with Pinault, and that one of the first things that Polet did was to put a dozen people from Balenciaga around a table and have them talk -- something that had never happened before -- Polet insists that the real change came from Ghesquiere. ''He found himself,'' Polet says. ''He's now in sync with his intuition. Instead of reacting, I think he took charge.''
 This is evident in the clothes -- in the sharp, more sophisticated lines and fabrics, the subtle references to the spacey 60's and the years when Courreges was an assistant at the house. Ghesquiere's Balenciaga has always projected a naive futurism, but as he says: ''I think there is also something typically French. Not Parisian -- French, really.'' He could be describing himself when he says that Balenciaga is ''a mix of the center of France and the north near Belgium and a little Paris.'' He continues, ''It's a certain irony, a certain authority and confidence.'' The clothes also reflect a belated realization that the industrial process can actually open his mind to new ideas. As he says, ''I think we can really play between the industrial and the craft.''
 Ghesquiere's contract expires next July, and he doesn't mind hinting that he'd like to do something else, maybe start his own line. ''I want to continue at Balenciaga, of course,'' he says. ''But it's always good to be asked even if you refuse. It's very good to be asked.'' We were finishing up a long lunch at Le Duc, a restaurant popular with the French establishment. His comment had to do with respect, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. I don't think for a minute he'll leave Balenciaga, not now. ''I have the feeling it's becoming more and more the work I was supposed to do seven years ago,'' he says. ''It's becoming real. And I don't have to fight as much. It feels like a starting point.''

HEADLINE: Finding Holes in the Housing Bubble

BYLINE: By David M. Muchnick. 
David M. Muchnick is a consultant on affordable housing and community economic development.

 BODY:
IN 2004, New York City approved building permits for 25,208 new housing units. That's up 17 percent from the city's average annual gain of 20,874 during the 1990's. 
 The housing boom may be a boon to many, but it has its drawbacks. Sure, it has been a blessing for owners who can afford property tax increases, cash out equity or refinance debt. It's created jobs and produced thousands of mostly expensive new houses, condominiums and apartments. And it has filled the coffers of city and state governments with billions of dollars.
In doing this, housing construction has performed its historic role as countercyclical ballast, helping the city and state to weather a recession and a recovery that has created minimal jobs in the economy's other industries. 
 But the boom has also worsened the affordable housing crisis in New York City and across the state. It has burdened homeowners with rising assessments and property taxes -- putting elderly people on fixed incomes in particular difficulty. It has priced first-time buyers and young adults out of the market. It has burdened apartment dwellers with the rent increases that accompany rising taxes and operating costs. And, it has driven up the cost of land, leading to higher construction costs and making housing assistance all the more necessary.
 Permits and production are opening numbers, but never the whole show. During the last decade, 34,071 new units were built in Manhattan, but there was a net increase in total housing units of only 13,017. Why the difference? Presumably, 21,054 units were demolished, vacated or converted to nonresidential use. Of Manhattan's 34,071 new units, 26,503 were occupied by renters, but the borough had a net gain of only 1,463 renter households. Once again, 25,040 units must have been demolished, vacated or converted to nonresidential use, co-ops, condominiums or other forms of owner-occupancy. Oddly, perhaps, in this context, were it not for construction of 14,158 rental apartments in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits during the decade, Manhattan would have suffered a net loss of housing.
 In the boroughs outside Manhattan, the opposite occurred. New construction produced 97,870 units, but the net increase from 1990 to 2000 was 195,726 because of rehabilitation and restoration of inventory. But only 10,088 apartments, or 5 percent, were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits. 
 Amid all the construction, housing costs have risen much faster than New Yorkers' ability to pay them. Citywide, median household income rose 34 percent from 1989 to 2003, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 93 percent, the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 74 percent and the median monthly gross rent for all apartments rose 64 percent. 
 As a result, 1.163 million New York City households, or 49 percent, had to spend 30 percent or more of their income on housing in 2003. That's up 33 percent, or 290,000 households, since 1990.
 So, where does this leave police recruits who join the force at the new collective bargaining agreement's starting salary, which is an annual rate of $25,100 for the first six months? If they can't find a friend or a spouse with a job to share housing costs, then, most likely, they're living either at home with their parents or some place 50 to 100 miles out in the Hudson Valley.
 At $25,100, new police officers can afford no more than $625 a month if they are to use less than 30 percent of their income for housing, a cap commonly recommended by lenders and other financial advisers. So, they cannot afford the median cost of owning a home or the fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in any of the city's boroughs or its suburban counties. They would have to use 51 percent of their income to pay the city's current $1,075 two-bedroom fair-market rent. 
 Nor can new recruits afford the median rent, and thus half the apartments, in any of the city's boroughs as well as in Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess Counties. They would have to use more than 34 percent of their income to pay the median rent in the Bronx and more than 41 percent in Queens. Only by moving out 100 miles into rural Sullivan County and commuting almost two hours each way, would they be able to afford the median rent (about $575) and half the apartments there.
 After six months and a bump in salary to $32,700, new officers can afford up to $818 a month, but their choices widen only a little. They will be able to manage the two-bedroom fair-market rents in rural Ulster ($735) and Sullivan ($666) Counties. And, they can afford the median rent in the Bronx ($719) and Brooklyn ($790) as well as in Ulster (about $630) and Sullivan (about $575) Counties. 
 Having so few housing choices is a predicament shared by about 200,000 young adults in the boroughs outside Manhattan, 31,000 in the Hudson Valley and 100,000 on Long Island.
 These 20- to 34-year-olds are prevented by high rents and low rental vacancy rates from leaving their parents' homes and forming their own household at a rate comparable to young adults living in other parts of New York State. Forty-nine percent of the young adults in the boroughs outside Manhattan are still living with their parents or other older adults, compared with a median of 35 percent in 34 counties in the state's major metropolitan areas and labor markets. 
 Assuming they would double up with a working spouse or triple up with working roommates to get a place of their own, these 200,000 young adults represent pent-up demand for between 67,000 to 100,000 affordable apartments. Their suburban counterparts represent potential demand for 44,000 to 66,000 more.
 If they look for a place in the city, they will run up against, and worsen, the estimated 177,000-unit shortage of housing with rents below $800. If they look outside the city, they will increase the pressures on suburban residents who face their own affordable housing shortage. Conversely, if young adults from the suburbs look for places in the city, they will increase the pressures on the city's affordable inventory.
 The affordable housing shortage transcends city limits just as it belies imprecise generalities about a housing bubble. Supply is so short, demand is so strong, and regional connections are so pervasive that substantial new production, like the city's 68,000-unit new development initiative, is both necessary and sustainable. 
 Greater state and local protection for the rent-stabilization program and for Mitchell-Lama and other assisted and regulated developments, which together supply 80 percent of the city's apartments with rents below $800, is also critical.
 So, too, are stronger interventions to stem predatory lending and foreclosures among first-time home buyers, stronger local incentives and requirements for the inclusion of affordable units in new developments, regional smart-growth strategies to contain sprawl while creating sites for housing and conserving open space, increases in Albany's capital budget for affordable housing and more persistent pressure to defend and expand Washington's investment in affordable housing and community development.
 In short, we need more constructive action and less bubble-blowing.

HEADLINE: Finding Holes in the Housing Bubble

BYLINE: By David M. Muchnick.

 BODY:
THE median value of Long Island's single-family homes skyrocketed between 1990 and 2003, doubling in Suffolk County to $333,251 from $165,200 and rising 81 percent in Nassau to $378,152 from $208,500, according to census data. Simultaneously, Long Island's population of people aged 20 to 34 fell 20 percent. There were 127,401 fewer young adults on the island in 2000 than in 1990. (Meanwhile, that population declined only 5 percent in the nation as a whole.) 
 What does one have to do with the other? The housing boom may be a boon to many, but it's been a bane to young people. Sure, it has been a blessing for owners who can afford property tax increases, cash out equity or refinance debt. It's created jobs and produced thousands of mostly expensive new houses, condominiums and apartments, and it has filled the coffers of state and local governments with billions of dollars.
In doing this, housing construction has performed its historic role as countercyclical ballast, helping communities and the state to weather a recession and a recovery that has created minimal jobs in the economy's other industries. 
 But the boom has also worsened Long Island's affordable housing crisis. It has burdened homeowners with rising assessments and property taxes -- putting elderly people on fixed incomes in particular difficulty. It has burdened apartment dwellers with the rent increases that accompany rising taxes and operating costs. It has driven up the cost of land, leading to higher construction costs and making housing assistance all the more necessary. And most ominously for the future of Long Island, it has priced first-time buyers and young adults out of the market.
 During the last decade, 62,313 housing units were built on Long Island, more than 12,000 in Nassau and just shy of 50,000 in Suffolk. An additional 6,634 units were rehabilitated or converted from nonresidential use. 
 Of the total 68,947 new and added units, 14,334 were rentals. But only 1,472 -- a paltry 2 percent -- were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits. Nassau had 376 and Suffolk had 1,096.
 Amid all the construction, housing costs have risen much faster than Long Islanders' ability to pay them. Nassau's median household income rose 49 percent from 1989 to 2003, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 78 percent; the median monthly expense for property taxes, insurance and utilities rose 109 percent; the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 62 percent; and the median monthly gross rent for apartments rose 62 percent. 
 Likewise, Suffolk's median household income rose 43 percent, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 72 percent; the median monthly expense for property taxes, insurance and utilities rose 86 percent; the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 62 percent; and the median monthly gross rent for apartments rose 41 percent. 
 As a result, 4 out of 10 Long Island households, or 333,279, had to spend 30 percent or more of their income on housing in 2003. That's up 28 percent, or 73,530 households, since 1990.
 So, where does this leave young adults starting work at salaries of, say, $25,100 a year, like secretaries, hospital technicians or even New York City's new police recruits? If they can't find a friend or a spouse with a job to share housing costs, then, most likely, they're living off the island or still at home with their parents.
 At $25,100, young workers can afford no more than $625 a month if they are to use less than 30 percent of their income for housing, a cap commonly recommended by lenders and other financial advisers. So they cannot afford the median cost of owning a home or the fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment on Long Island, in the city or in the nearby Hudson Valley. They would have to use 59 percent of their income to pay the island's current $1,225 two-bedroom fair-market rent. 
 Nor can these workers afford the median rent, and thus half the apartments, on Long Island, in any New York City borough, or in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess Counties. They would have to use 42 percent of their incomes to pay the median rent in Queens, 38 percent in Brooklyn. Only by moving out 130 miles into rural Sullivan County and commuting more than two hours each way, would they be able to afford the median rent (about $575) and half the apartments there.
 Even with a bump in salary to $32,700 so they can afford up to $818 a month, their choices widen only a little. They will be able to manage the two-bedroom fair-market rents in rural Ulster ($735) and Sullivan ($666) Counties. And, they can afford the median rent in the Bronx ($719) and Brooklyn ($790), as well as in Ulster (about $630) and Sullivan (about $575) Counties. 
 Having so few housing choices is a predicament shared by about 100,000 Long Island young adults together with 200,000 more in the boroughs outside Manhattan and an additional 31,000 in the Hudson Valley. 
 These 20- to 34-year-olds are prevented by high rents and low rental vacancy rates from leaving their parents' homes and forming their own household at a rate comparable to young adults living in other parts of New York State. Fifty-nine percent of Nassau's young adults and 52 percent of Suffolk's are still living with their parents or other older adults, compared to a median of 35 percent in 34 counties in the state's major metropolitan areas and labor markets. 
 Assuming they would double up with a working spouse or triple up with working roommates to get a place of their own, Long Island's 100,000 young adults represent pent-up demand for 33,000 to 50,000 affordable apartments. Their counterparts in the Hudson Valley and the boroughs outside Manhattan represent potential demand for 77,000 to 115,000 more.
 If they look for a place close to home, Long Island's young adults will run up against, and worsen, the nearly 80,000-unit shortage of housing with rents below $1,000. If they look to the city or its northern suburbs, they will increase the pressures on the households there who face their own shortfalls in affordable housing. These have been estimated to be as high as 177,000 units in the city and 44,000 in the Hudson Valley. 
 The affordable housing shortage transcends local boundaries just as it belies imprecise generalities about a housing bubble. Supply is so short, demand is so strong, and regional connections are so pervasive that substantial new production, like New York City's 68,000-unit new development initiative, is both necessary and sustainable.
 Stronger state and local incentives and requirements for the inclusion of affordable units in new developments as well as regional smart-growth strategies to contain sprawl while creating sites for new housing and conserving open space are critical. So, too, are stronger state and local protection for apartments in Mitchell-Lama and other assisted and regulated developments, more aggressive intervention to stem predatory lending and foreclosures among first-time home buyers, increases in Albany's capital budget for affordable housing and more persistent pressure to defend and expand Washington's investment in affordable housing and community development.
 In short, we need more constructive action, and less bubble-blowing.

HEADLINE: Finding Holes in the Housing Bubble

BYLINE: By David M. Muchnick.

 BODY:
THE median value of single-family homes in Westchester skyrocketed 78 percent between 1990 and 2003 to $502,882 from $282,200, the fifth-highest among more than 200 counties nationwide, according to census data. The median value soared in Dutchess County too, up 60 percent to $238,258 from $149,200. Simultaneously, the population aged 20 to 34 in Westchester and Dutchess fell 18 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively, during the last decade -- that's nearly four times the national decline. 
 What does one have to do with the other? The housing boom may be a boon to many, but it's a bane to young people. Sure, it has been a blessing for owners who can afford property tax increases, cash out equity or refinance debt. It's created jobs and produced thousands of mostly expensive new houses, condominiums and apartments, and it has filled the coffers of state and local governments with billions of dollars.
In doing this, housing construction has performed its historic role as countercyclical ballast, helping communities and the state to weather a recession and a recovery that has created minimal jobs in the economy's other industries. 
 But the boom has also worsened the affordable housing crisis in Westchester and Dutchess. It has burdened homeowners with rising assessments and property taxes -- putting elderly people on fixed incomes in particular difficulty. It has burdened apartment dwellers with the rent increases that accompany rising taxes and operating costs. It has driven up the cost of land, leading to higher construction costs and making housing assistance all the more necessary. And most ominously for the future of the region, it has priced first-time buyers and young adults out of the market.
 During the last decade, 18,934 new housing units were built in Westchester. They included 6,037 rentals. But, only 1,363 apartments -- 7 percent of the total construction -- were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits.
 In Dutchess, 10,216 new units were built and an additional 1,490 were rehabilitated or converted from nonresidential use. Together, they included 3,235 rentals. A mere 238 apartments, just 2 percent of the 11,706 total, were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits.
 Amid all the construction, housing costs have risen much faster than residents' ability to pay them. Westchester's median household income rose 38 percent from 1989 to 2003, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 63 percent, the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 76 percent and the median monthly gross rent for all apartments rose 56 percent. 
 Likewise, Dutchess's median household income rose 29 percent, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 55 percent; the median monthly expense for property taxes, insurance and utilities rose 43 percent; the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 52 percent; and the median monthly gross rent for all apartments rose 40 percent. 
 As a result, 1 out of 3 households in Westchester and Dutchess -- 98,043 in Westchester and 30,350 (33 percent) in Dutchess -- had to spend 30 percent or more of their income for housing in 2003. That's up 13 percent in Westchester and a whopping 42 percent in Dutchess since 1990.
 So, where does this leave young adults starting work at salaries of, say, $25,100 a year, like computer operators, hospital technicians or even New York City's new police recruits? If they can't find a friend or a spouse with a job to share housing costs, then, most likely, they're living further out in the Hudson Valley or still at home with their parents.
 At $25,100, young workers can afford no more than $625 a month if they are to use less than 30 percent of their income for housing, a cap commonly recommended by lenders and other financial advisers. So, they cannot afford the median cost of owning a home or the fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Westchester, Dutchess, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Ulster or Sullivan, not to mention Long Island and New York City. They would have to use 60 percent of their income to pay Westchester's current $1,259 two-bedroom fair-market rent and 45 percent to pay Dutchess's $942. 
 Nor can these workers afford the median rent, and thus half the apartments, in Westchester, Dutchess, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Nassau and Suffolk Counties or in any of the city's boroughs. They would have to use 37 percent of their income to pay the median rent in Dutchess and 45 percent in Westchester. 
 Only by moving to rural Sullivan County would they be able to afford the median rent (about $576). For those moving to, say, Monticello and working in White Plains that could mean an 80-mile, 90-minute commute each way.
 Even with a bump in salary to $32,700, so they can afford up to $818 a month, their choices widen only a little. They will be able to manage the two-bedroom fair-market rents in rural Ulster ($735) and Sullivan ($666) Counties. And, they can afford the median rent in Ulster (about $630) and Sullivan (about $575) plus the Bronx ($719) and Brooklyn ($790).
 Having so few housing choices is a predicament shared by about 17,700 young adults in Westchester and 1,200 young adults in Dutchess as well as 12,100 more in Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Ulster and Sullivan, an additional 100,000 on Long Island, and 200,000 more in the boroughs outside Manhattan. 
 These 20- to 34-year-olds are prevented by high rents and low rental vacancy rates from leaving their parents' homes and forming their own household at a rate comparable to young adults living in other parts of New York State. Forty-six percent of Westchester's young adults and 38 percent of Dutchess's are still living with their parents or other older adults, compared to a median of 35 percent in 34 counties in the state's major metropolitan areas and labor markets. 
 Assuming they would double up with a working spouse or triple up with working roommates to get a place of their own, Westchester's 17,700 young adults represent pent-up demand for 5,900 to 8,800 affordable apartments. Dutchess's 1,200 young adults represent potential demand for 400 to 600. Their counterparts in the Hudson Valley's other counties, in the boroughs outside Manhattan and on Long Island indicate a potential market for 104,000 to 154,000 more.
 If they look for a place close to home, Westchester's young adults will run up against, and worsen, the shortage of affordable housing that afflicts the 98,000 households there who cannot afford the county's median rent. This shortage has been estimated at 15,400 units with rents below $900.
 Dutchess's young adults will also confront, and aggravate, the shortage facing the 26,400 existing households there who cannot afford the county's median rent. This shortage approaches 5,400 units with rents below $760.
 If they look toward the city, Long Island or the other Hudson Valley counties, they will increase the pressures on households who face their own shortfalls in affordable housing. These have been estimated to be as high as 177,000 units in the city, 80,000 on Long Island, and 23,000 in Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Ulster and Sullivan. 
 The affordable housing shortage transcends local boundaries just as it belies imprecise generalities about a housing bubble. Supply is so short, demand is so strong, and regional connections are so pervasive that substantial new production, like New York City's 68,000-unit new development initiative, is both necessary and sustainable. 
 Stronger state and local incentives and requirements for the inclusion of affordable units in new developments as well as regional smart-growth strategies to contain sprawl while creating sites for new housing and conserving open space are critical. 
 So, too, are stronger state and local protection for apartments in assisted and regulated buildings, more aggressive intervention to stem predatory lending and foreclosures among first-time home buyers, increases in Albany's capital budget for affordable housing and more persistent pressure to defend and expand Washington's investment in affordable housing and community development.
 In short, we need more constructive action and less bubble-blowing.

HEADLINE: Winning In Iraq

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS; Nicholas D. Kristof is on vacation.. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Andrew Krepinevich is a careful, scholarly man. A graduate of West Point and a retired lieutenant colonel, his book, ''The Army and Vietnam,'' is a classic on how to fight counterinsurgency warfare. 
 Over the past year or so he's been asking his friends and former colleagues in the military a few simple questions: Which of the several known strategies for fighting insurgents are you guys employing in Iraq? What metrics are you using to measure your progress?
 The answers have been disturbing. There is no clear strategy. There are no clear metrics. 
 Krepinevich has now published an essay in the new issue of Foreign Affairs, ''How to Win in Iraq,'' in which he proposes a strategy. The article is already a phenomenon among the people running this war, generating discussion in the Pentagon, the C.I.A., the American Embassy in Baghdad and the office of the vice president.
 Krepinevich's proposal is hardly new. He's merely describing a classic counterinsurgency strategy, which was used, among other places, in Malaya by the British in the 1950's. The same approach was pushed by Tom Donnelly and Gary Schmitt in a Washington Post essay back on Oct. 26, 2003; by Kenneth Pollack in Senate testimony this July 18; and by dozens of midlevel Army and Marine Corps officers in Iraq. 
 Krepinevich calls the approach the oil-spot strategy. The core insight is that you can't win a war like this by going off on search and destroy missions trying to kill insurgents. There are always more enemy fighters waiting. You end up going back to the same towns again and again, because the insurgents just pop up after you've left and kill anybody who helped you. You alienate civilians, who are the key to success, with your heavy-handed raids. 
 Instead of trying to kill insurgents, Krepinevich argues, it's more important to protect civilians. You set up safe havens where you can establish good security. Because you don't have enough manpower to do this everywhere at once, you select a few key cities and take control. Then you slowly expand the size of your safe havens, like an oil spot spreading across the pavement.
 Once you've secured a town or city, you throw in all the economic and political resources you have to make that place grow. The locals see the benefits of working with you. Your own troops and the folks back home watching on TV can see concrete signs of progress in these newly regenerated neighborhoods. You mix your troops in with indigenous security forces, and through intimate contact with the locals you begin to even out the intelligence advantage that otherwise goes to the insurgents.
 If you ask U.S. officials why they haven't adopted this strategy, they say they have. But if that were true the road to the airport in Baghdad wouldn't be a death trap. It would be within the primary oil spot.
 The fact is, the U.S. didn't adopt this blindingly obvious strategy because it violates some of the key Rumsfeldian notions about how the U.S. military should operate in the 21st century.
 First, it requires a heavy troop presence, not a light, lean force. Second, it doesn't play to our strengths, which are technological superiority, mobility and firepower. It acknowledges that while we go with our strengths, the insurgents exploit our weakness: the lack of usable intelligence.
 Third, it means we have to think in the long term. For fear of straining the armed forces, the military brass have conducted this campaign with one eye looking longingly at the exits. A lot of the military planning has extended only as far as the next supposed tipping point: the transfer of sovereignty, the election, and so on. We've been rotating successful commanders back to Washington after short stints, which is like pulling Grant back home before the battle of Vicksburg. The oil-spot strategy would force us to acknowledge that this will be a long, gradual war.
 But the strategy has one virtue. It might work. 
 Today, public opinion is turning against the war not because people have given up on the goal of advancing freedom, but because they are not sure this war is winnable. Why should we sacrifice more American lives to a lost cause?
 If President Bush is going to rebuild support for the war, he's going to have to explain specifically how it can be won, and for that he needs a strategy.
 It's not hard to find. It's right there in Andy Krepinevich's essay, and in the annals of history.

HEADLINE: Buying a Lot of Stuff Makes You Happy? Well, It Depends

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:
Americans are constantly buying stuff. There's no doubt about that. But are they happy about the stuff they buy? Ah, that's another question. 
 You'd think it might be tough coming up with any sort of scientific answer to that question, but sure enough, someone has tried. According to the latest American Customer Satisfaction Index from the University of Michigan, shoppers were a bit happier in the second quarter of this year than in the previous quarter.
 That's a happy economic omen, the Michigan folks say, after two quarters of sharply declining scores -- except for that increasingly familiar party crasher, rising energy prices, which attach a gloomy asterisk to all prognostications these days. 
 But look closer at the survey and you'll find that all this happy consuming is not alike. We certainly like buying cars, especially if they are Toyotas, Hondas, BMW's and Cadillacs, and appliances and TV-related stuff. But personal computers? They leave people grumbling a bit more.

HEADLINE: Call Him the State's Defense Secretary 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
JOHN MARKOWICZ, the leader of a state coalition fighting to keep the Pentagon from closing the Naval submarine base in Groton, went to church early Wednesday morning. 
 ''We've done all we can,'' Father Joseph Castaldi of St. Joseph Parish, a Catholic church in New London, told him. ''It's time to pray.'' 
By 10:30 that morning, a federal commission had voted to overrule the Pentagon plan. The base would stay open. Southeastern Connecticut would not lose the 8,500 jobs at the base or thousands more directly linked to it. The submarine-shaped sign that welcomes people to Groton, ''Submarine Capital Of The World,'' would still stand.
 And, after months of ''a lot of long nights and a lot of long weekends,'' Mr. Markowicz, 61, a man who would spend Saturday afternoons responding to e-mail messages from reporters, would see his grandchildren again -- his wife, too, who ended up traveling without him on family trips planned for the summer.
 ''Mrs. Markowicz called the hotel looking for you,'' said a woman, raising her voice above the supporters and reporters who converged on Mr. Markowicz shortly after the vote. He and several dozen others had watched in silence, then euphoria, in a banquet room at the Hampton Inn on Long Hill Road, as the deliberations were telecast live on C-Span.
 It took a few minutes before he called his wife back.
 ''She said, 'Well, if all these people are hugging you, why don't you come home so I can hug you?'''
 In past rounds of base closings, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission typically has overruled about 15 percent of Pentagon proposals. After the vote on Wednesday, Mr. Markowicz admitted that he had thought Groton's chances for survival were particularly slim this time, in part because the base had had success fighting closures in the past, including in 1991, 1993 and 1995. 
 Each time, Mr. Markowicz, a former submariner who grew up in Salem, Mass., and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1965, had led the state-financed coalition charged with convincing the commission that the Pentagon plans were flawed. 
 ''It's sort of like a 90-day deployment,'' Mr. Markowicz said the night before the vote. ''I'm looking forward to getting home and seeing the family again. Hopefully, it'll be a successful deployment.''
 In the past, the base's core functions -- it is home to 18 fast-attack nuclear-powered submarines and the Navy's submarine school -- remained intact after the commission voted, although it has suffered some cuts. 
 This time, however, the plan was to close the base entirely, at a time when some top Navy leaders said they believed the overall attack submarine fleet, about 54 boats, should be smaller.
 Mr. Markowicz was joined in the fight by the state's top elected officials and others working behind the scenes, including Gabe Stern, an analyst who churned out spreadsheets disputing the Pentagon's cost estimates. Together, they established that the Pentagon's claim that closing Groton would save $1.6 billion over 20 years was overstated by $400 million and perhaps more.
 They hammered home the message that Groton, home to Navy submarines for 90 years, was more than just a military base. They talked of the military value of the synergy involving the base, the submarine school and Electric Boat, the company that builds submarines a few miles down the Thames River.
 In May, Mr. Markowicz went to Washington to meet commissioners and their staff. In June, he went again, this time adding to his schedule a meeting with retired submarine officers.
 ''I basically said, 'Folks, we're in a battle and we're going to need all the help we can get,''' he said. ''I think that prompted a dialogue within the community.''
 At a special hearing in Boston in July, he walked commissioners through a PowerPoint presentation. Under questioning about the capacity of the base, he suggested that the Navy was wrong not to consider expanding Groton, rather than the bases in Virginia and Georgia, where it had planned to move Groton's boats. Before the vote on Wednesday, one commissioner, Samuel K. Skinner, suggested that that very scenario should have been an option.
 By late July, the appeal to former submarine officers was paying off. Retired admirals began publicly opposing the plan to close the base. And they kept up the pressure. 
 In a letter to the commission on Aug. 7, William J. Crowe, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under President Reagan, along with two retired officers, Admirals Kinnaird R. McKee and Thomas Fargo, wrote that the Navy plan was based on ''flawed assumptions and analysis, as well as a force structure plan that assumes unacceptable risk.''
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman compared Mr. Markowicz to the old television detective, Joe Friday: ''The facts, just the facts, ma'am.''
 The coalition's arguments worked. On Wednesday, just before the vote, the commission chairman, Anthony J. Principi, announced his opposition to closing Groton.
 ''The New London submarine base is more than piers and parking spaces for nuclear-powered submarines,'' he said. ''It is truly the center of excellence in submarine warfare.''
 After the vote, in Groton, Senator Christopher J. Dodd said he believed the case for the base had been made conclusively. ''We're never doing this again,'' he said. 
 Then he turned to Mr. Markowicz.
 ''We're retiring your jersey today,'' Mr. Dodd said.
 Taking his turn at the podium -- after Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lieberman and Gov. M. Jodi Rell -- Mr. Markowicz stuck to the same script he used on May 13, when he and others were stunned to learn that the Pentagon wanted to close Groton.
 ''Never give up,'' he said. ''Never, ever give up.''
 He went to Mass at 5:30 p.m. that afternoon. A priest called it ''a Mass of Thanksgiving.'' And by Thursday morning, Mr. Markowicz was back at his desk in his day job as director of a public-private economic development agency, the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region.
 ''I'm writing a bunch of thank you's,'' he said.
 Mr. Markowicz was not declaring victory. He is keeping his coalition together and his eye on the future. Perhaps the Groton base can be diversified, he said, maybe by adding shallow-water combat ships, a futuristic weapon the Navy sees as potentially replacing some submarines.
 ''We're not standing down,'' he said. ''We're not decommissioning our activity. How do we keep this from happening again?''

HEADLINE: Energy Prices Weigh on Shoppers, and Investors

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Battered by rising energy costs, the stock market gave up further ground last week.
 All three of the major market gauges declined, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average posting their biggest weekly losses in two months, according to Bloomberg News. The Nasdaq composite index fell for a fourth consecutive week. 
Crude oil closed on Friday in New York at $66.13 a barrel, and there were indications that the recent increase in the cost of energy might be affecting the mood of consumers. On Friday, the University of Michigan reported a drop in consumer confidence in August that was much bigger than had been expected by Wall Street. Some traders and analysts said that escalating prices at the gas pump were beginning to have a dampening effect on consumer spending.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 161.94 points, or 1.5 percent, to close 10,397.29. The S.& P. 500 lost 14.61 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 1,205.10. And the Nasdaq composite index dropped 14.79 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,120.77.
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.18 percent from 4.21 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: If Your Home Utility Bill Is Zero, Is It Still a Bill?

BYLINE: By BARRY REHFELD

 BODY:
COOKING with Larry Schlussler at his home in Arcata, Calif., is, if not quite cool, at least incredibly efficient in its use of energy.
 He takes fresh ingredients out of his Sun Frost, the refrigerator he developed and manufactures, which uses far less electricity than any other brand on the market. (Its largest model costs $2,500.) He fills an electric pot, with an insulated top he made, with tap water heated to 180 degrees by thermal solar panels outside the kitchen wall. After his mix comes to a boil, he turns off the electricity to let the trapped heat in the covered pot do its work.
''Perfect soup every time,'' said Mr. Schlussler, a native New Yorker with a Ph.D. in engineering. ''And I save energy. I like that, too.'' 
 In the struggle against the rising cost of energy, Mr. Schlussler is way out front. His home is a model of efficiency, and his utility bill is zero. He uses so little energy that the small solar power system on his roof provides more than enough electricity to pay back the utility for the power he uses on cloudy days and cold nights. By comparison, the average American homeowner, according to the Energy Department, spends an average of $1,820 a year on energy. 
 Perfection in energy-efficiency, or anything close, requires a substantial investment of time, expertise and capital, all of which may be out of reach for most Americans. Still, a growing number are taking up the challenge of finding ways to get more out of less. 
 Businesses that may not have even existed a decade ago, offering huge selections of efficient products, are now a click away, at sites like 1000bulbs.com and affordable-solar.com. Among the offerings now available are Superglass windows, L.E.D. (light-emitting diode) bulbs, solar-powered exhaust fans and soybean foam insulation. They often cost more than the traditional versions: L.E.D. bulbs, for example, are about $20 each, compared with less than $3 for compact fluorescent bulbs and less than $1 for an incandescent bulb. And Superglass windows may run upwards of a third more than the several hundreds of dollars that conventional windows cost. Over the long run, though, for some homeowners, it may be possible to recoup the extra money through savings on utility bills.
 If superefficient solutions are pricey or obscure, many mainstream options abound at the mall. Anything that bears the Energy Star label, part of a federal program to promote energy efficiency, guarantees savings of at least 10 percent over standard models. 
 Over the last five years, when the program has operated at full throttle, the Energy Department says the number of homes with these more efficient appliances has grown substantially. Energy Star dishwashers, like a highly efficient Asko model for around $1,200, are in 21.1 percent of homes, up from 2.7 percent, while Energy Star refrigerators, like Kenmores from Sears in the $600 to $900 range, are in 11.8 percent, up from 3.8 percent, and Energy Star clothes washers, like a Eurotech at around $1,200, are in 7 percent, up from 1 percent.
 Energy Star refrigerators now command 35 percent of annual sales, according to Bill Prindle, deputy director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, which offers ratings and information on its Web site, aceee.org, on state rebates for buying a wide range of energy-efficient appliances. (An average Energy Star refrigerator will save $43 annually.)
 Even buyers who pass up the Energy Star label for something cheaper stand a good chance of cutting down on utility bills when they replace old appliances. Today's least efficient models are nearly always more efficient than the best of a generation ago. About the only thing that won't cut utility bills is sticking with what you have.
 Staying with the old way is not for Danny Orlando, an administrator for the Energy Star program in Atlanta. Mr. Orlando is another professional in the field who takes his work home with him. Since buying his ranch house 15 years ago, he has been taking steps toward making it more efficient.
 He was quick to buy a dishwasher and air-conditioners with Energy Star ratings. He replaced incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent ones and bought a new furnace that was 50 percent more efficient than the original -- and cheaper, because a smaller one would do. Last year, the space above his kitchen ceiling got new blown-in insulation made from recycled newspaper. 
 ''It gets better and easier all the time,'' he said. ''I remember five years ago they'd sell single compact fluorescent bulbs and I'd stuff it down in the bottom of a grocery bag because I didn't want to think about the cost. Now I get a pack of 8 to 12. They're so inexpensive I don't think about it.'' 
 The savings over 15 years, though, are worth thinking about: he has used nearly a third fewer kilowatt hours, for annual savings of roughly $600. And he isn't finished. His house is a work in progress.
 ''There's no one silver bullet'' to end energy inefficiency, Mr. Prindle said.
 Consumers who pay more up front for appliances may come out ahead over time -- if the appliances last long enough and save enough energy. Front-loading horizontal axis washing machines, which tumble clothing rather than agitating it, are one example. Those made by Eurotech and Asko run a few hundred dollars more than comparable top-loading models. 
 ''They use 10 to 30 percent less electricity,'' said Dennis Creech, executive director of the Southface Energy Institute in Atlanta. ''They also use less water, spin out more water from the clothes and are gentler on them.'' 
 Some consumers are taking other paths to energy efficiency. Robert Jackson of Hopewell, Mass., bought a solar-powered exhaust fan for $250 from the Alternative Energy Store, at altenergystore.com. It sells 2,400 products, like tankless water heaters that provide hot water on demand ($649), solar lanterns ($65) and composting toilets ($1,153). 
 The fan is installed on the roof and sucks hot air out of the attic. The sunnier the day, the more hot air it extracts. 
 ''The house cools off a lot faster since I put the fan in,'' he said. With his average utility bill down by $14 a month, he expects that the fan will pay for itself in less than two years. 
 Some choices, like passing up a less efficient side-by-side refrigerator, don't cost even an extra nickel up front. People in different regions may have different priorities. A Northerner will be more interested in upgrading a furnace, as opposed to the air-conditioner, while a Southerner is likely to see things the other way around. Neither may take the path of a homeowner in the West, who may be buying portable evaporative units called swamp coolers -- cheap substitutes for air-conditioners that work well only in dry climates because they can make a room uncomfortably sticky when the air is humid. 
 In some categories, products seem to come in three layers of energy efficiency: the usual, the better and the best (and, sometimes, the most expensive). In lighting, for example, there are incandescent, compact fluorescent and L.E.D. bulbs. But such divisions can also apply to windows and insulation. 
 Old-style windows generally have one pane of glass. Relatively modern insulating windows have two panes that trap dead air between them. The latest version, known by the brand name Superglass, has two layers of clear film between the panes. Both the plain double and the Superglass are specially treated, depending on heating and cooling needs. A low-emission treatment keeps heat in, while low-solar-transmittance coatings keep heat out. 
 IN the insulation category, there are standard blankets, blown-in fill and foam. The installation may be a good time for the homeowner to take off on vacation for a few days. ''It's invasive, no mistake about that,'' said David Thacker, a building consultant in Grand Rapids, Mich. Mr. Thacker, who has been in building product sales for 15 years, recommends a new foam insulation made from soybeans instead of petrochemicals.
 ''I like the idea of supporting the American farmer and using less oil,'' he said. He sells the foam for about 10 percent less than the petrochemical based foams and says that both will cut heating and cooling costs in half. 
 Mr. Thacker has used the soybean foam in only a few homes so far, and often hears questions about whether the insulation can be eaten by pests. He answers that even though the insulation is derived from soybeans, the soybeans' chemistry has been changed so radically that they no longer have any attraction as food. 
 Moreover, he stands behind his work -- or, rather, his daughter stands surrounded by it. He insulated her new home, and says she paid retail.

QUICK READ
To make their homes more energyefficient, consumers are turning to new types of insulation and appliances. But smaller steps can also lead to savings over time. Here are some suggestions:

CONSIDER buying a water heater wrap (about $10), to keep heat from escaping, or a programmable thermostat (about $25) that can be attached to heating and cooling units to save energy at certain hours.

REPLACE most incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs (about $3 each).

SEAL every hole and crack in your home. Ignoring them is like leaving a window open.

PLANT a tree in front of the western windows of your home. It helps to cool the house in the summer - and makes your lawn look better throughout the year.

 BODY:

WHY GO NOW -- The four wheels of Detroit culture -- sports, music, machines and beer -- are all on a roll. The city will be host to this season's Super Bowl, after having mounted the baseball All-Star game last month, and the high-profile events have fueled much sprucing up of downtown. Detroit's music revival, led by Eminem, Kid Rock and the White Stripes, is being extended by acts like Brendan Benson, the Dirtbombs and the Detroit Cobras. Car culture is always intense, and this January sees the opening of the North American International Auto Show; last year it drew over 780,000 people. As for beer -- well, there's never an off-season there.

WHERE TO STAY -- What more Detroit place to stay than General Motors headquarters? The Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center, (313) 568-8000, www.marriott.com, is in the Renaissance Center, the multibuilding development that's now the corporate home of G.M. The round 73-story hotel offers spectacular views of the skyline, the Detroit River, Canada and Lake St. Clair. The high-end Coach Insignia restaurant crowns the hotel, which has 1,298 rooms. Antique Chevys adorn the building's first-floor plaza. Doubles start at $219.
Those who like to be near slot machines might wish to stay at the 174-unit Atheneum Suite Hotel, 1000 Brush Avenue, (313) 962-2323, www.atheneumsuites.com, across the street from the Greektown Casino. It is in the Greektown neighborhood, with its pastry shops and shish kebab diners. The suites start at $189.
 The Hilton Garden Inn, 351 Gratiot Avenue, (313) 967-0900, www.hiltongardeninn.com, is a midmarket option. The hotel's 198 rooms are nothing fancy, but it's new, clean and only a walk to both Ford Field, home of the Detroit Lions, and Comerica Park, where the Tigers play. Doubles start at $169.
 Located next to Detroit's cultural center, the 40-room Inn on Ferry Street, 84 East Ferry Street, (313) 871-6000, www.theinnonferrystreet.com, offers some of the city's most charming accommodations. The four Queen Anne houses and two carriage houses that compose the inn were converted in 2001, through a lovely restoration job that honors the buildings' original 1880-90's construction (though with air-conditioning this time around). Rooms start at $105.

WHERE TO EAT -- With panoramic views out onto the Detroit River, the large and lively jazz restaurant Seldom Blues, 400 Renaissance Center, (313) 567-7301, has one of the best dining views in the city. Its main room draws a broad cross-section of Detroiters for both its entertainment and extensive, French-inflected menu. Appetizers include Popsicle lamb chops ($10) and ahi tuna carpaccio ($12); entrees feature items like blue-b-que bass, with a blueberry sauce ($28), or morel-crusted rack of lamb ($36). In nice weather you can sit at an outdoor table and watch Great Lakes freighters glide by.
 Another newish favorite is Small Plates, 1521 Broadway, (313) 963-0497, an airy, friendly bistro across the street from the Detroit Opera House. Not quite a tapas bar, the restaurant offers a menu of moderately priced and portioned selections, from crostini and empanadas (both $8) through garlic shrimp pizza ($11) and a petite tenderloin with Gorgonzola cream sauce and crispy onions ($12). Wash it down with something from the bar, or step next door to the Detroit Beer Company brewery, 1529 Broadway, (313) 962-1529, for a St. Brigid Oatmeal Stout or Local 1529 India Pale Ale; all brewery-made beers are $3.75 a pint.
 Jacoby's, 624 Brush Street, (313) 962-7067, a German restaurant in Bricktown, has been around since 1904. It has tin-tile ceilings, a 90-strong beer list, and an unpretentious atmosphere (attitude doesn't get you very far in Detroit). The menu consists of schnitzels, sausages and sandwiches. Order a bottle of Schneider Aventinus ($7) or a Franziskaner on draft ($5) with your potato pancakes and enjoy the game on TV.
 No place literally captures the flavor of Detroit more than Lafayette Coney Island, 118 West Lafayette Boulevard, (313) 964-8198. Detroit is rife with Coney Island restaurants -- diners whose principal dish is the hot dog. But not just any hot dog: this is a particular dog, covered in meat chili, onions and mustard, that falls apart while you eat it, demanding the use of an ecologically unsound number of paper napkins. It's Detroit's civic dish, and Lafayette's is the $2.25 classic. 

WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- Detroit, of course, is the Motor City, so start where the motors are: the Henry Ford Museum, Village Road and Oakwood Boulevard, (313) 982-6001, www.thehenryford.org, in nearby Dearborn. A museum of industry and technology, the Henry Ford collects historic planes and trains, frightening-looking old turbines, antique weaponry and classic home appliances. And cars -- many, many fabulous cars. The ''100 Years of the Automobile in American Life'' exhibit includes the earliest motorized carriages and lost brands like Hudson and Kaiser. A 1931 Bugatti Royale Type 41 Cabriolet, one of the rarest cars in the world, is stunning. For a view of modern auto technology, a bus takes visitors from the museum to Ford's nearby Rouge plant, which offers a catwalk view of pickup truck assembly. Museum: $14; age 5 to 12 $10; 62 and older, $13 Rouge tour: same prices, separately.
 Super Bowl XL will be played Feb. 5 at Ford Field, 2000 Brush Street, (313) 262-2100, www.fordfield.com. Football buffs can take a tour of the roofed stadium at 11 a.m. or 1 p.m. on weekdays. Tours are $7; $5 17 and younger and seniors, $5. Locker rooms, press boxes, luxury suites and the field itself are all on view. 
 Given its size, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, 315 East Warren Avenue, (313) 494-5800, www.maah-detroit.org, seems as though it should have more on display. But the lovely sandstone building does house some intriguing exhibits, like the current ''Shades of Greatness,'' until next Sunday, featuring works of art related to baseball's Negro Leagues; $8; age 3 to 13 and 62 and older, $5.
 Despite some recent progress, decades of economic struggle have left many once-grand Detroit buildings in ruins. But like ruins in Greece or Italy, these once mighty structures can exude a dilapidated wonder. While a renovation is hoped for, the 33-story Book-Cadillac Hotel Washington Boulevard and Michigan Avenue, once the city's grandest hotel, hulks like a wounded Goliath. Most dramatic is the former Michigan Central Depot, LaCombe Drive, off Michigan Avenue, its 18 blown-out floors looming against the sky, its railroad station interior looking like an abandoned Roman settlement. Photos by urban spelunkers can be seen at www.detroityes.com and www.forgottendetroit.com.

WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- Rock 'n' rollers taken with Detroit's music rebirth will want to sample local venues. The venerable St. Andrew's Hall, 431 East Congress Street, (313) 961-8961, with its proscenium stage and long, orange-lighted bar, has been host to groups of all stripes. The Lager House, 1254 Michigan Avenue, (313) 961-4668, is a classic small rock club, pleasingly dingy barroom on one side, pleasingly dingy music room on the other, the kind of place where arcanely named acts get their start. If you prefer billiards with your Von Bondies concert, try the Magic Stick, 4120-40 Woodward Avenue, (313) 833-9700. It has 10 pool tables, as well as the Garden Bowl bowling alley and the Majestic Cafe, with its eclectic menu.
 If your vibes are jazz, chart a course for Baker's Keyboard Lounge, 20510 Livernois Avenue, (313) 345-6300, with its jam sessions and moderately priced soul food ($6 to $16).
 Detroit has no shortage of watering holes, and the Old Shillelagh, 349 Monroe Street, (313) 964-0007, is a local legend. Covered in tin tile, this Irish pub and sports bar offers 20 draft beers and Irish music most nights. It is not a place for quiet contemplation. The Town Pump Tavern, 100 West Montcalm Street, (313) 961-1929, behind the Fox and State Theaters, also has an Irish feel. Ivy covers the front, and the dark, woody interior features a convivial circular bar. For more contempo-chic, try Oslo, 1456 Woodward Avenue, (313) 963-0300, sushi bar upstairs, dimly lighted bar and nightclub downstairs.
 Baseball fans can take in a game at Comerica Park, 2100 Woodward Avenue, detroit.tigers.mlb.com, tickets $5 to $60. Detroiters mourned the move from old Tiger Stadium, but they seem to be slowly warming to the new facility, with its airy atmosphere and downtown views. In addition to standard stadium food, Comerica has a barbeque stand, picnic areas and daiquiri windows trafficking in flavors like blue raspberry and the vodka-laced Jungle Juice.

WHERE TO SHOP -- Most of the high-end stores and designer boutiques drifted to the suburbs long ago, but bibliophiles should make a pilgrimage to John King Books, 901 West Lafayette Boulevard, (313) 961-0622. Housed in a former glove factory, it is one of the most impressive used-book stores in the country, four stories high with creaking wood-plank floors. It is also wonderful for its collection of garage-sale art, Detroit artifacts and antique postcards and stereoscope pictures.
 If used LP's spin your head, try People's Records, 615 West Forest Avenue, (313) 831-0864, a cluttered two-room hole in the wall near Wayne State University. Specializing in jazz, R&B and soul, this basement shop is all vinyl -- no CD's. Rows of large boxes stacked in the back room hold thousands of used 45's.
 The stock at Henry the Hatter, 307 Broadway, (313) 962-0970, is new, but the haberdashery itself is old, in business since 1893. Top yourself off with a Bailey Rainmaster ($59.88) or a Borsalino Roberto ($350).

YOUR FIRST TIME OR YOUR 10TH -- Detroit Industry, Diego Rivera's huge fresco cycle at the Detroit Institute of Arts, 5200 Woodward Avenue, 313-833-7900, www.dia.org, is one of the nation's great artworks. Painted on four soaring walls, the 1932-3 murals surreally portray the power of modern industry, depicting blast furnaces, assembly lines, mining, freighters, autoworkers, engineers and the races of North America. It will induce a dizzy awe. Suggested admission, $4.

GETTING AROUND -- Detroit's immediate downtown is compact and easy to walk or cab, though for 50 cents you can hop the People Mover, an elevated light-rail line that loops the area. Anyone planning on exploring greater Detroit and its suburbs should rent a car -- mass transit and the auto industry never did get along very well.

HEADLINE: A Hedge Fund Falls Off the Face of the Earth

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
''HELLO, this is Dan Marino,'' says a weary, raspy voice on an answering machine. Mr. Marino, the chief financial officer of the Bayou Group, a $400 million hedge-fund and brokerage firm that is under investigation by state and federal authorities in Connecticut, sounds beleaguered. ''Please leave me a message,'' he goes on. ''I am receiving lots of phone calls. I am unable to pick up every call, so if you do call, leave a message and a number. I will get back to you.''
 Bayou investors are dying to know why their money has not been returned as the firm promised last month. But if they're hoping for a return call, they are out of luck. ''Sorry,'' says a chipper female voice on the tape. ''You cannot leave a message now. This mailbox is full.''
Those few, unsettling words are just about all that investors in the four Bayou funds have to go on right now. Money that was supposed to be wired to their accounts in mid-August after the funds wound down has not appeared. The funds' principals, its accountants and its lawyer are not talking. The funds' offices in Stamford stand empty. 
 All that Bayou's investors can do is wait, fret and wonder what went wrong at the funds, run by Samuel Israel III, a folksy Wall Street veteran who seemed to turn in a steady, if unspectacular, performance.
 ''What panicked me, when I sat back and thought about it, was I know practically nothing about these people,'' said John C. Siegesmund III, an investor in Denver who had never put money in a hedge fund before he sank $250,000 into Bayou in February 2003. ''They had good returns, they seemed reputable, there's nothing sort of fly-by-night about them. But when the chips are down, you don't know what you're getting into.''
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined Connecticut banking officials and federal prosecutors who are trying to plumb the Bayou mess. It is unclear what they will discover, but investors are hoping, of course, that their money will be found and returned. 
 Whether or not it is, the Bayou situation is a cautionary tale for investors rushing to participate in the hedge fund boom of recent years.
 Calls to Mr. Israel and Mr. Marino, who is not the football player, were not returned. Neither were calls to Steven D. Oppenheim, the Bayou Funds' lawyer at Faust, Rabbach & Oppenheim, and its accounting firm, Richmond-Fairfield Associates of New York. 
 Investors who spoke about their involvement in the funds said they were surprised by recent events and that Bayou had none of the earmarks of a Ponzi scheme. For example, while Mr. Israel's returns were impressive -- they almost always beat the returns in the broad stock market indexes by a few percentage points -- they were not too good to be true. Last year, Bayou was up 12.8 percent, versus the 9 percent gain by its benchmark, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average. 
 For the first six months of this year, Bayou documents show gains of 4.56 percent, versus a decline of 1.7 percent in the S.&P. 
 Bayou also allowed investors to leave the fund at any time -- by contrast, many hedge funds have lockup arrangements that keep investors' money tied up. Bayou documents said that any investor looking to redeem his Bayou interest could receive it in 15 days. 
 Unlike most hedge funds, Bayou did not charge a management fee; its management simply took the standard incentive fee of 20 percent of profits. According to financial statements, that came to $10.8 million in 2004. The funds paid almost $8 million in commissions to the Bayou brokerage firm last year. At year-end, Bayou executives had $18.6 million invested in the funds, the statements indicated. 
 Investors said they also liked the fact that Mr. Israel was in regular communication. Every week, he sent a detailed e-mail message with updated returns, noting what issues Bayou was long and short, its sector exposure and the average number of positions traded. The messages also included brief market commentaries from Mr. Israel.
 Once a year, he would also conduct a conference call with investors, inviting their questions and discussing his views on the economy, world events and financial markets. 
 Bayou's investment strategy was also understandable: it was composed of stocks and exchange-traded funds. No murky derivatives, risky commodities or currencies. And the only leverage he used was garden variety: buying on margin. 
 Marketing materials for Bayou describe Mr. Israel, 47, as a ''third-generation trader'' who has been trading since 1978. His was a short-term strategy in which he would rarely keep positions for more than three days. He was satisfied eking out small gains rather than making big, directional bets on sectors or industry groups. 
 What Bayou does best, a recent investor note said, ''is hit singles on a regular basis.'' Perhaps most appealing, Bayou's funds had lower minimum investments -- $250,000 -- than are typical at other hedge funds.
 As is true of most hedge funds, Bayou hired outside marketers to bring investors into the fold. According to one investor, its assets under management really ballooned in 2003 and 2004, rising to more than $400 million from $100 million.
 Problems started emerging, investors said, in late 2004, when Mr. Israel wrote a letter trying to quell rumors about his funds that he said were circulating around Wall Street. ''This is not the sort of letter I am used to writing and hope never to have to again,'' he wrote. 
 In the letter, Mr. Israel described a lawsuit that had been filed by Paul T. Westervelt Jr., a trader he had hired in 2002 and fired a bit more than a year later. Mr. Israel said Mr. Westervelt failed to follow the firm's trading discipline and methods, investing ''based on Wall Street information which my investors know I do not believe in.''
 In disclosing details about the lawsuit to his investors, Mr. Israel said, he hoped to put the matter to rest. One investor, who was granted anonymity because he hopes to keep his involvement in Bayou a private matter, said he was impressed with the forthright nature of the letter. 
 AFTER Mr. Westervelt was fired, he sued Mr. Israel. Included in his suit were allegations of activities he said he had seen at Bayou that may have violated securities regulations. The case was moved from federal court to arbitration. Lawyers on both sides did not return phone calls seeking comment.
 The Bayou investor who declined to be identified, a certified public accountant with a background in forensic accounting, said he had conducted extensive due diligence on the fund in 2002, before he invested in it. He called Bayou's lawyer, its accounting firm, as well as Wall Street veterans he knew, to check out Mr. Israel. Everything came up clean. He invested about $725,000 in 2003. As of June 30, his account was worth almost $1 million. He has not received any of his investment back. 
 Mr. Siegesmund said that he began to become nervous last spring, when he talked with a hedge fund marketer who told him that his firm was telling its clients to exit Bayou Funds. ''He said: 'There's not enough transparency there. They use their own brokerage, and we can't figure out how they do their internal accounting,''' the investor recalled. 
 A short time later, Mr. Siegesmund said, a Bayou marketing executive told him that he was leaving the firm for other opportunities. Mr. Siegesmund said these events did not exactly worry him, but he did begin to wonder.
 Interestingly, Mr. Israel seemed to start turning down new investors earlier this year. ''I talked to a money guy,'' said the investor who declined to be identified, ''and he said, strangely enough, that he had people with another $30 to $50 million to invest in March, but Sam said he didn't think he could handle it.'' 
 In mid-June, the weekly updates from Mr. Israel stopped. Mysteriously, the funds' returns stopped changing week to week. Investors started to ask questions. 
 In July, investors received a letter from Mr. Israel advising them that he was going to close the funds and return their money after an audit was completed. He said that personal problems were preventing him from running the funds effectively. 
 The investors said they were told that they would receive their money on Aug. 15. They are still waiting. As they do, no one from Bayou is talking. The only people the investors can reach are federal and state authorities who are investigating. 
 The investor who declined to be identified said that, in hindsight, he should have recognized one red flag in the fact that Bayou had two accounting firms -- one to oversee the brokerage unit's books and another to vet the hedge funds' financials. 
 ''We've seen fraud in stocks, bonds and commodities,'' said Ross B. Intelisano, a lawyer at Rich & Intelisano in New York who represents many Bayou investors. Referring to the hedge fund industry, he said: ''What we're now seeing is an increase in what could be called hedge fund fraud. It just shows that even sophisticated investors who do their due diligence can be defrauded.''
 The investor who declined to be identified said that he was surprised to reach Mr. Israel on his cellphone last Tuesday. He said he told Mr. Israel that his e-mail messages were not being answered and asked why his money was not being returned. 
 ''I said, 'We're in the dark, Sam,''' the investor recalled. ''He said, 'I really can't say much right now; we're having a meeting with our attorney.' I said, 'You have a duty to your investors, and I want to continue our conversation.' He hung up on me.''

HEADLINE: Does Lighter Equal Deadlier? 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
THE last time the government decided to make cars go farther on a gallon of gas, during the energy shocks of the 1970's, the strategy worked. Or at least it did for about a decade, as new regulations forced automakers to make more efficient vehicles. Soaring gas prices and shortages were also a powerful motivator for consumers to trade in their Oldsmobile Toronados for little Datsuns and Ford Escorts. Gas mileage for the average new vehicle went from 13.1 miles per gallon in 1975 models to 22.1 miles per gallon in 1987 models, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 For this latest energy shock, with its first overhaul of fuel economy standards in three decades the Bush administration is responding more cautiously, citing safety as a reason for restraint. The regulatory system adopted 30 years ago, they say, led to unnecessary deaths by forcing automakers to produce cars that were too small, light and unsafe. 
Last week, the administration proposed a new structure for corporate average fuel economy regulations -- the so-called CAFE standards -- for sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans that they said would save 10 billion gallons of gas over nearly two decades. 
 While environmentalists called that a pittance -- ''at best, they're proposing a system that will save a month's worth of gas,'' said David Friedman, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists -- the administration, with previous steps and its current proposal, is doing more to raise vehicle mileage than Washington has accomplished in at least two decades, which is to say more than practically nothing. 
 ''Clearly, we would love to decrease our dependence on foreign oil down to zero, but what the environmentalists ignore is that, until we phase out the old system, every tenth of mile a gallon that we raise CAFE beyond what is technologically feasible, we kill people,'' said Jeffrey W. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. ''We're against killing people. We have to get this system reformed.''
 Have traffic deaths really occurred because of efforts to conserve gas? Consumer groups ridiculed this claim, saying safety is compromised because vehicles are too fat, not too light, and point to crash studies showing that heavy-set S.U.V.'s like Hummers pose the real danger. Critics say the system proposed by the administration could provide incentive for automakers to make their S.U.V.'s even larger, though gas prices are an increasingly potent counterweight to such temptations. 
 ''It's more accurate to say that this increases the safety dangers,'' said Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen and a predecessor of Dr. Runge's.
 An architect of the administration plan is John D. Graham, a top official at the Office of Management and Budget. In his previous life as an academic, with some of his research financed by the auto industry, Mr. Graham found that lighter-weight vehicles led to thousands of unnecessary traffic fatalities. ''The intent of the administration's C.A.F.E. reform plan is threefold,'' Mr. Graham said in an e-mail Friday. ''To save more fuel, to reduce the unintended safety risks to motorists, and to provide an equitable regulatory framework for all vehicle manufacturers.'' 
 A 2001 National Academy of Sciences report backed the essence of his safety research. The panel attributed 1,300 to 2,600 fatalities in 1993 alone specifically to the fuel-economy regulations. 
 David Greene, an expert on energy research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, served on the panel but dissented from its conclusions, disputing the traffic-death statistics. Still, he called the new proposed system innovative and said it could solve some shortcomings of the current regulation. His one concern, he said, was that automakers might find new ways to game the system.
 So how does this all work? 
 The current system regulates two broad categories of vehicles: cars and light-duty trucks, including S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and minivans. In 2005 models automakers are required to meet a fuel economy average of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 21.2 miles per gallon for light trucks. The new proposal would break up the light-truck group into six smaller categories based on vehicles' dimensions. Requirements would be less stringent for bigger vehicles. Particularly irksome to environmentalists is that the largest S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks, like Hummer H2's, would remain excluded from the regulations. (Administration officials say jumbo S.U.V.'s could still be covered in their final plan due in April.) 
 The new system encourages manufacturers not to reduce weight to improve mileage, but to take steps like putting better technology under the hood, from hybrid electric systems to more efficient transmissions, or perhaps de-emphasizing horsepower. 
 While the new system would probably discourage some dubious practices, like raising the ride height of cars to reclassify them as light trucks, some vehicles could move into less demanding mileage categories with only tiny changes in dimensions. Regulators say they are considering ways to guard against this.''In a perfect world, we would have no dependence on foreign oil, we would drive hydrogen vehicles and we would be carpooling,'' Dr. Runge said. ''But that's a dream world. We have to operate in reality.''

HEADLINE: A Ruling on Security And Tenant Privacy

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE office of the New York City district administrator of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal ruled this month that landlords can require tenants to use electronic key cards with photos on them to enter their buildings. But the state agency also said landlords cannot put any personal data -- including tenants' names -- on the card.
 The decision involves a landlord-tenant debate that has become increasingly contentious: when does enhanced security infringe on tenants' rights? The ruling was stayed pending an appeal to the commissioner.
''Enhanced security has been a general theme in American society subsequent to the 2001 terrorist attacks,'' the decision said. 
 The office also ruled that keeping track of those who enter or exit a building does not violate rent laws, but added that this decision did not determine whether tracking tenants is an invasion of privacy, because that determination is outside its jurisdiction.
 The rulings arose from an effort by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to issue electronic key cards to residents and some of their guests at the company's 2,700-unit Peter Cooper Village complex, between First Avenue and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and 20th and 23rd Streets in Manhattan. 
 Jack L. Lester, a Manhattan lawyer who represented the tenants, said that in March, MetLife decided to replace metal keys with electronic key cards that bore a picture of the tenant along with the tenant's name. The landlord, he said, originally indicated that it would issue guest cards -- specifically for guests to enter the building in the absence of the tenant -- that would contain a photo and the name of each guest. Guests arriving when a tenant is home would simply be buzzed in, as before.
 ''The tenants were very upset by this new procedure,'' Mr. Lester said. ''They considered it a blatant invasion of privacy.''
 The tenants sought an order in State Supreme Court barring the landlord from instituting the changes. In April, Justice Rolando Acosta allowed MetLife to replace the metal keys with electronic cards, but issued an interim order prohibiting it from including a photo or any other identifying information. He sent the case to the state agency to determine whether the use of cards, photos or identifying information violated rent laws.
 In its ruling, on Aug. 15, the agency office noted that while the tenants had said the landlord's plan constituted a significant change in the terms of the tenancy, the owner's lawyer, Daniel J. Ansell, indicated to the court that all that was needed to get a key card was a valid photo ID as proof of identity, and verification of tenant and occupant information -- including Social Security numbers -- already in the landlord's possession. The lawyer also said that the photo ID would not be retained by the landlord. (Mr. Ansell declined to comment for this article.)
 The agency office ruled that while an owner can demand proof of identity before issuing a card, the owner cannot require verification of the Social Security number of anyone other than those who have given him a security deposit; cannot demand Social Security numbers for the issuance of guest cards; and cannot put any personal data -- including the name of the tenant -- on the card.
 Maurice Mann, chief executive of Mann Realty Associates, a Manhattan company that owns and manages residential buildings, said owners have an obligation to protect tenants' security. 
 But Lucas Ferrara, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants and landlords, noted that ''the procedures used to record the comings and goings of building occupants can also be used to expose tenants illegally subletting their apartment or not using it as a principal residence.''

HEADLINE: Training for a Job in Real Estate (It's Hot in Career Prospects, Too)

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Early one morning recently, Frances T. Frame administered an exam to a student at the Real Estate Education Center's Brooklyn office. ''Good luck, baby,'' she said. 
 A few hours later, after the student had completed and passed the exam, she offered additional encouragement: ''Now go out there and make money.''
 It was a typical scene for Ms. Frame, who is vice president of the Manhattan school but who also functions as its cheerleader. 
 She particularly tries to encourage students who enrolled through a government voucher program that pays for employment training. ''Your heart goes out to them,'' Ms. Frame said. ''It gives them a chance.'' 
 The vouchers pay for training in real estate and other marketable professions for people who are on public assistance and unemployed, as well as for low- and middle-income workers who are looking to improve skills, leave dead-end jobs or change careers. They are offered through the five main Workforce1 Career Centers in New York, which are operated jointly by the city's Department of Small Business Services, the New York Labor Department and City University of New York.
 Edgar Wilson, 53, says, ''The program really changed my life.'' Mr. Wilson was on welfare for a year after the company he worked for relocated to Texas. 
 Last year, Mr. Wilson completed classes at the Real Estate Education Center, one of 15 schools approved to offer real estate training. He is now working in Manhattan as a licensed agent with Citi Habitats, a residential real estate broker. The voucher program was hardly a handout, Mr. Wilson says. ''They expect you to do what you're supposed to do. They are tough.'' 
 Sandy Frame, Ms. Frame's husband, who founded and is president of the five-year-old school, began accepting the vouchers about a year and a half ago. Since then, more than 60 students have attended the school using vouchers. The school offers flexible hours to accommodate employed people like Sofia Tzanis, 33, a Brooklyn resident, who took evening and Sunday classes while working full time for a contracting company in Manhattan. She now works part time for Century 21 William B. May.
 The 45-hour basic class in real estate sales is the school's most popular, Mr. Frame said, but the center also offers courses in residential and commercial brokerage, appraisal, home inspection, mortgage lending, facilities maintenance and property management.
 In an introductory facilities management class one evening, the instructor, Peter J. Grech, told students, ''Your life is in the hands of the superintendent.''
 ''You've got mold issues; you've got lead paint issues; you've got asbestos issues,'' said Mr. Grech, who is president of the Superintendents Technical Association, stressing the breadth of knowledge needed, in topics from ethics and engineering systems to air quality and security.
 Adrian Lyon, 58, was the only voucher student in a class of a dozen or so. A resident of Manhattan, Mr. Lyon has worked in Washington State as a fleet manager of city vehicles and in the Bronx and Queens as a foreman at bus companies. But last August he was laid off from a Brooklyn waste management company and he has not found work since.
 Reporting for unemployment benefits one day, he saw the voucher training program advertised at the Workforce1 Career Center in Harlem, which is in the same building as the unemployment office. Mr. Lyon hopes to land a job as a building manager or superintendent, a position in which he expects the pay to be in the range of what he made as a fleet manager, about $55,000 a year.
 Training for superintendents and property managers is critical, said Margie Russell, executive director of the New York Association of Realty Managers. With sophisticated technology and ever-changing laws and building codes, the demands of the job have gone beyond simply managing employees and fixing minor problems..
 But ''it's a bright future'' for job seekers, she said. ''Everywhere you look, another apartment building is going up.''
 The training vouchers were initially issued in 2001, but there was little infrastructure for the program then, and few controls, said Benjamin M. Branham, spokesman for the city's small-business services department. ''They were passed out like free buttons,'' he said. 
 In July 2003, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg merged the Department of Employment and the Department of Small Business Services, linking work force training and economic development. Now the voucher program is driven by demand, responding to the needs of city job seekers and industry growth. Mr. Branham said the emphasis was on having a job at the end of the training.
 Applicants for the vouchers must be at least 18 and make less than $56,000 a year. The grants, up to $2,500, are paid by the state, directly to approved schools. Of the 277 training schools eligible to receive vouchers, 111 schools have received them, Mr. Branham said.
 In the last year and a half, some 10,000 vouchers have been issued, at a total cost of about $26 million. The number of jobs secured as a result of the training program is not known, but Mr. Branham said that at least 2,300 people had used the vouchers for training that led to employment. 
 Each school receives two annual evaluations and, once more than 15 voucher students have completed training, must provide proof that at least half of its voucher students have found jobs. The Real Estate Education Center will get its first evaluation in January.
 Barbara Craig, who attended the center and accepted a job with a real estate development company last week, learned about the voucher program when she went to the Workforce1 Career Center in Jamaica, Queens, near her home.
 Ms. Craig, who is in her mid-40's, was a secretary for 13 years and worked for four years in desktop publishing for investment bankers before being laid off two years ago.
 ''When you are laid off, the last thing you can afford to do is take classes,'' she said. ''But it is exactly what you should do.'' 
 Devera Hardeman, 33, a Manhattan resident, said she was initially concerned about the stigma of a program associated with welfare and unemployment.
 But Ms. Hardeman, who has worked part time as a teacher in Harlem for almost eight years, was ready for a change. She is now licensed as a real estate agent and notary public, and received certificates to work as an assistant appraiser, mortgage specialist and property manager. Ms. Hardeman recently received two job offers but is waiting for more before making a decision.
 But it was Ms. Frame, she said, who ensured her success. ''She's the perfect person to give that push,'' she said. ''She's a second mother. She changed my whole life.''

HEADLINE: Case Is Appealed Over Lack of West Indians on the Jury

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In an unusual reflection of New York City's growing diversity, lawyers for a West Indian man are arguing that he was denied justice because the Bronx jury that convicted him of rape, sodomy and burglary included only American-born blacks while all five potential jurors who were West Indian were improperly excluded by the prosecution.
 Michael C. Taglieri, an appellate lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, filed suit last week in federal court in Manhattan on behalf of Mark Watson, a Jamaican-born man who was convicted in 2000 and is serving prison terms that total 37 1/2 to 75 years.
Whatever the impact of the suit on his client's case, he said, the potential impact on jury selection looms larger. In fact, he acknowledges, his client's chances of acquittal might have been even slimmer if the jury had included West Indians. 
 ''The reason that this case is being fought is for Mr. Watson's sake and also for the sake of the jurors,'' Mr. Taglieri said. ''No person has the right to serve on any particular jury, but a citizen has the right not to be excluded from jury service for unfair reasons.''
 Courts have held that, as a group, blacks and Mexican-Americans, among others, cannot be systematically excluded from a jury simply because of their race or ethnicity.
 In an earlier case, another Bronx man challenging his conviction -- former Representative Mario Biaggi -- won the argument that Italian-Americans are also a protected group under the rules against discriminatory jury selection. But his appeal in a racketeering case was denied in 1988 because, the court found, the government had other reasons for peremptorily challenging the Italian-Americans who were prospective jurors. 
 Regardless of the merits of the Legal Aid Society suit, it is a poignant reminder -- if one were needed, given the expected turnout at next weekend's West Indian Day parade in Brooklyn -- that an influx of immigrants from the Caribbean and, more recently, from Africa has altered the composition of the city's black population and has redefined how blacks are perceived by other groups and even how they perceive themselves. 
 Demographers for the City Planning Department estimated earlier this year that more than one in three black New Yorkers are foreign-born. The proportion is growing as more immigrants arrive and as more American-born blacks leave for the suburbs and move outside the metropolitan area, especially to the South. 
 The lawsuit challenges the trial court judge's conclusion that West Indians are simply black people ''who happen to be from the West Indies'' and his rejection of the defense argument that ''the absence of this group excludes a specific point of view that cannot be articulated by other members of the jury.''
 The judge added, ''If there is a bias against a person from the West Indies, it would be race-based and, as I said, there are a number of black Americans on the jury.'' 
 At the trial, Mr. Watson's lawyer said that while the jury included 10 American-born blacks, the West Indians rejected as jurors by the prosecution had been challenged only because of their ethnic background and ''because they would, in fact, have some sort of understanding of my client.'' 
 In state appeals, Mr. Watson's lawyers maintained that ''West Indians and African Americans see themselves as forming separate groups, consider themselves in economic competition with one another, regard one another with disdain, and judge one another via demeaning stereotypes.''
 The state appeals were rejected, prompting last week's federal suit that would compel prosecutors to explain why the five prospective jurors were rejected. 
 Steven Reed, a spokesman for District Attorney Robert T. Johnson, who is black (his maternal grandparents were from Barbados), said Mr. Watson was convicted on the basis of fingerprint, DNA and other conclusive evidence.
 He also said that judges had not supported the defense claim that West Indians were systematically excluded and that, in fact, two of the jurors were West Indian (although Mr. Taglieri says they were of Puerto Rican descent). ''Our policy is against excluding members of any group based on who they are,'' Mr. Reed said. 
 In his suit, Mr. Taglieri marshaled research from academics, including Mary C. Waters, a sociology professor at Harvard, who concluded that West Indians ''describe American blacks as hypersensitive to issues of race, while the American blacks describe the foreign-born blacks as naive in their acceptance of whites.''
 The West Indians are typically a majority of the population in their homelands and are a group of immigrants seeking better lives. 
 ''The court is definitely wrong, and West Indians are a group with separate experiences and values,'' Nancy Foner, distinguished professor of sociology at Hunter College of the City University of New York, agreed. 
 Mr. Taglieri acknowledged that Mr. Watson might have been convicted even faster with West Indians on the jury because ''West Indians tend to be very law-and-order oriented.'' But he ''would have had the conception that it was a fair trial,'' Mr. Taglieri said.

HEADLINE: To Play Is The Thing

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
BASEBALL has always been the most literary of sports, but it never managed to produce an intellectual fight worthy of the term. For most of its existence, writings on the game tended toward the poetic, like John Updike's ''Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,'' a farewell to Ted Williams, or toward statistical minutiae.
 This summer, however, the sport has found itself in the equivalent of a theological dispute about whether baseball is a game of mystery or of data, of statistics and analysis or of intuition and human instinct.
 Like any good intellectual spat, this one involves high-brow questions and low-brow insults -- in this case, dumb, narrow-minded and even unloving. It also has attracted interest from fields as far from the dugout as medicine, Hollywood and Wall Street, which find themselves grappling with the same question as baseball managers: When information can be gathered more cheaply and quickly than ever before, should people rely less on their hunches and more on numbers? 
 ''I've been sat down and told they can give me a better way to do everything,'' Tony La Russa, manager of the St. Louis Cardinals and the hero of a new book celebrating the hunch, said last week, describing the statistics crowd. ''They really are convinced that they can sit there and crunch out a formula that negates my power of observation.''
 ''It's been a little irritating,'' La Russa added, ''because there's a certain arrogance with that whole group.''
 It began two years ago, with the publication of ''Moneyball,'' the Michael Lewis best seller about the Oakland A's, whose general manager, Billy Beane, used quantitative tools to keep his team near the top of its division every year, despite having less to spend than many competitors. 
 All the while, Beane marveled at the inanity of baseball's old ways, like judging prospects by body type instead of performance. Beane's success, and that of Lewis's book, brought even more number-crunchers into front offices, often at the suggestion of a team owner who had read ''Moneyball.''
 Last year's World Series victory by the statistics-centric Boston Red Sox set baseball's old guard even farther back on its heels. The lessons of their championship will be enumerated next month with the publication of ''Mind Game: How the Boston Red Sox Got Smart and Finally Won a World Series,'' written by the staff of Baseball Prospectus, a Web site that is to baseball's reformation what The Public Interest was to the rise of conservatism.
 The traditionalists, who still dominate the scouting ranks, many front offices and the baseball media, have mounted a counterreformation this year with two books of their own. The first, ''Three Nights in August,'' by Buzz Bissinger portrays La Russa as a master at tinkering with players' psyches.
 He tries to bring out the best from an underachieving player, and he decides which pitchers should be briefed about the opposing lineup before a start, and which should simply go out and throw. 
 The second traditionalist text, ''Scout's Honor,'' by Bill Shanks celebrates the scouts of Atlanta Braves, a profession that often serves as Beane's foil in ''Moneyball.'' The Braves have won 13 straight division titles, Shanks writes, by letting their scouts find the players with the best ''makeup,'' a baseball catch-all for hustle, attitude and heart. 
 Shanks is openly contemptuous of the Lewis book, writing, ''the brash disregard for scouting in its truest sense as portrayed in 'Moneyball' was just as insulting to me as it was to so many scouts around the game.'' 
 Academic research, however, is pretty much on the side of statistics. Whether diagnosing patients or evaluating job candidates, human beings vastly overestimate their ability to make judgments, research shows. Numbers and analysis almost always make people better.
 ''There have been hundreds of papers on subjects from picking students for a school to predicting the survival of cancer patients,'' said Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago economist who uses sports examples in his class on decision-making. When a computer model is given the same information as an expert, the model almost always comes out on top, Thaler said. 
 Baseball's new analysts say that teams rely too much on instinct and received wisdom, which leads to things like the overuse of the sacrifice bunt and the drafting of high-school players. 
 In a speech to a group of investment bankers shortly after ''Moneyball'' appeared, Paul DePodesta, then Beane's deputy, called baseball a game where you were supposed to sit on your behind, ''spit tobacco and nod at stupid things,'' borrowing a remark from a retired pitcher named Bill Lee.
 ''It became clear to us that the inefficiency in decision making in baseball was vast,'' said DePodesta, who played baseball at Harvard and led the Los Angeles Dodgers to the playoffs last year, his first season as their general manager. 
 The early record suggests that the reformers have found a real edge, if not a fool-proof method. The small-budget teams that depend most on analysis -- Oakland, Toronto, Cleveland -- are among the only ones in the playoff picture this year.
 But their record is hardly spotless, the old guard happily notes. Beane has never won a playoff series, and DePodesta's Dodgers are struggling this year. The Braves are in first place again, despite Baseball Prospectus's many predictions of their imminent demise. So are La Russa's Cardinals
 The most entertaining part of the battle is the charges and countercharges. Bissinger, for example, writes that the number crunchers do not truly love the game because they do not appreciate its lore or its human ingredient, a claim Lewis called absurd.
 Indeed, what makes this fight truly comparable to those that periodically roil the worlds of art history or foreign policy is that the differences between the sides aren't as great as the sniping between them suggests.
 La Russa spends much of his time jotting down information on index cards and studying statistics in his office, while members of the new guard often say the future belongs to teams that combine number crunching with scouting and injury prevention.
 ''The 'Moneyball' kind of stuff has its place, but so does the human,'' La Russa said by telephone from Pittsburgh. ''Really, the combination is the answer.''
 But reaching that happy medium is likely to prove more difficult, and more interesting, than talking about it. The Cardinals, after all, created a statistical analysis department in the last two years, but La Russa said it had ''almost zero effect'' on his strategy. He wishes the team had instead spent the money on new video equipment.

HEADLINE: Dreading a Replay Of the 1938 Hurricane

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
THE national commission that studied the terror attacks of Sept. 11 concluded that the lapses in preventing or responding to the attacks stemmed from a collective failure to imagine that such a catastrophe could happen. 
 Emergency officials and meteorologists fear a similar failure of imagination on Long Island about major hurricanes.
Conditions are right this year for one or more especially severe storms to lash the Island, they say. But it's been a long time -- 67 years -- since the last Big One, and officials worry that Long Islanders accustomed to the glancing blows of minor storms have little grasp of just how devastating a major hurricane could be. 
 ''The only people who really have any idea are those who lived through the 1938 storm,'' said Michael E. Wyllie, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service office in Upton, referring to the unnamed hurricane that laid waste to eastern Long Island that year. ''And you are talking about people who are into their 70's to even remember it.'' 
 The 1938 hurricane killed more than 50 people on Long Island, even though it struck the sparsely populated East End on Sept. 21, long after the crowds of summer visitors were gone. It killed hundreds more in Rhode Island as it roared northward, flooding that state's cities. Over all, the storm took 600 lives and did about $308 million in damage to insured property, the equivalent of $4.1 billion today, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. 
 Scientists and officials using newly refined computer models say that a repeat of that storm today would be many times as destructive, because so much valuable real estate has since been developed on or near the shore, directly in harm's way.
 Timely evacuation of threatened areas, impossible in 1938 because there was almost no warning of the storm's approach, could prevent most loss of life in a repeat. But officials cite this danger: many people may think they can ride out a major hurricane as easily as they have the tamer storms the Island has seen lately. 
 It's been two decades since the last significant hurricane hit Long Island, and that one was Gloria, a Category 1 storm, the lowest rung on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, with sustained winds of no more than 95 miles an hour. That fast-moving 1985 storm, remembered mostly for tree damage and lengthy power failures, gave little hint of the worst that can be expected from a Category 3 hurricane like the 1938 storm, Mr. Wyllie said. 
 If ever there was a year for big hurricanes to strike Long Island, 2005 would seem to be it. High water temperatures in the Atlantic, weak atmospheric wind-shear conditions and the storm-steering influence of the seasonal weather phenomenon known as the Bermuda High all seem to be providing a window for a fearsome storm to charge up the East Coast. The season peaks in September. 
 If the 1938 hurricane, the strongest to strike Long Island in the last century, were to hit today, emergency officials say that Suffolk County alone would suffer more than $24 billion in losses. Nassau's losses would be smaller because the track of the storm would be well to the east, but it, too, might suffer damage in the hundreds of millions or more. The county has not calculated a dollar estimate. 
 Officials are more circumspect about projecting human casualties. The toll would depend on whether people heeded evacuation orders, they say. Those who did not would be on their own as winds and waters rose and police and emergency crews hunkered down to ride out the hurricane. 
 ''The cavalry will not be coming over the hill,'' said Thomas O'Hara, an ambulance services consultant in Suffolk's Department of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Services. ''So when we tell you to go, it's time to go.''
 The most prudent residents, Mr. O'Hara said, will bypass public shelters and clear out of Long Island entirely. ''Get in the car and go visit Aunt Tillie in Highland Falls,'' he said. ''The last place you want to end up is isolated and alone, and the second-last place is in a public shelter, because I assure you, you will not get a mint on your pillow.'' 
 County emergency planners and Federal Emergency Management Agency recommend preparing for a hurricane by taking these basic precautions: gathering a ''go kit'' of essentials, including medications; filling the car's gas tank; keeping bottled water, flashlights with fresh batteries, and a battery-powered radio or television on hand in case the power goes out; and having a family emergency plan. 
 The two counties and the State Emergency Management Office are currently surveying residents in coastal areas to gauge their preparedness and to find out what they would do in the face of an approaching storm. The survey results will help officials fine-tune plans for evacuation and shelters. 
 ''Everybody over the years has gravitated towards the water, and we have gotten complacent and are not thinking about the ramifications of that,'' said Joseph Williams, Suffolk's commissioner of fire, rescue and emergency services. 
 The projections of economic loss, generated by a new computer program called Hazus-MH that was released to state and local governments last year by FEMA, are one indication of the Island's vulnerability. 
 Aided by Hazus-MH and other continually updated programs that leave less and less to the imagination, officials see an ever-clearer picture of what hurricanes could do. And it is not a pretty sight.
 Gregory J. Caronia, the director for emergency preparedness in Nassau's Office of Emergency Management, recently produced a map that showed how Long Island would fare in a worst-case hurricane -- a Category 4 storm hitting at high tide, with winds as high as 155 m.p.h., moving west-northwest at 30 miles an hour. The Island looked like a swamped boat with water pouring over the gunwales. 
 Based on National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Slosh maps (an acronym for ''sea, lake and overland surges from hurricanes''), the map showed the entire city of Long Beach under more than eight feet of water, enough to obliterate houses and put oceanfront high rises at imminent peril of being undermined and toppled. A tidal surge running up to 21 feet above normal high tide would flood low-lying communities all along the South Shore and as far as five miles inland.
 Tides could run more than 30 feet above normal in Little Neck Bay and 24 feet above normal around Manhasset Bay and Hempstead Harbor, the map shows, as wind-driven water piles up relentlessly in the narrower westward reaches of the Sound with nowhere to go but ashore. 
 In Suffolk, Fire Island and its summer communities would be overrun by waves. The surging waters would cut off the eastern end of the South Fork at Napeague, making an island out of Montauk, and would swamp much of the North Fork. Ocean surf would cause major erosion.
 In West Hampton Dunes, an Army Corps of Engineers project to rebuild dunes and close a breach in the barrier island, completed in 1993, would be no match for the raging surf, and the multimillion-dollar homes built there in recent years would almost certainly be washed away. 
 Clifford Jones, the project manager for the corps, said the beach rebuilding was designed to protect against more modest storms, the kind that occur about once in 44 years on average. He said the corps estimated a 50 percent chance that the new beach and dunes would be overcome during the project's 30-year expected life. 
 Along with pounding surf, a Category 4 hurricane would bring with it lightning strikes, torrential rain, major inland flooding, tons of airborne debris and fallen trees -- and, if the winds were high enough, roofs and walls all over the Island would be torn away, not just at the shore.
 The Long Island Power Authority estimates that in a major storm, as many as one million homes and businesses -- in other words, nearly everyone on the Island -- could lose power, some for long periods. 
 As calamitous as all that would be, it would still pale in comparison to the damage in New York City, where the Rockaway peninsula, parts of Wall Street, many subway stations and all of John F. Kennedy International Airport would be under water.
 Forecasters say that while it is possible for such a Category 4 hurricane to reach Long Island, it probably will not happen more than once in 500 years. The strongest storm of all, a Category 5, is considered all but impossible this far north, because water temperatures here are never high enough. 
 The computer maps generated by Mr. Caronia, Nassau's emergency preparedness director, show how damage would diminish in lesser storms. A Category 2 hurricane -- weaker than the Category 3 storm in 1938 but still stronger than Gloria, with 110 m.p.h. winds -- following the same track as his hypothetical Category 4 and also striking at high tide, would still swamp Long Beach, but the tidal surge would be 14 feet above normal high tide, not 21 feet. There would still be flooding and wind damage across the Island, but many more buildings would remain intact. 
 Using Hazus-MH software, Mr. O'Hara, the ambulance services consultant, studied a possible storm in the Category 2 range hitting at high tide in the Babylon area. He estimated that it would cause $122.5 million in property damage and business interruption in Suffolk and generate 1.45 million tons of debris. 
 Mr. O'Hara's computer studies, combining topographical, storm surge, demographic and building data, project that residences would suffer most of the $24.5 billion in damage that a 1938-type Category 3 storm might do in Suffolk. Members of some 62,000 households would be left homeless, and 37 percent of all buildings in the county would sustain at least moderate damage. 
 A separate study by AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe risk-modeling company in Boston, came up with somewhat different estimates for such a storm. The company, which does most of its work for insurance companies, said if a 1938 hurricane struck today, the total insured losses for the entire Atlantic Coast would be $24.5 billion. S. Ming Lee, a senior vice president of the company, said that of that figure, $11.6 billion in losses would be in New York State, mostly in Nassau and Suffolk.
 Even so, the damage would be greater than from all four hurricanes that battered Florida last year combined, or even from the strongest storm to hit the United States in memory, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, whose 155 m.p.h. winds devastated South Florida and the Louisiana coast.
 In dollar-damage terms, it would be a disaster second only to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, which led to more than $30 billion in insurance payments. 
 Insurers say that many Long Island homeowners could be in for a shock after a big hurricane. Those who have not updated their policies to reflect home improvements may find that they have too little insurance to cover replacement costs. 
 Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, said that a study by her group found that 64 percent of all homes in the United States were underinsured, by an average of 27 percent. Federal flood insurance is capped at $250,000, much less than many shorefront homes are worth.
 Officials consider Long Beach, with 60,000 people living on a low-lying barrier island about 10 feet above sea level, to be the most vulnerable point on Nassau's South Shore. ''It's the weak link, as far as Nassau is concerned,'' said Richard Rotanz, the county's commissioner of emergency management. 
 Emergency plans try to compensate with early evacuation over the three bridges out of the city, two of them at low elevations and certain to flood in a bad storm. At least 18 hours before the predicted landfall of a hurricane, fire sirens are to begin sounding four single blasts, evenly spaced and repeated for 30 minutes. Emergency teams using loudspeakers are to drive through city streets telling residents to leave. 
 ''The biggest thing is early warning,'' said James P. Hennessy, the president of the City Council.
 The city manager, Charles Theofan, said that Long Beach had to be alert. ''We really are very vulnerable,'' he said. 
 Still, the city has declined to approve a proposal from the Army Corps of Engineers to build new dunes along its beaches as part of a storm protection project. 
 On Fire Island, the most vulnerable coastal area in Suffolk, evacuations would be mostly by ferry, well in advance of a predicted landfall. Gerald Stoddard, the president of the Fire Island Association, a property owners' group, said hurricanes were the general topic of conversation among summer residents.
 Protecting Fire Island and the entire South Shore from Jones Inlet to Montauk Point has been a bone of contention for years. The Corps of Engineers has been discussing a dune-building and beach-widening project since the 1960's and is now studying a revised plan. But Irving Like, a lawyer for the New York Coastal Partnership, a group of Fire Island and South Shore home and business owners, said that the Interior Department and the corps had failed to comply with a directive from Congress to submit a shore-erosion protection plan for Fire Island by the end of 1999. 
 Close calls with hurricanes do not count with the public, but they are agonizing for emergency officials and meteorologists who are trained to expect the worst. In August 2003, Hurricane Isabel gave them a scare, building up Category 5 winds of 167 m.p.h. and threatening to make landfall anywhere from the Carolinas to eastern Long Island. But wind shear weakened the huge storm while it was still over water, and a high pressure system over New England steered it onto the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where it struck at the low end of the Category 2 range and soon declined to a tropical storm, sparing Long Island. 
 Still, experts say that the Island cannot count on being lucky every time.

HEADLINE: Desperate in Buffalo: Men Who'll Bare It All

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
HERE is what women think that men think about their own bodies: that they are all, no matter how portly or scrawny, aging or out of shape, God's gift to us. That may be part of the reason ''The Full Monty'' has been such an audience pleaser since it began life as a 1997 British film. And the current Gateway Playhouse production at the Patchogue Theater is chock-full of charm.
 Here are some unemployed blue-collar guys in Buffalo actually concerned about what people will think of their naked bodies. Dave (Tad Wilson) knows he's fat. Horse (Kingsley Leggs) is afraid he won't live up to some people's stereotypical expectations of a black man. Harold (Bill Kocis) has the look of a mild-mannered bank clerk, dressed or nude. 
 The reason for this planned nakedness is economic. Dave and his pal Jerry (Charlie Pollock) have been jobless for almost 18 months. Jerry, in particular, needs money because he is behind on his child-support payments and is afraid he will lose his son to his ex-wife, Pam (Julie Dingman Evans), and her live-in boyfriend, a white-collar guy who takes Pam on Cape Cod vacations. 
 Appalled at first by the women in town going to a Chippendales-style male strip show, Jerry comes up with the idea of putting together a show of his own, with Dave and anyone else they can dig up. (The idea of going ''the full monty,'' British slang for total nudity, occurs to him later out of desperation.) 
 They recruit Malcolm (Andy Jobe) while he is trying to commit suicide. They persuade their former boss, Harold, to join the group. Then they hold auditions, during which Ethan Girard (Nick Dalton) announces his intention to dance up the side of the wall like Donald O'Connor in ''Singin' in the Rain.'' He fails and he can't sing, but he has other assets.
 The real find is Horse, who, despite looking ''60 if he's a day,'' as Harold observes, impresses everyone with ''Big Black Man.'' This number, which might be described as James Brown with a bad back, has been the showstopper since Andre De Shields first performed it on Broadway in 2000. The appropriately named Mr. Leggs is outstanding. 
 Turning nonmusical films into musicals is not always a great idea. (May the musicals ''Carrie'' and ''Lolita'' rest in peace.) But David Yazbek's music and lyrics enhance Simon Beaufoy's original story and its obvious affection for the characters. 
 The finale, ''Let It Go,'' and Jerry's ballad ''Breeze Off the River'' are terrific in very different ways. The women's musical numbers are much less satisfying with the exception of ''Jeanette's Showbiz Number,'' in which the pianist (Gerrianne Raphael), who has been around so long that Bing Crosby once tried to seduce her, recalls the old days. (''This gig's an echo/Of that time with Buddy Greco.'')
 There were sound problems during the performance I attended, but they seemed to have been eliminated by Act II. Kelly Tighe's sets are noteworthy. Patrick Q. Kelly's musical direction is admirable. (I especially liked the way the men punctuated their anger with the metal chairs in ''Scrap,'' their song about the indignities of unemployment.) And the director, Keith Andrews, must have done a lot of things right. 
 Does the Patchogue cast keep its promise and live up to the show's title? Let's just say that the lighting people have to have split-second timing to make the final moment work. And they succeed.
 ''The Full Monty'' is at the Patchogue Theater, 71 East Main Street, Patchogue, through Sept. 3, (631)286-1133.

HEADLINE: Good News, Bad News: Your Loan's Approved

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
ADAM GARDNER wasn't going to let limited resources stop him from buying a house. A 28-year-old appraiser's apprentice from Reno, Nev., he extended his search all the way to a new development 20 miles north of downtown. When he finally found a place -- a two-bedroom, three-bath house -- he took out two loans to finance 90 percent of the $253,850 price tag. And to keep his monthly payments within budget, he obtained what's known as an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage.
 ''I moved out of Reno to find something I could afford. Even then I needed an interest-only adjustable mortgage,'' said Mr. Gardner, who closed on his new home in April. ''First-time home buyers are being pushed out of the market entirely.''
Actually, many first-time home buyers are being pushed into the embrace of creative financing. As the housing boom lifts the median home price way beyond the budget of huge numbers of Americans, middle-income home buyers like Mr. Gardner are increasingly turning to such mortgages -- a decision that could well come back to haunt both them and the banks behind the loans later on. 
 The newfangled mortgages have been heralded in the industry as useful tools for buyers who would otherwise be shut out of the surging real estate market. That's because they reduce borrowers' monthly payments by allowing them to pay only interest initially while charging a lower interest rate that remains fixed for a few years before starting to adjust annually for the rest of the term, typically 30 years. 
 But critics say they are riskier than standard mortgages, as they are prone to two payment spikes -- one when the interest-only period expires and another when the fixed-rate period ends and the borrower faces potentially much higher interest rates. 
 Critics also worry that offering extra-risky financial products that permit financially vulnerable buyers to get ever bigger mortgages is particularly perilous now, when many experts say the housing bubble may be near a breaking point. 
 ''We are in uncharted territory,'' said Susan M. Wachter, professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''On the one hand, it is the case that these mortgages enable purchases of homes by higher-risk, poor-credit households who otherwise wouldn't be able to own a home. But on the other hand, they are riskier products, and we don't have historical data to know how risky they are.''
 Mr. Gardner, for one, is not especially worried. He said homes like his had already appreciated substantially, in his case making him a paper gain of tens of thousands of dollars. By the time the interest rate on this 30-year mortgage starts adjusting and his mortgage starts amortizing -- in five years -- he expects to have either sold or refinanced the home. 
 If he cannot, however, he may have to dish out a lot more money to pay his mortgage. How much more? If interest rates on his mortgage rose by a mere, say, two percentage points, to 7.25 percent from 5.25 percent, his mortgage payments in five years would increase by about $500 a month -- to some $1,560 from about $1,060, according to estimates by Cathie Jackson, who owns Mortgage Options, the broker who arranged Mr. Gardner's loan. But if rates spiked to 10.25 percent, as they did in the late 1980's, he could end up paying almost $1,000 more a month. 
 UNTIL recently, interest-only mortgages were the preserve of more affluent borrowers, people with solid or ''prime'' credit histories and substantial resources, including high incomes relative to the size of their total debt payments. They mostly used I.O. mortgages, as they are called, to refinance and extract cash from their homes.
 But as home prices have continued to soar, lenders have aggressively pushed interest-only mortgages down-market. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, typical home buyers using interest-only adjustable-rate mortgages could afford to borrow some $50,000 more than they could with standard 30-year fixed loans -- and still make the same initial monthly payments. So banks are offering the new products as an instrument of choice for potential buyers who could not otherwise afford a home. 
 In the subprime market -- where borrowers have low credit scores, higher debt-to-income ratios and, often, little cash to make a down payment -- interest-only loans soared from virtually nothing two years ago to about a quarter of all new mortgages in the first half of this year. 
 ''The most direct contributor to this is housing prices,'' said David Liu, a mortgage strategist at UBS, the investment bank. ''Average income definitely did not keep pace with home-price appreciation. The only way for buyers to afford a house is to get a bigger loan.''
 One of the first banks to take the I.O. mortgages down-market was First Franklin, a unit of the National City Corporation in Cleveland. Its specialty is what it calls the nonprime market, essentially home buyers with better credit ratings than typical subprime borrowers but who cannot afford a down payment. 
 First Franklin has had success selling interest-only mortgages that it promotes as a way to ''reduce monthly payments, reduce debt-to-income ratios and boost loan amounts.'' Today, such loans are more than half of its new mortgages, up from 27 percent two years ago. 
 First Franklin offers 100 percent financing that its Web site suggests is ''ideal for first-time and low-cash buyers,'' and even 103 percent financing for buyers ''to shrink their out-of-pocket expenses or to maximize purchase power.'' 
 John Gellhausen, vice president for consumer finance at National City, who is in charge of the First Franklin unit, said customers using interest-only loans were not necessarily financially troubled. They just have better things to do with their money, he said, than make a down payment on a home or pay the principal on the mortgage. 
 Maybe so. But many First Franklin customers also use interest-only mortgages to push their borrowing and buying power as far as it will go. On average, they borrow 94 percent of the value of their homes, mostly through a second fixed-rate loan for the down payment. Even though they are paying only interest, they devote a whopping 45 percent, on average, of their income to debt service. 
 By comparison, according to a UBS analysis, subprime borrowers using 30-year fixed-rate mortgages borrow, on average, slightly more than 75 percent of the value of their home and devote a more manageable 38.8 percent of their income to debt payments. 
 As these new products proliferate at the bottom end of the housing market, the risk is that borrowers will extend themselves, chasing houses higher and higher up the price scale. That would be somewhat akin to a low-income dishwasher buying stocks on margin at the height of the dot-com bubble. 
 Buyers using interest-only subprime loans have decidedly riskier profiles. They typically borrow a bigger percentage of the value of their homes, and earmark a larger slice of income to pay their debts. Most of these mortgages keep the interest rate fixed and allow interest-only payments for just two or three years, according to UBS. 
 That could soon expose borrowers to higher mortgage payments. In fact, interest rates -- especially the short-term rates that determine the rate on adjustable-rate mortgages -- are already rising sharply. If house prices take a nose dive, these buyers may find themselves squeezed between growing debt payments and a devalued asset. 
 ''They are selling it to you because it is a stretch for you to make the payment on a traditional mortgage,'' said Kathleen Keest, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham, N.C. ''That means that you are looking at more home than you can afford. When, five years down the road, the loans switch to amortizing, which is likely to be at the same time that interest rates are rising, you are going to be hit by a payment shock.'' 
 Nonetheless, both buyers and their financiers seem sanguine about the risk. Most buyers trust that they will have sold or refinanced their home before the payment shock kicks in, taking advantage of appreciation to build equity and to land a new mortgage on better terms. ''Very few people will still have these mortgages by the time the adjustment occurs,'' said Ms. Jackson, who is also president of the Nevada Association of Mortgage Professionals.
 Besides, for many middle-income buyers, the choice is often between an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage and not getting the home. In California, for example, one needs to earn $125,870 a year to qualify for a standard mortgage to buy a median-priced home, which currently costs $542,720. Only 16 percent of Californians make that kind of money.
 Kristi Borean, who owns Highland Financial, a mortgage broker in Murphy, Calif., noted that the price of an entry-level home in her area was rising above $300,000, up from a $90,000-to-$120,000 range 10 years ago. Not surprisingly, she said, the profile of the first-time home buyer has radically changed. To qualify for a standard loan for an entry-level house, Ms. Borean said, a household must have no other debt and needs at least ''two decent jobs -- say a teacher and a policeman.'' 
 ''Ten years ago, entry-level buyers were waitresses and gas station attendants,'' she added. ''Today they are out of the picture. They will rent until their parents die and leave them their house.''
 First-time home buyers are stretching the most. Nationwide, the typical first-time buyer earns only about 70 percent of the income needed to qualify for a standard mortgage to buy a typical entry-level home with 10 percent down, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 For Mr. Gardner in Reno, the interest-only mortgage was essential. The total monthly payment of $1,300, including taxes and homeowners' fees, was about a third of his and his wife's monthly income. Had he sought a standard, fixed-rate mortgage, he estimates, it would have been about $300 higher, and he might not have qualified for the loan.
 NEARBY, in Carson City, Erica Hall splits her time between full-time study at the local community college and a $1,300-a-month job in the reservations department at Harrah's Casino Hotel. She recently closed on a $135,500 condo but she said she could not have afforded it with a standard mortgage. Ms. Hall, who is 20, managed to close the deal with a 30-year mortgage that is interest-only for 10 years. That pulled down the monthly mortgage payment to just over $600. And while she said she expects to be able to refinance before her rate starts fluctuating and her amortization payments kick in, she acknowledged that her finances were already ''a teeny bit stretched.'' 
 Many home buyers may be overconfident in their ability to refinance their way out of a future mortgage squeeze. Their assumption is a rosy one -- that home prices will continue on their upward path, or at least not decline, and that interest rates will not rise too far. 
 But if the housing market tanks, as a growing number of skeptics expects, refinancing or selling into a falling market with higher interest rates won't be easy. As Bette Dobkin, a real estate agent for Coldwell Banker in Arcata, Calif., noted: ''Everyone's fear is what happens when rates go up and people are stuck.''
 So is the market poised for a wave of home repossessions? For the moment, interest-only mortgages are performing splendidly, even among subprime borrowers, showing lower delinquency rates than those of standard fixed-rate loans. But few of these interest-only loans have hit the payment shocks of amortization or higher interest rates. 
 While there is no exact parallel for the current explosion of creative mortgages in the subprime market, there are precedents that might give bankers some pause. ''We have had high default outcomes associated with instruments that were heavily used by low-income people,'' said Ms. Wachter of Wharton.
 She recalled two programs started by Congress in 1968 to stimulate low-income homeownership through mortgages that required only symbolic down payments and had very low, subsidized interest rates. Of nearly one million mortgages issued through the two programs, nearly 18 percent defaulted.
 But if the latest doomsday forecasts are right -- and house prices dive while interest rates soar-- there may be a silver lining of sorts for homeowners with interest-only adjustable-rate mortgages.
 Bob Tremble, who owns Fairview Mortgage, a small mortgage broker in the upscale gated community of Coto de Caza, near Mission Viejo in Orange County, California, observes that buyers who finance 100 percent of their homes with interest-only mortgages are likely to have no financial stake in the homes. If rates rise and the homes are repossessed, they will lose nothing. 
 ''The really big risk is on the part of the lender,'' Mr. Tremble said. ''Lenders have more to lose than borrowers.''

HEADLINE: How New Jersey Keeps 'Em Down on the Farm

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: OLDWICK 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to the business of weather, farmers are rarely happy.
 As Sharon Kyle, owner of K&S Farms in East Windsor, put it, ''You ask an old farmer, and he can always complain about the weather.''
So it seemed especially likely, given the relentless heat wave this month that sent most New Jersey residents scrambling for relief down at the Shore or cooped up indoors by the air-conditioner, that the state's growers of fruits, vegetables, grains and flowers might have been downright miserable.
 Ask many New Jersey farmers how they're doing this year, though, and you will probably get a remarkable answer: They're fine, thanks.
 Apparently, the weather formula so unappealing to humans -- blasts of heat seasoned by oppressive humidity, broken up only by occasional downpours -- is just about perfect for many of the crops grown in New Jersey. 
 ''The quality's been very good,'' said George Melick, whose family owns Melick's Town Farm in Oldwick. ''The heat, with a little bit of rain, it really helps.''
 As Mr. Melick's son Peter explained, the hot and mostly dry weather allows for ''enhanced sugars and less disease pressure,'' meaning better-tasting food and more of it.
 Though no one involved with New Jersey agriculture seems ready yet to use the term ''bumper crop'' to describe this year's output, farming officials seem bullish and say that consumers of local produce at farmers' markets, retail stands and supermarkets will share in the benefits: juicy peaches, sugary corn and tomatoes that taste like, well, tomatoes.
 ''I have to be a little bit cautious, but all indications are that it's going to be a very good season,'' said Charles Kuperis, the state's agriculture secretary. 
 Of course, the good news has to be seen in the broader context of the very real challenges facing farmers in what has come to be the ironically named Garden State. For years, growers have been under pressure to do almost anything but farm their land as demand for property in New Jersey -- the most densely populated state in America -- soared.
 The results can be seen all over the state, as vast chunks of land in North, Central and South Jersey have been transformed in recent decades from grain and vegetable farms to acres and acres of tract housing and McMansions. According to the State Department of Agriculture, there were 806,000 acres of farmed land in 2002, down from 857,000 just five years earlier, and 961,000 in 1974.
 Ms. Kyle, who was one of the farmers interviewed who predicted that this season would be a decent one, had a less cheery outlook for the long-term future of agriculture in New Jersey. ''I think it's going to continue to decline,'' she said, ''just not as steadily as it has been.''
 Still, there is some reason for optimism about the prospects of New Jersey's farmers. For one thing, the farming industry has benefited from state land preservation programs that pay agricultural landowners to place permanent restrictions on their deeds, and from lower tax assessments on farmland. The state's efforts have been effective over the last several years in preserving 138,000 acres, and farmland preservation received new financing earlier this month when Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey signed a bill appropriating an additional $142 million. 
 The flip side of land-use restrictions, of course, is that while they preserve much-desired open farmland, they also decrease its long-term value since it can no longer be sold to developers. Some farmers have actually seen their property values fall.
 But over all, the fact that the sell-off of agricultural lands has been slowed is viewed as a step in the right direction by many of New Jersey's longest-established farmers.
 ''Farmers are known to complain,'' said Bill Prickett Jr., a corn and soybean farmer in Mount Holly. ''But I think the attitudes are getting a lot better, and the citizens of New Jersey have really stepped up with this farmland preservation stuff. They're realizing they need the farmer. I'd say it's a lot better than what it was.''
 The unusual diversity of the crops in New Jersey has also proved to be a steadying factor for the farm economy. Unlike, say, Illinois, where the big corn crop is being ravaged by drought, New Jersey's mix of crops -- fruits, vegetables, grains, flowers and nursery stock -- make it less likely that the failure of any one crop will be ruinous to the state's farmers as a whole.
 ''What's unique about New Jersey is the diversity of our crops,'' Mr. Kuperis said. ''Not everybody is just a grain farmer.''
 That consistency often puts some segment of New Jersey growers in a position to benefit from higher prices during crop shortages in other regions of the country, as when heavy rains last year damaged Florida's tomato crops, or this year, when there will be less corn coming from the Midwest.
 Just as important, an increasing number of New Jersey farmers have adapted to changing circumstances by diversifying their own operations, seeking as many different sources of income as possible by growing new products and mixing crops, seeking new retail markets and even starting agri-tourism ventures like hayrides and pick-your-own fruit. 
 The Melick family's operations in Oldwick and Calafon in Hunterdon County are a perfect example. The Melicks had farmed in the area around Oldwick, they say, for 10 generations, relying for the bulk of their income on traditional local crops like apples.
 As the next generation of Melicks has come into the business -- Rebecca, 36; John, 34; and Peter, 38, have assumed much of the operation from their father, George, 69 -- the operation has been able to do what other growers in the area have not: adapt to new circumstances.
 ''Other farms around here have petered out because the next generation wasn't around to take care of them,'' Ms. Melick said. Like her brothers, she is a college graduate who chose to go into the family business. 
 Now, the Melicks rely on the retail sales for the bulk of their business, selling at three local farm stands and at the tailgate farmers' markets in Hoboken, Madison, Highland Park and Springfield. They do a brisk pick-your-own business in apples, peaches and Asian pears, and they also sell to grocery chains like ShopRite and Thriftway.
 Because of the reliance on retail sales, especially at farmers markets, where rules often require that growers only sell products they have grown themselves, it became worthwhile for the Melicks to dabble in as many new crops as possible, offering a supermarket's worth of selection from a single-family farm operation. Now, they grow strawberries early in year, asparagus (for the first time), broccoli and cauliflower, new breeds of peaches that mature at different times, plums and several exotic-looking varieties of heirloom tomatoes. 
 ''It used to be predominantly tree fruit,'' John Melick explained. ''Apples, peaches, cider and some sweet corn. But since we got involved with these tailgate markets, where you can only sell what you grow, we've tried new things. Over the last 10, 15 years we've switched over.''
 With the increase in retail sales, the Melick family business has expanded to take in about 300 acres, becoming ''more than a million dollar business,'' Mr. Melick said. (That's big for a general farm, although tiny in comparison to some of the single-crop grain or berry farms in South Jersey.)
 In a tour of the farm, the Melicks' crops all looked robust although, but Peter Melick said that the pumpkins being grown for Halloween ''could use a drink.'' 
 Underscoring the inherently fickle nature of the farming business, the Melicks said that some badly timed storms could undo an entire season of crop-friendly weather by driving away customers come harvest time.
 ''We're not out of the woods yet,'' Peter Melick said. ''On rainy weekends, no one will come out to pick the fruit when it's ready. And no one's coming back out afterwards in November. We've had floods, and we've had drought, but nothing can be as disastrous as three or four rainy weekends in a row.''
 Ms. Kyle, 36, who runs a 100-acre farm and retail stand operation in East Windsor with her husband, Kevin, said that her business had taken full advantage of the preservation measures, receiving money from the state in return for deed restrictions. 
 ''We stretched ourselves to buy this farm,'' she said. ''It takes all of that to be able to do this.''
 For the moment, she and her husband are now able to run an operation -- and to lead a life -- that seems to be throwback to older ways, not much different from the farming background of her parents or parents-in-law in the Monroe Township, where she grew up. Ms. Kyle, her husband and their three children -- Amanda, 12; Kathleen, 9; and Patrick, 7 -- raise tomatoes, watermelons, cantaloupes, broccoli, brussels sprouts, sweet corn, pumpkins and cut flowers, irrigated by a well and shipped out to a couple of farm stands in a single family-owned van.
 At the moment, Ms. Kyle is looking forward to expanding the tourism aspect of the family business, with a corn maze, a haunted hayride at Halloween and in a new experiment in farm-based entertainment, staging a professional wrestling match in one of the fields on the property.
 She said that business at her family's farm stands this year had actually been somewhat uneven, which she attributed to the hot weather, which keeps people at home, or maybe the high price of gasoline. 
 She also said that the environment for farming in New Jersey was getting more difficult -- what with taxes, development and traffic pressures -- despite the state's efforts to make things easier. ''Back when my dad was a kid farming, you could drive your tractor on the road, and everyone would know who you are and wave,'' she said. ''Now, people are ready to run you off the road.''
 Still, on a recent, sunny weekend, as Ms. Kyle watched her children running around a cornfield, she said that she had absolutely no regrets about the farming life, which she has no plans of abandoning. ''It's pretty difficult to be a farmer in this state,'' she said, ''but you just have to love it.''

HEADLINE: The Long-Term Lesson: It Pays to Diversify

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
SINCE 1994, every financial market has had a major stumble that has cost American investors caught on the wrong side a lot of money. 
 In 1994, bonds had their worst year in the last three decades. In 1997 and 1998, and again in 2001, commodity prices took a nose dive. In 2000, stocks plunged into a three-year bear market. 
I was around for all of those stumbles -- and tripped up a few times myself when musing about stocks, bonds, commodities and the dollar. Calling a fall in stocks in the 1990's was easy, except that they didn't drop until several years later than predicted. The bear year in bonds was as unexpected as it was unpleasant. 
 The markets have also surprised on the upside. Look at the much-better-than-expected returns from bonds in the three years through 2004.
 Some analysts in 2002 were worried about looming interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Like the stock market, however, the Fed delayed its move for years. When it did start raising short-term rates, in 2004, longer-term yields fell anyway.
 Commodities -- not just oil, but also raw industrial materials like copper and precious metals like gold -- have had a multiyear run that has surprised many investors.
 The lesson here is not that analysts, strategists and financial reporters are often wrong. That's well documented, even by this column, which is taking a leave of absence for the next year or so. 
 The lesson is that stumbles and recoveries are inevitable, and that means diversification is a very good idea. It increases the chance that something in your portfolio is going up when other portions are going down. In fact, diversification has produced much better results than many investors may think.
 I don't mean diversification within a stock, bond or commodity portfolio. I mean diversifying among what Wall Street calls asset classes, so that your portfolio holds stocks, bonds and commodities. 
 Diversification among asset classes also makes you put money where you may otherwise fear to go. And who knows? You may get a sweet surprise.
 In 2003 and 2004, I kept my 401(k) in a money market fund -- which is more like a mattress than an asset class -- because I was sure that interest rates would rise and I wanted to avoid the resulting capital losses in the bond market. I would have done even better if I had also moved some of that money into a 401(k) stock fund. 
 Diversification also prevents stock mania from distracting you from the opportunities in other asset classes. Stocks are right for the long run, as Prof. Jeremy J. Siegel of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has argued for years. But stocks are not the be-all and end-all of a good portfolio. The recent big gains in commodities are the best example of that. 
 Over the last 3, 5, 10 and 15 years -- the usual investment horizons for measuring market performance -- only stocks have had a down period. The average annual total return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was a loss of 2.3 percent in the five years ending in 2004, according to data calculated by Ibbotson Associates.
 Bonds had an average annual total return of 7.7 percent over the same period, as measured by the Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index. Commodities, as gauged by the total return of the Goldman Sachs Commodity index, produced returns of 13.8 percent, annualized.
 I am not anti-stocks, especially for the long run. Over the 10- and 15-year periods through 2004, equities were the winners. They returned 12.1 percent, annualized, over 10 years and 10.9 percent over 15 years.
 Bonds had annualized returns of 7.7 percent in both periods, while commodities brought home 9.1 percent a year, on average, over 10 years and 7.1 percent over 15 years.
 The average annual returns from money market funds were much smaller: 1.6 percent over three years, 2.8 percent over five years, 3.8 percent over 10 years and 4.4 percent over 15 years, according to iMoneyNet.
 Diversification is also a benefit, of course, when one big asset class stumbles and another picks up. Looking for such lead changes keeps investors sharp.
 WHAT makes diversification unappetizing is that you would not have racked up the huge returns that stocks alone brought in the late 1990's -- or the big gains that commodities brought in 2002 through 2004. But you would have done a lot better with a diversified portfolio than you might have expected. 
 Over the three years through 2004, according to Ibbotson Associates, the average annual return from a portfolio containing all these asset classes was 7 percent, assuming that you held 55 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds, 10 percent commodities and 5 percent cash. That compares with a return of 3.6 percent for a portfolio containing only stocks.
 Over five years, the average annual return was 3.4 percent for the diversified portfolio, versus an average annual loss of 2.3 percent for stocks. Over a longer period, a stock-only portfolio fared better, but not by much. The annualized 10-year return for stocks was 12.1 percent, versus 11 percent for the diversified portfolio. Over 15 years, stocks won by only 10.9 percent to 10 percent. 
 So you can live well, and a little less painfully, if you branch out. That's what makes diversification worth it.

HEADLINE: Installing a Food Disposal Unit

 BODY:

Q. I live in a rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan. Am I permitted to install a food disposal unit under my kitchen sink, at my expense, if my landlord refuses to do so? And if my landlord agrees to install one at his expense, how would any rent increase be calculated? C. Brody, Manhattan.

A. Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan real estate lawyer and editor of Landlord-Tenant Monthly, said that it would not be advisable for the letter writer to install a food disposal unit without the written consent of the landlord.
 ''Most leases prohibit alterations or modifications that are structural in nature,'' Mr. Ferrara said, noting that while it may not always be clear whether a particular alteration is structural or merely cosmetic, the safest course is to assume that changes to the building's systems are structural modifications that require approval.
 And while a rent-controlled tenant may not have a lease, such a tenant could be subject to liability or possible eviction if alterations or modifications made by the tenant result in damage to the building or cause problems for other tenants.
 ''Since installation of a food disposal unit involves both plumbing and electrical work, and since the waste from the unit can clog pipes elsewhere in the building, the letter writer would be well-advised to get the owner's permission before installing such a unit,'' Mr. Ferrara said.
 If the landlord agrees to allow the tenant to install the unit at the tenant's expense, Mr. Ferrara said, no rent increase would be allowed. As a practical matter, however, if the landlord is inclined to allow for the installation of the unit, he is likely to want to do the work himself. 
 That is because the landlord would then be entitled to a permanent monthly rent increase equal to one-fortieth of the cost of the installation -- provided, however, that the tenant consents to the increase. If the tenant does not consent, Mr. Ferrara said, it is unlikely that the landlord will agree to the unit's installation. 
 Finally, he said, while a landlord does not need the approval of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal to impose such an increase, rent-controlled tenants must sign a special form (RN-79b). The increase would be effective on the first rent payment date after the owner's filing of the document with the state agency. 

Veterans' Benefit On Property Tax

Q. In the Q&A on Aug. 14, a lawyer said that while tax credits in co-ops belong to the shareholders who qualify for them, the co-op, if it wants to, can impose an assessment against all shareholders that will effectively wipe out the credit. Can you tell me at what point in the year the New York City Department of Finance provides the list of shareholders who qualify for the Veterans Property Tax Exemption Program and the amount of the benefit? Leonard I. Weinstock, Manhattan.

A. Samuel Miller, an assistant commissioner in the New York City Department of Finance, said that the department sends out lists of eligible veterans, and the exemptions they qualify for, in November of each year.

HEADLINE: A Reader's Guide to Base Closings

 BODY:
Plenty of good reasons can always be found for keeping open military bases the Pentagon no longer needs. Well-paying, federally financed jobs will be lost. Local economies will be devastated. New strategic threats may develop someday that might make that unwanted base useful again. And so on.
 Arguments like these have now persuaded the independent federal commission in charge of reviewing the Pentagon's base closing recommendations to keep open the 205-year-old Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine and America's oldest submarine base, in Groton, Conn. The commission also granted reprieves to two Air Force bases that the Pentagon hoped to close, Ellsworth in South Dakota and Cannon in New Mexico, and rejected a plan to scale back operations substantially at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. 
Such reprieves hearten the communities involved, and it is easy to sympathize with local fears of base closings. Yet every such reversal diverts funds the Pentagon ought to be spending on real and urgent requirements -- including the needs of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan -- to the upkeep of installations the military has already concluded it can do without. The commission's actions eliminate a substantial chunk of the nearly $50 billion the Defense Department estimated it would have saved over 20 years. 
 Looking over the panel's rationale for most of these changes, we think the Pentagon had it right the first time. In the case of Portsmouth and the Groton base, a majority of the commissioners seemed to be swayed by the claim that China's naval building efforts might one day create new missions for America's current fleet of 54 underused nuclear-powered attack submarines -- a costly legacy of the days when America's main enemy was an oceangoing superpower, not cave-dwelling terrorists. The Portsmouth shipyard is good at repairing submarines. The Groton base, located near the Navy's prime submarine building and repair contractor, Electric Boat, has a school for training submarine crews. 
 China does theoretically have the economic and technological capacity to build a large and threatening submarine fleet. But it has no obvious reason for doing so unless Washington insists on casting it as a substitute cold war enemy. The United States Navy remains the world's most powerful. The Bush administration has been handing far more dangerous leverage to Beijing by failing to narrow America's gaping budget and trade deficits, which have allowed China to buy a huge amount of the national debt. 
 Ellsworth had become a symbol of political manhood for Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who spent most of the summer personally lobbying the commission. During the cold war, this heartland redoubt housed nuclear bombers and missiles targeted on the Soviet Union. More recently, it has been home to about half of America's B-1B long-range bombers. Long-range bombers still provide valuable strategic striking power and were used in Iraq. But none of that would have been sacrificed, and, by Pentagon estimates, nearly $2 billion could have been saved by consolidating the full B-1B fleet at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, where the remaining bombers are currently based. A similar amount could have been spared for more compelling uses if the Pentagon had been allowed to move Eielson's 24 F-16 fighter jets to Nevada. Cannon will lose its F-16's, but stay open anyway.
 We wish the commissioners had paid more heed to the fact that the counterinsurgency wars America has so far been fighting in the 21st century are very different from the kind of superpower conflicts it built its current forces and base structure around. The military's current deficiencies have nothing to do with the staggeringly advanced and expensive fighter jets and submarines that the services so love to order and military contractors so love to build. The problem lies in the less profitable and less politically networked areas of ground fighting forces and basic supplies. To address those deficiencies, the Pentagon should be shifting resources from the Air Force and Navy to the Army and Marines, and from expensive air and sea combat systems to more soldiers and better armor. 
 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has been far too timid about making such shifts. And when he tries, powerful entrenched interests line up to resist him every step of the way. Service chiefs and military contractors still fight to build every weapon ever imagined, regardless of changing needs and priorities. Navy and Air Force advocates fight tenaciously for their traditional shares of the Pentagon spending pie. Local politicians and businesses wage high-powered campaigns against base closings. 
 And whenever such resistance succeeds, America's broader defense needs lose.

HEADLINE: An Uneven Fight Against Inflation

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
INFLATION is rising in virtually all of the world's big economies, but not all central banks are fighting it actively. Local economic conditions supply the obvious excuse for this behavior. Yet, looking at history, one can make a strong argument that controlling inflation should trump those concerns.
 To track inflation, governments usually release two sets of figures: the overall change in prices, and a rate of change that excludes volatile food and energy prices. Lately, the second figure has often been quite a bit lower than the first, because of sharp upsurges in the prices of oil and a few other commodities. 
That second figure, however, provides only false comfort. Economists worry about inflation because of the cycle it sets in motion. People have to pay more for the goods and services they buy, so they demand higher wages. Businesses see their labor costs rise, so they raise the prices of their products. Then workers demand higher wages again, and so on.
 This cycle has some nasty side effects. The local currency loses value in world markets, so consumers can no longer afford imports. Companies have to redo their pricing schedules, so long-term contracts become difficult to impossible. Credit markets suffer under the weight of high interest rates, which lenders require to offset the dwindling value of the currency. The fact that part of the current inflation comes from oil and food doesn't change this process.
 That's not to say prices are already in an inescapable skyward spiral. The most recent inflation figures for the United States, Britain and the euro area are all less than 4 percent for the last 12 months. With a target of about 2 percent broadly accepted among central bankers -- the Bank of England and the European Central Bank set it explicitly -- that's probably within an acceptable margin.
 But there are grounds for caution. Just because you have a 2 percent target doesn't mean that you expect inflation to be above and below that target for equal periods of time, as some analysts have suggested.
 Simply put, the causes and costs of being on either side of the target are not the same. An economy may sustain lower-than-target inflation for years as a result of rapid improvements in workers' productivity, which allow the same products to be made for less money. While zero or negative inflation can be a persistent problem, as it has been in Japan until recently, such readings have historically been a transitory phenomenon. The same can't be said for inflation of about 3.5 percent or higher, which tends to persist or even float upward. 
 Moreover, price increases are accelerating when considered on a monthly basis. Part of the movement may be seasonal, at least in the United States, but these rates show a definite upward tilt.
 Though they have all experienced similar upturns in prices, three major central banks have responded in different ways. In the euro area, there has been essentially no reaction; handcuffed by worries about two of its biggest member economies, Germany and Italy, the European Central Bank has kept short-term interest rates steady. In Britain, concerns that a 12-year spell of uninterrupted growth may soon end have led the Bank of England to lower rates. And in the United States, the Federal Reserve has sent short-term rates steadily higher, though without much effect on the long-term rates faced by most consumers.
 The Fed has been lucky, in a sense, because it has been able to put itself in a better inflation-fighting position without damaging the economy. But inflation of 5 percent in the first half of the year, or 4 percent when adjusted for seasonal changes, offers a powerful reason for the Fed to grab the private sector's attention. To do that, it may have to raise short-term interest rates by more than a quarter of a percentage point at a time.
 The European Central Bank has less excuse for reticence. Its main mission is to keep prices stable and, as such, it is licensed to prop up economic growth only when there is a danger of falling prices. Undoubtedly, the weak conditions in the euro area have created pressure on the bank to keep rates steady or even to cut them. The bank's independence, however, is intended to make it immune from such pressure.
 The Bank of England's posture looks to be the most perilous of the three. Despite sagging retail sales, the British economy has been growing at an annual rate of 1.7 percent, adjusted for inflation -- a rate that Germans and Italians may envy. Unemployment is still very low, at about 5 percent. By cutting rates, the central bank seems to be acting pre-emptively -- and that's putting it kindly -- to head off economic weakness.
 By contrast, the threat of inflation is already present in all three economic regions. True, unemployment could join with inflation to form the deadly combination known as stagflation, which dogged the United States and other wealthy countries during the oil shocks of the 1970's and has ruined many developing economies since then. But the historically proven solution to stagflation is not to cut interest rates and hope for growth and jobs; it is to raise rates and wait for prices to even out.
 Monetary policy has moved on quite a bit since the 1970's. One wouldn't expect any of the three banks to allow inflation to hit the double digits, as it did as recently as the early 1990's in some euro area countries. Still, caution never goes out of style.

 13th District (Pelham, City Island, Throgs Neck, Allerton and Morris Park): Single-family homeowners worried about overdevelopment give this Democratic district a conservative streak. The current council member, Madeleine Provenzano, a Democrat, has straddled party lines on many votes. To fill her seat, she has endorsed Stephen Kaufman, who ran a ridiculous and losing State Senate campaign last year as both a Democrat and a Republican. In this race, Mr. Kaufman, who also has the Conservative Party line, is one of six Democrats in the primary.
The candidate whose credentials make him the standout in the field is James Vacca. As the district manager for Community Board 10, he has become renowned as a solver of problems large and small. He has blocked oversized construction, challenged City Hall on the aggressive proliferation of parking tickets and been a longtime advocate for senior citizens. Mr. Vacca would be a welcome dose of steady energy on the Council. We endorse James Vacca.

Brooklyn
 41st District (Bedford-Stuyvesant, Ocean Hill and Brownsville): The Boyland family, headed by the retired Assemblyman William Boyland Sr., regards this district as its own private political preserve. After Mr. Boyland won re-election to the Assembly two years ago, he stepped down and handed his seat over to his son, William Jr. Now he is running for City Council, hoping to succeed Tracy Boyland, his daughter, who is term-limited.
 Mr. Boyland, who did not make himself available for an endorsement interview, told the good-government organization Citizens Union, ''I would like to do what Tracy did.'' That alone is reason to consider extending term limits to include family members. If Ms. Boyland distinguished herself in the Council, it was for nonperformance.
 The non-Boylands in the race are plenty, which could splinter the vote to the family's advantage. The ball of fire here is Darlene Mealy, a transit worker and first-time candidate who has devoted years to organizing distressed neighborhoods and helping transform them into safe, desirable places to live. Ms. Mealy has the makings of a dragon slayer, which this underserved district needs. Darlene Mealy gets our endorsement.
 45th District (East Flatbush and Flatlands): Two years ago the incumbent, Kendall Stewart, barely won re-election in a crowded field in this central Brooklyn district, where the population is mostly rooted in the Caribbean. Now Mr. Stewart, a podiatrist born in St. Vincent, faces a showdown with the second-place finisher, Sam Taitt. 
 This is the third race for Mr. Taitt, who began this campaign badly by successfully challenging the nomination petitions of three opponents. That would be reason to look for another candidate if the district was not so much in need of better representation. Mr. Taitt -- a native of Barbados, who teaches communication at Kingsborough College -- has both the experience and the drive to do a better job. Since the last campaign, he has worked hard on community education and economic development projects. He is leading an effort to form a community credit union, which could offer hope to residents overlooked by conventional banks.
 Mr. Stewart has been a disappointment in the Council. He is chairman of the committee on immigration but has done little with the position. Sam Taitt offers a fresh approach, and he gets our endorsement.

Queens
 25th District (Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Corona, Rego Park and Woodside): Even in this city of variety, it's hard to match the diversity in this district. The incumbent, Helen Sears, deserves credit for her work in seeking accommodation for day laborers in the district and extending health care services for immigrant women. She also helped the successful drive to keep Wal-Mart out of the district. But some of her votes in the Council have been off key -- like her opposition to the lead paint bill and a resolution calling on the government to uphold immigrant rights under the Patriot Act. 
 Her main opponent is Bryan Pu-Folkes, a lawyer who serves as a city human rights commissioner and has a long history as an immigrant advocate. Mr. Pu-Folkes, whose parents emigrated from Burma and Jamaica, shows the promise of being more than just a good public servant. He is already a role model for young immigrants and could pull more of them into civic life. Among his top priorities would be to reduce pollution and expand public green spaces, both important goals for a district with high rates of asthma. Bryan Pu-Folkes has a firm grip on the issues and exudes a confident eagerness to take them on, and wins our endorsement.

HEADLINE: Drones Will Be Used to Help Fight Wildfires

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Firefighters are planning for a new ally in fighting wildfires, a remote-controlled spy plane that does not mind smoke and can see in the dark.
 Scientists have been testing whether such planes, similar to the spy drones the American military flies over Iraq and Afghanistan, can help track the direction and behavior of fast-moving flames without putting firefighters in harm's way.
 After experimental flights of three unmanned aerial vehicles this summer, the United States Forest Service plans to use the planes next spring. The plan calls for planes to work in 12 Western states, mapping forest fires 24 hours a day. 
 ''Unmanned aircraft have the capability to do what we call the 3-D missions, the dull, dark and dangerous missions where you don't want to put a pilot on,'' said Vince Ambrosia, a research scientist at the Ames Research Center of NASA at Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, Calif., home of the experiment. 
 Pilots now fly over hot spots and fire borders in helicopters and planes carrying heat-sensing cameras. The cameras relay images to workers on the ground who plot how to confront the blaze.
 Most planes can fly only during daylight. The Forest Service banned night flights after poor dusk visibility led to crashes involving air tankers that drop retardant or water on fires.
 It will be a while before drones directly extinguish fires, because they are not large enough to hold water tanks. 
 Forest officials have long considered using drones. In the last 10 years, heat-detecting sensors have become small enough to fit on small robotic planes.
 Unmanned aerial vehicles, or U.A.V.'s, are controlled by a pilot on the ground. They look like test-kit airplanes and relay information by antenna or satellite.
 Last month, the Forest Service tested three craft with 12-foot wingspans, about double that of a bald eagle, over Moffett Field. The planes, which can fly as low as 1,000 feet, had thermal sensors and hovered over four deliberately set fires, beaming back almost instantaneous infrared updates.
 In the spring, the Forest Service plans its first night flight using the craft to monitor fires near Fort Hunter Liggett, 250 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
 Next summer, the agency will team with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to test the high-flying Altair from General Atomics. The Altair is an extended-wing commercial version of the Predator B that the Air Force used in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The Altair, with an 86-foot wingspan, can fly up to 32 hours without refueling. It can reach 52,000 feet and has a maximum range of 4,200 miles. The Federal Aviation Administration has to decide whether to approve pilotless planes in civilian airspace before they can be routinely deployed. U.A.V. flights in the United States are permitted case by case if the planes can be flown safely alongside passenger aircraft, a spokesman for the aviation agency, Allen Kenitzer, said.

LENGTH: 1461 words

HEADLINE: Clean, Green and Seen In Coveted Car-Pool Lanes 

BYLINE: By CHRIS DIXON

DATELINE: LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. 

 BODY:
IT looks as bland as mashed bananas and it won't run circles around a Prius. Yet the Honda Civic GX may be the most provocative car to ply California's polluted, congested freeways this year.
 Neither a sophisticated hybrid nor a fuel cell vehicle designed for hydrogen highways of the future, the Civic GX doesn't run on canola oil, turkey renderings, subatomic particles or even electricity. Instead, it makes its idosyncratic way on cheap, clean-burning, abundant natural gas.
You may never have heard of the GX, though it wasn't born yesterday. Honda has sold about 7,000 natural gas Civics since 1997, the vast majority to fleet operators like utilities and municipal governments. Others have dabbled with natural gas cars; Ford has abandoned its American program, though Chrysler and General Motors continue to offer a few trucks to fleet customers. 
 Honda, however, demonstrated its expanded commitment last spring by quietly offering 310 Civic GX's to Californians. Honda is also providing a device that fuels the cars at home by tapping into the natural gas line that feeds the furnace or kitchen stove.
 The device, called the Phill, permits overnight refueling in one's own garage, offering an alternative to the natural gas pumps sprinkled around many urban areas.
 Why would anyone want a Civic GX? For starters, it is the cleanest internal-combustion car ever tested by the Environmental Protection Agency. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, an environmental advocacy group, calls it the greenest car in America.
 About 95 percent of natural gas is methane, a simple molecule consisting of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. When burned, natural gas produces little more than carbon dioxide and water vapor.
 Aside from emitting less smog-causing compounds than a gasoline Civic, Honda says the GX produces 20 to 25 percent less of emissions linked to global warming, like carbon dioxide. Only a few highly efficient hybrid cars, like the Civic Hybrid, the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight, have greenhouse gas numbers on par with the GX's.
 Also, with gasoline selling for $3 and up in some areas, natural gas is a relative bargain despite price rises to residential customers in recent years. It still costs less than $2 at the pump for the equivalent of a gallon of gas, and $1.27 per equivalent gallon when filled at home here in Orange County. 
 Part of the savings is tax-related; currently, neither federal nor state highway taxes are collected on natural gas pumped at home. (The taxes are included in the pump price.)
 There are more advantages. Compared with gasoline, natural gas is far cleaner and cheaper to refine and transport. Nor are supplies controlled by Middle Eastern sheiks: although imports are rising, about 98 percent of American consumption comes from North America.
 Here in freeway-laced Southern California, stickers on the dowdy sedan confer a V.I.P. privilege: access to an extensive network of high-occupancy-vehicle lanes -- intended to encourage car-pooling -- even if the driver is alone. The benefits quickly became clear: as traffic crawled on the regular lanes of the 405 freeway, my 100-horsepower Honda was one of the fastest cars on the road.
 While sales to individuals are quite limited, Honda plans to bring the GX to the East Coast -- it hasn't announced which states -- next year. 
 At $22,310, the GX is more expensive than the outwardly identical $17,210 Civic LX, though buyers qualify for a $2,000 federal tax deduction and often for state incentives as well. The new federal energy bill sweetens the deal next year by offering a tax credit equal to 80 percent of the additional cost of the natural gas powertrain, or about $3,600 for the GX.
 Honda plans to continue offering a natural gas GX when its redesigned line of Civics goes on sale for 2006.
 The GX is built alongside other Civics in Marysville, Ohio, and is similarly equipped. My test car had four-wheel antilock brakes, front and side air bags, air-conditioning, remote locking, power windows, cruise control and an entirely adequate CD player (though it lacked a jack for an iPod or MP3 player).
 Even under the hood, the GX appears similar to its gasoline counterpart. The four-cylinder engine displaces 1.7 liters and generates 100 horsepower and 98 pound-feet of torque, compared with 115 and 110 for the gasoline Civic LX. The GX carries a federal gas-equivalency estimate of 30 m.p.g. in town and 34 on the highway, compared with 29/38 for the gasoline Civic LX. But with a smaller tank, the GX can go no more than 250 miles between refuelings.
 The clean-air Honda makes good use of its limited power with the help of a nifty continuously variable transmission. This belt-and-pulley wonder constantly adjusts for needed power somewhat like a bicycle derailleur; with no gears, it never downshifts. Wailing up the long grade of the San Joaquin Toll Road in Orange County, the GX maintained 80 m.p.h. while remaining below the redline of the tachometer. 
 In terms of emissions, the GX is classified as an AT-PZEV, shorthand for ''advanced technology-partial zero emissions vehicle.'' In practical terms, the same attributes that make natural gas safe to burn in your home mean the GX emits 87 percent less carbon monoxide and 25 percent less greenhouse-gas emissions than a gasoline Civic.
 In an effort to encourage purchases of natural gas vehicles, and to expand the infrastructure that supports them, Los Angeles and several other California cities provide free parking. By allowing access to the car-pool lanes, at least through 2007, the state has conferred a privilege that until now was denied even to hybrid cars without at least one passenger, though a limited number of high-mileage hybrids will gain access under a new state rule. 
 I put the lane exemption to the test after filling the GX at a Clean Energy station in Irvine, nine miles from my home. The station, at the city's fleet maintanence yard, has a 24-hour pump that accepts credit cards. After gassing up, I headed down Interstate 5 during the afternoon rush. 
 To drive solo in the carpool lane is like sampling forbidden fruit -- and it gets you where you are going much faster. Outside Irvine, a new Prius passed in the fast lane to my right. A couple miles farther south, as regular traffic backed up, I passed the Prius doing 60. 
 Assuming a station is nearby, filling a natural gas car is simple: you insert a credit card and follow the instructions on a video screen at the pump. After acknowledging that you understand how to turn a knob and attach the nozzle, you're given a two-digit identification number that lets you skip the video the next time. 
 Under the filler door, instead of the familiar receptacle for a gasoline nozzle, there is a small self-sealing fitting for natural gas. When the natural gas starts flowing, it's noisier than a gasoline pump, but fills the tank to 3,000 or 3,600 pounds per square inch (depending on the pump) in roughly the time it takes to fill a tank with gasoline.
 The GX's trunk is smaller than you expect, because its eight-gallon fuel tank -- wrapped in carbon fiber -- is situated between the back seat and the trunk. Honda says the tank is much stronger and safer than a gasoline tank, as demonstrated by testing and several real-world accidents. 
 While I was filling the GX, two City of Irvine vehicles made use of the pump, and a pair of Civic GX's pulled up as well. The first was a white 2001 model driven by Darrin McClure, a 40-year-old software programmer and surfer who commutes 20 miles from San Clemente to Irvine every day. Mr. McClure says he flies past cars idling on Interstate 5 and waves to other GX drivers, many of whom feel as though they are in on a big secret. ''The car's awesome,'' he said. ''It's so clean that you could park it idling in your living room overnight.''
 An early adopter of Phill was Jeff Church, a 49-year-old United Airlines pilot who uses a 2003 GX for his 50-mile commute to the airport from his home in San Dimas. Mr. Church, who said he had eagerly volunteered to test the system, offered to let me try fueling my Civic in his garage. 
 The unit turned out to be a three-foot-high appliance hung from a wall. Fueling the GX was a simple matter of extending the coiled hose, snapping the nozzle onto the fuel input and pushing a start button. 
 I reluctantly returned my GX after 270 enlightening miles. Honda estimates that fuel for a gasoline Civic costs 8.8 cents a mile. I figured the GX's expense at 5.8 cents a mile when fueling at a Clean Energy station. But if I were filling at home my cost would have been more like 3 cents a mile, not including lease or installation costs. With those numbers, anyone would breathe easier.

WHEN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WAS WHITE
An Untold History of Racial Inequality
in Twentieth-Century America.
By Ira Katznelson.
238 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95.
 After years of battling racial discrimination and braving state-sanctioned violence -- with hundreds of Southern black churches set fire to and scores of citizens beaten or murdered for daring to challenge American apartheid -- the civil rights movement achieved a climactic victory when President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6, 1965. It was the outcome of ''a shining moment in the conscience of man,'' declared the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In less than two years, the nation did more to advance equal rights for minorities than at any time since Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
 The 1964 Civil Rights Act struck down the South's segregation laws, outlawed employment discrimination and forbade discrimination in federal programs. For black Americans living in the South, the voting rights law finally secured the right to the ballot. And President Johnson initiated a sweeping new government policy called affirmative action. Its purpose was to overcome at least some of the accumulated human damage caused by 350 years of slavery and Jim Crow, and to ensure further progress toward equality.
 Benefiting from that ''shining moment'' in the 1960's, a black middle class has prospered and grown rapidly. Yet millions of African-Americans remain mired in poverty in a nation bitterly divided over whether special help to minorities should continue. Affirmative action programs have long been under siege, vigorously attacked in Congress and the federal courts and criticized for ''discriminating'' against the white majority. With conservatives dominating the federal government, civil rights groups and other liberal organizations have waged a mostly defensive battle to protect the gains of the 1960's. Fresh ideas and effective leadership to advance the American ideals of equality and social justice have been in short supply. 
 Ira Katznelson, the Ruggles professor of political science and history at Columbia University, enters this fray with a provocative new book, ''When Affirmative Action Was White,'' which seeks to provide a broader historical justification for continuing affirmative action programs. Katznelson's principal focus is on the monumental social programs of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and Harry Truman's Fair Deal in the 1930's and 1940's. He contends that those programs not only discriminated against blacks, but actually contributed to widening the gap between white and black Americans -- judged in terms of educational achievement, quality of jobs and housing, and attainment of higher income. Arguing for the necessity of affirmative action today, Katznelson contends that policy makers and the judiciary previously failed to consider just how unfairly blacks had been treated by the federal government in the 30 years before the civil rights revolution of the 1960's. 
 This history has been told before, but Katznelson offers a penetrating new analysis, supported by vivid examples and statistics. He examines closely how the federal government discriminated against black citizens as it created and administered the sweeping social programs that provided the vital framework for a vibrant and secure American middle class. Considered revolutionary at the time, the new legislation included the Social Security system, unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, protection of the right of workers to join labor unions and the G.I. Bill of Rights.
 Even though blacks benefited to a degree from many of these programs, Katznelson shows how and why they received far less assistance than whites did. He documents the political process by which powerful Southern Congressional barons shaped the programs in discriminatory ways -- as their price for supporting them. (A black newspaper editorial criticized Roosevelt for excluding from the minimum wage law the black women who worked long hours for $4.50 a week at the resort the president frequented in Warm Springs, Ga.) 
 At the time, most blacks in the labor force were employed in agriculture or as domestic household workers. Members of Congress from the Deep South demanded that those occupations be excluded from the minimum wage, Social Security, unemployment insurance and workmen's compensation. When labor unions scored initial victories in organizing poor factory workers in the South after World War II, the Southern Congressional leaders spearheaded legislation to cripple those efforts. The Southerners' principal objective, Katznelson contends, was to safeguard the racist economic and social order known as the Southern ''way of life.''
 Katznelson reserves his harshest criticism for the unfair application of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, known as the G.I. Bill of Rights, a series of programs that poured $95 billion into expanding opportunity for soldiers returning from World War II. Over all, the G.I. Bill was a dramatic success, helping 16 million veterans attend college, receive job training, start businesses and purchase their first homes. Half a century later, President Clinton praised the G.I. Bill as ''the best deal ever made by Uncle Sam,'' and said it ''helped to unleash a prosperity never before known.'' 
 But Katznelson demonstrates that African-American veterans received significantly less help from the G.I. Bill than their white counterparts. ''Written under Southern auspices,'' he reports, ''the law was deliberately designed to accommodate Jim Crow.'' He cites one 1940's study that concluded it was ''as though the G.I. Bill had been earmarked 'For White Veterans Only.' '' Southern Congressional leaders made certain that the programs were directed not by Washington but by local white officials, businessmen, bankers and college administrators who would honor past practices. As a result, thousands of black veterans in the South -- and the North as well -- were denied housing and business loans, as well as admission to whites-only colleges and universities. They were also excluded from job-training programs for careers in promising new fields like radio and electrical work, commercial photography and mechanics. Instead, most African-Americans were channeled toward traditional, low-paying ''black jobs'' and small black colleges, which were pitifully underfinanced and ill equipped to meet the needs of a surging enrollment of returning soldiers.
 The statistics on disparate treatment are staggering. By October 1946, 6,500 former soldiers had been placed in nonfarm jobs by the employment service in Mississippi; 86 percent of the skilled and semiskilled jobs were filled by whites, 92 percent of the unskilled ones by blacks. In New York and northern New Jersey, ''fewer than 100 of the 67,000 mortgages insured by the G.I. Bill supported home purchases by nonwhites.'' Discrimination continued as well in elite Northern colleges. The University of Pennsylvania, along with Columbia the least discriminatory of the Ivy League colleges, enrolled only 46 black students in its student body of 9,000 in 1946. The traditional black colleges did not have places for an estimated 70,000 black veterans in 1947. At the same time, white universities were doubling their enrollments and prospering with the infusion of public and private funds, and of students with their G.I. benefits. 
 Katznelson argues that the case for affirmative action today is made more effectively by citing concrete history rather than through general exhortations. Studying the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the Great Society and the civil rights movements of the 1960's could not be more relevant at a time when the administration seems determined to weaken many of the federal programs that for decades have not just sustained the nation's minorities but built its solid middle class. Whether or not Katznelson's study directly influences the affirmative action debate, it serves an important purpose. With key parts of the Voting Rights Act set to expire in 2007 and other civil rights protections subject to change, we must understand a continuing reality: the insidious and recurrent racial bias in the history of American public life.

HEADLINE: Roberts V. The Future 

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Rosen. 
Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor at George Washington University, is a frequent contributor to the magazine. His new book, ''The Most Democratic Branch: How the Courts Serve America,'' will be published next year by Oxford University Press.

 BODY:

I. The Future Is Not the Present
 Three years ago, in a small conference room at the offices of the law firm Hogan & Hartson in Washington, I had the chance to talk with John G. Roberts Jr. At the time, Roberts was a lawyer in private practice, unsure whether Senate Democrats would hold a hearing on his nomination to be a federal appellate judge. (After being nominated three times, in 1992, 2001 and 2003, he would finally be given a hearing and confirmed in May 2003 after Republicans took control of the Senate.) In a conversation over cookies and coffee, Roberts spoke candidly about a wide range of topics, and I was impressed by his modesty, intelligence and sense of humor. 
 Now that Roberts has been nominated to the Supreme Court, something else about our conversation strikes me: he was acutely sensitive to the unpredictability of history and the surprises that the future tends to bring. At one point, the conversation turned to the thesis he wrote in 1976 as an undergraduate at Harvard, in which he analyzed the fate, decades earlier, of the British Liberal Party. After winning one of the biggest landslides in British history, in 1906, the Liberals appeared to be destined for a long period of dominance. But in fact the party never won another election because of a series of political miscalculations. The lesson of this particular episode of history, Roberts seemed to suggest, was that politicians -- and judges, for that matter -- should be wary of the assumption that the future will be little more than an extension of things as they are.
 Roberts's point might be useful for senators to keep in mind as they prepare to question him at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, which are scheduled to begin on Tuesday, Sept. 6. Since Roberts's nomination to replace Sandra Day O'Connor was announced in July, Senate staff members have been combing through legal memos that Roberts wrote, many while he was still in his 20's, hoping to find hints of his views about the most controversial issues of the past generation -- from civil rights to affirmative action to abortion. It's not surprising that lawyers, who are trained to look backward, instinctively deferring to precedent and tradition, would parse memos from two decades ago as clues to how Roberts would perform on the court. 
 But in the case of Supreme Court nominees, looking backward may not be the most reliable way to predict the future. During William Rehnquist's confirmation hearings, first as a nominee for associate justice in 1971 and then for chief justice in 1986, the discussion focused heavily on a memo he wrote as a law clerk that seemed to question the soundness of Brown v. Board of Education. By expending so much of their energy on the issue of segregation, the senators asked little, in the end, about the issue that would come to define the Rehnquist court -- the relationship between the federal and state governments.
 To judge from comments in the press from Senate Judiciary Committee members, the same sort of myopia may characterize the Roberts hearings. That would represent a missed opportunity: in the next 10 or 15 years, as technology and science continue to advance and America's demographic profile continues to change, the Supreme Court will, in all likelihood, be asked to decide a fascinating array of divisive issues that are now only dimly on the horizon. To try to identify more concretely what those issues might be, I recently canvassed a number of technology experts, bioethicists and legal scholars.
 The topics that they discussed amount to a Brave New World of constitutional disputes. As Congress and the states pass legislation to address a host of futuristic issues, from the genetic enhancement of children to the use of brain scanning to identify criminal suspects, the laws will inevitably be challenged in court, raising novel and surprising questions about how to interpret our constitutional rights to privacy, equality and free expression. Rather than focusing on Roberts's past, the senators questioning him might get a better sense of his future on the Supreme Court by imagining the issues of the next generation. The court's response to those issues, far more than its resolution of cases that will be decided next year, will define the role it will play in the first decades of the 21st century.

II. Brain Fingerprinting and the Future of Privacy Rights
 In the wake of the recent London bombings, the New York subway system implemented random bag searches, and the London Underground announced plans to introduce high-tech body scanners that peer through clothing. In the coming years, if technology advances as expected and the threat of terror fails to subside, Western democracies will develop ever more sophisticated and intrusive forms of surveillance, many of which will be challenged in court as a violation of rights to privacy and equality. Not long ago, I visited Marc Rotenberg, the head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil-liberties group, at his office in Washington and asked him what form he thought the new legal battles over surveillance technology might take. 
 Sketching out a hypothetical situation, Rotenberg imagined, in the near future, a young man walking around the Washington Monument for 30 minutes while waiting for a friend. Meanwhile, sophisticated biometric camera systems (which can register the details of someone's face), connected to data-mining computer programs (which link the face to a database of personal information), monitor the young man. The cameras might also detect, say, a copy of the Koran he is carrying under his arm. Taken together, this information is used to generate a ''threat index'' based on how suspicious the high-tech profiling makes him out to be. ''According to the computer algorithm, pacing around a national monument might be a suspicious activity characteristic of someone intending to commit a terrorist attack,'' Rotenberg said. ''The link between his face and his travel records and magazine subscriptions, maintained by a big commercial database, might generate a citizenship trustworthiness score that suggests further investigation.''
 Based on a low trustworthiness score, the young man might be stopped by the police, who might open his backpack and find a bag of marijuana. Would the examination of the backpack amount to an unconstitutional search or seizure? 
 On the current Supreme Court, Rotenberg noted, a challenge on constitutional grounds to this kind of search might face an uphill battle. In January, in a 6-2 decision written by the court's most liberal justice, John Paul Stevens, the court upheld as constitutional a dog sniff of a driver who had been stopped for speeding. (When the dog barked, the cops opened the trunk and found marijuana.) The dissenting justices, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, expressed concern that the majority opinion cleared the way for the police to turn drug-sniffing dogs on large groups of innocent citizens without cause to suspect illegal activity. But even Ginsburg and Souter said there might be nothing wrong with the use of bomb-detection dogs if they were effective in identifying potential terrorists. 
 According to the court's logic, whether a threat-index system that places citizens in different categories of suspicion violates the Constitution might depend on how accurate the threat indexes turn out to be. But even if the indexes turned out to not be very accurate, Rotenberg suggested, a justice like John Roberts, should he be sitting on the court, might not be inclined to question their use. In two recent cases as an appellate judge, Roberts was very deferential to searches and seizures by the police. In one case, he reluctantly upheld a Washington policy requiring the arrest of a 12-year-old girl who ate a French fry in a Washington Metro station, and in the other, he argued in dissent that the police should have been allowed to search the trunk of a car after stopping the driver for having a broken light. (The officers found a loaded gun in the trunk, a discovery that Roberts's colleagues in the majority contended had to be suppressed because there had been no probable cause to search the trunk in the first place.) ''Roberts seems untroubled by what people would think of as pretextual searches,'' Rotenberg said. 
If polls about the U.S.A. Patriot Act are correct (only 22 percent of Americans say it goes too far in restricting people's civil liberties to fight terrorism, while 69 percent are content with it or say it doesn't go far enough), many people may not object to data-mining technology that promises to identify potential terrorists. But if the war against terror escalates further, the government may deploy even more controversial forms of electronic surveillance. 
 To explore the promises and dangers of these technologies, I phoned O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist at the University of Notre Dame who is studying neuro-imaging techniques that can detect the presence of electrochemical signals in the brain. Promoters of this so-called brain fingerprinting, which uses functional magnetic resonance imaging, or f.M.R.I., say that it can detect brain activity that is associated with particular kinds of recollection. (In an appeal of a murder conviction in Iowa, for example, a brain scan was introduced that suggested that the murderer's brain did not contain information about the murder but did contain information consistent with his alibi.) Snead imagined that these scans might be used in the future to interrogate, for example, suspected terrorists accused of having trained in Afghanistan. ''Officials who are examining the suspects could hook them up to an f.M.R.I. device, show them pictures of the battlefield in Afghanistan, and if they've been in that particular place before,'' the device would detect the corresponding brain activity, he said. 
 It's an open question, under the Supreme Court's current doctrine, whether f.M.R.I. scans, used as a sort of high-tech lie detector, would be considered a form of compulsory self-incrimination that violates the Fifth Amendment. If the justices viewed an involuntary brain scan as no more intrusive than a blood or urine sample or an ordinary fingerprint, there wouldn't be any Fifth Amendment problem. But if the court were to decide that f.M.R.I. scans are not only searching for physical evidence but also encroaching on a suspect's private memories and consciousness, the justices might conclude that the suspect's mental privacy is invaded and that he has been forced to testify against his will.
 There is also the possibility that police officers or counterterror experts may eventually search suspects for brain waves that suggest a propensity toward violence -- a sort of cognitive profiling. ''You can do an f.M.R.I. scan showing that the structures in the brain responsible for impulse control and empathy are underactive and the parts of the brain responsible for aggression and more animalistic, violent activities are overactive,'' Snead explained. ''Maybe with these nascent technologies, we'll be able to develop some kind of profile for a terrorist.'' Suspects who show a propensity for violence might be detained indefinitely as enemy combatants even though they committed no crimes.
 When I asked William Stuntz, a scholar of criminal procedure at Harvard Law School, about the legal ramifications of these technologies, he argued that brain scanning will put tremendous pressure on the court's understanding of privacy. The traditional definition of privacy protects the sanctity of information that people go out of their way to conceal from the world. But brain-scan technology can access personal information that is neither actively hidden from view nor meant to be exposed to the public. ''There's a whole category of information about our bodies and our brains that we don't keep secret from the world in the way that I keep secret my sex life or my finances,'' Stuntz said. ''It's not that they're invading my space or my bedroom or my car. It's that they're invading me.''

III. Genetic Screening and the Future of Personal Autonomy
 Every Supreme Court confirmation hearing since the election of Ronald Reagan has been marked by efforts -- nearly always unsuccessful -- to predict the nominee's views on Roe v. Wade. The Roberts hearings are unlikely to prove an exception. If Roberts is confirmed, he will have two opportunities in the next Supreme Court term to reveal some of his views about the potential implications of Roe -- in one case involving a teen-health exception in parental-notification laws and in another concerning the federal power to prosecute protesters at abortion clinics. Regardless of whether Roe v. Wade remains on the books in 10 or 20 years, however, America's political and legal disputes about reproduction may well have moved far beyond efforts to balance the interests of a fetus against the interests of a pregnant mother. Instead, the country will most likely be debating the use of sophisticated technologies involving genetic manipulation and reproductive cloning outside the womb -- controversial procedures that may prompt restrictions or bans by state legislatures or Congress. In order to get a better sense of these coming debates, I turned again to O. Carter Snead, who recently served as general consul to President Bush's Council on Bioethics, to describe the kinds of developments that might give rise to Roe v. Wade-like controversies. 
 The first issue he mentioned was genetic selection. In the future, he noted, scientists may have analyzed much more of the genetic makeup of embryos created through in vitro fertilization. They might then be able to use that information to help aspiring parents implant in the woman's womb only those embryos that display a specified range of desired characteristics -- including those having to do not only with sex but also, perhaps someday, traits like intelligence, eye color and height. Not all the traits that parents demand will be conventionally desirable: a few years ago in the United States, a deaf lesbian couple attracted attention (and criticism) by deliberately choosing a deaf man as a sperm donor in order to increase their chances of having a deaf child. And if scientists ever learn to identify a genetic predisposition to homosexuality with a high degree of certainty, genetic screening might be used to ''weed out these embryos,'' as Snead put it, ''or to select for them.''
 The political response to so-called designer babies might create strange bedfellows. ''Feminists are rightly concerned that male embryos will be routinely selected over female embryos,'' Snead noted, which is why many feminists say they would oppose the practice. (''As we increasingly come to see our children as commodities to be chosen, like consumer products, they will be devalued in ways that we will come as a society to regret,'' the feminist Judy Norsigian, co-author of ''Our Bodies, Ourselves,'' told me. ''This kind of sex selection would create a sex imbalance, and it would reinforce preferential attitudes toward male children.'') Social conservatives would also oppose these efforts, but out of concern for the right to life of fertilized embryos. Earlier this year, in fact, a Republican state legislator in Maine introduced a bill to ban abortions based on the sexual orientation of the unborn child. Snead imagined that a conservative state might pass a law banning genetic screening ''for elective sex selection or sexual-orientation selection not linked to a therapeutic concern.''
 How would the Supreme Court view the constitutionality of a state law banning sex selection? In 1992, when it reaffirmed Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court held that the Constitution protects a right of personal autonomy. The scope of this right would be at the heart of disputes over genetic technologies in the future. If the Supreme Court agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to a law banning sex selection, for example, the conservative justices might find themselves divided. Justices like Antonin Scalia, a states-rights conservative who advocates deference to local legislatures, might vote to uphold the law, while a libertarian conservative like Anthony Kennedy, who argues that the Constitution protects a broad sphere of autonomy over intimate and personal decisions, might vote to overturn it.
 At the moment, the Kennedy-style vision of personal autonomy is most vigorously defended among legal scholars by a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin named John Robertson. He argues that the right to have offspring or not, recognized in Roe v. Wade, necessarily entails some right to select the characteristics of the offspring. ''The liberal notion of autonomy over reproduction includes some right of selectivity that logically could extend to nonmedical traits,'' Robertson told me, ''but how far has to be sorted out by the Supreme Court and the country.''
 Should the Supreme Court try to draw the line between those traits that parents can select for and those traits they can't? If so, where should the justices of the future draw that line? It seems quite unlikely that John Roberts, for one, shares Robertson's broad view of the right to autonomy and privacy: in a 1981 memorandum to Attorney General William French Smith, Roberts referred to ''the so-called 'right to privacy' '' and suggested that ''such an amorphous right is not to be found in the Constitution.'' Even those justices who do not share Roberts's apparent skepticism about the right to privacy might share a reluctance to decide, by judicial fiat, the mysterious point at which screening for genetic disabilities becomes screening for genetic enhancement.
 When I spoke recently with George Annas, a professor of bioethics at Boston University, he pointed out that genetic screening by prospective parents for Down syndrome is already widely accepted. Couples in the future, he said, may naturally insist that if they are permitted to screen for genes associated with a low IQ, they should also be allowed to screen for those associated with a high IQ. Judicial decrees about the scope of privacy rights will not settle this debate. Rather than presuming to define the boundary between therapy and enhancement on the basis of its understanding of privacy doctrine, the court might serve the country better by leaving that agonizing decision -- which has confounded our leading scientists and philosophers -- to democratically accountable legislatures.
Another area of potential controversy is reproductive cloning. At the moment, there is no widespread clamor for the practice. But it's not hard to imagine, for instance, a growing demand in the near future among parents who might want to clone a terminally ill child or, according to Snead, among same-sex couples looking for a way to produce children that are genetically related to both parents -- something that reproductive cloning may be able to offer. 
 To consider the second situation, here is how two men could possibly have a child of their own: scientists would create a cloned embryo from one man, derive stem cells from the embryo and then coax the stem cells (which can be used to create any tissue in the body) into a human ovum. The ovum would then be fertilized by the sperm of the other man, conceiving an embryo that would be implanted in a surrogate's womb. ''The baby would be genetically related to both men,'' Snead told me, ''much like a baby conceived through sexual reproduction.'' It's certainly possible that Congress would be moved to ban this kind of noncoital reproduction. ''You could imagine a bill,'' Snead went on to say, ''that says that children shall be conceived only through the union of egg and sperm taken from an adult human.''
 A bill along these lines would clash with the broad vision of personal autonomy endorsed by Kennedy on the current Supreme Court. In the future, however, supporters of laws banning reproductive cloning might be able to call on conservative judges and legal scholars to make arguments for upholding the legislation. Just as some liberals insist that the constitutional right of personal autonomy guarantees a right of genetic selection, some social conservatives are increasingly countering that the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws should be interpreted to protect embryos from the moment of conception -- including those that are destroyed in the process of generating stem cells. 
 I spoke recently with Robert P. George, an influential conservative legal philosopher at Princeton, about the possibility that this view might persuade a future court. ''If, in fact, the embryo is, as I think the science shows it is, a full living member of the species homo sapiens,'' he said, ''and if by the word 'persons' the framers of the 14th Amendment meant to protect full living members of the species homo sapiens, then plainly, the creation of embryos for destruction would be a violation of their equal protection. That would be straightforward, and I would see no room around it.''
 Although George's legal argument represents a minority view at the moment, there may be some political momentum gathering for his way of thinking. Illinois, for example, has defined human life as beginning from the moment of conception, and earlier this year, an Illinois judge invoked this declaration to hold that a frozen embryo accidentally discarded in a fertility clinic was a human being whose parents were entitled to file a wrongful-death suit. If the Supreme Court were to hold that all embryos in America are full human beings entitled to equal protection under the Constitution, researchers engaged in stem-cell research across the country might be similarly liable for homicide.
 If a future and more conservative court accepted George's argument, even an attempt by Congress to authorize carefully regulated stem-cell research and therapeutic cloning could be deemed an unconstitutional attempt to deny embryos the equal protection of the laws. Of course, it's hardly obvious that the Supreme Court in 2015 or 2025 would recognize embryos as constitutional persons -- certainly no member of the current court has yet endorsed this bold argument. And any effort by an activist conservative Supreme Court to stop Congress from authorizing stem-cell research would be a serious affront to the wishes of a majority of Americans. Some scholarly advocates on both sides of the political spectrum have acknowledged that the justices might do better to allow the future of reproduction to be settled by Congress and the state legislatures, a view that George endorses. ''I hope we won't be thinking in 2025 with a narrow court-focused view,'' he said. ''I like the trend toward respecting the authority of other branches of government to deliberate about constitutional questions.''

IV. D.N.A. and the Future of Affirmative Action
 If current demographic trends continue, over the next few decades the United States will become more diverse. The Census Bureau estimates that the number of non-Hispanic whites may shrink to less than half of the population before 2060 and that Hispanics will soon outnumber blacks. As intermarriage rates continue to rise, more and more Americans will consider themselves multiracial. This is a recipe for conflicts over affirmative action and public entitlements.
 To better understand these coming battles, I phoned Peter H. Schuck, a professor at Yale Law School and the author of ''Diversity in America: Keeping Government at a Safe Distance.'' Schuck emphasized what he called ''the growing and palpable absurdity of color-coding and racial preferences in a population as hybridized, individualistic and immigration-driven as ours.'' He predicted a rise in the number of state limitations or bans on affirmative action, as well as the increasing fragility of Grutter v. Bollinger, the 5-4 Supreme Court decision in 2003 that upheld affirmative action in higher education.
 In her opinion for the court in Grutter, Sandra Day O'Connor noted that ''it has been 25 years'' since the court first approved the use of racial preferences in higher education, and she added that ''since that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased.'' O'Connor concluded hopefully, ''We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.''
 What to make of O'Connor's prediction? There's no guarantee, first of all, that in 25 years O'Connor's opinion will still be the law of the land. In Grutter, she cast the swing vote on a divided court, and if Roberts succeeds her, he may view affirmative-action programs less indulgently. (As a young Justice Department official in 1981, he wrote a biting criticism of a defense of a federal affirmative-action program by the outgoing head of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.) Even if the Supreme Court continues to approve of affirmative action in higher education in 25 years, it's possible to imagine a challenge to the policy from a rejected white applicant, arguing, in effect, that O'Connor had promised that affirmative action would no longer be necessary by 2028. In response, defenders of affirmative action might argue that O'Connor was too optimistic, and that racial preferences were still necessary to maintain educational diversity in the face of continuing gaps in grades and test scores. 
 But would this reply persuade the court to preserve affirmative action beyond its expiration date? Schuck pointed to a recent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research expressing skepticism about O'Connor's prediction. The study notes that the gap between white and black test scores, which narrowed in the 80's, actually widened in the 90's. And the authors of the study conclude that black economic gains over the next 25 years are likely to lead to less than 20 percent of the level of black representation at universities that affirmative action currently guarantees. How a justice like Roberts, presumably an affirmative-action skeptic, would respond if this pessimistic situation came to pass is hard to predict, but he might be reluctant to extend the term for another 25 years with no end in sight. 
 Affirmative-action programs may also be challenged by people other than disappointed white applicants. As America becomes increasingly multiracial, there may be debates over who, precisely, gets to qualify for racial preferences. Akhil Reed Amar, a colleague of Schuck's at Yale Law School, told me that people might eventually resort to genetic tests to prove their racial heritage. ''I can imagine a predominantly white person who has been rejected because of an affirmative-action program saying, 'I should benefit from it because I am of mixed race, and I can prove it with sophisticated DNA analysis showing the percentage of my genes that came from Africa,' '' he said. ''The university might respond: 'It's not a genetic test but a social understanding test, and since people don't perceive you as black, you haven't been subject to discrimination.' ''
 In response to disputes like this, Amar suggested, state legislatures might conclude that ''the social-understanding test is unacceptably fuzzy, and at least science can give us some rules. So the government might require a genetic test because it's easy to administer.'' If, however, a state legislature were to declare that anyone with a drop of African-American blood is entitled to be considered black, the policy might provoke a bitter Supreme Court challenge. ''It would recall the shameful history in times of slavery and Jim Crow,'' Schuck told me, ''in which one drop of blood was sufficient to render an individual black for the laws of slavery. And it would be extremely distasteful for blacks and whites.'' Still, Schuck acknowledged, the problem of deciding who is eligible for affirmative action will grow only more urgent in an era of shrinking public resources. ''I think as pressure on affirmative-action programs increases,'' he said, ''affirmative-action programs will have to make refined judgments about eligibility.''

V. Old Age and Drug Legalization
 If birth rates continue to fall and life expectancy continues to rise, a population made up increasingly of older Americans may bring about a host of constitutional issues of its own -- issues ranging from government financing of gene therapies to the legalization of painkilling drugs. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, has written that within five years, ''it is likely that predictive genetic tests will be available for as many as a dozen common conditions, enabling individuals to take preventive steps to reduce their risks of developing such disorders.'' The medical profession may respond by customizing drugs and other treatments to suit an individual's distinctive genetic profile, possibly tailoring them not only to prevent disease but also to enhance a patient's cognitive and physical capacities. ''By 2020,'' Collins predicted, ''the impact is likely to be far more sweeping than any of us can envision today.''
 Who will pay for these gene therapies? Samuel Gorovitz, a bioethicist and philosopher at Syracuse University, told me recently that in the future, states may well prohibit health care organizations that receive state financing from providing access to these therapies -- at least those that border on enhancement. ''A state legislature might decide that any kind of enhancement is unconscionable,'' he said. Prohibitions like this might provoke court battles over whether states and the federal government have an obligation to finance genetic therapies that can cure identifiable diseases. In the past, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to require the states to finance medical care for the poor. In 1977, for example, the court upheld a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of public money for abortions, except those that were ''medically necessary.'' But identifying which genetic therapies are medically necessary to cure disease and which are merely elective enhancements may prove just as agonizing in cases involving public money for the old as in cases involving reproduction for the young. 
 The Supreme Court may also face increasing pressure from an aging population to remove federal barriers on controversial drugs. William Stuntz, the Harvard professor I spoke with about brain scanning, is 47 and suffers from chronic back pain. He suggested that his common disability will afflict many more Americans as baby boomers age over the next 20 years. ''My generation will include lots of very old people, who have more chronic pain than middle-aged people and also get cancer at higher rates, and both of these trends will massively change the way the baby-boom generation thinks about drug policy,'' he said. ''I'd never had any prescription pain medications until I spent the last five years on them for back pain, and anyone who has that experience will think very differently about what drugs should be on the prohibited list.''
 Last June, by a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court upheld Congress's authority to dictate national drug policies, even in the face of a California voter initiative that authorized the use of medical marijuana. ''I bet a case like that would come out very differently in 20 years,'' Stuntz said. He suggested that political demands may lead states to enact more lax laws authorizing the use various variants of morphine, which are federally prohibited but useful in treating a variety of pain. ''Only those laws won't be coming from California but from Florida and Arizona,'' he said. ''Old people are traditionally statist on these issues, but aging baby boomers may well become more libertarian because they want to be able to design everything from the way they die to personalized medical treatments.'' At the beginning of the new Supreme Court term in October, in fact, John Roberts would most likely have an opportunity to explore whether the federal government has the power to ban the use of drugs for assisted suicide, despite an Oregon voter initiative to the contrary.

VI. Property, Free Expression and the Right to Tinker
 At Roberts's confirmation hearings, a central focus will be the nominee's views about the scope of Congress's power to regulate the economy and the environment. As a federal appellate judge, Roberts once questioned the constitutionality of some applications of the Endangered Species Act, and Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has told Roberts that he intends to ask him about recent Supreme Court decisions narrowing Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. As important as these issues are, during the next decade or two there may be other, less familiar legal debates over the scope of rights involving private property -- in particular, the ability of corporations and entrepreneurs, through the use of copyright and patent law, to control a broad spectrum of intellectual property, from digital entertainment to genetic sequences.
 As books, music and movies are increasingly distributed by large corporations in digital form, entertainment and publishing corporations are clamping down on the ability to access copyrighted material -- sometimes by persuading Congress to extend copyright protections and sometimes by devising ingenious technological ways to block users from making copies of the product. Many digital activists fear that free expression won't be able to thrive if people are deprived of the right to sample, remix and tinker in a world where every copyright infringement can be recorded, punished or technologically impeded.
 The guru of digital activism is the Stanford law professor and cyberspace visionary Lawrence Lessig, whom I recently reached by telephone in Spain. ''As life moves increasingly onto the Net and the capacity to control every aspect of our cultural capital increases almost to perfection, the question will be whether there is an affirmative right of access, to use and remix,'' Lessig said. Three years ago, as the lawyer for an Internet publisher of works in the public domain, Lessig failed to convince the Supreme Court that the purpose of copyright law -- to promote creativity -- was undermined by the automatic copyrighting of all creative works for the life of the author plus 70 years (as it is after the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension law added 20 years to existing copyright protections.) Lessig argued unsuccessfully that the First Amendment is threatened in a world where artists, for example, must solicit permission from lawyers at major movie studios before using 10-second clips in their video art -- virtually a requirement in the current scheme. In 10 or 20 years, Lessig told me, the problem for digital activists will be copyright restrictions that are enforced not by lawyers but by computer code and digital-rights-management technology. These technologies can ensure that everyone who buys an electronic book or tune can copy it as many as five times, for example, but no more. 
 At the moment, copyright law contains an exception for ''fair use'' -- an artist or biographer, for instance, can quote briefly from copyrighted books or songs. But as movies, books, songs, games and the computers that transmit them are increasingly controlled by digital-rights-management technology, they might be made impervious to copying or sampling, even for the brief quotations that fair use now protects. Bloggers, for example, might find themselves technologically unable to cut and paste from future books.
 ''Imagine a world where 90 percent of the stuff you read and watch and listen to is on very high-definition screens,'' Lessig said. At that point, our ability to access books and movies and music online will determine the degree to which we can put them to other creative uses. ''When libraries loan books,'' Lessig continued, ''they don't make a copy, so it's not regulated by copyright, but when all content is in digital form and every use produces a copy and is subject to copyright law, there's an affirmative right that has to be asserted -- a right to access.'' Lessig told me that Congress might try to extend the terms of copyright yet again when the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension expires in 2019. He said that the only way to persuade a Roberts-era Supreme Court to strike down further extensions is to mobilize a political coalition in the country around the importance of digital free expression. ''You speak to conservatives by pointing to this extraordinary loss of resources caused by overregulation,'' he said, ''and you speak to liberals by pointing to the lost opportunities for creativity and free speech.'' 
 Edward Felten, a professor of computer science at Princeton University, told me that he hopes in 20 years that Americans might be able to assert a newly recognized constitutional right -- rooted in the First Amendment -- to circumvent the obstacles posed by digital-rights-management technology. He calls it ''the constitutional right to tinker.'' Felten began thinking about the right to tinker several years ago, when he became aware of the legal complications that were increasingly cropping up in his own discipline of computer science. ''Researchers were worried about the possibility of legal threats from companies whose interests were affected by their research,'' he recounted in a recent phone conversation. In fact, Felten has firsthand knowledge of how the threat of lawsuits can inhibit creativity: a few years ago, he and his colleagues were about to publish an academic paper about a set of anticopying technologies being considered by the record industry. When a consortium of companies that had developed the technology threatened to sue the scholars for violating federal copyright law, Felten and his co-authors had to withdraw the paper (although they eventually won the right to publish it).
 Chastened by the experience, Felten decided to articulate what, exactly, is threatened when researchers aren't permitted to experiment without first consulting their lawyers; he hit upon the concept of tinkering. ''The process of experimentation, not always with a direct goal, is captured by the term tinkering,'' he said. Whether the Supreme Court ever recognizes tinkering as a constitutional right, the ability to tinker may be threatened not only in computer science but also in the life sciences as well. Genetic material is increasingly being patented, Felten noted, and many biologists worry that the tools they need in the lab to carry out research on genetic diseases -- like individual gene sequences in genetically engineered animals -- may become entangled in patent disputes. 
 Efforts to patent the building blocks of life may not only raise hard issues about scientific freedom. They may also ultimately force American society, and perhaps the Supreme Court, to debate the moral and constitutional issues raised by efforts to patent human life itself. To explore those issues, some of which seem more like science fiction than others, I phoned James Boyle, a professor at Duke Law School, who wrote about the topic nearly a decade ago in his prescient book ''Shamans, Software and Spleens.'' Boyle, imagining a coming constitutional battle over patents and human life, told me that ''we already allow patents on genetically modified organisms -- mice who have a predisposition to various forms of cancer suffered by humans, for example. What about a patent on a chimp with genetically enhanced intelligence? Or a 'meat puppet' -- not sapient but looking like a human being, intended for use as a sex toy, say?'' 
 Even if the market for humanoid sex puppets were to take off unexpectedly, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has announced that it won't issue patents on human beings -- that would violate the constitutional prohibition on slavery and involuntary servitude. But identifying what counts as a human being may be an increasingly challenging task. For example, Boyle explained, patenting chimp gene sequences is now legal. ''If someone created a chimp with an IQ of 75 and limited vocabulary,'' he said, ''I hope the Patent and Trademark office and the Supreme Court would draw the line and say no, no, no.'' 
 Confronted with patents on sapient life forms that resemble human beings, legislatures will face tremendous pressure to intervene. Still, the task of defining human life might be so politically explosive and embarrassing that Congress might ultimately prefer to punt the controversy to the Supreme Court. ''Congress might well say you can't patent human life, but the question is, What's that?'' said Boyle, who imagines a future constitutional case being brought on behalf of ''a high-IQ genetically engineered dolphin'' or, perhaps more plausibly, a computer program for artificial intelligence that seems to perform human functions. Either the dolphin or the machine might assert a right ''not just to be free of patent rights, but to be free of any ownership rights at all,'' as Boyle put it. And there is precious little in the existing categories of constitutional discourse that would prepare the justices to identify the point at which an organism with a genetic sequence or artificial brain similar to a human deserves constitutional rights. ''This is kind of 'woo woo' stuff,'' Boyle said. ''But I could see an interesting jurisprudential train wreck coming up.'' 

VII. What the Hearings Should Accomplish
 It seems unlikely that John Roberts's confirmation hearings will result in the nominee speaking unguardedly and at length on abortion and other controversies of the moment, or in the Democrats thwarting his confirmation. (Roberts is a conservative; he is also intelligent, able and possesses, by all accounts, a judicious temperament.) What, then, would be the most productive use of his confirmation hearings? It would be illuminating for the senators to ask the man who will be, if confirmed, the first new justice of the 21st century some probing questions about the Supreme Court of the future -- including how, in the broadest sense, it should prepare to handle cases arising from the technological and social changes of the coming decades.
 In particular, the senators might ask Roberts to reflect on the following historical paradox: Why has the Supreme Court, often considered the least democratic branch of government, traditionally been most effective when it has reflected the constitutional views of the country as a whole? The Supreme Court decisions that have tended to maintain their legitimacy over time -- like the decisions in the 1960's protecting free speech and racial equality -- are those that deferred to values that had already been debated and accepted by a majority of the American people. By contrast, the least effective Supreme Court decisions -- the decisions most likely to be attacked and resisted -- have been those in which the court unilaterally imposes constitutional principles that are actively and intensely contested by a majority of the country. 
 Is this historical lesson one that the 21st-century court should heed? Like the rest of us, of course, senators can't confidently predict the particular controversies that the future will bring. As Roberts understood as a college student, history is full of surprises, and in 10 or 20 years, many of today's efforts to speculate about the constitutional future may look shortsighted and naive. But precisely because constitutional futurology is not an exact science, Roberts suggested in his conversation with me three years ago, judges should be reluctant to second-guess the decisions of elected legislators. 
 ''Do I think it's a good thing that at least once every 30 years, the Supreme Court says something that motivates Congress to focus a little more closely on why it's regulating in a particular area?'' he asked. ''Yes, I do think that's good.'' But he stressed that ''there has to be a lot of legal room in the joints, and the Supreme Court has to remind itself on a daily basis that it occupies tenuous ground.''
 Roberts's point about the importance of judicial deference will be all the more important in an age when activists on the left and the right contend that only judges and other professionals will have the expertise to resolve the complex technological and bioethical disputes of the future. For the truth is that the issues most likely to divide the country in coming years will remain, at heart, more political and moral than technological. If the court tries to impose the views of political minorities, whether liberal or conservative, in the face of public resistance, it risks provoking social turmoil. Whether Roberts will be a deferential conservative, as he appears to be, or a unilateralist conservative, as his opponents fear, will be a central question for the Senate to explore. But his repeated paeans to the importance of modesty, stability and deference to democratic outcomes should be heard and embraced by all who will eventually sit on the court in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: With a Sub Base at Risk, Connecticut Closed Ranks 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
For three months in Connecticut, every elected official was on the same side. Who, after all, would be foolish enough not to oppose the Pentagon's plan to close the Naval submarine base at Groton, home to 8,500 jobs and the core of southeastern Connecticut's economy? 
 ''Nobody talked Republican, Democrat, elections, incumbents, past, whatever,'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, said Wednesday, just an hour after an independent commission overruled the Pentagon plan, keeping the base intact. ''We just pulled together to make it work for the state, and we did.'' 
Yet what may have been most striking about this bipartisan submarine summer -- particularly among the four main members of what they called ''Team Connecticut'' -- is that it really was not all that striking.
 Not these days. Not in a state whose Democratic senators, Mr. Lieberman and Christopher J. Dodd, are prominent national figures, ironclad in their incumbency. Not when the Republican governor, M. Jodi Rell, glows with what polls say is an 80 percent approval rating. And not when the most vulnerable player, Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican whose politically fickle district includes the Groton base, is an exuberant moderate who often introduces himself by saying ''Gung-Ho!''
 ''It did not look like anyone was straining to smile,'' said Andrew W. Roraback, a Republican state senator from Goshen, who also prefers the middle political ground.
 ''If you scratch beneath the surface, there is such an absence of rancor under normal circumstances,'' Mr. Roraback said, ''and that absence of rancor manifests itself in times like this. There are no histories between these individuals.''
 Then again, no one seems to expect the good times to last. Next year, after all, is an election year.
 ''This is a nice reprieve, a summer reprieve,'' said Nick Paindiris, a member of the Democratic State Central Committee and the leader of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign in Connecticut. ''But when the congressional campaign, the gubernatorial campaign kicks off, you're not going to see the unity you're seeing now.''
 Mr. Dodd won a fifth term last fall. Mr. Lieberman is seeking a fourth term next fall. Mrs. Rell, who has yet to announce whether she will seek a new term next year, is far ahead of Democratic challengers in early polls.
 ''The only one of the four who's in any trouble is Simmons,'' said Howard L. Reiter, chairman of the political science department at the University of Connecticut.
 Mr. Simmons won in 2004 with 54 percent of the vote in a district where less than a fourth of voters are registered Republicans and the largest group is not affiliated with any party.
 Asked how long the unity of the submarine fight would last, Mr. Simmons said: ''Probably until the election year. But wouldn't it be nice if we could do that with every issue that comes down the road?''
 In the final weeks before the commission vote, Mr. Simmons's office dispatched a constant stream of e-mail messages, sometimes several each day, featuring bulleted quotes from members of the bipartisan alliance. The officials coordinated calls to commission members up through the eve of the vote. Still, said Mr. Simmons, while he knew Mrs. Rell would support him, he said he expected the Democratic senators to campaign for the Democrat opposing him next year, Joe Courtney, a former state representative.
 ''During the silly season we're not surprised when people who we work closely with have to part ways,'' he said. ''We understand.''
 Mr. Reiter, with the University of Connecticut, agreed that the bipartisanship would evaporate during the campaign season. But he also said the ease with which ''Team Connecticut'' appeared to work together may be more reflective of their true nature and was in keeping with the state's history of political temperance.
 ''It's traditionally been a machine-politics kind of state,'' he said. ''It was not a politics that was driven by hot-button issues, by highly ideological conflicts.''
 It helps that the four most prominent players in the submarine fight do not have ambitions, at least for now, for one another's. But they are genuine coalition-builders, Mr. Reiter said. 
 ''The ideological distance isn't there,'' he said. ''Their style of politics is a much more low-key accommodating style.''
 That was evident on Wednesday, when praise and credit was shared all around.
 ''He's on the hot seat obviously,'' Mr. Dodd said of Mr. Simmons in the first, euphoric moments after the commission voted. ''It's his district here and we know how difficult that can be.''
 Then Mr. Dodd, who once represented Mr. Simmons's district in Congress, added, ''Let it be known that he was a great advocate, a great fighter and did a great job.''
 Mr. Courtney, Mr. Simmons's challenger in next year's election, said the congressman called him after the decision ''to thank me for taking the high road'' and not trying to make the submarine base a campaign issue.
 Mr. Courtney also noted that his campaign has already received contributions from political action committees controlled by Mr. Dodd and Mr. Lieberman. 
 Told that the senators had made a point of giving credit to Mr. Simmons in saving the base, he said, ''To be honest, I don't really remember them saying that.''

HEADLINE: Panel on Base Closings Wraps Up Work

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The military base-closing commission completed its work on Saturday, approving a huge retrenchment of the Defense Department's domestic installations after deciding in recent days to keep open more than a dozen sites that the Pentagon had said were no longer needed.
 The Base Closure and Realignment Commission approved the revised list in a half-hour final session, attended by five of the nine commissioners, after marathon deliberations over the previous three days in which members reviewed more than 800 bases the Pentagon wanted to close, shrink or assign new missions.
 Much of the Defense Department's plan for closing or consolidating a record 62 major military bases and 775 smaller installations emerged from the review intact. But by opting not to close installations in Connecticut, Maine, South Dakota, Alaska and Michigan, and by saving Air National Guard units in other states, the panel cut into the savings that the Pentagon was hoping to achieve in this round of base closings. 
 The changes were a relief to communities whose bases had been on the original list and will help ensure a smoother reception for the plan in Congress, officials involved said. Although it was rarely acknowledged by the commission members during their final deliberations, their decisions had sweeping political and economic implications.
 States where bases were spared could count on a continuing flow of federal money. States where bases were closing had to begin thinking about new ways to generate economic growth. Politicians unable to save a local base faced the possibility of a challenger in the next election charging that they lacked influence.
 Anthony J. Principi, the commission chairman and a former secretary of veterans affairs, said the panel successfully balanced ''proposals to restructure military infrastructure against the human and painful impact of those proposals.''
 The revised plan now goes to President Bush, who is expected to send it without changes to Congress. Despite the sweeping nature of the Pentagon plan, Congress is not expected to intervene to block it.
 Among the controversial parts of the plan were proposals to shift Air National Guard units around the country, leaving some states without aircraft. Late Friday, the commission restored planes to some units, and in doing so, kept open some Air Guard and Reserve bases that would have closed under the Pentagon plan.
 The Air Guard base in Schenectady, N.Y., saw the commission increase its complement of C-130 cargo planes to 10 from 6 in the Pentagon plan. In addition, the panel rejected a Pentagon proposal to close the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, leaving eight C-130's there rather than moving them to a base in Arkansas.
 Explaining the decision, Mr. Principi said the base ''is the second-largest employer in western New York.''
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat from New York who serves on the Armed Services Committee, claimed credit for helping to save the installation.
 ''I'm thrilled that the BRAC commission accepted the strong arguments that we made and reversed the decision to close the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station,'' she said in a statement, adding that the move ''will preserve the thousands of jobs that were jeopardized just a few short months ago.''
 Mr. Principi told reporters Friday night that changes in the Pentagon blueprint approved by the commission had reduced the estimated savings over 20 years to $37 billion, from $48 billion, though he called the revised number ''very preliminary.''

HEADLINE: For UConn Basketball, Time for Defense

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
WHEN the men's basketball team at the University of Connecticut won the National Collegiate Athletic Association title against Duke University in 1999, Connecticut's two United States senators, Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman, asked their colleagues to join them in passing a resolution recognizing the players' accomplishment. In his speech to the Senate before the passage of the measure, Mr. Dodd talked of how the university's basketball teams had made many in the state proud, and had even garnered notice beyond Connecticut. 
 ''We are a state that, over many years, has had to export our allegiances to athletics,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''In the meantime,'' he added, ''it has been our men and women's basketball teams at UConn that have captured the attention of everybody in our state, and I might say, as well, beyond our state's borders.''
Men's basketball at UConn has again been in the news, but this time, there will be no congratulatory Senate resolutions. Although the UConn men's and women's basketball teams won a tandem championship in 2004, and although players on the women's team have typically excelled academically, the men's team has become somewhat notorious for problems. 
 With the arrests this month of the point guard Marcus Williams, an N.B.A. prospect, and the guard A.J. Price on charges of stealing laptop computers from other university students, the university and its highly ranked basketball team are in a position they are unaccustomed to: on the defensive. 
 The athletics department issued a statement saying it had no comment on the arrests. Jim Calhoun, the men's basketball coach, suspended the players indefinitely from the basketball program soon after they were charged. 
 Mr. Williams filed an application in Superior Court in Vernon on Tuesday to enter accelerated rehabilitation for first-time offenders. If his application is granted, he will be given a type of probation that wipes his criminal record clean if he stays out of trouble for a specified period. He is due back in court on Sept. 13. Mr. Price's first court appearance was postponed until Tuesday. 
 Statewide and on campus, reaction has been mixed. Many students arriving on campus expressed surprise that players with such promising futures could be involved in such a situation.
 Mano Rajkotia and Hetal Patel, both 21 and senior accounting majors, were walking on campus recently when they stopped to answer questions about the cases. The players' actions baffled them, they said.
 ''The arrests were kind of a shock,'' Mr. Rajkotia said. ''I just don't see a reason for them to do this. And even though reports of this might jeopardize the university's reputation, I think it's hard for the administration to keep track of what every student is doing.''
 Tom Ritter, a former Speaker of the House who is a member of the university's board and a graduate of its law school, said he believed a new school year offered the chance for a fresh beginning for the team. 
 ''It's been a bad few months for the university in general,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''But I've got my money on Jim Calhoun to meld these guys into men. And I think as far as the fan base is concerned, they want to make sure these kids are dealt with fairly harshly, but they are looking to Coach Calhoun for direction.''
 Allen L. Sack, a professor of management at the University of New Haven and author of ''College Athletes for Hire: The Evolution and Legacy of the N.C.A.A.'s Amateur Myth,'' said that the evolution of college athletes was part of the problem.
 When colleges and universities started entering into individual television contracts for their athletic teams, the pressures and temptations on the students increased, Dr. Sack said, and it is difficult to find students who are mature enough to handle these stresses, and for universities to track the behavior of their athletes. 
 ''Once individual universities entered into free enterprise, it ratcheted up the competition tremendously,'' Dr. Sack said. ''So of course I'm not surprised.''
 ''The media has a tendency to look at these things as individual acts,'' he continued. ''It's not a couple of bad kids. We're talking about a system run amok. You have to hire coaches for $2 million a year, they've got to win. They bring in athletes who will help them win. They probably lower some standards, look the other way if the kid has behavioral problems, then ratchet up the pressure on the kids. The kids' heads are blown up and their egos inflated and they get a sense of entitlement. A lot of this is fairly predictable.'' 
 Peter Barth, a retired UConn economics professor and a former chairman of the department, is also a season ticket holder for the men's basketball games.
 Standing in the shadow of Gampel Pavilion, where the basketball teams plays their home games, he said that although the men were presumed innocent until proved otherwise, he mourned what he saw as a change in the team's makeup.
 ''One reason I was a ticket holder for men's and women's basketball was because the programs were so clean compared to what goes on at other universities with big athletic programs,'' Dr. Barth said. ''This certainly has cast a shadow over the men's program. I must say that for the men's program, most of my pride has dissipated over the past few years. We've had success and we've had young men and women we're proud of playing at this university. But if I had a choice, I'd want a clean program and a mediocre team.'' 
 The men's team has had other problems with its players this year. On March 14, Mr. Calhoun suspended Antonio Kellogg, a guard, from the team, but the reasons were not made public. On April 9, Mr. Kellogg was arrested on three charges, including attempted assault and resisting arrest.Mr. Kellogg was subsequently expelled and left the university in April. His case was resolved when he was placed in accelerated rehabilitation until April 25, 2007.
 In 2000, two freshman players, Doug Wrenn and Tony Robertson, were temporarily suspended from the team during a police investigation. No charges were filed, but Mr. Wrenn was eventually thrown off the team and left the university soon after. Mr. Robertson stayed with the team. 
 This spring, UConn football players also ran into trouble. Five were arrested after one shot a pellet gun in the parking lot of a Willimantic food store, shattering the window of a passing car. The driver was treated at a hospital and released. Charges against two players were dropped, and three were given accelerated rehabilitation. 
 A report released this year by Richard Lapchick, director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida, added to the negative publicity surrounding the university's athletic program. The report found that UConn had graduated only 27 percent of its male basketball players over a six-year period starting in 1997-98, a figure that is not unusual among big-time basketball programs. Seth Needleman, a fifth-year economics major, said he was prepared to be cynical about the outcome of the basketball arrests. 
 ''They'll probably get off, even though they should get kicked out of school,'' Mr. Needleman said recently, as he smoked a cigarette outside Gampel Pavilion. ''I know if I did something like this, I'd get thrown out. It's just like the football players with the pellet gun in the car. Most of those guys got off. I love the basketball team, but really, I wasn't that surprised.''
 Dozens of high school students on college tours were on the campus in the past week and, unless they lived in Connecticut, few had heard of the arrests.
 ''There are unfortunate events everywhere,'' said Jennifer Moody, 17, a high school senior from Burlington, Vt. ''I'm still very interested in coming here.''
 Tim Tolokan, associate director of athletics for licensing and a former sports information director at the university, said he was confident the university would continue to draw support from its fans.
 ''We are the only game in town,'' he said. ''The reason we can speak in those terms is that we have close to 100,000 alumni who live within the borders of the state, and I'm only listing the people who have an educational tie to the university. That does not take into account the thousands from Connecticut who do not have educational ties to the university but who are fans. We truly cover the borders of the entire state.''

HEADLINE: As His Challenger Fires Away, Morgenthau Stands Clear

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
One Hogan Place does not look much like the White House. Home to the Manhattan district attorney's office, the dark and rather grim building near Foley Square scarcely has a lobby, much less a rose garden suitable for official photos.
 But as the primary battle for the post of Manhattan prosecutor looms, some political consultants say that Robert M. Morgenthau, the longtime incumbent, seems to have adopted a classic ''Rose Garden strategy,'' remaining above the fray and scarcely acknowledging his opponent, at least publicly.
 This has clearly frustrated that opponent, Leslie Crocker Snyder, who has been campaigning until she is hoarse and lobbing ferocious attacks on Mr. Morgenthau. Just last week her campaign began running three television ads, two of which say he has failed to promote black, Hispanic and Asian staff members. 
 In August alone, according to her staff, Ms. Snyder, a former judge and onetime prosecutor, has been hitting one or two subway stops a day, speaking at churches in Harlem, attending street fairs and farmers' markets. And she has been holding news conferences on the steps of City Hall, as she did last week, complaining bitterly that Mr. Morgenthau will not debate her.
 Mr. Morgenthau, who has not faced a serious challenger in 20 years, has been on vacation for much of the last two weeks.
 Political strategists say this makes perfect sense. ''His job is to keep out of her view, and her job is to go after him,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a consultant not involved in the race. ''By not engaging her, she appears shrill, a voice screaming in the wilderness. It's tactically smart.''
 And while polls are very limited, they suggest that Mr. Morgenthau's strategy is working. A Quinnipiac University poll of 136 likely Democratic voters in Manhattan found that Mr. Morgenthau had 61 percent of the vote to Ms. Snyder's 16 percent (the margin of error is 8.4 percentage points). Ms. Snyder's camp says the gap is not really that great. 
 The ''Rose Garden strategy'' ultimately did not succeed for the man most closely associated with it, former President Jimmy Carter, who avoided the campaign trail in 1980 and lost to Ronald Reagan that year.
 But Mr. Morgenthau has advantages that the former president did not, beset as he was by gas lines, inflation and the Iran hostage crisis. The district attorney can point to a low crime rate, three decades in office and the support of a host of current and former public officials, including former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, who reveres him. 
 In June, Mr. Morgenthau's office won the conviction of Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco, for essentially looting the company and deceiving shareholders. Mr. Morgenthau's first effort to prosecute Mr. Kozlowski ended in a mistrial in April 2004, which had helped fuel Ms. Snyder's criticism that his office hoarded white-collar cases better left to state and federal prosecutors. 
 Ms. Snyder's main theme has been to criticize the length of his tenure and, by implication, his age: he just turned 86; she is 63. And while he is as cogent as ever, he is very hard of hearing and rather shaky of gait. 
 ''Morgenthau may be sharp as a tack, but appearances matter,'' said Danica Gallagher, a political consultant. Limiting appearances, running on his record, and relying on testimonials is a good strategy to combat that, she added, given that Ms. Snyder has little public recognition.
 While campaign insiders say that ''nonengagement'' has been their strategy from the first, a spokesman for Mr. Morgenthau's campaign, George Arzt, said he did not agree with the ''Rose Garden'' characterization. He said Mr. Morgenthau had been campaigning recently, meeting with newspaper editorial boards, attending at least one fund-raiser and shaking hands at a subway stop in Washington Heights. ''And he's working a full-time job,'' Mr. Arzt added.
 Mr. Morgenthau was also the first to go on the air with a television ad, a dignified if not terribly lively commercial that stresses his record. He has sent out at least three mailings. And he is involved in planning the campaign's strategy over lunches at Forlini's and other locations.
 Certainly, both sides have been raising and spending money lately. From mid-July to mid-August, Mr. Morgenthau's campaign raised almost $250,000, spent more than $500,000 and still has close to $700,000 on hand, according to his most recent filings with the city's Board of Elections. Ms. Snyder's campaign raised more than $120,000 in the same period, spent almost $700,000 and has about $570,000 on hand. 
 Ms. Snyder's team says ''Rose Garden'' is an apt description of Mr. Morgenthau's strategy -- almost.
 ''You call it Rose Garden, I call it irresponsible,'' her campaign spokesman, Eric Pugatch, said in an e-mail message. ''New Yorkers will not accept that just because he has been in office for 30 years, he is somehow entitled to stay for another four.'' If Mr. Morgenthau ''is not capable of defending his record -- and articulating a vision for the future -- then he should not be running,'' Mr. Pugatch added.
 Mr. Morgenthau's camp insists that he has already debated Ms. Snyder, in the spring, at the Harvard Club and at the National Organization for Women. Ms. Snyder disagrees. ''It's stupid to suggest he's faced her in anything close to a real debate, and he knows it,'' said her spokesman, Mr. Pugatch.
 Only last week did Ms. Snyder appear to get Mr. Morgenthau's goat, by contending that his senior staff is not diverse and does not reflect either the population of Manhattan or the makeup of the people most likely to encounter the criminal justice system as victims, witnesses or defendants. She says that only 9 out of 117 senior attorneys are black, Hispanic or Asian; his office says the real number is 12 out of 86.
 Though his spokesmen responded swiftly to Ms. Snyder's allegations, Mr. Morgenthau did not, at least not directly. But he did not have to. Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem congressman who has endorsed Mr. Morgenthau, called a news conference to denounce Ms. Snyder's charges, something he says he volunteered to do as soon as he saw her ads.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Housing Boom Is Nearly Over

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Looking forward to the time after he steps down as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan predicted here on Saturday that the nation's frenzied housing boom -- and the consumer spending that it has spurred -- is near an end.
 In a generally sanguine outlook at a Fed symposium here this weekend, Mr. Greenspan said both the excesses of the housing market and the nation's unprecedented dependence on foreign borrowing were likely to correct themselves through the normal function of market forces. 
He also acknowledged more strongly than before that the housing boom, which has been fueled in large part by the Fed's own decision to prop up the economy with low interest rates, is closely tied to the nation's soaring trade deficit and its record level of foreign indebtedness.
 But Mr. Greenspan also seemed intent on defending his legacy against critics who say his policies contributed to the United States' imbalances, which could lead to higher interest rates and potentially wrenching declines in housing prices and consumer spending.
 ''We have a problem. We have a policy that is adding to, adding to the systemic risk by subsidizing investors to take greater risks,'' said Michael Mussa, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics and a former director of research at the International Monetary Fund.
 In Mr. Greenspan's view, the housing market will inevitably ''simmer down,'' and sales and prices are all but certain to slow. ''House turnover will decline from currently historic levels, while home price increases will slow and prices could even decrease,'' he said.
 Mr. Greenspan's prediction that prices could actually decline dovetailed with other recent warnings that people have become too confident that the market value of assets will remain high for the foreseeable future.
 But he went further, saying that the end of the housing boom would also help correct other major imbalances. It would lead to weaker consumer spending, a recovery from today's nearly nonexistent rate of household savings and a reduction in the nation's huge trade deficit.
 ''An end to the housing boom could induce a significant rise in the personal saving rate, a decline in imports and a corresponding improvement in the current account deficit,'' he said. Whether those changes are ''wrenching,'' he said, will depend on whether the United States remains flexible and avoids over-regulation and barriers to trade.
 Mr. Greenspan was gloomier about the nation's long-term budget deficits, which skyrocketed after President Bush took office. He said today's budget deficits were likely to get far worse as the nation's baby boomers begin to retire and drive up the costs of Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs.
 Regardless of how the deficit is reined in, Mr. Greenspan said, rising federal deficits and overall government debt will, if not reduced, force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to prevent future inflation.
 ''We had too much experience with the dangers of inflation in the 1970's to tolerate going through another bout of dispiriting stagflation,'' he said. ''The consequences for future workers and retirees could be daunting.''

HEADLINE: Westchester Finds It, Too, Can Fall Prey to Blog-orrhea

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHARFENBERG

 BODY:
YOU read Bill Clinton's book. Hillary's, too. You followed Martha Stewart's trial religiously. You even brushed up on your Spanish in case you ran into Westchester's newest celebrity resident, the Mets pitcher Pedro Martinez.
 But what do you know about Heidi Huenemann, 28, a financial analyst for I.B.M.? 
If the answer is ''nothing,'' have no fear. You can keep apprised of the White Plains resident's family reunions, Old Navy purchases and complaints about the local fast-food scene on her new blog, ''Heidi's So-Called Life!''
 In a recent entry on Taco Bell in Elmsford, she wrote: ''get this it's the MIDDLE of summer, we go there at 9:00ish at night, and there is NO ICE! No ice, for sodas, when my parched little throat is begging for a Dr. Pepper! HELLO, can someone hook a sista up!?!?''
 Ms. Huenemann, the county's unofficial queen of the exclamation point, is one of an untold number of technophiles toiling in obscurity to build Westchester's ever-expanding blogosphere.
 This local universe of unaffiliated blogs, or online journals, touches on everything from local politics, to the economics of Star Wars' Galactic Empire to the Boston Red Sox's habit of losing on Ben Affleck's birthday. 
 The bloggers' postings range from the meaningful to the mundane. Visitors are often allowed to tell bloggers just what they think by posting a comment on the bloggers' Web sites.
 But consequential or not, these online ruminations provide a glimpse into the lives of everyday Westchesterites. And taken together, bloggers say, they provide a new digital voice for a county that is often overshadowed by the behemoth to the south.
 ''We don't have the same attention that everyone strives for, that they get in a city like New York,'' said Hezi Aris, 55, founder of the Yonkers Tribune, an online newspaper and blog site (YonkersTribune.tv) . ''I think the bloggers are filling a need.''
 Just how many people are tuning into Westchester's burgeoning blogosphere is unclear. There is no list of Westchester-based sites, no easy way to track the number of visits to local journals. But nationwide, Internet users seem increasingly interested in the online meditations of family, friends and amateur pundits.
 A recently released study by comScore Networks, a market research company in Reston, Va., found that 50 million Americans, about 30 percent of the country's Internet users, visited blogs during the first quarter of 2005. That represents a 45 percent increase over the first quarter of 2004, according to the company.
 Political blogs were the most popular category nationwide, comScore reported, and that phenomenon seems to hold in Westchester. Mr. Aris says some 35,000 distinct readers log on to his four-year-old site each month, poring through his mix of news and commentary and attaching their own anonymous, often sharply worded comments to his articles.
 Mr. Aris's readership figures are difficult to verify independently. But a few months ago Mayor Philip A. Amicone of Yonkers, a frequent target of ridicule on the site, was sufficiently concerned about its reach to block computer access to the site at City Hall and the Board of Education.
 Richard Halevy, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city took the action because the blog allowed ''any unidentified person to say anything they wanted on that site -- to the point of foul language and disparaging remarks about individuals.''
 Mr. Aris's blog is not the only online challenge to the Yonkers administration. The Yonkers Citizen, The Yonkers Insider, the Park Hill Blog and the Bad Hedgehog -- the latter apparently from its content written, in part, by a pair of anonymous, acid-tongued city employees -- are also on the front lines of the digital battle.
 Somers, Greenburgh and Edgemont are also the subjects of political blogs. In Croton-on-Hudson seven friends, including a pair of married couples, have combined public affairs reporting with slice-of-life columns on crotonblog.com.
 A recent visit to the site, which went online in February and claims more than 1,600 individual visitors a month, found an homage to the Ossining Farmers' Market, a debate between a pair of columnists known only as Mr. Red and Mr. Blue over the term ''war on terror'' and some discussion of the fate of a local garbage transfer center. ''It's almost like a reality show,'' said Ross Weale Jr., 40, a co-founder whose day job is as an Internet product manager.
 David L. Perlmutter, an associate professor of mass communications and senior fellow at Louisiana State University who is writing a book on political blogs, said locally focused sites like crotonblog.com can be even more influential than national ones because they ''have a smaller circle to effect.''
 But that has not stopped Westchester bloggers like Stephen Sherman, 51, a Scarsdale banker, from sounding off on national issues. Mr. Sherman, who describes himself as a conservative Republican, ridicules liberal orthodoxy on his satirically titled blog, The Politburo Diktat.
 The project is a constant source of amusement and a release for him as a conservative who often feels constrained about what he can say aloud in a left-leaning county, he said. ''It's a soap box,'' he said. ''If I'm with a group of neighbors or at church, maybe I don't want to speak out.''
 Chris Serico, 26, a reporter at The Patent Trader weekly newspaper in Mount Kisco, envisions nothing quite so lofty for his three-month-old, tongue-in-cheek blog, Varsity Basketweaving.
 Mr. Serico, who views the blogosphere not as a news source but as a perfect place for commenting on ''the ridiculous and the mundane,'' fills his site with odes to the actress Rachel McAdams and fast-food pinings.
 In one recent posting, he pleaded with Sonic Drive-In Carhops to open a restaurant in Westchester, so he could indulge in the chain's Island Fire burger, Ched 'R' Peppers and ''painfully yummy-looking dessert thingies with bits of crunchy and chewy goodness mixed in.'' 
 ''No matter where you live,'' Mr. Serico said, in a recent telephone interview, ''everyone wants to be heard.''

 BODY:

LEAPIN' LAGGARDS -- With Europe and Japan stumbling along a seemingly unending path of economic anemia, the United States has for the last few years borne the burden of acting as the engine of world economic growth. But rising consumption and capital spending in Japan suggest it may be revving up its motor, too. A spate of reports on economic activity in July that are due out in Tokyo this week -- the unemployment rate and retail sales today, automobile production and automobile exports tomorrow and construction orders and industrial production on Wednesday -- should give a clearer picture of whether the Asian giant is waking up.

TOO INCHOATE TO CALL -- Gassing up the S.U.V. is getting expensive, and the value of your house might be about to turn south. Glass half empty. On the other hand, the economy is humming along. Glass half full. The monthly measure of Americans' economic anxiety level comes out tomorrow, and whatever it shows, it will not be a trend. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell last month after rising in June, rising in May and falling in April. (Last Friday, the University of Michigan's monthly survey showed a sharper-than-expected drop in consumer sentiment, so brace yourselves.) Three other gauges of our collective material well-being -- figures on personal income (expected to be flat), personal spending (expected to be up 0.2 percent) and jobless claims -- follow on Thursday.

COMING INDICATORS -- Then there are macroeconomic numbers: factory orders for July, due out tomorrow; preliminary G.D.P. growth for the second quarter and preliminary corporate profits on Wednesday; construction spending for July on Thursday; and then the big one, the August unemployment rate, on Friday. It will probably remain at 5 percent, though Bloomberg News said the median forecast of the economists it surveyed called for an increase of 190,000 jobs. Taken together, the reports are unlikely to be surprising enough to move the stock market out of its current meandering in the neighborhood of 10,500.

REST STOP -- Auto sales for the month will also be announced on Thursday, and are expected to be down sharply from the blowout months of June and July. General Motors, which cleared out much of its inventory by using employee-discount pricing for all comers, is likely to report a big drop in sales, while Ford stands to gain. The Big Three are still offering employee-price promotions, but the sizzle has faded. August sales figures from leading retailers are also due out Thursday; some disappointing results last month were attributed to consumers spending more time and money in car lots than in malls.
THE O.C. SINGERS -- Is there such a thing as an O.C. effect? The popular Fox teenage drama ''The O.C.'' has spawned several successful soundtrack albums featuring music by bands like Nada Surf and the Dandy Warhols, which are not typically heard on prime time (or on MTV, for that matter). One of the best known ''O.C.'' bands, Death Cab for Cutie, releases its new album, ''Plans,'' tomorrow, providing a test case for a possible crossover effect on sales.

ALSO THIS WEEK -- Hawaii is capping the price of wholesale gasoline, the first such action by a state since the price controls and oil shocks of the 1970's. A New Jersey judge will weigh whether to postpone the Sept. 12 start of a trial that will pit Merck against a postal worker who had a heart attack after taking the company's painkiller Vioxx.

HEADLINE: Northwest Airlines Strikers Showing Signs of Dissent

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Ten days into a strike against Northwest Airlines, signs of dissent are beginning to bubble up among mechanics' union members on picket lines at airports around the country.
 In a union known for lively debate, some members of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which struck Northwest on Aug. 20, are questioning the union leaders' decision to call a strike without a vote on the airline's final offer.
Other workers are voicing adamant support for the walkout. But even some of them are looking for other jobs, saying they cannot afford to be out of work.
 The union's 4,430 workers at Northwest are walking picket lines without pay, since AMFA does not have a strike fund. Their medical coverage from the airline runs out on Thursday, and none is available from the union. And in some states, they have no unemployment benefits. 
 Northwest is using 1,900 substitute workers, including replacement mechanics, contractors and supervisors. 
 On Sunday, Northwest said its operations had run relatively well over the weekend, although it had canceled 15 flights because of Hurricane Katrina. On Saturday, the airline said 28 percent of its flights were delayed 15 minutes or more; as of midafternoon Sunday, about 13 percent were delayed, airline officials said. 
 Northwest normally encounters delays involving 20 percent to 22 percent of its flights. 
 The airline's last offer to the union called for $176 million in wage and benefit cuts, including the elimination of 2,000 jobs. It also would have provided for six months' severance pay and medical coverage for those laid off.
 ''It's absolutely ridiculous. I can't believe they didn't let us vote on it,'' Jeff Doerr, who has been a mechanic at Northwest's hub in Minneapolis for 15 years, said last week. 
 ''I have 31 years of my life invested in my job,'' said Richard S. Paterala, a lead technician at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. In an e-mail message, he said he was ''furious'' that he did not get to consider the airline's offer.
 But union leaders, including AMFA's executive director, O.V. Delle-Femine, have said the airline's final proposal was so unreasonable that the rank and file would surely have turned it down if they had a chance to vote on it.
 On Sunday, Mr. Delle-Femine said he stood by his decision not to bring the offer to a vote. ''We put out feelers on that,'' he said, adding that only a small minority of union members thought the offer was worth voting on. ''We would have been hung if we brought it out to ratify.''
 Labor experts said this stance was justifiable. ''No leadership will just present everything that a company offers,'' said Herman Benson, founder of the Association for Union Democracy, a nonprofit trade organization that advises unions.
 Nor would it send workers to picket lines without their approval, and 93 percent of AMFA members at Northwest voted in favor of a strike in July. This weekend, many vowed to keep picketing as long as it took to reach an acceptable deal. 
 On Saturday, hundreds demonstrated in support of the union at its offices in Bloomington, Minn. In Detroit that same night, workers held a fund-raising dinner at a downtown bar. ''We're still strong,'' said David Doyle, a mechanic at Northwest's operations in Detroit.
 The father of four children, Mr. Doyle is on the picket line every day at 5 a.m., with his family's support. ''The resolve is there. It's still there,'' he said. 
 Union leaders are well aware of other members' unhappiness. Late last week, AMFA Local 5 in Detroit, the site of Northwest's major international hub, posted a three-page letter on its Web site explaining in detail why the company's proposal was not submitted to members. 
 ''We knew that the company's final, last best offer had no chance of being ratified,'' wrote Neil Hesselgrave, a union negotiator. 
 Mr. Hesselgrave told members that AMFA had countered Northwest in the final hours before the strike with a verbal offer of cuts worth $146.3 million, including a 20 percent pay cut, and the elimination of up to 1,300 jobs. In return, the union demanded 32 weeks of severance pay, along with medical and dental insurance for 12 months. But even this deal, he said, had a ''slim chance'' of winning ratification.
 No matter how the strikers feel about the situation, some could soon be leaving the picket lines anyway. Several workers in Minneapolis and Detroit said they had begun looking for new jobs. 
 Matt Bailey, who has worked at Northwest for 15 years and whose last job was in the machine shop in Minneapolis, has already gone on one job interview and had set up three more, he said Friday. 
 Sue Dorr, who has spent eight years as an airplane cleaner in Detroit, said she began looking for work a month ago, anticipating that the union would go on strike. But, Ms. Dorr said, ''I'm going to have to take two jobs just to keep my house.'' 
 The lively debate among AMFA members over the strike is not unusual at a union known for controversy.
 Since its inception 40 years ago, AMFA has become known for luring members from rival unions by promising to fight wage and benefit cuts, as it did at Northwest, where it unseated the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers in 1998.
 Dubbing itself a ''craft union'' to set it apart from industrial unions, AMFA does not belong to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. It refuses to sign confidentiality agreements that would let its leaders examine airlines' financial data, because it prides itself on sharing information with its members.
 But Northwest's ability to keep operating with what it considers to be an acceptable number of delays and cancellations, coupled with the chance that members will take other jobs, has put leaders in a bind, said Mr. Benson, of the Association for Union Democracy.
 ''Unless they can pull off some kind of a decent compromise, the union is in very rough shape,'' he said.
 There could be some wiggle room. In May, AMFA departed from its no-concessions stance at United Airlines, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since 2002. For the first time in the union's history, AMFA members approved a wages-and-benefits package with $96 million in cuts. That was a unique situation, Mr. Delle-Femine said at the time, because a judge could impose the concessions if workers refused to accept them.
 Another option, though far less face-saving, would be to call off the strike. That happened in 1995 at Caterpillar, after a 17-month strike by 13,000 members of the United Auto Workers union. 
 Caterpillar kept operating with replacement workers, managers and union members who crossed the picket line. Ultimately, the union declared that the strike was in recess, and cut off strike pay. Caterpillar hired back most but not all of the striking workers.
 Such a move is not likely at Northwest, at least for now, labor experts say. In any event, the union cannot expect Northwest to proffer the terms it previously proposed, said Andrew C. Roberts, the airline's senior vice president for operations.
 ''We would not leave the last offer on the table,'' Mr. Roberts said Friday during a conference call with reporters.
 Under the federal Railway Labor Act, Northwest does not have to rehire striking AMFA members if it has hired permanent replacements, a step the airline said it was considering.
 For their part, workers say they know some job losses are inevitable. But Paul Bute, who spent nearly 19 years as a mechanic in Minneapolis before the strike, said a vote by members would uphold the union's democratic philosophy, no matter how distasteful the proposal.
 ''You could vote to get replaced, and some severance and unemployment, and some of your friends would get to stay,'' he said last week.
 Northwest has set up a toll-free number for workers to call if they want to cross the picket line and reclaim their jobs. AMFA says none of its members have done so; Mr. Roberts says two or three have.
 Still, Mr. Bute and other workers draw the line at that idea. No matter their feelings about union leaders, principles are still at stake, they said.
 ''You try to teach your kids something,'' Mr. Bute said. ''There's right and wrong, and in the face of a disaster, there's still right and wrong.'' 
 But of the strike, he said, ''It hurts.''

HEADLINE: Catskill Casinos: An Issue Left in Limbo by Discord and Indecision

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: THOMPSON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In recent months, residents and business owners who for years have longed for casinos have felt like gamblers before a giant roulette wheel. Would there be three Catskill casinos, which lawmakers authorized four years ago? Or the five that Gov. George E. Pataki was pushing last winter? Or just one, part of a scaled-back plan he supported in June?
 Through the late spring and early summer, the wheel seemed to spin and spin. But with court rulings clouding the Indian land claim settlements, and with lawmakers disagreeing, the legislative session closed with the ball on zero. 
 For opponents of gambling in the Catskills, the derailing of the quest for casinos -- at least for now -- was a lucky break. But for many who view gambling as the last, best chance to restore this once-thriving resort region to prosperity, the sudden lack of progress was a bitter blow.
 ''You've been dangling this carrot in front of the residents of this county long enough,'' said Anthony P. Cellini, the supervisor of the Town of Thompson, where four of the five casinos would have been built. ''Just do something. Make a decision. We sit here four years later and we still have no casino.''
 Others, who have followed each fit and start in the local newspaper, seem to have stopped caring about the outcome, almost as a hedge against further disappointment. ''It's never going to happen; maybe after 100 years,'' said Jimmy Kokkosis, the manager of the Blue Horizon Diner, whose business fell off sharply after the closing of the legendary Concord Hotel near here in 1998. ''I have no hope now.''
 This spring, more than at any time in the two decades that some have lobbied for a casino industry, local officials, developers and small-business owners thought they had five casinos lined up. While even some casino backers thought that that number was high, the County Legislature in February, after a contentious public hearing, signed off on five, an approval that state lawmakers and the governor's office had sought to move the plan forward.
 The prospect of casinos in the Catskills is certainly not dead. Legislators from both parties have said that they could take up the issue again.
 But the Pataki administration, in withdrawing legislation in April that would have allowed five Indian-run casinos as a way of settling age-old land claims, cited a Supreme Court ruling against the New York Oneidas. State lawyers said that the ruling muddied the legal waters and cast doubt on four of five settlements that the state had spent years negotiating.
 A subsequent federal ruling from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, relating to the Cayuga land claim, found that the tribes did not have a claim because they filed their suit too late -- 200 years after the loss of their land. If the decision stands, it would likely affect all the tribes' claims.
 Still, Mr. Pataki, a Republican who has since announced that he will not seek a fourth term in 2006, forged ahead with the St. Regis Mohawks' plan to open a casino at Kutsher's Sports Academy as part of a settlement of a land claim brought by the Akwesasne. That proposal was not affected by the court decision, state lawyers said.
 But while the Democratic-controlled Assembly also supported a single casino by the St. Regis Mohawks, the Republican-controlled Senate insisted on three, despite the court rulings. As a result, no casinos were approved. Some lawyers representing the tribes argue that the governor has leaned too heavily on the rulings, which they do not believe necessarily undermine the other land claim settlements.
 As disappointment turned to anger after the session ended, some accused the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, of refusing to allow only one casino because his son, Kenneth, was a consultant for the Wisconsin Oneidas, one of the two tribes that were cut from the Assembly's and governor's proposal. 
 ''That's not correct at all,'' said Mark Hansen, a spokesman for Senator Bruno. ''His position all along has been economic development, job creation, keeping people within the state where money can be used for state and local education. From his perspective, having three casinos creates more jobs and more economic development than having one.''
 For environmental advocates and the growing numbers of opponents, the stalling of the casino movement was cause for rejoicing. In the western part of Sullivan County, where opposition appears to be the strongest, some shop owners are doubtful that there would be spillover business from people making the trip to gamble.
 ''I think I would lose customers,'' said Roberta Handler, the owner of Good Earth, a health food store in Jeffersonville, who is passionately against gambling here. ''The casinos have their own hotels, restaurants and golf courses. I don't think people who come here to gamble in multitudes are coming to enjoy our natural beauty.''
 Bea Lazaroff, a retired typist who lives in Woodbourne and has enjoyed the occasional visit to Las Vegas, said she was relieved that the casino plan seemed to be on hold for now. Mrs. Lazaroff, 79, said she dreaded the thought of the traffic tie-ups that would result from the introduction of casinos.
 ''I hope it keeps stringing along until I'm gone,'' she said. 
 But the impasse has meant frustration for the town officials who have been waiting for a huge new source of revenue, as well as the real estate developers who have already bought large tracts of land and the Indian tribe members who want a piece of the action. 
 In his office here, Mr. Cellini has an arcade-style slot machine that takes tokens and plays an insistent minimalist soundtrack reminiscent of Philip Glass. Illustrating just how long some have been waiting for gambling here is a bumper sticker from the 1970's perched on top of the machine, reading: ''Casinos Mean Jobs.''
 Once home to hundreds of bustling hotels that catered to a predominantly Jewish clientele, Sullivan County has enjoyed something of an economic renaissance even without casinos. In the past few years, people from Manhattan and elsewhere have streamed in to snatch up relatively affordable weekend homes, which are nestled in and among the many bungalow colonies that still exist.
 The county's unemployment rate for July was only 1.7 percent. But the winter is another story. ''It's dead,'' said Dimitris Vernezos, the general manager of the Blue Horizon Diner, who has lived in the county for 16 years. ''You try to make as much money as you can in the summer so you can make it through the winter. A lot of businesses do not survive. They open and close and open and close.''
 Mr. Cellini said that the longer the casino plan remained bogged down in Albany, the more chance the opponents would have to sharpen their message. ''It's discouraging,'' he said. ''The anticasino group just keeps building momentum. We were once the hospitality capital of the Northeast. Why can't we have three more resort destinations?''

HEADLINE: In Slot Machines' Silence, A Storm's Economic Cost

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Joseph B. Treaster contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: GULFPORT, Miss., Aug. 28 

 BODY:
The economic engine of Mississippi's Gulf Coast emits not a mechanical roar but a symphony of electronic chimes: the melody of slot machines that attract 60,000 people a day, provide jobs for 17,000 employees and rack up hundreds of millions of dollars daily for the state treasury.
 But for one of the few times since legal gambling arrived, the casinos that helped revive the Gulf Coast economy went dark early Sunday, shutting down along with scores of other businesses as Hurricane Katrina -- at a top-rated Category 5 -- approached.
''All the casinos were built to withstand a Category 3 hurricane,'' said Susan Barnes, the general manager of the Treasure Bay Casino. ''Beyond that, we are very nervous.'' 
 It was an especially nervous time for Ms. Barnes, who spent Sunday overseeing the final steps of closing down her casino for the storm, chores like wrapping slot machines in plastic and seeing that the cash -- some $40 million -- was picked up by an armored car. Added to that, the Treasure Bay Casino, shaped like a pirate's galleon, is built atop a barge that is moored just off the beach here. The original law that brought legal casinos to Mississippi allowed only gambling cruises. In 1991, the law was changed to say that the ''boats'' where the gambling occurred could be permanently docked and as a result, many of them were built on barges.
 Since then, the law has been amended again, and most Gulf Coast casinos have land-based amenities like golf courses, theaters and luxury hotels. The most expensive, the Beau Rivage, cost $700 million.
 The situation could be even worse for casinos that have held on to their riverboat roots.
 Under orders from the state, the casinos closed their doors to the public at 2 a.m. Sunday and were shut down entirely by midday. While previous storms have caused them to close for a day or two, no hurricane as powerful as this has threatened the casinos since 1992, when the industry took off. 
 There are 27 state-regulated casinos in Mississippi. Seventeen were closed because of the approaching storm, including those as far inland as Vicksburg and Natchez, said Beverly Martin, the executive director of the Mississippi Casino Operators Association. At least some gamblers headed north to Tunica, just below Memphis.
 Together, the casinos generate $400 million in tax revenue each year. When the Gulf Coast casinos are closed, the cost to the state is $400,000 to $500,000 a day. With 17 closed, tax revenue would drop by at least 50 percent, Ms. Martin said.
 ''The only reason why it's not two-thirds is because Tunica has a lot of the evacuees,'' she said.
 And, of course, the casinos lose money during storms even when they are not closed. The drop-off in business began about three days ago, Ms. Martin said. ''The Weather Channel, God bless them,'' she said.
 Although they are expensive to insure, the casinos are not totally unprotected. Their mooring systems are supposed to withstand wind speeds of 150 miles per hour, said David Kingman, the gaming commission's emergency management liaison. ''If you look, the pilings are in some cases six feet in diameter,'' he said.
 Katrina is expected to have top winds of 160 miles per hour.
 Still, Ms. Barnes said that she would not follow a mandatory evacuation order for her neighborhood.
 ''If it weren't for the Treasure Bay, I would have evacuated,'' she said. ''But I need to be back here for any disaster recovery.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 29 about the closing of Mississippi's casinos as Hurricane Katrina approached misspelled the surname of the general manager of the Treasure Bay Casino, who said the casinos were built to withstand a Category 3 hurricane. She is Susan Varnes, not Barnes.

HEADLINE: U.S. Banks on Technology in Revised Military Plan for a Possible North Korea Conflict 

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: CAMP CASEY, South Korea 

 BODY:
American commanders are making significant changes in their plans in the event of a military conflict with North Korea, to rely in large measure on a new generation of sensors, smart bombs and high-speed transport ships to deter and, if necessary, counter that unpredictable dictatorship, the senior United States commander in South Korea says.
 The shift in strategy is being undertaken even as the United States cuts the number of troops here by one-third and begins moving the remaining soldiers farther from the demilitarized zone, to improve their chances of surviving any North Korean offensive.
 Army headquarters in Washington has made a formal announcement that a brigade of Second Infantry Division soldiers sent urgently from South Korea to Iraq last year will not return to South Korea, but will instead return to a base in the United States. That puts the American troop commitment to South Korea on track to drop from 37,500 -- a figure maintained since the early 1990's -- to 25,000 by 2008.
 In a recent interview that provided a detailed public description of the highly classified war-planning process, Gen. Leon J. LaPorte, the commander, described how American contingency plans are being reshaped by new theories of war-fighting and by new military technology. 
 ''We have better intelligence,'' he said, so the American and South Korean militaries will have more advance warning if North Korea mobilizes for war, providing the opportunity to locate and attack its vast arsenal of artillery and rockets.
 ''We have precision-guided munitions,'' he added. ''We have better weapons systems. We have better communications. So we are able to not only accomplish our current mission, but increase our capabilities -- at the same time reducing the number of personnel it takes to do this.'' 
 American plans call for moving those troops remaining in South Korea away from the border with North Korea -- where for decades they have been within easy killing range of 12,000 artillery pieces and rocket tubes -- to new positions where the troops would have greater chances of absorbing, and then responding to, a North Korean offensive. The plans were under discussion before the war in Iraq began. 
 ''Why would we want to have our valuable resources underneath the artillery of North Korea?'' General LaPorte said. ''Our high-value assets are now disposed where they would not be under immediate fires. It gives us the operational agility we need.''
 The shift of the American footprint here has an added benefit, as the movements also ease tensions with South Koreans. The tight embrace of urban sprawl from the South Korean capital, Seoul, had surrounded a number of American bases that were set up decades ago at what had been the end of dusty roads.
 As the nation's senior war planners survey the world for potential military rivals, there is no doubt that the most significant state rivals are China and North Korea -- and that the nuclear, Communist North Korea is by far the more unpredictable. In the interview, General LaPorte also pulled back the curtain on the latest intelligence assessments of a North Korean threat across a demilitarized zone just 11 miles from this American base. His detailed description of American military efforts can be at least partly be interpreted as a desire by the United States government to indicate to the North Koreans that there is continued commitment in South Korea, despite the reduction in troops.
 Although the tenor of political exchanges between the United States and North Korea depend on the status of talks seeking to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program, the state of readiness maintained by North Korea's conventional military forces has not altered in response to either a sharper tone of criticism from either side or the resumption of six-party negotiations.
 ''We have not seen any significant changes,'' General LaPorte said. ''They are operating within what we would call operational norms, seasonal norms. They have a summer training cycle and a winter training cycle. We have not seen any significant deviation outside the norms over the past five years.''
 At the same time, this steady state of readiness has been maintained despite the near collapse of North Korea's economy, including its agricultural system, with the nation's military receiving about one-third of the gross domestic product regardless of the poverty thrust upon North Korea's population. 
 North Korea has announced that it is a nuclear power. But chemical weapons are a source of concern as well, General LaPorte said. ''North Korean doctrine does not see chemicals as a weapon of mass destruction, but as a conventional munition,'' he said. ''Their doctrine is that every third round is a chemical round.'' 
 Michael E. O'Hanlon, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the plans initiated by General LaPorte to shift American forces on the peninsula received widespread support when analyzed purely on military grounds, although a few members of Congress have questioned whether some might misinterpret the reduction of troops here as a sign of lessening support from the United States.
 The reworking of the war plans, at least those that have been described in public, incorporates advances in technology and combat skills that were successfully executed during the rush to Baghdad in 2003, said Mr. O'Hanlon, an author of ''Crisis on the Korean Peninsula: How to Deal With a Nuclear North Korea.'' 
 Advances in satellite-guided targeting of bombs let the Americans attack Iraqi Republican Guard units even as ground forces were slowed by blinding sandstorms.
 In case of war with North Korea, ''There are a large number of targets that we have a chance of taking out in the opening days of a battle, but not the opening minutes, because of our precision-strike capabilities and I.S.R.,'' Mr. O'Hanlon said, using the initials for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. ''Even if that artillery is pulled back inside caves, we have a pretty potent capability.''
 North Korea is believed to have more than 800 missiles that can strike South Korea and beyond, and more than 12,000 artillery pieces, a large proportion in underground bunkers where they could strike Seoul. The North Korean military is said to number 1.2 million in its standing army, with the ability to mobilize another five million. North Korea also has 120,000 special operations forces, whose mission is to infiltrate South Korea for reconnaissance and attacks.
 The South Korean military has 645,000 active-duty personnel, and a reserve of 1.5 million that can be doubled in case of wartime mobilization. As the South Korean military has grown in capability in recent years, about a dozen significant military missions have been transferred from the United States military here to South Korean forces, including full responsibility for security along the demilitarized zone.
 American and South Korean war planners have reworked contingency plans in one of the most dramatic examples of how military transformation -- often a cliche and vague buzzword in Pentagon conversations -- has actually been put into place in a potential crisis zone.
 General LaPorte emphasized how different the current plans are from those of even his recent predecessors. ''Why? Because we can do things faster and with more precision than we could five years ago,'' he said.
 The new plans would rely, for example, on being able to move Army units and the service's new Stryker infantry fighting vehicle on C-17 cargo jets from their base at Fort Lewis, Wash., to reinforce South Korea in just 11 hours, General LaPorte said.
 High-speed troop transport ships can bring larger numbers of marines from Okinawa in less than a day. Heavy equipment for arriving troops is already positioned in South Korea in climate-controlled warehouses, the general said.
 Fighter aircraft and bombers based in Japan, Guam and as far away as Alaska, Hawaii and the continental United States also would be put under General LaPorte's command in time of war. Aircraft carriers also could be ordered to steam within striking range.
 A highly visible example of the shift in war plans could be seen in the squadron of F-117 Stealth fighters dispatched in recent weeks to South Korea from their bases in the United States for a series of military exercises.
 The message of their presence could not have been lost on the North Korean leadership, as it was that exact type of aircraft that opened the war with Iraq by slipping past Baghdad's radar network to bomb a suspected hide-out of Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: A School of One's Own

BYLINE: By Georgia Ka'apuni McMillen. 
Georgia Ka'apuni McMillen, a lawyer, is the author of the forthcoming ''School for Hawaiian Girls,'' a novel.

DATELINE: MAUI, HAWAII 

 BODY:
THE last of the great Hawaiian warrior kings was Kamehameha the Great, who conquered all the islands in the archipelago and established a unified Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810. Although Kamehameha and his rivals used firearms acquired from foreigners, for the most part warfare in those days involved direct hand-to-hand combat, to the death. During his campaign to take the island of Maui, Kamehameha is said to have rallied his troops by declaring: ''Forward, little brothers, and drink bitter waters. There is no turning back.''
 I graduated from a school named for this warrior king. Founded in 1887 thanks to a bequest by the great-granddaughter of Kamehameha, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the Kamehameha Schools have limited admission to Hawaiian or part-Hawaiian children, subsidizing most of their education, for more than 100 years. In her will, the princess directed that the trustees ''devote a portion of each year's income to the support and education of orphans, and others in indigent circumstances, giving the preference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood.'' My grandmother attended the schools in 1920, my father in the late 1930's and 1940's, myself and a host of cousins in the 1960's and 1970's. 
Three weeks ago, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled that in giving preference to Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian children, the Kamehameha Schools admissions policy violates the Civil Rights Act. That legislation, which forbids race discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts, was intended to protect the disadvantaged. In this case, it has been used to exactly the opposite effect.
 The plaintiff in this case, Doe v. Kamehameha, is a non-Hawaiian teenager who was denied admission under the schools' Hawaiian preference policy. On Tuesday, the schools filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit seeking a rehearing before the entire court. The Ninth Circuit is to decide whether it will rehear the case by Sept. 13.
 The Kamehameha Schools admissions policy was intended to improve the social, economic and health conditions of the Hawaiian people. At the time of Princess Pauahi's bequest, imported diseases like smallpox, influenza, measles and whooping cough had devastated Hawaii's native population. When Capt. James Cook arrived in Hawaii in 1778, there were a million Native Hawaiians; by 1883, just 44,000 remained; and in 1919, that number was reduced to 22,000. 
 The Hawaiians who survived lived in desperate poverty. Historically, Hawaiians did not own the land they lived upon, but had rights to farm, fish and gather resources there. With the influx of foreign interests and the creation of private land ownership laws, by 1850 the commoner Hawaiian owned only 0.8 percent of all of the land. Seventy-one percent of all adult men were landless under the new system. The dispossessed migrated to urban areas in search of jobs.
 The United States owes a political as well as an economic debt to the Hawaiian people. In 1893, a group of businessmen overthrew the islands' monarchy with the assistance of American military forces and the American minister to Hawaii. That paved the way, in 1898, for an annexation agreement that breached numerous treaties on friendship and trade between Hawaii and the United States, as well as violating international law and the United States constitution. In its 1993 Apology Resolution, Congress acknowledged that the United States wrongfully participated in the overthrow, and it expressed a commitment to reconciling with the Native Hawaiian people.
 In the wake of the Ninth Circuit ruling, I have been asked why a school designated for Native Hawaiians is still necessary in the 21st Century. That's a good question. But it presupposes that at one time the race-conscious admissions policy was needed to counteract discrimination against Hawaiians, whereas today such problems are behind us. 
 They aren't. As the court itself acknowledged, disproportionate numbers of the state's poor, homeless and undereducated are Native Hawaiians. Compared with non-Hawaiians, Native Hawaiians are also more likely to experience child abuse and neglect, more likely to be involved in crime, and less likely to have professional and managerial jobs. Congress has repeatedly acknowledged the continuing need for remedial race-based legislation, having passed more than 85 laws that include preferences for Native Hawaiians. These include the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, the Native Hawaiian Education Act of 2002, and the Hawaiian Homelands Ownership Act of 2000. Like the schools' race-based admissions policy, these affirmative action programs aim to redress the inequality suffered by an indigenous people. 
 Were the Kamehameha Schools forced to admit non-Hawaiian children, much would be lost. As it is, with around 70,000 Native Hawaiian children in the state, there is nowhere near enough space for them at these private schools, which operate three campuses on Oahu, Maui and the island of Hawaii and subsidize up to 90 percent of each student's education costs. For the three campuses combined, enrollment is limited to approximately 4,900 students with only 750 openings a year. 
 Any non-Hawaiian child admitted to the schools would take the place of a Hawaiian child, enjoying the benefits of a superlative private education at an institution rich in financial resources, dedicated teachers and excellent facilities, one that has a celebrated history and high standing in the community. To open the schools' admissions to non-Hawaiians would also violate the terms of the schools' trust instrument, which the princess devised in keeping with the traditional fiduciary obligation of the chiefs to manage the land for the Hawaiian people. Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians were, and remain, that trust's beneficiaries.
 To admit non-Hawaiian children to the Kamehameha Schools in place of Hawaiian children would undermine the remedial intent of the schools' founder to elevate her people. And unfortunately, the need for remedy continues into the 21st century. That is why the Ninth Circuit should re-hear this case and reverse its earlier decision.

HEADLINE: Approaching Storm Slows Oil Output in Gulf of Mexico

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Energy companies rushed to shut down oil rigs and refineries and evacuate employees in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Katrina approached over the weekend, shrinking oil output in the area at a time when markets are already on edge over surging energy prices. 
 Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange climbed as high as $70.80 a barrel on Sunday night as traders factored in the threat to the most important oil-producing region in the United States. That was up $4.67 from the close on Friday. Oil prices have never risen above $70 a barrel, but when adjusted for inflation they are still lower than they were in the early 1980's. 
 The evacuations, which were mostly completed by Sunday, cut oil production in the Gulf of Mexico by more than 600,000 barrels a day, or more than a third of the area's normal output of 1.5 million barrels a day. Large refining and oil-shipping installations in southern Louisiana, where the hurricane was expected to make landfall early Monday, also shut down over the weekend.
 ''The oil market is going to be on fire until we figure out exactly what is going on,'' David Pursell, a principal with Pickering Energy Partners in Houston, said in a telephone interview on Sunday. ''There's fear on several fronts, from the capacity of this storm to tear up pipelines on the ocean floor to doing extreme damage to port infrastructure and platforms.'' 
 Speculation about a possible release of oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve led to a drop in oil prices at the end of last week, though traders said talk about such a plan was premature. The Bush administration has been hesitant to release oil from the reserve, which has 700 million barrels of oil, despite calls from Democrats in Congress to do so. 
 The focus on the reserve is bound to intensify as the hurricane takes its toll. The storm is expected to be the biggest disruption to oil production in the gulf since Hurricane Ivan last year, which reduced the area's yearly output by 7 percent after destroying 7 platforms and damaging more than 100 underwater pipelines. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about a quarter of the nation's overall domestic oil production. 
 Gasoline prices for consumers may climb further as refining capacity is stretched by the storm. Chalmette Refinery, which is about 10 miles east of downtown New Orleans and processes 190,000 barrels of oil a day, shut down over the weekend. Calls to officials at Chalmette, a venture between Exxon Mobil and Petroleos de Venezuela, went unanswered on Sunday. Valero Energy said it was shutting down its St. Charles refinery in Louisiana, and Chevron was shutting down a refinery in Pascagoula, Miss., Bloomberg News reported.
 Elsewhere, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the nation's largest oil-importing terminal, 19 miles off the coast of Louisiana, stopped receiving crude oil from supertankers on Sunday. Altogether, about 6.5 million barrels of crude oil a day are imported along the Gulf Coast, largely to ports in Louisiana and Texas, while roughly 1.5 million barrels of oil a day are produced in domestic waters in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Royal Dutch Shell, the largest oil producer in the gulf, said in a statement that it had evacuated 983 employees and shut down production of 420,000 barrels of oil and 1.345 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.

HEADLINE: POWERFUL STORM THREATENS HAVOC ALONG GULF COAST

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and ABBY GOODNOUGH; Joseph B. Treaster reported from New Orleans for this article, and Abby Goodnough from Gulfport, Miss. Duwayne Escobedo contributed reporting from Pensacola, Fla., Marko Georgiev from New Orleans and Thomas J. Lueck from New York.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Hurricane Katrina, one of the most powerful storms ever to threaten the United States, bore down on the Gulf Coast on Sunday, sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the approach of its 160-mile-an-hour winds and prompting a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, a city perilously below sea level. 
 ''We are facing a storm that most of us have long feared,'' said Mayor C. Ray Nagin, who issued the order to evacuate. ''This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.''
 The hurricane's eye was expected to make landfall around daybreak on Monday in southeastern Louisiana, possibly squarely in New Orleans.
 The city has avoided a direct hit from a powerful storm since Hurricane Betsy in 1965. In addition to the dangerous winds, Mr. Nagin said, Hurricane Katrina could bring 15 inches of rain and a storm surge of 20 feet or higher that would ''most likely topple'' the network of levees and canals that normally protect the bowl-shaped city from flooding. 
 That possibility was enough for many of the city's 485,000 residents to heed the mayor's call to leave, paralyzing traffic along major highways from just after daybreak and into the evening. 
 ''I probably won't have a house when I go back,'' Tanya Courtney, 25, who lives in the city's French Quarter, said Sunday in Gulfport, Miss., where she and a group of friends bound for Atlanta stopped for a rest.
 The approaching storm shut down much of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, which is responsible for one-quarter of American oil production. The price of oil rose more than $4 a barrel on Sunday. [Page A12.]
 Many in New Orleans, including stranded tourists, stayed behind, with as many as 10,000 of them crowding into the Superdome arena, which the city designated as a shelter of last resort.
 People five and six abreast waited in line for hours to get into the arena, clutching children, blankets and pillows, oversize pieces of luggage or plastic bags filled with belongings.
 ''When you are on a holiday you don't really follow these kind of things,'' Neil Coffey, 35, a tourist from Britain, said as he stood in line to get into the Superdome. ''We were surprised. We don't get hurricanes like this at home.''
 Ernest Paulin Jr., a 55-year-old unemployed welder from New Orleans, said he looked around his three-bedroom wood-frame house where he has lived alone since the death of his wife last year and decided to head for the Superdome.
 ''I just didn't want to take a chance,'' said Mr. Paulin, who like many arrived with hastily packed possessions. He was carrying a small plastic bag containing his eyeglasses, medication and a paperback book, the Tony Hillerman novel ''First Eagle.''
 After crossing South Florida late last week, killing nine people as a weaker storm, Hurricane Katrina intensified over the warm waters of the gulf, growing early Sunday morning into a Category 5 storm, the strongest step on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Since records have been kept, there have only been three Category 5 storms to hit the United States -- Hurricane Andrew, which ravaged Florida and Louisiana in 1992; Hurricane Camille, which cut a path through parts of Mississippi, Louisiana and Virginia in 1969; and an unnamed storm that hit the Florida Keys in 1935.
 President Bush, vacationing at his ranch in Texas, declared a state of emergency for the Gulf Coast, a move that cleared the way for immediate federal aid. Mr. Bush also urged people in the storm's potential path to head for safer ground.
 ''We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to Gulf Coast communities,'' he said. 
 The president also participated in a videoconference on Sunday with disaster management officials who were preparing for the storm. And he spoke by telephone with the governors of the four states under immediate threat: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.
 In an unnervingly quiet New Orleans, many restaurants and stores in the French Quarter were shuttered and hotels, almost all fully booked, struggled to accommodate visitors whose flights had been canceled. The hotels were also a refuge for many residents, who sought rooms above ground level in hope of staying dry. 
 ''We call it a vertical evacuation,'' said Joseph Fein, owner of the Court of Two Sisters, a French Quarter restaurant. Mr. Fein said the city was responding much as it had to many previous hurricane threats, but that Hurricane Katrina was ''the most threatening we have seen.''
 At the Omni Royal Orleans hotel, all 346 rooms were booked, with the hotel putting up about 100 employees and members of their families, said Amiri Hayden, the concierge. ''Between guests who are stuck and employees who are staying here, every room is taken,'' Mr. Hayden said. 
 Some out-of-town guests took taxis as far as Baton Rouge, 75 miles away, to find rental car agencies that were open, he said.
 Louisiana state officials said that at one point during the evacuation of New Orleans on Sunday, more than 18,000 cars an hour were leaving the city. 
 ''I think this storm is bigger than anything we have dealt with before,'' Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. ''This is not a minor problem.''
 Officials in Attorney General Charles Foti's office said they were investigating about a half-dozen cases of price gouging, including increased prices on gasoline-powered generators and hotel rooms. The Louisiana Legislature recently passed a law stiffening penalties for price gouging when hurricanes are in the gulf. 
 Farther east on the coast, the party atmosphere promoted by the region's many casinos was nowhere in evidence. Casinos built on barges were dark on Sunday, and people all along the Mississippi Coast were ordered to evacuate. 
 In Gulfport, about 55 miles east of New Orleans, residents feared a repeat of Hurricane Camille, which smashed into the Mississippi Coast in 1969 with winds of 200 miles an hour, killing more than 250 people over several states. 
 ''I'm afraid this is the one we've dreaded,'' said Robert R. Latham Jr., the director of Emergency Management Operations for Mississippi. ''I don't think the scenario could be any worse for us.''
 In Gulfport, the authorities were making about a dozen schools and other public buildings available as shelters. But Joe Spraggins, the director of emergency operations for Harrison County, which includes Gulfport and Biloxi to the east, urged residents to go to shelters only as a last resort. Most of the buildings were built years ago, Mr. Spraggins said, and not designed to withstand the anticipated winds of 140 to 150 miles an hour.
 ''We're asking people to get out of the area,'' he said, ''and to get out fast.''
 Yet Mr. Spraggins and other emergency officials acknowledged that the hurricane could chase evacuees on a northeasterly route. Mobile, Ala., expected a storm surge of up to 20 feet, much higher than any it has experienced to date, that could flood its historic downtown. Farther east in the Florida Panhandle, residents of barrier islands were urged to evacuate as Hurricane Katrina began sloshing water onto coastal roads and near homes. 
 ''We're all getting a little tired of going through this drill,'' said Eric Landry of Pensacola, who was shuttering his house on Sunday afternoon, not quite a year after Hurricane Ivan ravaged that city. ''But we're not at the point of moving away. This is just what you have to live with.''
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose director, Michael D. Brown, flew to Baton Rouge on Sunday, was waiting to determine where the agency would need to deploy supplies and specialized personnel. A spokeswoman said FEMA had mobilized several hundred specialists, including about 20 medical teams and a smaller number of urban search and rescue teams.
 The agency has also begun moving water, ice and military Meals Ready to Eat to sites in the Southeast, said the spokeswoman, Natalie Rule. Outside the Superdome, which holds 70,000 people, long lines of evacuees were still waiting in the rain by evening as security forces searched everyone entering for drugs, weapons and other contraband. 
 Cara Every Calderon and her husband, Axel Calderon, flew to New Orleans from their home in Smithtown, N.Y., on Saturday to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. They had reserved four nights at a hotel in the French Quarter, and when Ms. Calderon called to inquire about the storm, she said, the hotel told her, ''Come on down.''
 The couple ended up at the Superdome, roller suitcases in tow, after finding themselves trapped. 
 ''We're resilient,'' Ms. Calderon said. ''We're New Yorkers. But this is a little over our heads.''

HEADLINE: A Deputy Mayor Can Fix It

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
C. Virginia Fields may have been criticized by rivals for not presenting specifics in her ideas for running the city, but her theory of governing is nonetheless emerging: throw a deputy mayor at the problem. 
 Months ago, Ms. 
Fields pledged to create a new deputy mayor for full employment to address the high levels of unemployment among minorities. Now, answering a detailed questionnaire from the NYC Zero Waste Campaign, a coalition that seeks to nearly eliminate the waste exported by the city within 20 years, Ms. Fields has proposed yet another No. 2 slot: deputy mayor for planning and zero waste. This official, she wrote, would be ''responsible for all aspects of zero waste,'' which includes trash reduction through reuse, recycling and composting.
 While it might seem a bit top-heavy to load a refuse czar into the mayor's office, to Ms. Fields, trash is more than simple garbage. 
 ''It's an environmental issue, it's a health issue, it's a jobs issue,'' said Kirsten Powers, Ms. Fields's campaign spokeswoman, ''and it's a budget issue.'' And it's one that Ms. Fields feels has not received enough attention.
 ''The single-minded focus of Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff's marshalling city resources to plan West Side development,'' she wrote in explaining her rationale, ''is a good, if unfortunate, example of the kind of focus possible and necessary for the Zero Waste plan to be successful.'' DIANE CARDWELL

HEADLINE: Intelsat Agrees to Acquire Rival in Big Satellite Deal

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Intelsat plans to announce today that it has agreed to acquire a rival, the PanAmSat Holding Corporation, creating the world's largest operator of satellites that distribute data and video programming for clients. 
 Intelsat, which is a private company, will pay $3.2 billion, or $25 a share, for PanAmSat, executives at the companies said. It will use cash to pay for the shares, which it is buying at a price that is almost 40 percent higher than the trading price just after PanAmSat's initial public offering in March. On Friday, PanAmSat shares closed at $19.80, down 3 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Intelsat will also take over $3.2 billion in PanAmSat's debt.
 The combined company will have 53 satellites -- 28 from Intelsat and 25 from PanAmSat -- and annual revenue of $1.9 billion. Executives for the companies hope to receive regulatory approval for the deal in 6 to 12 months.
 The two companies have complementary businesses. Intelsat has large contracts with the United States government, and about half of PanAmSat's revenue comes from providers of video programming like Disney, Time Warner and HBO, which need their shows beamed to cable companies.
 Intelsat is particularly strong outside the United States, while most of PanAmSat's satellites hover over North America.
 ''The two companies are complementary in customer, geographic and product focus,'' said David McGlade, Intelsat's chief executive officer, who will remain in that job if the merger is approved by regulators.
 The deal is the latest and largest in a fast-consolidating industry. A glut of satellite launchings in the 1990's sent prices tumbling and pushed several big players into bankruptcy.
 But in the last couple of years the industry has stabilized after rounds of cost cutting, fewer launchings and an upturn in demand for broadband services and video products like high-definition television and video-on-demand.
 Wholesale satellite distributors like Intelsat and PanAmSat face fierce competition from big rivals like SES and Eutelsat in Europe, as well as companies that operate global fiber-optic networks. Prices for transporting video, data and phone calls across continents and oceans plunged following the collapse of the technology bubble of the 1990's and continue to slide even now.
 But Intelsat, PanAmSat and other satellite distributors are still some of the only companies able to provide video, Internet and phone services to developing countries and remote regions that lack sophisticated fiber networks.
 Intelsat's purchase is a victory for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Carlyle Group and Providence Equity Partners, which bought PanAmSat last year and own 58 percent of its shares. Of the remaining shares, 40 percent are traded publicly and management owns 2 percent.
 Credit Suisse First Boston is Intelsat's financial adviser. Its legal advisers are Wachtell, Lipton Rosen & Katz; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. Morgan Stanley is serving as PanAmSat's financial adviser, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is serving as PanAmSat's legal adviser.

HEADLINE: Questions on Ferrer and Redevelopment of Bronx Market

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and ROBIN SHULMAN

 BODY:
One of the Democratic mayoral challengers took to the steps of a Bronx courthouse last week to attack the Bloomberg administration for what he called a ''sweetheart'' development deal that would allow a shopping mall to displace small merchants at the city-owned Bronx Terminal Market.
 The politician was not Fernando Ferrer, the borough's favorite-son candidate who is intimately familiar with the market and whose campaign has accused Mr. Bloomberg of favoring billionaire developers over small business owners.
 Instead it was Anthony D. Weiner, the congressman from Queens, who rallied with the Bronx merchants and questioned whether a developer with ties to City Hall was being unfairly favored in a deal that would displace them. 
 ''Freddy Ferrer has been completely out of it,'' said Stanley Mayer, president of the Bronx Terminal Market Preservation Association and a produce seller there for more than 30 years.
 Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, disputes the view that he has been unexpectedly quiet about the deal and the dilemma faced by the tenants. But his remarks have been rare and restrained, and his absence from the rally last week revived questions about his relationship with a real estate lawyer whose firm is representing the mall developer.
 The lawyer, William B. Wachtel, has been one of Mr. Ferrer's chief campaign fund-raisers. Last year, Mr. Ferrer worked as the $122,308-a-year president of a private research institute that was founded by Mr. Wachtel's father and is housed in space it rents from Mr. Wachtel's law firm, Wachtel & Masyr.
 ''You have to ask whether there are cross-pressures that are affecting him on the issue,'' said Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for the merchants at the market. Mr. Lipsky said he was referring to support for the redevelopment project from the Bronx Democratic organization, which is backing Mr. Ferrer, as well as his relationship with Mr. Wachtel.
 ''Certainly, he owes a lot to Bill,'' Mr. Lipsky said.
 Mr. Ferrer called such a suggestion silly, asserting that while he supports redevelopment of the market, he has been plain in his criticism of the Bloomberg plan. Under the plan, the developer, Related Companies, is being given tax breaks and other incentives to build a $394 million multistory mall with parking and a grassy esplanade along the river. The market's two dozen remaining tenants will be evicted, but the city and the developer have said they are looking for new locations for them. 
 Mr. Ferrer's campaign cited remarks he made at a news conference and in an interview with The Daily News in May, in which he said he saw some ''troubling issues'' with the Bloomberg plan. Mr. Ferrer also mentioned the market in a political endorsement he made several weeks ago and in an article yesterday in El Diario/La Prensa, the Spanish-language daily newspaper.
 In an interview on Friday, Mr. Ferrer said: ''I've been in favor of market redevelopment forever. But when this development was announced, the mayor said it was strictly a private deal. This is not a private deal. The city, taxpayers, have substantial sums of money invested here.''
 In an interview, Mr. Wachtel said he has had no personal involvement in the Bronx project, which he said was being handled by another partner in his firm. He said he had not spoken to Mr. Ferrer about it. Mr. Ferrer has received $96,700 in campaign contributions that were either solicited by Mr. Wachtel or came from his family or employees of his firm.
 No one disputes that the market, with its crumbling buildings, has become an eyesore or that the decisions about the future of the property near Yankee Stadium were long delayed by a legal dispute between the city and the longtime landlord, David Buntzman, to whom the city had leased the property. As borough president, Mr. Ferrer had put forward his own plan to overhaul the market, which was once one of the largest Hispanic food wholesaling operations in the country but has been in steady decline. Dozens of merchants have left in recent years.
 Given the history, many people responded enthusiastically last year when Related Companies bought out Mr. Buntzman's lease for $42.5 million as part of a three-way deal with the Bloomberg administration. Since then, though, critics have questioned whether the city's deal was too generous and whether the tenants were being treated fairly.
 The city approved a number of sweeteners for Related, including tax breaks worth at least $15 million and access to a $7 million fund for the demolition of hazardous buildings. The city developed, but later dropped, a plan to offer the company $80 million in tax-exempt bonds. The city has also promised to reimburse Related for the $42.5 million it has spent if land-use approvals necessary for the mall do not come through.
 The Bloomberg administration has defended the terms as fair and says the project will provide the Bronx with a much-needed economic boost.
 Mr. Ferrer, who campaigned in the Bronx that day, said he did not know he had been invited to join Mr. Weiner at the rally. He said he felt strongly that more should be done to address the tenants' concerns about where they will be relocated, a position that other Bronx Democrats have expresssed as well. 
 Many of the remaining tenants say they want to stay at the market, where customers are used to finding them. The city, they say, has shown them alternative sites but only ones that are inadequate or too expensive.
 ''None of the politicians have really stepped up and fought for us,'' said Omar Duarte, who operates Cuba Tropical, one of the larger produce companies at the market.

HEADLINE: Senator Will Ask Rumsfeld To Testify to Panel on Iraq

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
With lawmakers facing tough questions at home about the war in Iraq, Senator John W. Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, says he intends to summon Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld quickly for a hearing when Congress returns next week.
 Mr. Warner, a Virginia Republican who is one of the most important Congressional voices on military policy, said mounting numbers of dead and wounded Americans, the contentious process of drafting an Iraqi constitution and the economic cost of the war were adding up to new anxiety in Congress.
''The level of concern is, I think, gradually rising,'' Mr. Warner said in an interview on Friday. ''Our nation has given so much to the Iraqi people, and what are they giving us in return?'' 
 Unlike some of his colleagues in both parties, Mr. Warner said he did not see parallels between the current situation and the Vietnam era. While he said he believed that most Republican lawmakers remained strongly behind administration policy, he indicated that continuing on the same course could steadily erode Congressional backing for the war.
 ''I don't see that the Congress is going to suddenly pull back like in the days of Vietnam,'' Mr. Warner said. ''It is the desire of the Congress to continue to work with and support the administration. But there is always a tipping point.''
 He spoke as leaders of both parties acknowledged that lawmakers had heard, during the August recess, from voters unhappy with events in Iraq. The public sentiment has been reflected in polls indicating a drop in support for President Bush and his Iraq policies. The political atmosphere has also been influenced by the antiwar vigil outside Mr. Bush's ranch in Texas.
 ''I think the public is losing patience with the effort because they don't see it succeeding,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No.2 Democrat in the House. ''In fact, from their perspective, they see the attacks increasing. We haven't done what we need to do for the infrastructure in Iraq. We haven't got the economy going.''
 Appearing on ABC television on Sunday, Senator John Thune, a freshman Republican from South Dakota, acknowledged ''a certain amount of fatigue'' among the public with events in Iraq. ''And particularly, when we hear the news of casualties, people in this country don't want to hear that,'' Mr. Thune said on the program ''This Week with George Stephanopoulos.'' But he added, ''At the same time, I think we have to keep the broader purpose in mind, and that is that we are making this world safer.''
 Other allies of the administration said they saw clear signs of progress.
 ''We are talking about a constitution here that's going to be, by Middle Eastern standards, extraordinarily enlightened, that is going to be approved in all likelihood in October, and you'll have a democratic government elected in December,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the No.2 Republican in the Senate, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' 
 He noted that it had still been less than three years since Saddam Hussein was toppled. ''It took us in this country 11 years to get from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution,'' Senator McConnell said. 
 But Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a senior Democratic member of the Armed Services Committee, said the public would not be satisfied by what he called the administration's efforts to turn Iraq's constitution into a rationale for the conflict.
 ''The idea that we would be sending American servicemen over to Iraq on the basis of the Iraqis developing a new constitution is just so remote, so distant and so fallacious,'' he said in an interview.
 On the CBS program ''Face the Nation,'' Senator John McCain, who has persistently criticized the Bush administration for dispatching too few troops to Iraq, said Sunday that the Pentagon should send 15,000 to 20,000 more troops to help stabilize Iraq.
 ''I know we need more marines, we need more Special Forces, we need more linguists, we need more civil affairs people,'' he said.
 Senator Warner, who said he intended to visit Iraq soon, also said he had not formally asked for Mr. Rumsfeld to testify. 
 Mr. Warner has also said he will schedule a hearing in the next several weeks on whether the Pentagon has failed to hold senior officials and military officers responsible for the prisoner abuses that took place at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, and at other detention centers in Iraq, Cuba and Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Greenspan And The Bubble

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Most of what Alan Greenspan said at last week's conference in his honor made very good sense. But his words of wisdom come too late. He's like a man who suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then -- after the horse is gone -- delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up.
 Regular readers know that I have never forgiven the Federal Reserve chairman for his role in creating today's budget deficit. In 2001 Mr. Greenspan, a stern fiscal taskmaster during the Clinton years, gave decisive support to the Bush administration's irresponsible tax cuts, urging Congress to reduce the federal government's revenue so that it wouldn't pay off its debt too quickly. 
Since then, federal debt has soared. But as far as I can tell, Mr. Greenspan has never admitted that he gave Congress bad advice. He has, however, gone back to lecturing us about the evils of deficits.
 Now, it seems, he's playing a similar game with regard to the housing bubble. 
 At the conference, Mr. Greenspan didn't say in plain English that house prices are way out of line. But he never says things in plain English. 
 What he did say, after emphasizing the recent economic importance of rising house prices, was that ''this vast increase in the market value of asset claims is in part the indirect result of investors accepting lower compensation for risk. Such an increase in market value is too often viewed by market participants as structural and permanent.'' And he warned that ''history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low-risk premiums.'' I believe that translates as ''Beware the bursting bubble.''
 But as recently as last October Mr. Greenspan dismissed talk of a housing bubble: ''While local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances, a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely.''
 Wait, it gets worse. These days Mr. Greenspan expresses concern about the financial risks created by ''the prevalence of interest-only loans and the introduction of more-exotic forms of adjustable-rate mortgages.'' But last year he encouraged families to take on those very risks, touting the advantages of adjustable-rate mortgages and declaring that ''American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed-rate mortgage.''
 If Mr. Greenspan had said two years ago what he's saying now, people might have borrowed less and bought more wisely. But he didn't, and now it's too late. There are signs that the housing market either has peaked already or soon will. And it will be up to Mr. Greenspan's successor to manage the bubble's aftermath.
 How bad will that aftermath be? The U.S. economy is currently suffering from twin imbalances. On one side, domestic spending is swollen by the housing bubble, which has led both to a huge surge in construction and to high consumer spending, as people extract equity from their homes. On the other side, we have a huge trade deficit, which we cover by selling bonds to foreigners. As I like to say, these days Americans make a living by selling each other houses, paid for with money borrowed from China.
 One way or another, the economy will eventually eliminate both imbalances. But if the process doesn't go smoothly -- if, in particular, the housing bubble bursts before the trade deficit shrinks -- we're going to have an economic slowdown, and possibly a recession. In fact, a growing number of economists are using the ''R'' word for 2006.
 And here's where Mr. Greenspan is still saying foolish things. In his closing remarks he suggested that ''an end to the housing boom could induce a significant rise in the personal saving rate, a decline in imports and a corresponding improvement in the current account deficit.'' Translation, I think: the end of the housing bubble will automatically cure the trade deficit, too.
 Sorry, but no. A housing slowdown will lead to the loss of many jobs in construction and service industries but won't have much direct effect on the trade deficit. So those jobs won't be replaced by new jobs elsewhere until and unless something else, like a plunge in the value of the dollar, makes U.S. goods more competitive on world markets, leading to higher exports and lower imports.
 So there's a rough ride ahead for the U.S. economy. And it's partly Mr. Greenspan's fault.

HEADLINE: America and the U.N.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 John R. Bolton, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, has objected to important sections of the draft of reforms for the United Nations (news article, Aug. 25).
You report that two of the Bush administration's objections are to support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and a pledge to devote 0.7 percent of gross national product to development.
 The United States was the chief proponent of the test ban treaty, which has helped slow the numbers and types of nuclear weapons developed. President Bill Clinton signed it in 1996, and a policy to embrace it, not undermine it, would encourage nonproliferation. Considering that we've spent billions of dollars to prevent proliferation in Iraq, it's worth doing it right globally, for a much more modest price.
 Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other European allies have strongly supported committing just 0.7 percent of gross national product to aid emerging countries and their people. Such an investment could greatly help relieve world poverty, drought and the global spread of epidemics.

HEADLINE: After Centuries of 'Controlling' Land, Gulf Residents Learn Who's Really the Boss

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN and ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The Gulf Coast has always been vulnerable to coastal storms, but over the years people have made things worse, particularly in Louisiana, where Hurricane Katrina struck yesterday. Since the 18th century, when French colonial administrators required land claimants to establish ownership by building levees along bayous, streams and rivers, people have been trying to dominate the region's landscape and the forces of its nature.
 As long as people could control floods, they could do business. But, as people learned too late, the landscape of South Louisiana depends on floods: it is made of loose Mississippi River silt, and the ground subsides as this silt consolidates. Only regular floods of muddy water can replenish the sediment and keep the landscape above water. But flood control projects channel the river's nourishing sediment to the end of the birdfoot delta and out into the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico. 
Although early travelers realized the irrationality of building a port on shifting mud in an area regularly ravaged by storms and disease, the opportunities to make money overrode all objections. 
 When most transport was by water, people would of course settle along the Mississippi River, and of course they would build a port city near its mouth. In the 20th century, when oil and gas fields were developed in the gulf, of course people added petrochemical refineries and factories to the river mix, convenient to both drillers and shippers. To protect it all, they built an elaborate system of levees, dams, spillways and other installations. 
 As one 19th-century traveler put it, according to Ari Kelman, an environmental historian at the University of California, Davis, ''New Orleans is surprising evidence of what men will endure, when cheered by the hopes of an ever-flowing tide of dollars and cents.''
 In the last few decades, more and more people have realized what a terrible bargain the region made when it embraced -- unwittingly, perhaps -- environmental degradation in exchange for economic gains.
 Abby Sallenger, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey who has studied the Louisiana landscape for years, sees the results of this bargain when he makes his regular flights over the Gulf Coast or goes by boat to one of the string of sandy barrier islands that line the state's coast.
 The islands are the region's first line of defense against hurricane waves and storm surges. Marshes, which can normally absorb storm water, are its second.
 But, starved of sediment, the islands have shrunk significantly in recent decades. And though the rate of the marshes' loss has slowed somewhat, they are still disappearing, ''almost changing before your eyes,'' as Dr. Sallenger put it in a telephone interview from his office in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''Grassland turns into open water, ponds turn into lakes.'' 
 Without the fine sediment that nourishes marshes and the coarser sediment that feeds eroding barrier islands, ''the entire delta region is sinking,'' he said. In effect, he said, it is suffering a rise in sea level of about a centimeter -- about a third of an inch -- a year, 10 times the average rate globally.
 ''Some of the future projections of sea level rise elsewhere in the country due to global warming would approach what we presently see in Louisiana,'' Dr. Sallenger said.
 Hurricane Katrina was a strong storm, Category 4, when it came ashore east of New Orleans, near a string of barriers called the Chandeleur Islands. ''They were already vulnerable, extremely so,'' Dr. Sallenger said.
 He said he and his colleagues were reviewing photos, radar images and other measurements made of the islands after Hurricane Lili, a Category 2 hurricane that passed over them in 2002. 
 ''The degree of change in that storm was extreme,'' he said. ''So we had a discussion this morning: O.K., if Lili can do this, who knows what Katrina is going to do?'' The scientists expect to fly over the coast on Wednesday and find out.
 Of course, New Orleans is vulnerable to flooding from the Mississippi River as well as from coastal storms. North of the city, the Army Corps of Engineers has marked out several places where the levees would be deliberately breached in the event of a potentially disastrous river flood threat, sending water instead into uninhabited ''spillways.''
 But there is no way to stop a hurricane storm surge from thundering over a degraded landscape -- except, perhaps, by restoring the landscape to let the Mississippi flow over it more often.
 Some small efforts are being made. For example, at the Old River Control Structure, an installation of dams, turbines and other facilities just north of Baton Rouge that keeps the Mississippi on its established path, workers collect sediment that piles along the dams and cart it by truck into the marshes. 
 But truly letting the river run would exact unacceptably heavy costs -- costs that would be paid immediately by people in the region and in particular by any politician rash enough to endorse such a plan.
 Instead, there continue to be efforts to build more capacity into New Orleans flood control efforts, said Craig E. Colten, a geographer at Louisiana State University and the author of a new book, ''An Unnatural Metropolis: Wresting New Orleans From Nature'' (Louisiana State University Press, 2005). That will mean ever more costs, Mr. Colten said, given that the city, which is below sea level, must run pumps simply to keep from being flooded in an ordinary rainstorm. 
 Roy K. Dokka, a geologist at Louisiana State, said flooding would be even worse for decades to come, not just in New Orleans but in the entire Gulf Coast region. 
 The consequences were clear yesterday, Dr. Dokka said, around Port Fourchon, La., where the single road that is the commuting route for oil workers heading to offshore rigs lay under water. ''That road that all the roughnecks and oil workers drive down every day has sunk a foot in 20 years,'' he said. ''It's now under water every time there's a significant south wind blowing.''
 But as Dr. Kelman said: ''Once you've invested enough in urban infrastructure, you have to keep on buying in. And that doesn't even count the cultural dimension.'' The reference was to the region's cuisine, culture and mystique.
 ''With billions of dollars sunk into the soil in southern Louisiana and the Gulf Coast,'' Dr. Kelman said, ''it's kind of too late. We're there, and we're staying there.''

HEADLINE: Insurers Estimate Damage at $9 Billion, Among Costliest U.S. Storms on Record

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
Insurance companies said yesterday that damage from Hurricane Katrina could top $9 billion, making it one of the costliest storms on record. 
 While the extent of the damages will not be known for days, estimates yesterday from insurers ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion -- down from $15 billion to $30 billion on Sunday.
Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, said: ''While financially painful, the storm will not put any insurers or reinsurers under financial duress. They will be able to pay all these claims.'' 
 Hurricane Andrew, which ravaged parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, ranks as the costliest hurricane in American history, with nearly $21 billion in insured losses, in 2004 dollars, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Last year, four hurricanes -- Charley, Ivan, Frances and Jeanne -- combined to register almost $23 billion in losses in the Southeast, mostly in Florida. Hurricane Charley was the most costly of the four, with about $7.5 billion in damages.
 Since last year, insurance rates for Florida homeowners have increased 15 to 30 percent, Mr. Hartwig said. Rates have risen along coastal areas of the Southeast for several years to cover what meteorologists expect to be more frequent and more intense hurricanes in the next two decades. 
 ''It's too early to talk about potential losses,'' said Ray Stone, vice president for catastrophe operations at St. Paul Travelers. ''But compared to yesterday's prediction of a 175-mile-per-hour storm making a beeline for New Orleans, we're breathing a sigh of relief.''
 Financial analysts said the insurance industry was financially capable of handling the claims. The domestic industry has a capital base of more than a $400 billion, said Peter C. Streit, a property and casualty insurance analyst at the Williams Capital Group, which should inoculate it from bankruptcies and the need to tap the capital markets for supplemental financing. 
 ''They're in much better shape than they were just a couple of years ago,'' Mr. Streit said. 
 Another analyst agreed, and noted that the lack of a sharp sell-off in insurance stocks suggested that traders were confident that providers would be more than capable of handling claims from Hurricane Katrina.
 ''From a trading perspective, if the scenes started to look horrific, that could cause panic in the group,'' said the analyst, Clifford Gallant of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''But we're not seeing that -- the market is acting pretty rationally.''
 Eqecat, a risk management firm in Oakland, Calif., that was predicting damages of $9 billion to $16 billion as of yesterday, said damages would have been higher if the storm had not veered east of New Orleans. 
 ''New Orleans missed a worst-case scenario,'' the company president, Richard L. Clinton, said. ''It's still going to be impacted significantly.''
 Mr. Clinton said a large amount of the damage would be related to business losses from oil production operations in the Gulf of Mexico.

HEADLINE: Japan's Post Offices: Full-Service Political Battlefields 

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: JOETSU, Japan 

 BODY:
Koichi Nakashima is the fourth generation of his family to own and run the post office in Maki, a village deep in the mountains near here on Japan's rural west coast and a battleground in the general election in September.
 As his forefathers did, Mr. Nakashima, 59, handles the villagers' mail and savings. His workers will even collect money and packages if villagers are too busy to visit the post office. ''We know each other and they trust us,'' Mr. Nakashima said. 
 Japan's post offices, which have deep roots throughout the country, have grown into the world's largest financial institution, Japan Post, with $3 trillion in assets. But they have also played another, little understood role here, serving as the bedrock of Japan's postwar political structure and the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party's machine.
 Another indicator of that role played itself out early in August when Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi abruptly dissolved Parliament after rebellious members of his own party rejected his bill to privatize the postal services. Calling an election for Sept. 11, a year ahead of schedule, Mr. Koizumi compared opponents of privatization to reactionaries who insist that the Earth revolves around the Sun.
 ''Even after Galileo was found guilty of heresy, he still said, 'The Earth moves,''' Mr. Koizumi said.
 Whether Mr. Koizumi will be remembered as the Galileo of Japanese politics remains to be seen. But what is clear is that the election in September -- as much a referendum on the future of the 134-year-old postal system as on Mr. Koizumi's leadership -- will present voters with two different visions of government in Japan.
 Mr. Koizumi said the ''privatization of the post office is the first step toward the reconstruction of Japan's politics and economy.'' 
 It is also an attempt to wean his party from its core support in rural areas, which have declined in population and are less politically significant than before, and make it relevant to urban voters who have been gravitating to the main opposition Democratic Party. 
 But to opponents, the postal system has sustained Japan's cherished egalitarianism over an American-style, market-driven economy. 
 The approaching election has already set off a feud in the Liberal Democratic Party, which has held a grip on power for all but 10 months in the last half-century. Rebellious party members have felt the wrath of Mr. Koizumi, who has been sending high-profile challengers -- called ''assassins'' -- into their constituencies to unseat them.
 Under Mr. Koizumi's privatization plan, Japan Post would be split into four companies in 2007, and its savings and life insurance services would be privatized in 2017. Mr. Koizumi has often cited Japan Post as an example of bloat, pointing out that it has more employees, 262,000, than Japan's military, which has 239,000. Of the nation's 24,700 post offices, 19,000 are owned and operated by so-called special postmasters, often as family businesses handed down from father to son.
 ''If I have to run this office based on market principles, I'd have to close it down,'' said Toshio Hinode, 55, a special postmaster who owns the Tanihama branch in Joetsu, in Niigata Prefecture. ''It wouldn't be viable.'' 
 In the Maki branch, which was owned by the Kondo family for four generations before the Nakashimas took it over, the 10 employees provide more than just postal services. The workers respond to villagers' requests to break a 10,000-yen bill, about $90. They deliver pensions in cash and may even drop by with loan money, though such transactions usually have to be carried out at the post office. 
 ''If the depositor is bedridden,'' Mr. Nakashima said, ''we'd do that for the person and make sure everything is all right.''
 With those and other services, Japan Post is actually providing a form of welfare, especially in rural areas with aging populations. 
 In Itakura, in Niigata, Makie Miyakoshi, 75, who works a small plot of farmland, tells of a housebound neighbor living far from the local post office. ''Since her legs are weak,'' Mrs. Miyakoshi said, ''the post office workers come to her house and pack up the stuff she wants to send.''
 Postal savings accounts have also earned the trust of Japanese, with 85 percent of households holding such deposits. The assets allowed Japan's leaders to finance national projects, from the war effort before 1945 to the country's postwar high growth. 
 It was Kakuei Tanaka, postwar Japan's most powerful prime minister and a native of Niigata, who put the money held by the post office to use as a huge slush fund for the Liberal Democrats, said Kent Calder, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. First as postal minister in the 1950's and then as prime minister in the 1970's, Mr. Calder said, Mr. Tanaka protected postal services from oversight from other ministries, so the Liberal Democrats could freely use the assets to reward their backers. 
 Small businesses that pledged to back the Liberal Democrats were given loans with no collateral and low interest rates from postal services -- as long as they had the endorsement of their member of Parliament. Japanese could also take loans up to 90 percent of their deposits at low rates. Special postmasters, as influential members of their communities, played a crucial role by acting as vote-gatherers for the Liberal Democrats.
 Hirokuni Tanaka, 76, chairman of the national Retired Special Postmasters Association, said each branch of the association had a formal relationship, including financial support, with the local chapter of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
 His association recently announced that it would no longer support the Liberal Democrats, though it would give local chapters the freedom to decide.
 Mr. Calder said of the former prime minister, Mr. Tanaka: ''This was Tanaka's heritage. It is akin to Socialism. Japan is the only Socialist country that worked, it's sometimes said. But Koizumi says it's no longer working and that's why he's serious about privatizing it.''
 The defenders of the system say it fostered egalitarianism by giving small businesses and individuals in areas like this one access to capital. To them, Mr. Koizumi's reforms and implicit vision of a new Japan are unsettling.
 ''American efficiency has its merits,'' said Mr. Hinode, the special postmaster. ''But I wonder if it is necessary to introduce it to such an extent that we'll end up losing our Japanese culture.'''

 CORRECTION:
An article on August 30 about efforts to privatize Japan's postal savings system misstated a remark by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi about opponents of the plan. He said they are like reactionaries who insist that the Sun revolves around the Earth, not that the Earth revolves around the Sun.

HEADLINE: Another Storm Casualty: Oil Prices

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and SIMON ROMERO; Jad Mouawad reported from New York for this article and Simon Romero from Houston. Reporting was contributed by Anne E. Kornblut in El Mirage, Ariz.; Micheline Maynard in Detroit; and Vikas Bajaj in New York.

 BODY:
The region that produces and refines a major portion of the nation's oil and natural gas was largely shut down by Hurricane Katrina yesterday, further tightening strained energy markets and sending prices to new highs. 
 As oil companies evacuated offshore operations throughout the Gulf of Mexico, oil production in that region was reduced by 92 percent and gas output was cut by 83 percent. 
 The latest interruptions in oil supplies are likely to send retail gasoline prices even higher than the current average of $2.60 a gallon. They have prompted the Bush administration to say it would release emergency oil stocks from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed.
''We are still in the soap-opera phase where everyone is still wondering what is going on,'' said Dan Pickering, the president of Pickering Energy Partners, a Houston-based energy research firm. ''The next 24 to 48 hours, as the companies get out to see if there has been any damage, are really going to determine how significant this is.'' 
 Halfway through the hurricane season, the storm hit at an especially bad time for consumers, who have seen gasoline prices climb to their highest level in a generation, and adds to worries that oil prices might be hurting the American economy. 
 Hurricane Katrina could result in insured damages of more than $9 billion, making it perhaps the costliest storm since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, according to Risk Management Solutions, which assesses catastrophes and is based in Newark, Calif. The storm disrupted maritime traffic and trade, as well as caused losses at port and shipping facilities. 
 Crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $67.20 a barrel yesterday, up 1.6 percent, after touching a high of $70.80 a barrel in earlier electronic trading. 
 Natural gas futures soared 11 percent after operations at a major hub in Louisiana were temporarily halted. They closed at $10.85 a thousand cubic feet, after reaching a high of $12.07. Disruptions at refineries also pushed futures for gasoline and heating oil to record highs on Nymex. Gasoline contracts closed up 6.9 percent at $2.06 a gallon while heating oil gained 3.9 percent, to $1.91 a gallon.
 Producers are currently pumping as much oil as they can and have little spare capacity left to make up for any shortages. While that leaves no margin for major disruptions from hurricanes and other disasters, most analysts cautioned that it would be days before a full assessment of the damage to pipelines, refineries and offshore platforms was completed. 
 The Gulf of Mexico, which produces 27 percent of the nation's oil and a fifth of its natural gas, is dotted with nearly 4,000 platforms linked by 33,000 miles of underwater pipelines. Over the weekend, oil companies withdrew their workers from 615 platforms and 96 drilling rigs in the gulf.
 Oil production was reduced by about 1.4 million barrels yesterday and gas production by 8.3 billion cubic feet, according to the Minerals Management Service, a unit of the Department of the Interior. Since Friday, oil output has been cut by a total of 3.1 million barrels. Along the coast, at least nine refineries were closed in anticipation of the storm. These have a total refining capacity of about two million barrels a day, or 10 percent of the nation's refining output.
 Oil companies now have to wait until heavy winds and rain die down before they can dispatch helicopters to survey their deepwater facilities and get an idea of the destruction. That is unlikely to happen before today at the earliest. But in one of the earliest indications of the damage from the storm, Royal Dutch Shell said that tracking devices onboard two offshore drilling rigs showed that they had shifted out of location yesterday. The rigs are contracted to Shell and owned by two companies, Nobel and Transocean. Shell, the company with the largest operations in the Gulf of Mexico, also said yesterday that it would dispatch an aircraft to review the status of its assets in the area.
 Valero, the nation's largest independent refiner, indicated that it might be two weeks before it could restart its St. Charles refinery in Louisiana. The refinery was under three feet of water and sustained ''minor damage'' to its cooling tower, the company said.
 Hurricane Katrina is the most severe storm to affect the oil industry since Hurricane Ivan tore through the gulf last September. That storm destroyed seven offshore platforms and cut 7 percent of the region's yearly oil production and 4 percent of its total gas output. It also caused huge damage to the underwater pipeline network, requiring as much as six months to repair. 
 The ability of refineries to resume production quickly will be another factor likely to weigh on oil markets this week. The largest refinery shut by the storm has a capacity of 493,500 barrels of oil a day and is run by Exxon Mobil in Baton Rouge.
 ''The crunch is on refineries,'' said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, an oil consultancy in Washington. ''Restarting a refinery is a very delicate operation. These things can blow up. They are complicated, old and cranky.
 ''If refineries don't start by Wednesday or Thursday, the stock draw is going to be dramatic,'' he said. ''Already, gasoline stocks are low. This will further tighten the market.'' 
 The storm forced the temporary closing of crucial oil terminals, including the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest oil-importing port in the United States. The shutdown, which also stopped pipeline deliveries of oil from the port, could prevent about a tenth of the nation's oil imports from reaching refineries.
 To make up for any shortfall in supplies, the Department of Energy said yesterday that it would consider lending crude oil from the nation's emergency stockpiles if refiners asked for it. So far, no such call has been made.
 Last year, after Hurricane Ivan disrupted production, the Energy Department agreed to lend more than five million barrels to refiners from the strategic reserve, which currently stocks 700 million barrels. 
 President Bush alluded to the energy situation today during a appearance in El Mirage, Ariz., where he was speaking on Medicare. 
 ''You just got to understand that the situation we got ourselves into, dependency on foreign sources of oil, took a while to get there, and it's going to take a while to become less dependent,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 Senate Democrats have pressed the president to use the reserve to help bring prices down. 
 ''If there was ever a time for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped, it would be now,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. 
 In response to the storm -- and rising prices -- Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said his country, the world's top oil producer, would make sure no one would run out of oil.
 ''Saudi Arabia stands ready to increase crude oil production immediately to 11 million barrels per day and sustain that level to replace any shortages in the crude oil market,'' Mr. al-Naimi said in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency. ''We continue to be in close contact with all our customers, especially, those in the U.S., to assist them with any shortfall in oil supplies.''
 Refineries might prove more resilient in recovering from the storm than other energy infrastructure, like undersea pipelines or floating oil and natural gas platforms, according to some refining experts. 
 ''This was a big and severe storm and it hit where a substantial portion of our production and refining capacity is concentrated,'' said Edward H. Murphy, the general downstream sector manager for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group. ''Refineries are built to withstand storms.''
 Almost all refineries in the Gulf Coast area were designed for protection from very high winds, according to S. Frank Culberson, chief executive of the Rimkus Consulting Group, a forensic consulting company that examines energy installations after they are hit by natural disasters. 
 ''Usually the refineries fare pretty well, as long as they batten down the hatches and wait it out,'' Mr. Culberson said. ''There might be damage to some storage or marginal operations, but the main refining units should remain shut down only temporarily.''
 Some airlines were also concerned about the rising premium they have to pay for jet fuel. Airports in a swath from Atlanta to Dulles outside Washington depend, at least in part, on one refinery in Memphis. Some analysts said that with the Louisiana terminal closed and imports curtailed, the refinery might run out of crude oil stocks within the next couple of days. 
 Even part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana was shut down, with workers in New Orleans evacuated and operations in Bayou Choctaw, where 72 million barrels of oil are stored near Baton Rouge, closed and evacuated. Other locations of the reserve, in Texas and Louisiana, remained in operation yesterday, the Department of Energy said. 
 Oil refinery officials, meanwhile, remained cautious yesterday as they waited for an opportunity to send employees back to Louisiana to assess the effects of the storm. Mindy West, a spokeswoman for Murphy Oil of El Dorado, Ark., which operates a refinery in Meraux, La., with normal capacity to process 125,000 barrels of oil a day, said that today would be the earliest the company could examine the refinery. 
 Adam E. Sieminski, the chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank in New York, said: ''The real story is not going to be known until workers can get back on the platforms and assess the damage. Are the platforms still there? Have they been damaged? Are the pipelines still there? Have they moved?''

HEADLINE: Escaping Feared Knockout Punch, Barely, New Orleans Is One Lucky Big Mess 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The oak tree crashed through Terry Milton's bedroom ceiling just before dawn on Monday. Then Mr. Milton opened the front door on his old brick house and a waist-high wall of water nearly knocked him down.
 He yelled to his fiancee, his best friend and six relatives to get out of the house. Then he rousted his sister and three others next door. 
With thrashing tree limbs whipping them around and floodwater surging over eastern New Orleans, the women and children clambered into a boat that a neighbor had left behind. Mr. Milton and the other men clung to the side. As they rounded a corner, crying for help, three people on a second-floor balcony being lapped by the water pulled them to relative safety. But their ordeal was not over.
 The hurricane was just starting and through most of the day the flood waters rose and fell, rose and fell, threatening to inundate the house. The building shook and quivered in the staggering, gusting wind.
 ''I thought I was going to lose my life,'' Mr. Milton said.
 By late afternoon, the city police and rescuers had begun venturing out to look for stranded victims of Hurricane Katrina; no one knew how many people were in trouble. The worst damage in the city was thought to be in Mr. Milton's neighborhood, a mostly poor area known as the Lower Ninth Ward.
 Downtown New Orleans and the French Quarter appeared to have been spared as the eye of the powerful storm passed just east of the city. Dire predictions of 20-foot-deep toxic rivers running in the streets and huge buildings coming apart did not materialize. 
 Instead, most of the city was left fairly in disarray, with trees and branches and power lines down, canvas awnings and store signs lost, and some streets under a foot or two of water. A huge chunk of the white rubbery fabric that covers the Superdome arena was torn away and thousands of people who had taken shelter there were soaked, but none were hurt, the authorities said.
 Hundreds of windows were blown out in some of the big hotels, office buildings and condominiums, and scores of cars, parked on the streets, were flooded and left with broken glass. But many big buildings lost only a few windows or, in some cases, it appeared, none at all.
 The French Quarter was a mess of torn tree limbs and shrubs, and a smattering of broken roofs and masonry. But Galatoire's, the famous French restaurant, seemed barely touched and there was no sign of serious harm at the equally renowned Cafe du Monde, nearby.
 Palm trees along the center of Canal Street were uprooted and a few street-level shops were ripped open by the wind. All over town traffic signals lay on the ground.
 Even with much less destruction than expected, though, the cost of repairs could easily run into the billions. Recovery will take months. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost electricity, city officials said, and it may take weeks for some of them to get it back.
 Two hospitals, Charity Hospital and Baptist Hospital, were heavily damaged, said Deputy Fire Chief Joseph R. Matthews, who is also the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management. On Camp Street at Gravier, the brick facade came loose from an old four-story building, burying a beige Land Rover and a white Pontiac.
 Throughout the city scattered houses and condominiums were torn up. Some lost roofs. Others simply collapsed. Fires broke out and burned wildly even in the torrential rain, some of them ignited, the authorities said, as people used candles so they could see.
 An entire wall of a five-story condominium in the Algiers section, just across the Mississippi River, was torn off. Somehow none of the dozen or so people still staying there were hurt, the authorities said.
 During the storm, scores of desperate calls for help poured into the emergency operations center in a vaultlike section of City Hall. They were recorded with mechanical self-control by operators who usually handle 911 lines.
 ''Residence has collapsed,'' one operator said as she passed the information to supervisors shortly after 7 a.m. ''Flooding inside.''
 ''Female unable to breathe; she is oxygen-dependent,'' she reported a few minutes later.
 ''House on fire,'' the woman said, after her next call.
 Moments later: ''Another fire.''
 ''Two males on a roof, water rising.''
 ''Water up to windows,'' she reported after another call. ''People screaming that I'm drowning.''
 ''Elderly couple in a building,'' she said. ''Roof came off.''
 So it went through the day, but all the authorities could do was note the location and urge people to hang on.
 ''We couldn't send our officers out in the storm,'' Chief Matthews said later. ''We couldn't put them at risk.''
 The winds died down enough by midafternoon for rescuers to head toward the Lower Ninth Ward in shallow-draft boats. 
 Already a struggling neighborhood, it is even worse off now. Officials said a levee protecting the area may have succumbed, though residents thought the flooding might have been a surge from the Gulf of Mexico.
 As night fell more than 200 people from the area clustered along the side of the St. Cloud Bridge, drying out after they were saved from the balconies, roofs and attics of submerged houses.
 Qiana Mack, 28, who is unemployed, and her partner, Jonathan Sylvester, 22, a day laborer, had awakened at 8 a.m., surrounded by water. ''Our bed was floating,'' Ms. Mack said. ''We swam out a window to a neighbor's porch, then got into her attic.''
 But after four hours, the attic was flooding. ''We knocked out a vent and crawled through that to get to the roof,'' Ms. Mack said. The couple stayed balanced on the peak of the roof, the only thing sticking out of the water, for four hours.
 ''They couldn't get a boat close to us,'' Ms. Mack said. ''So they threw us life preservers and scuba divers helped us swim to the boat.''
 Dion Richardson, who dragged Terry Milton and the others onto her second-story porch, said that like many of the others, she ignored warnings to evacuate because she thought Hurricane Katrina would be ''another false alarm.''
 ''We evacuated last year for Hurricane Ivan,'' she said, ''and nothing happened.''
 Mr. Milton, 26, gets along on disability payments from Social Security. His fiancee, Alison Berryhill, works as a parking lot cashier. ''We lost everything,'' Ms. Berryhill said.
 Harvey Lewis, 35, a security guard, and his wife, Didra, 33, and their four children headed for Texas Saturday night in their van. But the van began heating up and they decided to return home.
 As the flood engulfed the family Monday, Mr. Lewis hoisted the children onto the top of a free-standing closet in their bedroom. Then he and his wife climbed up, too.
 They were rescued after sitting up there for hours as the winds hammered their house, worrying that they would never get out. ''We held hands and prayed,'' Mr. Lewis said.

HEADLINE: HURRICANE SLAMS INTO GULF COAST; DOZENS ARE DEAD 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and KATE ZERNIKE; Joseph B. Treaster reported from New Orleans for this article, and Kate Zernike from Montgomery, Ala. Reporting was contributed by Abby Goodnough in Mobile, Ala.; Michael M. Luo in New York; James Dao in Hattiesburg., Miss.; Jeremy Alford in Baton Rouge, La.; Ralph Blumenthal in Hammond, La.; and Diane Allen in Diamondhead, Miss.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf Coast with devastating force at daybreak on Monday, sparing New Orleans the catastrophic hit that had been feared but inundating parts of the city and heaping damage on neighboring Mississippi, where it killed dozens, ripped away roofs and left coastal roads impassable.
 Officials said that according to preliminary reports, there were at least 55 deaths, with 50 alone in Harrison County, Miss., which includes Gulfport and Biloxi. Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings.
Jim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway. 
 Packing 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center. 
 The storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record.
 In New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees took shelter.
 Some of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable.
 ''It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks,'' Gov. Haley Barbour said at a midday news conference ''It's a terrible storm.'' 
 President Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses.
 In Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority, but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest-hit areas.
 The governors sent out the police and the National Guard after reports of looting, and officials in some parts of Louisiana said they would impose a curfew. 
 Hurricane Katrina was downgraded from Category 5 -- the most dangerous storm -- to Category 4 as it hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m., and in New Orleans officials said the storm's slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat. The city is below sea level, and there had been predictions that the historic French Quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water. 
 Still, no one was finding much comfort here, with 100 m.p.h. winds and water surges of up to 15 feet. Officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled.
 ''I can't say that we've escaped the worst,'' Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. ''I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city. We don't even know what the worst is.''
 Preliminary damage estimates from the hurricane -- which raked across southern Florida last week as a Category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and making its run at the Gulf Coast -- ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion. Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier -- with nearly $21 billion in insured losses.
 Beyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds, Hurricane Katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region. Both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the Mississippi Gulf Coast shut down on Sunday as the storm approached. 
 Since Friday, oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has been cut by 3.1 million barrels. Closing the casinos cost Mississippi $400,000 to $500,000 a day in lost tax revenue alone, and Mr. Barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos.
 The storm pounded New Orleans for eight hours straight. Flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown. On the southern shore of the lake, entire neighborhoods of one-story homes were flooded to the rooflines, with nearby off-ramps for Interstate 10 looking like boat ramps amid the waves. 
 Along the lake were snapped telephone poles, trees blocking roads and live wires scattered over the roads. In one cabin, a family was cooking a chicken dinner over charcoal briquettes on a hibachi. They had lost power like everyone else in the area.
 Windows were blown off condominiums, hotels, office buildings and Charity Hospital, sending chards of glass into the winds. Fires broke out despite torrential rain, some ignited, the authorities said, by residents who lighted candles after the electricity went out.
 The storm knocked out telephone and cellular service across swaths of the gulf region, and officials in New Orleans said parts of the city could remain without power for weeks.
 Two nuclear plants near the path of Hurricane Katrina appear to have weathered the storm without major damage, and a third shut down on Saturday, in anticipation of the hurricane, according to Entergy Nuclear, which owns all three. The extent of damage to the plant that shut down, Waterford, 20 miles west of New Orleans, was still unknown late Monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look, said Diane Park, a spokeswoman.
 The more sparsely populated parishes east of New Orleans, meanwhile, got hit much harder than anyone had expected.
 Ms. Blanco said Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson and St. Tammany Parishes had been ''devastated by high winds and floodwaters.'' In St. Bernard, the emergency center was submerged, and officials estimated that 40,000 homes, too, were flooded. 
 Parish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their roofs. 
 Officials estimated 80 percent of New Orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate. But in areas that had been expecting less damage, officials were worried -- and annoyed -- that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm.
 In Plaquemines and Terrebonne Parishes, south and west of the city, officials said they were particularly concerned about commercial fisherman who had decided to remain on their boats.
 ''My biggest concern is the loss of life,'' said State Senator Walter J. Boasso. ''We have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics, and I don't know if we will get to them fast enough.''
 In Mississippi, Mr. Barbour said many people suffered from what he called ''hurricane fatigue,'' deciding not to evacuate this time after having done so in the past only to be spared.
 ''We pray that those people are O.K.,'' he said. ''But we don't know.''
 In Diamondhead, Miss., Don Haller and his 17-year-old son, Don Jr., were left clinging to the remains of their house when a 23-foot surge of water hit it, flexing the roof like a deck of cards. 
 They had decided against evacuating, Mr. Haller said, judging the storm ''just a lot of rain.''
 ''We rode the house,'' Mr. Haller said, emerging from the waters here, his son carrying their dachshund, Kuddles.
 Mr. Barbour said casinos along the coast near Biloxi and Gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet. But casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage, he said, because U.S. 90 had ''essentially been destroyed.'' 
 Along the coast in Mobile, Ala., 150 miles east of New Orleans, thousands of evacuees from Mississippi and Louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open.
 The lowest-lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin Counties in Alabama were evacuated on Sunday night. By noon, areas south of Interstate 10 were already flooding, and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of Mobile and Mobile Bay as the hurricane progressed. 
 Downtown Mobile, which is right on the bay, was severely flooded by Monday afternoon, the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the Mobile Museum. Water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters, and large, heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets.
 The main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding, causing concerns that they, too, would be flooded, at least in the main floors. And as power and phone lines went down, evacuees were getting restless.
 Paul Weir said he had not left his home in Meraux, La., just outside New Orleans, during a storm since Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and left on Sunday morning only after hearing that Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5. He drove with his wife, daughter and four friends to Mobile; with roads clogged with other residents fleeing, what is normally a three-hour drive took 12. 
 By Monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find when they got home.
 ''If I was home, I would've went on a roof for two days just like everybody else,'' said Susan Weir, Mr. Weir's wife, said. ''I'd rather be in that situation than here, honestly. This is expensive and I've only got a credit card with a $2,000 limit.'' 
 At the Ramada Hotel in downtown Mobile, Edith Frieson sat anxiously in a soggy room wondering why her husband had not returned. ''He left maybe three hours ago to go down and see if he could check the house,'' said Mrs. Frieson, who lives on Dauphin Island, a narrow barrier island south of Mobile. The island was already flooding on Sunday afternoon.
 Like most storms, Hurricane Katrina weakened as it came onshore, and by Monday evening the National Hurricane Center had downgraded it to a tropical storm. The center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward Jackson, Miss.
 But state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one, causing a wide swath of damage, and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks.
 In Louisiana, Ms. Blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back.
 ''The roads are flooded, the power is out, the phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down,'' she said.
 ''Wherever you live, it is still too dangerous for people to return home,'' she continued. ''If you evacuated and you're in a shelter, if you're with friends and family, please, please stay there. Stay safe.''
 Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed. 
 ''Be careful,'' Mr. Brown said, standing next to the governor at a news conference. ''Don't get in that water. Watch for downed power lines. If you're going to use a chainsaw, know how to use a chainsaw. If you're going to have a generator, know how to exercise and operate the generator. Be very, very careful. The storm is not over.'' 
 Mr. Brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked.
 Even before the hurricane hit the New Orleans area, FEMA had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region. It also delivered generators, and stockpiles of water, ice and ready-to-eat meals. It even sent in two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals. 
 As of early Monday, about 52,000 people were in 240 shelters in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida and Texas, with the majority in the Superdome in New Orleans.

HEADLINE: Shares Rally as Oil Prices Pull Back From Early Surge 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street rallied yesterday after Hurricane Katrina weakened, easing concerns about refinery failures along the Gulf of Mexico and pulling oil prices back from record highs.
 Stocks opened lower but quickly rebounded as crude oil futures cooled after surging past $70 a barrel in early trading on news that the storm shut down about 8 percent of the nation's refining capacity.
A barrel of light crude settled at $67.20, up $1.07 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Investors found some relief in reports that President Bush was mulling whether to offset the supply disruption with oil from the nation's petroleum reserve, but energy and insurance stocks still came under pressure as the market tried to gauge the hurricane's financial impact. 
 Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer for PNC Advisers, said the market had braced for the storm's blow and started looking elsewhere for direction after the Gulf Coast got ''hit full force and survived.''
 ''It's not likely this is going to have a significant impact on growth,'' Mr. Dunigan said. ''If it's not going to have a significant impact on energy, we're still in pretty good shape.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 65.76 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 10,463.05. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 7.18 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,212.28, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 16.88 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,137.65.
 While declining issues outpaced advancers through most of the session, the market shifted in afternoon trading and finished with advancers leading decliners by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Much of Wall Street's advance came late in the day, as the hurricane gradually diminished to a Category 1 storm. With the storm passing through the heart of the nation's oil and gas infrastructure, the market weighed a spike in energy prices against the potential for long-term production disruptions.
 The storm forced the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port -- the nation's largest import terminal -- to evacuate workers and stop unloading ships over the weekend. 
 ''Clearly it's going to have some impact on the market if there is damage that will keep the port closed,'' said John Caldwell, chief investment strategist for McDonald Financial Group.
 Exxon Mobil gained as much as 83 cents in morning activity but ended the day up a penny at $58.42, while Chevron rose 13 cents, to $59.51, and BP added 23 cents, to $66.35. 
 Halliburton, the offshore drilling contractor, jumped 54 cents, to $57.80.
 Home Depot and Lowe's also advanced on optimism that consumers spent more at the home improvement stores as they readied for the hurricane and that they would be buying materials to repair storm damage. Home Depot climbed 73 cents, to $40.54, and Lowe's rose $1.42, to $64.60.
 Insurance stocks, however, took a hit after early projections pegged storm losses at $9 billion to $16 billion, which would rank Katrina among the nation's most costly storms. Allstate dropped 77 cents, to $57.18, and RenaissanceRe Holdings fell 73 cents, to $45.52.
 Elsewhere on the market, acquisitions lifted individual stocks higher. PanAmSat Holding agreed to be acquired by the privately held Intelsat for $3.2 billion in cash, forming the world's biggest commercial satellite fleet. The $25-a-share offer is a 25 percent premium to PanAmSat's closing price of $19.80 on Friday. PanAmSat surged $4, or 20.2 percent, to $23.80.
 Per-Se Technologies and the Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer said that they were buying NDCHealth, a maker of software for processing health care claims and prescription data, in separate deals totaling about $1 billion. Per-Se declined 59 cents, to $19.45, while NDC added $1.18, to reach $18.95.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to a price of 100 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.17 percent from 4.18 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Weapons Sales Worldwide Rise to Highest Level Since 2000

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The value of military weapons sales worldwide jumped in 2004 to the highest level since 2000, driven by arms deals with developing nations, especially India, Saudi Arabia and China, according to a new Congressional study.
 The total of arms sales and weapons transfer agreements to both industrialized and developing nations was nearly $37 billion in 2004, according to the study.
That total was the largest since 2000, when global arms sales reached $42.1 billion, and was far above the 2003 figure of $28.5 billion.
 The United States once again dominated global weapons sales, signing deals worth $12.4 billion in 2004, or 33.5 percent of all contracts worldwide. But that was down from $15.1 billion in 2003. 
 The share of American arms contracts specifically with developing nations was $6.9 billion in 2004, or 31.6 percent of all such deals, up slightly from $6.5 billion in 2003.
 Russia was second in global arms sales, with $6.1 billion in agreements, or 16.5 percent of all such contracts, a notable increase from its $4.4 billion in sales in 2003. In 2004, Russia signed arms transfer deals worth $5.9 billion with the developing world, 27.1 percent of the global total, up from $4.3 billion in 2003.
 Britain was third in arms transfer agreements to the developing world in 2004, signing contracts worth $3.2 billion, while Israel ranked fourth, with deals worth $1.2 billion. France followed with $1 billion. 
 The report, ''Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations,'' is published by the Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress.
 The annual study, which was delivered to Congress on Monday, is considered by academic experts to be the most thorough compilation of facts and figures on global weapons sales available in the public domain.
 The study uses figures in 2004 dollars, with figures for other years adjusted to account for inflation.
 The statistics in the report ''illustrate how global patterns of conventional arms transfers have changed in the post-cold-war and post-Persian-Gulf-war years,'' Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in national defense at the Congressional Research Service, wrote in the introduction to the study.
 ''Relationships between arms suppliers and recipients continue to evolve in response to changing political, military and economic circumstances,'' he said. ''Nonetheless, the developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons suppliers.''
 The study found that arms sales to developing nations in 2004 totaled nearly $21.8 billion, a substantial increase over the $15.1 billion in 2003. That was 58.9 percent of all arms sales agreements worldwide for last year.
 Over the last four years, China has purchased more weapons than any other nation in the developing world, signing $10.4 billion in deals from 2001 to 2004. Such statistics could be used by those in the United States government who have argued against any decision by the European Union to lift its arms embargo against China.
 For that same four-year period, India ranked second, with $7.9 billion in arms purchases, and Egypt was third, with $6.5 billion in deals.
 But India surpassed China in total purchases in 2004, agreeing to buy $5.7 billion in arms.
 Saudi Arabia was second in signing arms deals last year, with contracts valued at $2.9 billion, and China was third in 2004, signing $2.2 billion in contracts for arms purchases.
 ''Presently, there appear to be fewer large weapons purchases being made by developing nations in the Near East,'' Mr. Grimmett wrote, while relatively larger purchases are being made by developing nations in Asia, ''led principally by China and India.'' 
 According to the study, the four major West European arms suppliers -- Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- significantly increased their collective share of arms sales with developing nations between 2003 and 2004, rising to $4.8 billion in 2004 from $830 million in 2003.

HEADLINE: Plans for Natural Gas Ports Stir Debate About Debate 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The energy law signed by President Bush this month contains an unusual provision: in places where companies want to build terminals to receive large shipments of liquefied natural gas, the government must hold forums to discuss the role of such gas in meeting energy demand.
 Supporters of the terminals say the meetings will help address issues raised by importing the gas, which they expect to become a major source of energy in coming years. But opponents call the meetings a taxpayer-financed method of drumming up support for a fuel that would increase the nation's reliance on foreign sources of energy and that could put coastal communities at risk for tanker accidents or explosions.
The debate over efforts to import more liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., is expected to intensify after Hurricane Katrina. Natural gas prices surged about 11 percent on Monday to $10.85 per thousand cubic feet in New York, on concern over a disruption of offshore natural gas production. 
 Tanker imports of natural gas, unlike those of oil, cannot easily be increased because there are only five terminals in the nation to receive and process L.N.G. At one point on Monday, natural gas futures touched $12.07, the highest since trading began on the New York Mercantile Exchange. ''These forums are insulting and laughable, given that we're dealing with an administration hellbent on placing these terminals wherever the industry sees fit,'' said Patrick C. Lynch, attorney general of Rhode Island, who has been outspoken in his opposition to plans for L.N.G. terminals in Providence and nearby Fall River, Mass.
 Opponents of L.N.G. projects are particularly worried because many officials in Washington have been pressing for greater support for L.N.G., arguing that the United States needs more of the fuel from abroad to offset rising natural gas prices, flat domestic production and lower imports from Canada. L.N.G. is natural gas that has been condensed so it can be transported in tankers, as oil is.
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has repeatedly called for increasing L.N.G. imports during the last two years, claiming that high prices for natural gas could curb economic growth.
 Some members of the Bush administration, including Samuel W. Bodman, the secretary of energy, have worked in the liquefied natural gas industry and support new terminals. During his previous job as chief executive of the Cabot Corporation in Boston, Mr. Bodman oversaw the company's L.N.G. importing terminal in Everett, Mass.
 ''The construction of new terminals to receive natural gas from the far corners of the earth is precisely what is needed at a time when our own domestic production has run flat, yet demand continues to increase,'' Mr. Bodman said in a speech in California this month. 
 Similarly, Patrick H. Wood III, who resigned in July as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has told industry officials that he expects at least eight new L.N.G. terminals by the end of the decade. In a recent interview, Mr. Wood, responding to concern over the potential for L.N.G.-related accidents, said he would welcome the construction of an L.N.G. terminal near where he grew up in Port Arthur, Tex.
 John Grasser, spokesman for the Energy Department's office of fossil energy, which will organize the forums, said it was too early to determine where they would be held and what form they would take. Mr. Grasser said the energy bill required his office to conduct at least three forums over the next year, in consultation with the Homeland Security and Transportation Departments, as well as with governors in coastal states, and that ''they should be designed to foster a dialogue.''
 Supporters of L.N.G. terminals say the forums could help their cause. ''There's the thinking that maybe we can legislate a little public relations campaign,'' said John P. Cogan, a lawyer in Houston who has been involved in brokering liquefied natural gas deals since the 1970's. ''Everyone from Greenspan on down says we need this, but it's not happening.''
 Indeed, some participants in earlier federal efforts to increase awareness about L.N.G. say they are concerned that the forums might support the energy industry's efforts to create a global L.N.G. market while drowning out dissent. Bry Myown, spokeswoman for Long Beach Citizens for Utility Reform, a group opposing plans for an L.N.G. terminal in Long Beach, Calif., said the Department of Transportation paid for her to travel to Washington in February to take part in an L.N.G. Community Awareness Workshop.
 According to an agenda from the meeting, presentations at the meeting were limited to government officials; representatives from one energy company, Exxon Mobil; and a Houston-based energy consulting company, the Lukens Energy Group, as well as a scientist from Sandia National Laboratories, which conducted a study last year on the potential for large L.N.G.-related explosions. Ms. Myown said members of the public were allowed only to make short responses to the presentations.
 Despite support for the projects on the federal level, local governments and environmental activists have blocked construction of at least three terminals in California, Alabama and Maine. Several other projects have been delayed as energy companies struggle with local resistance.
 William S. Cooper, executive director of the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a pro-L.N.G. lobbying group, said the inclusion of the forums in the energy bill were a ''fortuitous turn of events.'' ''We're glad to see it,'' he said, adding that he envisioned the forums as a ''neutral way to facilitate discussion.''
 The measure mandating the L.N.G. forums was written by an aide to Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the Energy Committee, according to Bill Wicker, a committee spokesman. Mr. Wicker said he was not surprised at the reaction to the forums among anti-L.N.G. activists, given the emotion associated with L.N.G. battles around the country.
 Still, Mr. Wicker said: ''The intent of the forums is to further promote dialogue and discussion. If they're saying we're pimping for the industry, that's not the case.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Plays Up His Life Story

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:

''Grew Up,'' a 60-second commercial for United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee for New Jersey governor, began running on network television affiliates in New York and Philadelphia on Sunday.

ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with black-and-white snapshots that appear torn from the Corzine family photo album: Mr. Corzine as a pudgy-cheeked baby wearing overalls, a gangly high school basketball player and, finally, a business school student clad in coat and tie. As the uplifting music swells, the screen is filled with a parade of flags, smiling children and Mr. Corzine, appearing friendly and resolute, as he talks with constituents about their concerns.

THE SCRIPT -- ''The son of a farmer and schoolteacher. He went to public schools and worked his way through business school at night. Then he started at the bottom on Wall Street and worked his way up to lead a company named one of the 10 best places to work in America. Jon Corzine knows from his own life what it means to live the American Dream. Now he's running for governor because every child in New Jersey deserves the same opportunity to get ahead. That means we need to get the cost of education and health care and owning a home under control. That's going to take new leadership in Trenton, leadership that can't be bought. Jon Corzine. Cut the waste in state spending. Put an end to the old corruption. Create jobs through investment and economic growth not higher taxes and more debt. Real plans to reduce property taxes and to make health care more affordable. Jon Corzine. Honest. Effective. A governor who can't be bought.

ACCURACY -- The rosy version of Mr. Corzine's life story is factually correct, but the suggested impacts of his policy prescriptions for New Jersey are highly debatable. Republicans say that Mr. Corzine's property tax plan will do little to ease the burden felt by homeowners and that his initiatives to spur job creation and lower health care costs represent little more than wishful thinking. Mr. Corzine's assertion that he ''can't be bought'' is also an attempt to emphasize his independence from the Democratic county bosses who have been blamed for an assortment of scandals. While it is true that Mr. Corzine has accepted few contributions from the party power brokers, he has given millions in donations to them and will depend on party leaders for campaign help and legislative support, raising questions about how much influence they might wield in state government if he is elected.

SCORECARD -- After an unexpectedly bruising summer on the campaign trail, Mr. Corzine's advisers are hoping that this feel-good ad, released during a brief lull in the race, will remind voters of the inspiring biography that helped him become one of the state's most popular elected officials. That image has been soiled in recent months, as Republicans blasted Mr. Corzine's dealings with Democratic power brokers and newspapers reported that he gave a $470,000 gift to an ex-girlfriend who heads the largest state employees union. So while Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican nominee, is mired in a dispute about whether his campaign funding is legal, Mr. Corzine is attempting to retouch his image before an onslaught of negative advertising that is expected this fall.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Sues to Block Loss of National Guard Jets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Connecticut sued on Monday to stop the Pentagon's planned transfer and retirement of fighter jets from the Air National Guard base at Bradley International Airport, saying the move would exceed the federal government's authority and leave the Guard without a ''flying mission'' in the state. 
 The state's arguments parallel those made in other states' lawsuits saying the federal government cannot close or realign National Guard bases without the consent of governors.
On Friday, a federal judge in Pennsylvania declared illegal the Pentagon's plan to transfer some of that state's National Guard planes. Later that day, Connecticut announced plans for its suit. 
 On Saturday, the Massachusetts attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly, said the state would sue to prevent the transfer of F-18 fighters from the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod to a base at a municipal airport in Westfield, Mass. 
 The ruling in the Pennsylvania case came on the same afternoon that an independent federal commission upheld the Pentagon's plan to transfer 9 of the 15 active A-10 Warthogs at the Bradley base to bases in other states. The other six Warthogs would be retired. 
 The commission, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, made the decision as part of a review of the Pentagon's proposal to close hundreds of military bases nationwide.
 Earlier in the week, the commission overruled a Pentagon plan to close the Navy's submarine base in Groton, which employs about 8,500 people. That decision won the commission statewide praise as officials expressed relief that one of the region's largest military bases and an economic anchor would stay in place. 
 But the move to transfer fighter jets, which could reduce the Bradley base's work force by nearly 400 employees, amounted to what Attorney General Richard Blumenthal called ''a power grab that we must meet head to head.'' He said Connecticut would be the only state where an Air National Guard unit had no flying mission.
 ''There is an important principle here that goes back to the first days of the republic,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''The National Guard is the successor to our militia. We are guaranteed a militia by the United States Constitution and, equally important, by the statutes of our nation.''
 Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat, announced the suit with Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, in a news conference at the Capitol that also included Brig. Gen. Thaddeus J. Martin, the adjutant general of the state's National Guard, which includes the 103rd Fighter Wing at Bradley, in Windsor Locks.
 ''We're going to court to protect my authority and that of future governors and future commanders in chief,'' Mrs. Rell said. ''The men of the 103rd Flying Yankees have been protecting us since 1917, and today we're stepping up to protect them and to defend them. It's going to be an all-out fight, and I expect to win.''
 Mr. Blumenthal said Connecticut's case was stronger than Pennsylvania's because Connecticut would lose all its active aircraft, while Pennsylvania would lose only some. A spokesman for the Department of Justice, Charles Miller, said Monday that the department had not decided whether to appeal the Pennsylvania ruling.
 The lawsuits underscore the blurry lines of authority over the Guard, several lawyers said Monday. The federal government has the authority to activate Guard units to federal service, as in the war in Iraq, but governors control the Guard when units are not in federal service, according to the lawsuit.
 ''Does that mean that the governor has the authority to control the weaponry?'' said Edward S. Hershfield, a Boston lawyer who has worked on base-closing cases, noting one unresolved question.
 A section of federal law dealing with the organization and command of the Guard and cited by the Connecticut suit says, ''No change in the branch, organization, or allotment of a unit located entirely within a state may be made without the approval of its governor.''
 Mr. Hershfield said conflict over control of the Guard might have increased since states have become more concerned with defending themselves against terrorism.
 Mrs. Rell and Mr. Blumenthal said transferring the planes without the state's consent would undermine the governor's authority as well as recruitment and retention efforts in the Guard. General Martin said the transfer would include losing as many as 384 of the base's 926 employees, hurting the state's ability to respond to emergencies.
 The 103rd Fighter Wing is not currently active in combat. Christopher Hellman, a senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information, a group in Washington that researches global security, said the A-10 jets were ''worth their weight in gold'' for their role supporting ground troops by attacking tanks and artillery. They have played that role in Bosnia and the Gulf War. 
 The suit is the second in a week that Connecticut has filed against the federal government. Last week, the state filed suit saying the federal No Child Left Behind education policy demanded changes in student testing without paying for the changes.

HEADLINE: Carriers Are Stricken by Cancellations and Lack of Fuel

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The airline industry felt the brunt of Hurricane Katrina yesterday, with some airports running low on jet fuel and carriers canceling hundreds of flights. Meanwhile, Wall Street feared that the financial problems of the sickest airlines could grow worse.
 The industry's trade group, the Air Transport Association, said the nation's supply of jet fuel had been cut 13 percent because of damage to refineries on the Gulf Coast. 
The association arranged for supplies of jet fuel to be shipped by air tanker to airports in Charlotte, N.C., and Fort Myers and West Palm Beach in Florida, where supplies had dwindled, the group's chief economist, John Heimlich, said yesterday.
 The group also planned to send jet fuel by tanker truck as well as plane to other airports, Mr. Heimlich said. Of particular concern are supplies at two big airports --Hartsfield, serving Atlanta, and Dulles, serving Washington. Both airports generally rely on supplies from refineries in Louisiana and in Memphis.
 Complicating matters is the coming Labor Day weekend, which wraps up the summer travel season and is generally the last period of strong travel for the airlines until Thanksgiving. Car travel is also heavy then. 
 And with gasoline selling for upward of $3 a gallon in some parts of the country, versus $1.88 for jet fuel, Mr. Heimlich said the airlines were worried that refineries might choose to produce gasoline rather than jet fuel, which would be less in demand.
 Yesterday, airports serving New Orleans and Gulfport-Biloxi in Mississippi remained closed, while operations at the airport in Jackson, Miss., were curtailed. The Federal Aviation Administration said it expected operations to resume in New Orleans today, although it could not predict when Gulfport-Biloxi would reopen.
 Despite the reopening, some airlines, like United, canceled flights to New Orleans through tomorrow; US Airways canceled flights there through Saturday.
 Delta Air Lines said it had canceled as many as 300 flights throughout the South, and AirTran, a low-fare carrier, said it had canceled about 190 since the weekend. 
 But industry analysts said the cancellations would not hurt the airlines' finances, since they could accommodate those passengers eventually. 
 The bigger concern, they said, was another rise in jet fuel prices, already at the highest level in history, up 53 cents a gallon this year. Contracts based on the future price of jet fuel spiked yesterday; in Los Angeles, usually the most expensive market across the country for jet fuel, the price closed at $2.24 a gallon.
 That is a particular worry for Delta, which has warned it could seek bankruptcy protection because of a cash squeeze. The airline has said each rise of a penny in the price of jet fuel costs it $25 million. 
 With jet fuel prices up 53 cents so far this year, Delta is paying $1.35 billion more for fuel than it anticipated. 
 Airline shares fell yesterday. Delta shares was down 7 cents, to $1.20. Northwest lost 25 cents, to $4.94, and AMR, the parent of American, dropped 71 cents to $12.69.

Prices for Energy Futures Soar In the Wake of Hurricane Katrina
As the extent of the damage on offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico slowly became apparent a day after Hurricane Katrina's passage, oil prices soared above $70 a barrel and gasoline futures jumped by 20 percent on concerns it would take months to restore production. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures closed at $69.81 a barrel, after touching a high of $70.85 earlier in the day. [Page C1.]

Economists warned that Katrina was likely to leave a deeper mark on the national economy than previous hurricanes because of its profound disruption to the Gulf of Mexico's complex energy supply network. [C1.]

Stocks skidded in the aftermath of the hurricane, which pounded hotels and casinos, constricted oil refinery capacity and left insurers to cover losses estimated at up to $25 billion. The Dow closed down 50.23 points, at 10,412.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.87 points, to 1,208.41, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.89 points, to 2,129.76. [C9.]

The airline industry felt the delayed brunt of Hurricane Katrina, with some airports running low on jet fuel and carriers canceling hundreds more flights. Meanwhile, Wall Street feared the financial problems of the sickest airlines could grow worse. [C4.]
 With offices and presses flooded, New Orleans media outlets mostly abandoned newsprint and television broadcasts and set up shop on the Web. [A10.]

U.S. Wins Round in Canadian Lumber Dispute
The United States won a potentially major victory when the World Trade Organization ruled that the imposition of duties on Canadian softwood lumber did not violate international law. The decision, which may yet be appealed, broadly contradicts the conclusions of a special Nafta panel that instructed Washington to refund $5 billion in tariffs. ''My message is very simple,'' Canada's trade minister, Jim Peterson, above, told reporters. ''We want the U.S. to live up to and respect the Nafta.'' [C6.]

After a Shake-Up, Signs of Accord at Citigroup
It has been a long, hot summer at Citigroup, filled with recriminating headlines and power-struggle intrigue, as the chief executive, Charles O. Prince, moved to cement his authority. But if Mr. Prince now has his team in place, as some Citigroup executives say they believe, that might alleviate at least some investor concerns. [C1.]

Money Seized in Arizona May Come From Hedge Fund
Authorities in Arizona have seized $101 million in a bank account that they say could be funds from Bayou, a hedge fund based in Connecticut. The development is the first hopeful sign for the wealthy investors in Bayou, who have been worried that none of their money would be returned. Federal and Connecticut officials are investigating the fund's apparent collapse. [C1.]

Clothing Designers in China Aspire to More
Thousands of ambitious would-be Chinese designers, eager to prove themselves in the rough-and-tumble clothing industry, may provide the next shake-up for garment makers in the United States and Europe. Even as they focus mostly on basic tasks, China's designers are starting to show an interest in innovation. [C1.]

China remained entangled in trade disputes with the world's two biggest economic superpowers. The United States pressed Beijing to reduce the flow of cheap textiles while Europe sought to pick up the pieces of its failed quota deal. [C6.]

Sprint Nextel Buys 2 Wireless Affiliates
Sprint Nextel said it would buy two small wireless affiliates, IWO Holdings and Gulf Coast Wireless, resolving legal issues arising from Sprint's purchase of Nextel Communications. Sprint Nextel said it was in talks with its seven remaining Sprint affiliates, which have exclusive rights to use the Sprint brand in markets where Sprint does not operate. It previously bought another affiliate, US Unwired. [C8.]

Gas Prices and Labor Talks Complicate G.M. Comeback
General Motors executives told financial analysts that they were making progress in their efforts to become profitable again, but that rising gas prices and continuing negotiations over labor costs were complicating the company's comeback bid. [C3.]

Icahn Group May Step Up Pressure on Time Warner
A consortium of hedge funds led by Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor, is discussing whether to ratchet up its pressure on Time Warner by increasing its stake in the company to as much as 10 percent. [C8.]

Fed Policy Makers Found Inflation a Risk
Surging energy prices and a strengthening jobs climate have raised the risk that inflation could worsen, in the opinion of Federal Reserve policy makers, who cited those concerns in a meeting this month in support of continued raising of short-term interest rates. Minutes of the meeting, held on Aug. 9, were released yesterday. [C3.]

Consumer Confidence Shows Unexpected Rise
Consumer confidence unexpectedly strengthened in August, the Conference Board reported, citing an improving job market. It said that its consumer confidence index rose in August to 105.6, from a revised 103.6 in July. [C3.]

HEADLINE: Poverty in U.S. Grew in 2004, While Income Failed to Rise for 5th Straight Year

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Even as the economy grew, incomes stagnated last year and the poverty rate rose, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. It was the first time on record that household incomes failed to increase for five straight years.
 The portion of Americans without health insurance remained roughly steady at 16 percent, the bureau said. A smaller percentage of people were covered by their employers, but two big government programs, Medicaid and military insurance, grew. 
The census's annual report card on the nation's economic well-being showed that a four-year-old expansion had still not done much to benefit many households. Median pretax income, $44,389, was at its lowest point since 1997, after inflation.
 Though the reasons are not wholly clear, economists say technology and global trade appear to be holding down pay for many workers. The rising cost of health care benefits has also eaten into pay increases.
 After the report's release, Bush administration officials said that the job market had continued to improve since the end of 2004 and that they hoped incomes were now rising and poverty was falling. The poverty rate ''is the last, lonely trailing indicator of the business cycle,'' said Elizabeth Anderson, chief of staff in the economics and statistics administration of the Commerce Department.
 The census numbers also do not reflect the tax cuts passed in President Bush's first term, which have lifted the take-home pay of most families.
 But the biggest tax cuts went to high-income families already getting raises, Democrats said Tuesday. The report, they added, showed that the cuts had failed to stimulate the economy as the White House had promised. 
 ''The growth in the economy is not going to families,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. ''It's in stark contrast to what happened during the Clinton administration.''
 The main theme of the census report seemed to be the lingering weakness in compensation and benefits, even as the ranks of the unemployed have dwindled. Fewer people are getting health insurance from their employers or from policies of family members, while raises have generally trailed inflation.
 Last year, households kept income from falling by working more hours than they did in 2003, the data showed. The median pay of full-time male workers declined more than 2 percent in 2004, to $40,800; for women, the median dropped 1 percent, to $31,200. When some people switch to full-time work from part-time, they can keep household incomes from dropping even when the pay of individual workers is declining.
 ''It looks like the gains from the recovery haven't really filtered down,'' said Phillip L. Swagel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington. ''The gains have gone to owners of capital and not to workers.''
 There has always been a lag between the end of a recession and the resumption of raises, Mr. Swagel added, but the length of this lag has been confounding.
 In addition, the poverty rate rose last year for working-age people, those ages 18 to 64. The portion of people age 65 and older in poverty fell, while child poverty was essentially flat.
 Over all, the poverty rate increased to 12.7 percent, from 12.5 percent in 2003. Poverty levels have changed only modestly in the last three decades, rising in the 1980's and falling in the 1990's, after having dropped sharply in the 1960's. They reached a low of 11.1 percent in 1973, from more than 22 percent in 1960.
 In the same three decades that poverty has remained fairly steady, median incomes have grown significantly, lifting living standards for most families. After adjusting for inflation, the income of the median household, the one making more than half of all others and less than half of the rest, earns almost one-third more now than it did in the late 1960's. 
 But income inequality has also risen in that time and was near all-time highs last year, the Census Bureau reported. The census numbers do not include gains from stock holdings, which would further increase inequality.
 In New York, the poverty rate rose last year to 20.3 percent, from 19 percent, making it the only city of more than one million people with a significant change. The reason for the increase was not obvious.
 Among populous counties, the Bronx had the fourth-highest poverty rate in the nation, trailing three counties on the Texas-Mexico border. 
 Many economists say the government's statistics undercount poverty in New York and other major cities because the numbers are not adjusted for cost of living. A family of two parents and two children is considered poor if it makes less than $19,157 a year, regardless of whether it lives in a city where $500,000 buys a small apartment or a mansion.
 Households in New Hampshire made more last year ($57,400 at the median) than in any other state, while those in West Virginia made the least ($32,600). Fairfax County in Virginia ($88,100) and Somerset County in New Jersey ($84,900) were the counties with the highest earnings, the census said.
 The decline in employer-provided health benefits came after four years of rapidly rising health costs. The percentage of people getting health insurance from an employer fell to 59.8 percent last year, from 63.6 percent in 2000. The percentage receiving it from the government rose to 27.2 percent, from 24.7 percent.
 The trend is likely to continue unless the job market becomes as tight as it was in the late 1990's and companies decide they must offer health insurance to retain workers, said Paul Fronstin, director of the health research program at the Employee Benefit Research Group, a nonpartisan organization in Washington.
 The numbers released Tuesday showed a slight decline in median income, but the bureau called the drop, $93, statistically insignificant. 
 The Midwest, which has been hurt by the weak manufacturing sector, was the only region where the median income fell and poverty rose. Elsewhere, they were unchanged.
 Since 1967, incomes have failed to rise for four straight years on two other occasions: starting in the late 1970's and in the early 1990's. The Census Bureau does not report household income for years before 1967, but other data show that incomes were generally rising in the 40's, 50's and 60's.

HEADLINE: Where Living at Nature's Mercy Had Always Seemed Worth the Risk 

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
After Hurricane Andrew huffed and puffed and then somehow veered away in 1992, the way the storms always seemed to do, the manager of a praline shop in the French Quarter mused on the mixture of fatalism and bravado that has always been at the heart of New Orleans.
 ''You do live with the belief that some day the big one's going to get you,'' said Patricia McDonald Gomez, general manager of Aunt Sally's Original Creole Pralines said as the party resumed, as it always did on Bourbon Street. ''You're almost fatalistic, which is part of the reason New Orleans has that mixture of frivolity and fatalism. Living in a soup bowl will do it to you, like Romans dancing while Nero fiddled and the city burned.''
Now it seems, after countless close calls, the big one has hit, leaving New Orleanians terrified, stunned, gasping, speechless. 
 With whitecaps on Canal Street, water coursing through breeched levees and 80 percent of the city under water, surviving, not rebuilding, is now the order of the day. But in the back of their minds people who love New Orleans are wondering what will remain physically and psychologically of perhaps America's most distinctive city when the water recedes and -- days, weeks or months from now -- some semblance of everyday life struggles to resume.
 So former Mayor Marc Morial, now the head of the Urban League and living in New York, kept interrupting a telephone conversation to gasp in disbelief at the watery images on his television and then did his best to conjure up the task ahead.
 ''We'll rebuild, of course,'' Mr. Morial said. ''But what made New Orleans is the polyglot, the tapestry, the mosaic, the gumbo. So the French Quarter gets most of the attention, but the Quarter feeds from the arteries of the neighborhoods.''
 He paused and gasped again as the screen showed the flooded images from the low-income Ninth Ward: ''Oh my God, oh my God. We're looking at the worst natural disaster in American history.''
 Left unspoken was the question not of how to rebuild the French Quarter, but how to rebuild the city of Stella, Blanche and Stanley, the city that to William Faulkner was ''the labyrinthine mass of oleander and jasmine, lantana and mimosa,'' a place one admirer said ''could wreck your liver and poison your blood,'' the city of the Italianate mansions of the Garden District and forlorn housing projects like the one named Desire -- a place that gave America most of its music, much of its literature, a cracked mirror glimpse of American exotica and a fair piece of its soul.
 ''Great Babylon is come up before me,'' shuddered Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel, upon encountering New Orleans more than a century and a half ago. ''Oh, the wickedness, the idolatry of this place.''
 In truth, the wickedness has long since become fairly tame, pre-fab voodoo, L.S.U. and Ole Miss sorority girls flashing their breasts from French Quarter balconies and sad-eyed strippers being ogled by drunk conventioneers at seedy Bourbon Street bars. And people have been predicting the slow de-Babylonization of New Orleans for decades, pondering its inexorable transformation into a place like anyplace else.
 But it never really happened. Mr. Morial said that was partly a function of its identity as a city of natives, who make up 70 percent to 80 percent of the population. It is partly a function of its in-bred business climate, suspicious of newcomers, in which the go-go gene that defined cities like Dallas or Atlanta, petty trifles when New Orleans was at its peak, never took hold. And partly it is a function of geography, the proudly insular culture that results from what one scholar, Pierce Lewis, described as being an ''inevitable city on an impossible site.''
 So, as much as the oysters at Felix's or the street performers in Jackson Square, what has defined New Orleans has been nature -- the smothering blanket of humid air, the rains so thunderous, the humorist Roy Blount Jr. once wrote, ''that you expect to see alligators bouncing off the pavement.'' And most of all, the oceanic expanse of water surrounding the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, which covers 600 square miles. That location made it a natural settlement point, a place that drew settlers from every culture that passed by and left it in a place so precarious that this week's disaster has always seemed almost inevitable.
 Mr. Morial said city planners had been as attentive to hurricane planning as possible and cited the city's shift in focus from shelters to evacuation planning as something that could play an incalculable role in minimizing the casualties from the storm.
 As for any psychological denial, he noted that other places face earthquakes or floods, and people in New Orleans have always looked at the odds and figured living at nature's mercy in such an alluring hothouse was worth the risk.
 ''People have always thought, there's a chance for the big one, but is it one in 100? One in 1,000? One in 10,000? One in 100,000?'' he said. ''People have sort of learned to deal with this and live with it, and now we're all having to deal with it.''
 Even those who survived the storm with minimal damage were wondering what would happen next in a city whose other dominant thread is entrenched urban poverty.
 Henry Armand Austan, a 61-year-old photographer, said he picked out his home in the city's Carrollton section uptown because it stood on some of the highest ground around.
 Yesterday afternoon Mr. Austan had no electricity, but he did have gas and water. He had a clutter of downed banana trees in his backyard, a posse of hungry cats looking for food, a view of looters foraging through shops nearby, and a fiancee whose cellphone had died stranded at the Louisiana Superdome. The foot of water that was in front of his house a day earlier had drained down to the flooded sections below.
 ''We had a good tourist thing going, but if this place is closed down for six months you can forget that,'' he said by telephone. ''If they don't come back, you wonder what will happen. This is a poor city with a bad education system. Corporate America isn't going to want to put its business in a place that might flood every so often. We might not have a lot to recommend us.''
 Some fear that the city that emerges from the floodwaters will finally be turned into a theme park -- the glitter of Bourbon Street without the grit that now surrounds it.
 But there is also a sense that, like the river, there remains something immutable in New Orleans. As the jazz patriarch Ellis Marsalis once said: ''You know, I don't think New Orleans is ever going to change, because I don't think in the scheme of things, it's supposed to change.''
 That sentiment will be tested now as never before, but Mr. Morial said he was confident the city could rebuild and recover.
 ''I've heard from so many people and everyone says the same thing,'' he said. ''First they say, 'How's your mom? Is she O.K.?' Then they say, 'We've got to do something to help.' A lot of people have lost everything they own, but there's a great spirit, a zeal, to clean up and to rebuild.''

HEADLINE: Uniting the Two Koreas, in Animated Films at Least

BYLINE: By MARK RUSSELL

DATELINE: SEOUL, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
It is the most Korean of folk tales. A young girl, Shim Chung, gives her life to a sea dragon so that her blind father may see again -- and is rewarded for her filial piety by becoming an empress. 
 Now Shim Chung has earned another reward for her selfless sacrifice: an animated version of her ancient tale has become the first film to be released at the same time in North and South Korean movie theaters. ''Empress Chung'' opened on 51 screens in South Korea on Aug. 12, followed by 6 screens in North Korea on Aug. 15 -- 60 years after the end of World War II, when the United States and the Soviet Union divided control of the Korean Peninsula. 
''Empress Chung'' is also a labor of love for Nelson Shin, and an expensive labor at that. Mr. Shin, a Korean-American animator, worked for seven years and spent more than $6.5 million of his own money to tell the classic tale.
 Mr. Shin, 65, has devoted a lifetime to animating other people's stories, including 20 years at AKOM, his production company in Seoul, doing the grueling work of grinding out the tens of thousands of drawings needed in each episode of ''The Simpsons'' and other Western television shows. But he wanted to tell his own stories, so he started a new animation venture to create ''Empress Chung'': KOAA Films, based in the United States. 
 ''I picked 'Empress Chung' because it had the most drama,'' Mr. Shin said, ''and it is full of our Korean tradition.'' He was able to finance the film himself, but to cut expenses he turned to animators in North Korea, where labor costs a small fraction of what it does in South Korea. He worked with about 500 animators (''100 in the South, and the rest in North Korea'') to create the 500,000 drawings required for ''Empress Chung.''
 ''The usual 'Simpsons' episode has about 20,000 cells in 22 minutes,'' Mr. Shin said. ''So 'Empress Chung' had a lot of details.''
 ''North Korean animators are excellent,'' he added. ''They learn quickly and work very hard.'' The SEK animation studio in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, which did the animation, has been involved in an array of international productions since the late 1990's. 
 It was a natural connection for Mr. Shin, who was born in what is now North Korea in 1939. He was 12 when he walked with his family from North Korea to the South during the Korean War. ''I remember the bombs going off overhead,'' he said.
 Despite the hard times after the war, Mr. Shin knew he wanted to draw. After doing editorial cartoons for newspapers and working on some animated films, he immigrated to the United States in the 1970's. He found work with DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, one of the main subcontractors for Warner Brothers cartoons, and stayed on after Marvel Comics bought the company in 1981. Highlights of those years, he said, included helping create the light sabers in the original ''Star Wars'' film, producing the television series ''The Transformers'' and directing the movie version.
 But it was an emergency rush in 1985 for the film ''My Little Pony: The Movie'' that allowed Mr. Shin to start Akom Studio in Seoul. In only 10 weeks, his newly formed team of animators was able to create the 300,000 cells required for the 1986 film. ''We all just worked nonstop,'' he said.
 It was a bountiful time for animation. In 1994, the South Korean government finally recognized the economic potential of the industry and started to support it (a far cry from 1967, when the government labeled cartoons one of the ''six evils'' of Korean society). By the late 1990's, South Korea was taking in up to 50 percent of the world's subcontracted animation. AKOM at one point employed more than 1,700 people.
 Today, AKOM employs just 150. Most of the South Korean animation industry has suffered a major slowdown, and a rising standard of living has made South Korea less of a bargain, as animation companies increasingly moved to the Philippines, Vietnam and North Korea. In addition, two-dimensional animation has fallen out of favor. Audiences are turning more often to three-dimensional animation films like Pixar's ''Incredibles.''
 More seriously, perhaps, Korean animators did not learn how to tell their own stories, preferring to churn out others' tales. ''Koreans' technique is O.K., but they don't know anything about creation,'' Mr. Shin said.
 Recent Korean attempts at original animated stories have not done well at the box office. The $10 million science-fiction film ''Wonderful Days'' barely made $2 million. ''My Beautiful Girl, Mari'' and ''Oseam,'' both Grand Prix winners at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival (in 2002 and 2004), also barely made a blip at the Korean box office.
 And it looks as if ''Empress Chung,'' which also won a special prize at Annecy in 2003 and the top prize at the Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival in 2004, did not escape that fate either, earning just $140,000 in its opening weekend (a highly competitive weekend nonetheless, with new releases like ''Fantastic Four,'' ''Sympathy for Lady Vengeance'' and ''Welcome to Dongmakgol'').
 Mr. Shin has not finished working with North Korea, though. He said that both North and South Korea have agreed to produce his next project: a six-part animated series on Goguryeo, an ancient state that once occupied the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and much of Manchuria about 2,000 years ago. China recently created a furor in Korea when it claimed historical ownership of Goguryeo.
 ''I don't want to focus on where the land was; I don't want to make trouble,'' Mr. Shin said. ''But it is a fantastic story.''

HEADLINE: Damage to Economy Is Deep and Wide

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER; Micheline Maynard in Detroit and Jad Mouawad and Vikas Bajaj in New York contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
As Hurricane Katrina plowed through the Mississippi River basin, shutting down ports, flooding cities and cutting power lines, economists warned that it was likely to leave a deeper mark on the national economy than previous hurricanes because of its profound disruption to the Gulf of Mexico's complex energy supply network.
 ''The typical pattern with a natural disaster like this is that the regional economy gets clobbered but you can barely see it in the national statistics,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''This time it is very different because of the impact on the energy infrastructure.''
Already, it is clear that much of the economic activity in the gulf region has indeed been clobbered. New Orleans, home to nearly a million people, is under water. By yesterday morning an estimated 2.7 million residents in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi had reported power failures, with many expected to be without electricity for weeks. Conventional and mobile telephone service along the Gulf Coast suffered from severe disruptions from flooded call-routing equipment and damaged cellular towers. 
 Businesses across the Southern interior ground to a halt as then storm affected the region's transportation network and power grid. Since last Thursday, AirTran, a low-fare airline, has canceled 195 flights because of Katrina, including 18 cancellations yesterday. 
 Casinos were destroyed in Mississippi and New Orleans; tourism is not expected to revive for months. Grain shipments face serious delay: Bunge, the world's largest oil-seed processor, evacuated a huge soybean operation in Destrehan, La., its main export terminal in the United States. Food exports and imports that normally flow in huge quantities through regional ports, roads and rail lines are likely to face major disruptions for weeks, if not longer. 
 Economic activity is expected to resume in the next few days and weeks in all but the worst-hit locations. But what worries most economists is Katrina's ripple effect on energy prices.
 A spike in the price of gasoline just ahead of Labor Day will force consumers to dig deeper into their wallets on one of the busiest driving weekends of the year, providing both a real and psychological blow to spending on other goods and services. And a sustained rise in the cost of energy could substantially slow economic growth.
 Across the storm's path, it has been difficult to come to grips with the extent of devastation. Ed Preau, assistant secretary for intermodal transport at Louisiana's transportation and development department in Baton Rouge, said he assumed that ports east of New Orleans remain closed because they are under water. But he said he could not be sure because ''I have no contact with anybody in the 504 area code.'' 
 Yesterday, the Coast Guard barred all traffic except barges and tugs from the Mississippi delta to the Arkansas state line, a spokesman said. 
 While all estimates at this stage are just guesses, privately insured losses could reach $15 billion or more, according to Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute in New York, making Katrina the most expensive hurricane for the insurance industry since Andrew hit Florida in 1992. Other analysts estimated insured losses up to $25 billion.
 Damage from flooding, which private insurers do not cover, could easily double the figure.
 But economists point out that although Katrina has destroyed a lot of accumulated wealth, it ultimately will probably have a positive effect on measured growth over the next few months as vast resources from around the country are channeled to rebuilding.
 Even as shuttered businesses will temporarily add to joblessness, the huge reconstruction effort is expected to create jobs in construction and a host of related sectors. Insurance companies and the federal government will pick up a significant portion of the cost. 
 ''Longer term, in the wake of a number of hurricanes there is actually an increase in measured output that even shows up at the national level, because there is a whole bunch of rebuilding activity,'' said Stephen P.A. Brown, director of energy economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ''Though in some sense it would be easy to argue that we have been made worse by the hurricane, the process of rebuilding of property contributes to an increase in output.''
 But it will take a while to get to that stage. With buildings damaged, roads closed, power lines down and telephone service severely crimped, restoring basic services is the first order of business. Even cellphone service in the New Orleans 504 area code, for example, may not come back easily.
 Still, at the national level, the already stressed energy supply system is considered the most critical sector to watch. ''The economic impact of delays in getting exports of grain out is not as large as the impact of delays in getting oil in,'' said John Robertson, an economist at the Atlanta Fed.
 According to Mr. Behravesh at Global Insight, in a best case outlook, with oil and natural gas supplies falling by 2 percent or less, oil prices are likely to stay at $65 to $70 a barrel for the next couple of weeks while gasoline prices climb to $3 a gallon for a couple of months. He estimated that course of events would shave no more than half a percentage point from output growth in the fourth quarter.
 But Mr. Behravesh noted that if the disruption of supplies is deeper, oil prices could spike to $100 a barrel and gas at the pump could soar to $3.50 a gallon for four months to six months. That kind of price shock could sharply curtail consumer spending elsewhere, possibly bringing economic growth for the October-December quarter to a halt from the 3 percent gains most analysts have been expecting.
 As news trickles in of the storm's damage, economic prospects are looking bleaker. The storm crippled oil and gas operations in the gulf and shut down most of the output from the region, which accounts for nearly a third of domestic oil production and a fifth of natural gas output. It also forced the closing of nearly 10 percent of the nation's refining capacity, concentrated in Mississippi and Louisiana.
 The hurricane also shut a major oil-import terminal in Louisiana with a daily capacity of one million barrels, about a 10th of the nation's overall imports. Pipelines to markets in the Northeast and the Midwest also closed. Power will have to be restored to them before they can resume supplying markets outside the area. Analysts said it would probably take weeks before the full extent of the damage is revealed and months before production is restored to its pre-storm levels.
 The supply squeeze is already rippling through the economy. The Air Transport Association estimated that jet fuel production was cut by 13 percent. ''We're working extremely hard to avoid any operational impact,'' said John Heimlich, chief economist for the association. 
 Mr. Heimlich said fuel was being transported by tanker plane to airports in the South, including Charlotte, N.C., and West Palm Beach and Fort Myers in Florida.
 The string of hurricanes that tore through Florida last year provide a useful precedent for understanding Katrina's potential economic impact. Last year hiring in Florida froze in August and September as the hurricanes hit, holding average job gains to just 2,000 a month. By October, however, job growth bounced back to almost 33,000.
 Ultimately, the four hurricanes in 2004 made only a small dent in the nation's growth. Most of the impact came from Hurricane Ivan, which ripped through underwater oil pipelines, cutting output from refineries and helping push gasoline prices back above $2 a gallon.
 Those prices already seem like a long-lost dream.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Rises Unexpectedly 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Consumer confidence unexpectedly strengthened in August, the Conference Board reported yesterday, citing an improving job market .
 It said that its consumer confidence index rose in August to 105.6, from a revised 103.6 in July. Analysts had predicted a decline to 101.5. 
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that new orders at American factories in July suffered the largest drop since April 2004, though the decline was still not as sharp as had been expected. The demand for durable manufactured goods plunged.
 Meanwhile, in commodities trading, crude oil rose $2.61 a barrel yesterday, to $69.81, as oil and oil service companies assessed the damage that Hurricane Katrina had wrought on the Gulf Coast. Gasoline and natural gas futures also rose. 
 Cary Leahey, senior managing director at Decision Economics in New York, referring to the consumer confidence data, said: ''The market will look at the report with the expectation that confidence will still wobble with sky-high levels of gasoline prices and higher natural gas prices for heating homes in the winter, figuring that consumer spending will be hurt down the road.''
 Consumers' spirits seem to have been buoyed by the employment prospects, with the index of those seeing jobs as plentiful rising to 23.5 percent, from 22.9 percent, and the index of those saying jobs are hard to get easing to 23.2 percent, from 23.8 percent. 
 It was the first time since October 2001 that the optimists outnumbered the pessimists.
 Expressing surprise, David Laster, senior economist at Swiss Re, said, ''I guess people are tolerating the gasoline prices -- the gasoline price hikes -- surprisingly well.''
 New orders at American factories fell 1.9 percent in July on a 4.9 percent drop in demand for durable goods -- relatively costly items expected to last at least three years. The durable goods figure was unchanged from an initial reading released last week. 
 The fall was partly offset by a 1.7 percent increase in orders for nondurable goods. 
 ''There isn't much excitement in the July factory orders numbers,'' Mr. Leahey said. ''July is payback for a pretty good June and May, but any way you slice it, your third-quarter capital spending slowed down quite a bit from previous quarters.''
 Economists had expected overall factory orders to drop 2.3 percent.
 While orders were not as weak as expected in July, the Commerce Department said orders were not quite as strong as previously thought in June, when they rose only 0.9 percent. The department had previously said June orders were up 1.4 percent.

Surging energy prices and a strengthening jobs climate have raised the risk that inflation could worsen, in the opinion of Federal Reserve policy makers, who cited those concerns in a meeting this month in support of continued raising of short-term interest rates.
 But Fed policy makers suggested they could stick with their course of bumping up rates gradually, in modest quarter-point increments, because of other forces that could blunt inflation, according to minutes of the Fed's last meeting, on Aug. 9, which were released Tuesday.
 Competition from foreign companies is acting as an inflation-tempering force, the Fed minutes said. That competitive force is making it harder for companies in the United States to fully pass through to consumers higher costs resulting from soaring energy prices. 
 ''The continuing expansion of global trade was seen as an important factor limiting firms' ability to pass through cost increases,'' the minutes said.
 Instead, companies are paying for a chunk of the higher energy costs and other costs out of their profits, which are being squeezed, the minutes suggested.
 At the August meeting, Fed policy makers lifted a benchmark interest rate, called the federal funds rate, by a quarter percentage point, to 3.50 percent, the highest it has been in nearly four years. It was the 10th quarter-point increase since the Fed began to tighten credit in June 2004.
 In Fed parlance, those quarter-point moves are considered ''measured,'' or gradual, increases.
 Economists expect the Fed to increase rates by another quarter point at its next meeting, on Sept. 20, as well as at the year's last two meetings in November and December.
 On the subject of the booming housing market, Fed policy makers generally expected that the torrid pace of increases in home prices ''would slow over time, though the timing and the extent of that slowing, as well as its implications for consumer spending, were quite uncertain,'' the minutes said. 
 A few Fed officials voiced concerns that the still-low interest rate climate of the last several years was continuing to foster ''an inappropriate degree of risk-taking in financial markets.''
 On the nation's fiscal situation, recent projections of a smaller budget deficit this year -- helped by stronger tax revenues -- do not change the sobering long-term budget picture, the minutes said.

HEADLINE: Giants' Feud With Xanadu Is About More Than Traffic 

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Aug. 25 

 BODY:
If further evidence is needed that the car is king in New Jersey -- and that matters of traffic and roads trump most other issues -- look no further than the Meadowlands.
 The New York Giants have gone to court to try to block their neighbor, the planned $1.3 billion Meadowlands Xanadu family entertainment and retail complex, from operating on game days, on the grounds that it would turn a trip to a Giants game from a mere traffic problem into a traffic nightmare.
 The fight among the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which owns the land; the Giants; and the developers of Meadowlands Xanadu appeared to be over last May when the team and the state agreed to a plan for a new privately financed $750 million football stadium on a separate parcel nearby.
 But in papers filed in State Superior Court in Bergen County on Aug. 23, just a month before the team is to provide details about the new stadium, its lawyers sued, asking a judge to immediately restrict the operations of Xanadu, now under construction. 
 According to their court papers, the Giants say their fans' No. 1 complaint involves getting into and out of the stadium grounds on game days -- a feat that involves 24,000 cars and as many as 80,000 fans. With Xanadu, 12,000 cars will be added to the mix, both sides agree.
 Some of the cars will be shunted to Xanadu's garages, affecting those fans' ability to indulge in that parking lot tradition, tailgate parties.
 The Giants say they are actually losing parking spaces. But the lawsuit is about more than parking, the team concedes. With details of the new stadium to be worked out, the suit is an attempt by the team to gain leverage in talks with Xanadu's developers and to strengthen its hand in dealing with the sports and exposition authority. In particular, the team wants court enforcement of a provision in its lease that makes its consent required for any changes in the complex that affect the team's operations on game days or compete with them.
 The issue seems to have become a matter of pride for John Mara, the executive vice president of the Giants. In an interview, Mr. Mara spoke wistfully about the decision his father, Wellington Mara, made in 1971 to move the Giants from Yankee Stadium. There, they were ''second-class tenants.'' To get the true football stadium he desired, he decided to move his team to what was then a vast marsh and vacant expanse of filled-in dump.
 One editorial cartoon at the time depicted the elder Mr. Mara, cloaked like George Washington on a snowy winter night, standing at the prow of a boat, being rowed by football players onto a shore strewn with broken bottles, crushed cans and litter. There was wide speculation, apart from New York-centric chauvinism, that the move to New Jersey would be a disaster for the team. 
 It was in that atmosphere that the Giants managed to get provisions in their lease that gave them a virtual veto over alterations at the site that might affect their operations. John Mara says those provisions are crystal clear, but Carl J. Goldberg, the chairman of the sports and exposition authority, insists they are not.
 Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist and professor at Smith College, said such clauses were common in stadium lease arrangements around the country. ''They are designed to maximize space and thereby maximize revenues for the team,'' he said.
 Mr. Mara said the Giants feel they must invoke the provisions to protect their interests. ''It was a decision by my family that gave rise to this entire complex,'' he said. ''And to be honest, we are starting to feel like second-class citizens over here.''
 Xanadu's retail operations would be closed on Sunday game days because of county blue laws, but restaurants and other activities would be open. Mr. Goldberg said Giants fans could stick around to eat and play, and the drawn-out day could actually decrease the traffic congestion immediately after the games.
 A planned rail link to the Meadowlands could reduce traffic by as many as 10,000 to 20,000 cars, officials have estimated. Martin E. Robins of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University said an efficient rail connection would come to be accepted by fans ''over time.''
 But Mr. Zimbalist is skeptical. ''These are people of means who want to drive and are not going to take public transportation,'' he said.
 Mr. Mara said the blue laws affect only Sundays, and more and more league games are on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, putting the stadium in direct competition with Xanadu -- a situation that the anticompetition and noninterference clauses are meant to address. 
 The Xanadu developers say they have offered traffic improvements, to be carried out on a timetable to be negotiated with the team. Further, they have agreed to spend $80 million on road construction. Michael Turner, a spokesman for the developers, the Mills Corporation and the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, also said that whatever the team loses in surface parking would be more than made up by Xanadu's parking decks.
 Mr. Mara is holding fast, insisting that Xanadu not be allowed to open on game days until all of the road improvements are completed and proven to work. He said deck parking is no alternative for football fans and tailgate partygoers.
 George R. Zoffinger, the president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, who carried out Gov. James E. McGreevey's mission to broaden the use of the Meadowlands by bringing in Xanadu, said the Giants' stance was ''all about the money.'' He said the team was hobbling efforts to better use the land for creating jobs and producing tax revenues for the state. 
 Mr. Mara said he realizes that the lawsuit and the team's tough stance could jeopardize plans for the new stadium. But he said it was a chance he had to take. ''This lawsuit is necessary for us to preserve our rights as we go into any new negotiations,'' he said. ''We only have 10 home games a year, and Xanadu has the other 355 days to operate.''

HEADLINE: No Quick Fix for Gulf Oil Operations

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
As the extent of the damage to offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico slowly became apparent a day after Hurricane Katrina's passage, oil prices soared above $70 a barrel and gasoline futures jumped by 20 percent yesterday on concerns it would take months to restore production to prestorm levels.
 For consumers across the nation this means that retail gasoline prices are likely to jump above $3 a gallon -- matching inflation-adjusted records reached in the early 1980's -- just as millions of drivers hit the roads on the Labor Day weekend.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures settled at $69.81 a barrel yesterday, a 3.9 percent jump, after touching a high of $70.85 a barrel earlier in the day, a reflection of how little slack there is on global energy markets to make up for shortages in the gulf.
 The hurricane, one of the most severe storms to hit the United States, crippled the nation's foremost oil-producing region at the worst possible time for American and global energy markets.
 It will probably take days, or even weeks, before the full extent of the damage is fully revealed. Repairs are likely to drag on for months. 
 ''The market can't afford any disruption whatsoever,'' said Ben Dell, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York. ''As it happens, we just had the worst disruption ever.'' 
 Most of the oil and gas production from the Gulf of Mexico remained shut off yesterday. The region, which usually produces 1.5 million barrels of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of gas each day, accounts for nearly a third of domestic oil production and a fifth of its natural gas output. 
 Because of flooding and power disruptions, many refiners along the gulf coast in Louisiana and Mississippi remained shut for a second day. 
 The prospect of lengthy delays in restarting refineries sent gasoline futures up 41.39 cents, their highest-ever jump, to $2.47 a gallon on the Nymex. 
 Information trickled in slowly because the offshore industry's base is concentrated near New Orleans. 
 The Coast Guard said that its crews had spotted several sunken platforms and rigs. The destruction was often accompanied by oil spills.
 ''We're still in the preliminary stages of identifying what damage had been done,'' Petty Officer Larry Chambers, a Coast Guard spokesman, said. ''It could take a couple of days. Some of them are definitely sunk and some of them are definitely out of place.'' 
 The Coast Guard was starting to dispatch hazardous-materials teams to deal with oil and chemical spills yesterday afternoon, although most of its activities remain focused on rescuing people, he said.
 Offshore platforms were damaged by the storm's winds and waves, and some had snapped out of their moorings and were drifting away; 10 refineries, accounting for 10 percent of the nation's capacity, were shut down and remained without power yesterday; strategic pipelines linking the gulf to major markets in the rest of the country were still closed because they too lacked power.
 Because of the experience from Hurricane Ivan, which slammed into the gulf last September, much of the concern centered on the underwater pipelines that link the 4,000 platforms in the gulf to the mainland. These were buried, uprooted or damaged by last year's storm, and many feared that they might have suffered a similar fate from underwater mud slides or swells on Monday. The damage from Ivan took months to repair. 
 Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall early Monday, left a grim picture in the south, killing at least 70 people, submerging most of New Orleans and devastating communities in Louisiana and Mississippi. 
 Its impact also highlighted how reliant America's domestic production has become on this region. The United States imports more than 10 million barrels a day of crude oil and more than 1 million barrels a day of gasoline -- 60 percent through ports along the gulf. Nearly half the nation's refining capacity is along the coast, from Texas to Alabama.
 ''We are very dependent on energy resources produced in the Gulf of Mexico, not just the Persian Gulf,'' said Stephen P. Brown, director of energy economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
 Royal Dutch Shell, the largest operator in the gulf, said that its Mars platform, a 225,000-barrel-a-day facility that accounts for 15 percent of oil production in the gulf, had sustained some damage to its upper levels. The company also said that two drilling rigs were adrift.
 Chevron said that it had dispatched helicopters from Texas to fly over its platforms in the gulf and take pictures of the facilities. It planned similar flyovers of its shut-down refinery in Pascagoula, Miss. Exxon Mobil indicated that it had received reports of damage to a gas-processing plant in Grand Isle, La.
 The storm also crimped power utilities, leaving 18 percent of residents in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi and some small regions of Florida without power, according to the Department of Energy. 
 The loss of power has disabled infrastructure and stalled efforts to restart other energy-related operations like refineries and the main pipeline transportation systems.
 For example, Colonial Pipeline, which carries refined products like gasoline from Houston to New Jersey and the New England markets, warned that its operations were shut down because of ''widespread damage to the electric grid.'' Other pipelines, like the Plantation Pipeline and the Capline Pipeline, were also completely or partly shut. 
 Over 95 percent of the gulf's daily output -- or 1.43 million barrels -- remained closed yesterday, while gas production was down by 88 percent, or 8.8 billion cubic feet, according to the Minerals Management Service, a unit of the Department of Interior. 
 Since Friday, a total of 4.6 million barrels, nearly 1 percent of the gulf's yearly output, has been lost. Nearly 80 percent of the gulf's manned platforms and three-quarters of the drilling rigs have been evacuated.
 The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port remained shut for a second day. It is one of the main crude oil-importing ports in the gulf, with a daily capacity of a million barrels. 
 The storm has sent the refining industry into a tailspin. Gasoline prices had already been rising in recent weeks, during peak summer demand, because of a series of accidents and shutdowns at refineries. One refiner, Valero, said it might take as much as two weeks to restart its St. Charles refinery in Louisiana.
 ''The U.S. refinery system has been showing some signs of severe tightness over the past months,'' Kevin Norrish, an analyst with Barclays Capital in London, said in a note. ''The shut-in of refining capacity from Katrina is then not so much a straw, but rather a large log on top of an already fully laden camel.''
 Energy prices across the board jumped on the Nymex yesterday. Natural gas prices gained 7.5 percent, to $11.659 a thousand cubic feet; heating oil futures rose 8.8 percent, to $2.0759 a gallon.
 The risk that high energy prices could have on the global economy -- and the political risk of seeing retail gasoline prices above $3 a gallon -- prompted the Bush administration on Monday to say that it would lend some crude oil from the nation's emergency stockpiles to refiners.
 To reduce the pressure on prices, the International Energy Agency, which coordinates the emergency response of industrialized countries, could direct its member states to release both crude oil and refined gasoline products to the United States. The agency, based in Paris, indicated that it was waiting for a full assessment of the damage before taking any such action.
 But in the short term, not much can be done to help lower prices.
 ''We already have built into this market retail prices of more than $3 a gallon, that's a certainty,'' said Ben Brockwell, the director of pricing with Oil Price Information Service, an independent trade publication. ''The question is how quickly we get there and how long they stay there.''
 ''The futures market is indicative of the direction of the market but substantially understates what's been happening on the physical markets,'' he said. 
 The storm's effects were made worse because commercial stocks of gasoline, which now stand at 20 days of demand, are at historic lows. On the other hand, with the end of the driving season after Labor Day, demand is expected to drop soon.
 Still, over the next few days, gasoline prices at service stations will reflect yesterday's price jump on Nymex. While there are not likely to be shortages, drivers will notice substantially higher prices at the pump. 
 ''The United States doesn't have to worry about gasoline lines but consumers need to worry about the price they pay this week,'' said Deborah White, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris. ''They should be prepared for a short-term shock. Only time can fix that.''

HEADLINE: Vermont Blends 'Green' Flush Toilets and a Greenhouse 

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: SHARON, Vt. 

 BODY:
It is a rare rest stop attraction, especially in Vermont, a humid greenhouse soon to be filled with orchids and other flora better suited to steamy jungles than snowy mountains.
 But this exotic enticement is possible here because of the most mundane of rest stop features: flushing toilets.
 The State of Vermont has installed a system that uses plants and organisms to clean wastewater at a rebuilt rest stop on Interstate 89 here, 10 miles northwest of White River Junction, and then pumps the treated water back to the toilets for reuse.
 State officials said the system, called a living machine, not only advanced so-called green construction, but also allowed the rest area to stay open and the country's first Vietnam veterans memorial, erected in 1982, to remain at the site. 
 ''Its purpose is two-fold,'' Gov. Jim Douglas said. ''We thought it was important to do something honoring our Vietnam veterans, and Vermont has a long tradition of environmental stewardship.'' 
 The rest stop, a $6.3 million complex that includes the toilets, the greenhouse, an array of Vermont tourism brochures and a newer, bigger Vietnam memorial, will open to the public in September.
 But the project is not without skeptics, who say that while the spot should be preserved for the veterans memorial, the additional bells and whistles are a waste of taxpayer money.
 ''Is this going to be a rest stop or a Four Seasons resort?'' Jim Kenyon of The Valley News of White River Junction wrote in a June 29 column critical of the cost. 
 Mr. Kenyon said politicians had been loath to question the cost because of potential political risks.
 State officials and the state's builders trade association said rest areas were expensive because the construction had to be sturdy enough for high use and because many spots on Vermont highways had poor drainage. The state completed two rest areas from 1999 to 2002 at a total cost of $12 million. Much of the money, like that for the Sharon rest stop, was federal highway money.
 Ed Von Turkovich, state director of buildings and environmental services, said the state was sensitive to cost, but thought the Sharon rest center would help promote Vermont's economy. 
 ''We think it will be a destination stop for veterans from around the country to come and pay their respects and see the first Vietnam memorial on the Interstate system,'' Mr. Von Turkovich said.
 The Sharon rest area was threatened with being shut down in the mid-1990's because of problems with sewage drainage. A coalition of veterans furiously lobbied Gov. Howard Dean and the legislature to spare the rest area, where the Vietnam memorial, a simple granite obelisk, had been placed for a particular reason.
 ''When it was put there in 1982, there were very specific reasons why,'' John Miner, president of the Vermont chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said. ''One was the proximity to the highway, which was used many times by people heading to Canada to flee the draft, and the area looks like Highway 1 in Vietnam.'' The legislature spared the rest area and committed to building a larger memorial, but officials were not sure how to remedy the drainage problem. The living machine, they said, was the perfect solution.
 The technology is used by businesses, schools and some local governments to purify toilet water, industrial runoff and contaminated bodies of water. People familiar with the technology say this is the first time a state has built a permanent rest area whose toilets run exclusively on a living machine. A few years ago, Vermont installed a temporary system at another rest stop that has been shut down. 
 In a living machine, the contents of a flushed toiled are pumped into a filtration system to rid them of odor and then into six concrete cylinders holding vegetation. The various plants are South Asian natives, a good choice both because of the Vietnam memorial and because their roots are well suited to host the organisms that eat the waste, converting it into plant food. 
 After the water is clean for reuse, it is pumped back into the toilets, to resume the cycle. Just to be safe, signs hanging over toilets warn users that the water, dyed blue for good measure, is nonpotable wastewater.
 In a wing of the building, in the glass greenhouse, visitors look down on the vegetation from a grated ledge. The room, which offers spectacular mountain views, smells like a combination of mulch and chlorine. 
 The building is heated and cooled by 24 geothermal wells. A similar system lies under the sidewalks to melt snow in the winter.
 ''This is a great idea,'' Virginia McCormack, 54, said as she stood in the women's restroom in mid-August shortly before a rededication of the Vietnam memorial. ''It makes much more sense than sucking clean water out of here.''
 In the center of the 6,000-square-foot rest area structure is a glass monument with the names of all 7,230 Vermonters who served in Vietnam. A timeline detailing major events around the United States, in Vermont and in Vietnam in the 1960's and 70's is on a stone wall to its left.
 Outside, beyond a small footbridge, the original memorial now stands in a small granite amphitheater. One hundred thirty-eight white slabs of marble protrude from its walls, representing Vermonters killed in the Vietnam era. Semicircles ringed in marble rise out of the ground, allowing visitors to sit.
 ''It's overwhelming,'' Chuck Delano, 58, a Vietnam veteran from Londonderry, N.H., said at the rededication. ''It's beautiful. I wasn't expecting anything like this.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Gets Lift in Lumber Fight With Canada

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Ian Austen reported from Ottawa for this article and Clifford Krauss from Toronto.

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The United States won a potentially major victory this week when the World Trade Organization ruled in an interim decision that the imposition of duties on Canadian softwood lumber did not violate international law.
 The W.T.O. decision, which may yet be appealed, broadly contradicts the conclusions of a special North American Free Trade Agreement panel that earlier this month instructed Washington to refund $5 billion in tariffs it had collected from Canadian softwood lumber exporters. That ruling was promptly rejected by the Bush administration.
The latest development in the decades-old trade dispute comes amid anger in Canada at the Bush administration's decision to ignore the Nafta arbitrators, and frustration with American challenges to a series of rulings that have mostly favored Canada. Senior Canadian officials are threatening retaliation on American products and even expressing doubts about the future of Nafta. 
 ''Canada has to take a stand,'' Industry Minister David Emerson said in a television interview. ''When it comes to negotiating with the United States, power seems to win out every day, every time.''
 Canada responded to Washington's snub by walking out of negotiations on the issue, while officials have hinted that Parliament could return early from summer vacation and impose tariffs on California wine and Florida orange juice. 
 The ratcheting up of language recently by several members of the cabinet as well as senior members of the opposition has brought the roughest patch in American-Canadian relations since Canada's refusal to join in the invasion of Iraq two years ago. 
 In the United States, the softwood lumber industry hailed this week's W.T.O. finding, the details of which remained confidential.
 ''It is a profoundly important decision,'' said Harry L. Clark, a lawyer who represents the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, an American softwood lumber group in Washington. ''What's really going on here is a Nafta panel system that's out of hand.''
 At the United States trade representative's office, Neena Moorjani, a spokeswoman, said in a statement that the preliminary finding confirmed that Canada had dumped and subsidized its softwood exports. 
 ''Despite this win, the United States believes that back-and-forth litigation won't solve this 20-year-old issue,'' Ms. Moorjani said. ''The best course of action is to come to a negotiated solution, and we look forward to the resumption of talks as soon as possible.''
 In Canada, however, trade officials and politicians rejected the idea that the W.T.O. finding was a setback, and continued to regard the Nafta panel as the final word on the matter. The Canadian trade minister, Jim Peterson, said Tuesday that the Nafta agreement trumped the W.T.O. in disputes involving the United States.
 ''We're going to examine this decision very carefully,'' Mr. Peterson told reporters in a conference calls. ''My message is very simple: We want the U.S. to live up to and respect the Nafta.''
 At the heart of the dispute is the fact that most wood in Canada is harvested from land owned by provincial governments. The United States industry, which largely takes its trees from private land, has long argued that Canadian provinces subsidize their lumber producers through artificially low cutting fees.
 The current round of the battle dates to 2002, when the United States International Trade Commission imposed tariffs as high as 28 percent. That has prompted about two dozen challenges by the Canadian government through Nafta, the W.T.O. and courts in the United States.
 After the rejection of its subsidy arguments, the International Trade Commission gathered additional evidence, expanded its reasons for an order against Canada and then went back to the W.T.O. It is that revised order, issued in December 2004, that was upheld by the W.T.O. in its preliminary ruling.
 The unanimous ruling from the challenge committee of Nafta this month, which Canada is promoting as the pivotal decision, only reviewed the 2002 trade order, not the most recent one. 
 It will now probably be up to the United States Court of International Trade, where Canada refiled a suit last week, to determine if the Canadian lumber industry gets refunds of the duties. But if the W.T.O.'s finding against Canada is ultimately upheld, as expected, it could greatly diminish Canada's ability to retaliate against the United States.
 In a recent meeting with The Ottawa Citizen editorial board, the United States ambassador to Canada, David H. Wilkins, called on Canadian politicians to stop their ''emotional tirades.'' 
 ''Emotional press conferences are not going to settle the issue,'' Mr. Wilkins said, adding that ''we could start talking about import barriers by Canada on certain goods, like dairy and egg products.''
 Prime Minister Paul Martin later responded, ''It's not emotional to state the facts, and the facts are that when you sign an agreement you should live up to its terms.''

Dance-Floor Focus Group
 Test audiences are a longtime staple of movie marketing. Now, a pop music star has borrowed the technique. Madonna, right, has chosen songs for her next album, ''Confessions on a Dancefloor,'' after trying them out on unsuspecting British night clubbers, The Sunday Telegraph reported. Stuart Price, 28, a D.J. and producer who is collaborating on the CD, said in an interview for the singer's Web site that the tunes, minus her vocals, were played in clubs in Liverpool, Ibiza and elsewhere in June, with the reaction of the crowds filmed for the singer. ''You can work on a song for 12 hours,'' Mr. Price said, ''but I guarantee you'll know within just 10 seconds of putting it on at a club whether it works or not. So these songs were tested on unwitting subjects throughout Europe.'' A spokesman for Madonna, 47, declined to comment. The album, from Warner Brothers Records, is scheduled for a November release.

Ozzfest Dust-Up
 It was a raucous performance on a raucous tour, but the commotion wasn't the band's doing. When Iron Maiden took the stage for its last appearance on the Ozzfest tour, this month in Devore, Calif., the group's sound was cut off several times. Last week, the tour's organizer, Sharon Osbourne, left, admitted she was responsible, Billboard.com reported. In a statement that took the form of an open letter to Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, Ms. Osbourne said her action came in response to derogatory remarks she said the group's singer, Bruce Dickinson, had made onstage about the tour and Black Sabbath, the group led by her husband, Ozzy Osbourne. ''Was Dickinson so naive to think that I was going to let him get away with'' comments about her family, she asked in the statement. She signed the letter as the ''real Iron Maiden.'' Mr. Smallwood said this week that he had ''never seen anything anywhere near as disgusting and unprofessional as what went on that night.''

Garfunkel and the Law
 The singer Art Garfunkel, below, is facing another charge of marijuana possession, again in upstate New York. The Daily Freeman of Kingston, N.Y., reported Tuesday that Mr. Garfunkel, 63, of Manhattan had been pulled over in Woodstock for failing to stop his car at a stop sign, and a trooper who smelled an odor had found a joint in his car ashtray. He was issued a ticket and is due back in Woodstock Town Court on Sept. 22. In January 2004, the singer was charged with marijuana possession after the state police stopped his limousine for speeding in the Ulster County town of Hurley and found a small amount of pot in his jacket. He pleaded guilty to that charge and paid $200 in fines.

Forget the Show
 Another performance would not make up for a canceled Las Vegas concert that is at the heart of a dispute between Rod Stewart, below, and Harrah's Entertainment, the company's head testified on Monday, The Associated Press reported. At a federal court in Las Vegas where the breach-of-contract suit was being heard, Gary Loveman, the chairman and chief executive of Harrah's, said the show, scheduled for New Year's Eve 2000 in the company's Rio hotel, was meant to celebrate the millennium and thus was expected to be a big draw. Mr. Loveman also said Mr. Stewart had refused at the last minute to perform a New Year's Eve 1999 show unless he was also hired for the 2000 date and paid $2 million in advance. Mr. Stewart's lawyer, Louis Miller, has said that the show was canceled because of the singer's operation for thyroid cancer in May 2000 and that Mr. Stewart offered to play a makeup date. The company is seeking the return of the $2 million. 

Composers With Cash
 Mozart famously died penniless. But it's less well known which composers were the wealthiest. A classical music station in Britain set out to estimate the earnings, adjusted for inflation, accrued in a composer's lifetime and came up with a list led by George Gershwin, above, The Guardian reported on Monday. Gershwin earned millions of dollars from ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' ''Summertime'' and many other compositions, ranking him ahead of Johann Strauss, who charged more than $50,000 an appearance. Verdi was third on the list; his take included a commissioning fee of nearly $300,000 for ''Aida.'' Rounding out the Top 10 in order were Rossini (who received more than $5,000 a lesson), Handel, Haydn, Rachmaninoff, Puccini, Paganini and Tchaikovsky. 

Theater Notes
 With ''The Phantom of the Opera'' on track to surpass ''Cats'' in January as the longest-running show in Broadway history, the Phantom who has logged the most stage time in the role on the Great White Way is returning to the show. Howard McGillin, who has played the masked one more than 1,200 times, will take over on Oct. 3 for Hugh Panaro, who has played the part more than 1,000 times. On Jan. 9 the show will break the longevity record with performance No. 7,486. ''The Producers'' will welcome back an original cast member. On Tuesday, Gary Beach, who left in 2003, returns to play Roger De Bris, the role for which he won a Tony Award. It's possible he could be on stage and screen in the same role at the same time: he also plays Roger De Bris in ''The Producers'' movie, scheduled for release in December. Though little is known about a Twyla Tharp show based on Bob Dylan songs, one mystery has been cleared up. The title will be ''The Times They Are A-Changin','' Broadway.com reported yesterday. It is set to play the Old Globe Theater in San Diego early next year. 

A Loan Criticized
 In 2001, the British prime minister, Tony Blair, lent a bronze bust of Winston Churchill to President Bush, a fan of the wartime leader, but the little-known gesture of friendship is drawing a great deal of attention now. The Observer in London reported on Sunday that the work, created in 1946 by Jacob Epstein after six sittings with his subject, is owned by the public British Government Art Collection, which is allowed to lend its holdings for display only on property owned by Britain. The collection has come under scrutiny for its handling of art worth millions of pounds, and the bust's move is being examined in a radio documentary to be broadcast on the BBC tomorrow. ''This is usually a well-run collection, but they should stick to their rules,'' Gill Hedley of the Contemporary Art Society told The Observer.

HEADLINE: Disease and Coordination Vie as Major Challenges

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN and KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
As they rushed medical equipment and experts to the Gulf Coast, federal officials warned yesterday that the public health consequences of Hurricane Katrina were likely to be enormous and long term.
 The officials said they were particularly worried about outbreaks of disease spread through sewage contamination of drinking water, spoiled food, insects, and bites from snakes and other animals.
Scores of people have already died by drowning or other causes, two by carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of gas-powered generators in poorly ventilated areas. An additional nine people are being treated for carbon monoxide poisoning, federal health officials said at a news conference in Atlanta, home of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 Rescue workers searched for the injured and disabled yesterday in an effort to prevent additional fatalities, and, trying to head off outbreaks of diarrheal disease, used helicopters to deliver food and safe drinking water.
 ''We're racing the clock'' to find stranded people, digging trapped victims out of collapsed concrete and metal, and providing food and water, Michael Chertoff, secretary of homeland security, said at the Atlanta news conference.
 In New Orleans, Tulane University Hospital and Clinic, which was surrounded by about four feet of water, lost both of its backup generators to the flooding and began evacuating all its 200 patients, 30 requiring critical care. H.C.A., which manages the hospital, hired 20 helicopters to land in succession on its helipad, atop a parking garage, and ferry the patients to Women's and Children's Hospital in Lafayette, La., and elsewhere. In addition to the patients, more than 800 others were stranded at the Tulane hospital and also required evacuation: members of the staff as well as their families, families of patients and people who had simply sought shelter there.
 The hospital had only portable generators remaining, which provided just enough power to run a small amount of equipment. Among the tasks was to light the helipad in the darkness last night. Because elevators were inoperable, members of the staff were carrying patients up the stairs.
 Karen Troyer-Caraway, a vice president of the hospital, said by telephone at 8:20 p.m., New Orleans time, that ''we are in absolute complete darkness,'' with only flashlights to guide those still there. 
 Michael O. Leavitt, secretary of health and human services, said his department was working to open up 1,000 hospital beds on an emergency basis in the Gulf Coast region.
 The disease control centers has sent basic supplies like first-aid and suture kits, sterile gloves, bandages, blankets and portable oxygen tanks from the national stockpile.
 In addition, the Public Health Service has deployed 38 doctors and nurses and has an additional 217 on stand-by.
 Experts warned that a major challenge would be to coordinate efforts by government and private organizations and the many health care workers who might voluntarily go to the region.
 But all the energy being expended in the initial phase of flood relief is likely to be dwarfed by what lies ahead.
 ''This is going to be a long-term event,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Sinks Jr., an epidemiologist at the C.D.C.
 The affected area is ''a couple of hundred miles wide, four to five times the geographic extent of Hurricane Andrew in 1992,'' Dr. Sinks said.
 Wherever rescue efforts take place, there will be concerns about injuries from falls, broken glass, downed wires and other hazards, said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University.
 Other worries will focus on bites from poisonous snakes like the cottonmouth, an excellent swimmer. Alligators could also be a menace, as could raccoons, which are capable of spreading rabies and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can lead to meningitis, kidney damage and liver failure. 
 Health workers will also have to deal with the long-term mental health problems that develop among the hurricane's survivors.
 Dr. Irwin Redlener, who directs the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Columbia School of Public Health, said yet another concern was that people might have lost or become separated from the drugs they rely on daily for diabetes, heart disease and other chronic ailments. Pharmacies in the affected areas may have insufficient stocks of vital drugs like insulin for diabetics, a circumstance creating a need to import and distribute essential medicines in the area. The shortage could go on for months, Dr. Redlener said.
 The poorest areas are expected to be hit hardest. Experience has shown, Dr. Redlener said, that ''the more underserved and more economically fragile a community is pre-disaster, the more we expect to see severe consequences after a disaster.''

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATIC FIELD LAGS IN CITY POLL

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
New York City Democrats are largely unimpressed with their field of mayoral candidates in the coming primary election, and nearly half of them believe that the Republican mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, deserves re-election, according to the latest New York Times poll.
 With two weeks to go before the Sept. 13 primary, more than a quarter of Democratic voters said they remained undecided. And half of Democrats said that if Mr. Bloomberg were in the Democratic primary they would vote for him, giving the mayor more than double the support of the next most popular candidate, Fernando Ferrer, in such a hypothetical matchup.
The poll showed Mr. Bloomberg in an enviable position as he heads to the November general election. It was a startling reversal for a mayor who two years ago had the lowest job approval rating in the history of the New York Times poll, 24 percent. Today, 59 percent of New Yorkers approve of the job he is doing, 9 percentage points higher than his previous high of 50 percent in late June. 
 But when voters were asked to choose among just the four Democratic candidates, Mr. Ferrer held a comfortable lead over his three main competitors, Anthony D. Weiner, C. Virginia Fields and Gifford Miller, all of whom were statistically tied for second place, with 13 percent, 12 percent and 10 percent respectively. But just 29 percent of registered Democrats said they would vote for Mr. Ferrer, and he needs 40 percent to avoid a runoff.
 The citywide poll, of 931 adults, was conducted by telephone between Aug. 22 and Aug. 28 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Of the total, 718 said they were registered to vote, and 448 of them said they were registered as Democrats. Results from those subgroups have margins of sampling error of plus or minus 4 and 5 percentage points respectively.
 The poll is a vivid portrait of Mr. Bloomberg's strength. After flooding television for months with more than $10 million in advertisements promoting his accomplishments, Mr. Bloomberg is soaring in popularity and job approval, the poll suggests. After various gaffes, misstatements and squabbles, the Democrats appear to be failing to wow voters or gain traction on any particular issue, even though they have started their advertising campaigns, so far spending a combined total of less than $4 million on advertisements.
 Mr. Bloomberg is getting high marks on his handling of the threat of terrorism and of the city's economy, as well as his overall management of the city, with a majority of those surveyed saying he is better equipped to oversee such matters than his Democratic opponents.
 But the Democrats do have lines of attack in areas where the mayor may be vulnerable.
 By a ratio of nearly three to one, respondents said a Democrat would do a better job of dealing with the problem of high housing costs than Mr. Bloomberg would. And 48 percent said a Democrat would do a better job of dealing with public schools than Mr. Bloomberg would. 
 In fact, the poll showed that 59 percent of respondents were not satisfied with the quality of the city's public schools. And respondents listed education and housing as the top issues they would like to see addressed during the next mayoral term.
 ''If the middle class and the lower class can't afford to live here anymore, then what does New York City become?'' asked one voter, Ted Bartles, 34, a production manager who said he was leaning toward voting for Mr. Ferrer because of his focus on the less fortunate. ''The Bloombergs and the Giulianis of the world don't think about that stuff,'' he said in an interview after the poll was completed.
 And in the good-news-bad-news department for city Democrats, only 17 percent of registered voters interviewed said they were paying close attention to the race. While that is another indication of apathy in the contest, it also leaves room for the Democrats to make a strong impression should more people begin thinking about the race during the two weeks before the primary.
 Democratic officials said in interviews yesterday that they were not surprised by the poll results but added that the race would shift as the candidates intensify their campaigns and voters pay closer attention.
 ''Months of uninterrupted advertising by the mayor has had an impact,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the New York State Democratic Committee. ''In the coming days and weeks Democrats will be increasingly getting out our side of the story, and this dynamic will change.''
 Nick Baldick, the campaign manager for Mr. Ferrer, said he considered it too early to put too much stock in polls, noting that his campaign greatly increased its level of advertising on Monday, after a couple of weeks of heavier advertising by Mr. Miller and Mr. Weiner.
 ''Polls go up, polls go down, but for two weeks now Gifford has been buying broadcast; we just started,'' Mr. Baldick said. ''I think you have to wait a week when we've been up, Anthony's been up, Gifford's been up.''
 Mr. Ferrer is in a position to know about volatility in the final days before a primary. In August 2001, polls showed him trailing the supposed front-runner in the race, Mark Green, by 10 percentage points. Mr. Ferrer went on to beat Mr. Green on Primary Day, but not by enough to avoid a runoff, which he lost.
 Should voter interest remain low this time around, Mr. Ferrer might be the biggest beneficiary, the poll indicates. When undecided voters are taken out of the equation, he is supported by 45 percent of Democrats, more than enough to avoid a runoff. But that assumes that all of those who have not yet made up their minds will not vote in the primary. And it assumes that those who have made up their minds will actually turn out to the polls.
 Jef Pollock, Mr. Ferrer's pollster, noted that when 8 percent of the Democrats surveyed who said they did not intend to vote in the primary are taken out, his support rises, to 31 percent. But, he said, ''getting to 40 percent is still hard; we're fighting every day.''
 Without the 8 percent who say they are not going to vote, the percentage of the primary vote for Mr. Miller, Ms. Fields and Mr. Weiner also goes up. But they remain in a statistical tie in the low teens, giving any of them a chance to face Mr. Ferrer in a runoff. 
 Still, Mr. Ferrer can take comfort in a lack of any statistically significant upward movement in the poll for any of his rivals since June. In fact, Ms. Fields' support in the Times poll dropped from 20 percent to 12 percent. And most voters still do not know enough about the Democratic candidates to offer an opinion about them.
 One respondent to the poll, Craig Casper, 35, from the Upper West Side, said of Ms. Fields, ''I have nothing against Virginia Fields, but she really hasn't wowed me as Manhattan borough president, either.'' He said he was leaning toward Mr. Bloomberg because, ''at this point I don't think any of the other candidates can really compare with or have the same clout as Bloomberg has.''
 Another respondent, Angela Harden, a social services worker from Brooklyn, said she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Miller in the primary because ''he pretty much says what he believes,'' but she indicated she would vote for Mr. Bloomberg in the general election.
 ''What cinched it for me this year was when I saw that he had the guts to dismantle the New York City Board of Education as it existed,'' she said. 
 At this point Mr. Bloomberg seems to be benefiting from an overall impression in this overwhelmingly Democratic city that he is not a typical Republican. More than half of respondents in the Times poll said they did not consider him to be one.
 ''I'm a Democrat and I think that the Democratic Party was supposed to be basically what Bloomberg is doing,'' said William Thomas, 50, a deputy warden for the city's Department of Correction and a Democrat. ''Something that is inclusive for everybody.''
 Still, even Mr. Bloomberg's aides doubt that his commanding lead over the Democratic field -- which ranges in the poll from 22 points over Mr. Ferrer to 29 points over Mr. Miller -- will exist to such a great extent come Election Day, Nov. 8.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Aug. 22 through Aug. 28 with 931 adults throughout New York City. Of these, 718 said they were registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish. The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of active residential exchanges across New York City. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to borough, sex, race, Hispanic origin, age and education. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New York City. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. It is plus or minus four points for registered voters, for instance, and 6 points for enrolled Democrats who said they definitely intended to vote in their party's primary election. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording, order or translation of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results. Complete questions and results are available at nytimes.com/metrocampaigns.


CORRECTION-DATE: September 3, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Wednesday about a New York Times poll finding that nearly half of New York City Democrats believe that the Republican mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, deserves re-election gave an erroneous figure in some copies for the amount he has spent on television advertising. It is more than $10 million, not more than $20 million. The article also gave an erroneous spelling in some copies for the surname of a poll respondent who said he was leaning toward voting for Fernando Ferrer, one of the Democratic candidates. He is Ted Bartles, not Barltes.

HEADLINE: Europe Leaves Trade Talks In China; U.S. Arrives

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and CHRIS BUCKLEY; Thomas Fuller reported from Paris for this article and Chris Buckley from Beijing.; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
China remained entangled in trade disputes with the world's two biggest economic superpowers Tuesday, as the United States pressed Beijing to reduce the flow of cheap textiles while Europe sought to pick up the pieces of its failed quota deal.
 The arrival of American negotiators in Beijing, after the departure of a European Union delegation Monday, underscored the pressures China faces in restricting its textile exports enough to quell protectionist sentiment in both the United States and Europe.
The latest round of talks between the United States and China comes as Washington is to decide Wednesday on six more ''safeguard'' restrictions that would cap Chinese exports. China is also under pressure to conclude a deal with Washington before President Hu Jintao's visit to the White House on Sept. 7. 
 So far, Beijing and Washington appear divided over how much export growth to allow in any settlement. With the prospects of a breakthrough uncertain, the trade dispute could shadow Mr. Hu's visit to Washington.
 Chinese trade officials and industry representatives said they were hoping for a compromise. ''The chances of this fourth round of consultations achieving substantial progress, and even signing an agreement, are rising,'' He Weiwen, a senior adviser to the Chinese Commerce Ministry, told The International Business Daily, a Chinese-language newspaper. 
 Meanwhile in Brussels, Peter Mandelson, Europe's trade chief, warned Tuesday that the union's agreement with China to limit textile exports for the next two years could collapse if European governments did not agree to accept the sweaters, bras, trousers and T-shirts now marooned in European ports.
 ''I am not confident the Shanghai textile agreement will be sustainable unless we release the goods currently held at the border,'' he said of the June quota deal, without elaborating. 
 The number of garments stranded at port grew to 84.4 million items Tuesday, up from 80 million Monday. Europe's retailers placed large orders for Chinese clothing ahead of the quota agreement, swiftly hitting the quota's limits.
 Addressing the European Parliament's trade panel, Mr. Mandelson's tone was markedly different from Monday, when he said the notion of clothing shortages was exaggerated. On Tuesday, he said that not letting the garments into Europe would cause ''severe economic pain for many smaller retailers and medium-sized businesses'' unable to find alternate suppliers at short notice. 
 ''It could mean some shortages during the autumn but, even more likely, higher consumer prices for many of our citizens who cannot afford to pay more for clothes,'' he said. 
 Retailers from across Europe, notably in Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, have warned that the blocked goods could hurt their bottom line. 
 Calls for new trade barriers increased in Brussels as a European Parliament committee adopted a resolution demanding that the European Union re-examine its commitment to global free trade.
 The resolution, which was likely to be ignored by the European Commission and the governments of Europe, nonetheless reflected some popular sentiment. It recommended taking ''immediate steps to prevent the current impasse over textiles from spreading to the bicycle, automobile, machinery and iron and steel industries,'' according to a statement by the Greens party, which sponsored it. 
 Europe's talks with China on the quota deal remained deadlocked Tuesday, and European governments had not yet decided how to handle the matter. Analysts said that United States and Chinese negotiators were closely watching the European impasse and the rising mountains of clothing. 
 Trade lawyers said American negotiators would probably consider a longer grace period before the effective date of any new quotas, to avoid Europe's mistake of not giving importers enough time to clear their orders.

PERSON: Jude Wanniski

HEADLINE: Jude Wanniski, 69, Journalist Who Coined the Term 'Supply-Side Economics'

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Jude Wanniski, a journalist, consultant and, most of all, a fierce and unconventional partisan who marshaled intellect and salesmanship to promote big tax cuts as the best cure for an ailing economy, a theory embraced and executed by President Reagan, died yesterday in Morristown, N.J. He was 69.
 The cause was a heart attack, according to a statement by Polyconomics, his consulting firm in Parsippany, N.J.
Mr. Wanniski coined the phrase ''supply-side economics'' to describe his idea that a reduction in personal tax rates would stimulate productive investment, the production side of the economy and spur economic growth. He immodestly called this idea, which he formulated in the early 1970's, ''a general theory of the world political economy.'' 
 Others viewed it as traditional Republican ''trickle down'' economics, meaning that the benefits accruing to wealthier taxpayers would filter throughout the economy. But, indisputably, the idea that tax cuts are almost always a good idea became a tenet of Republican, and many Democratic, campaigns.
 Mr. Wanniski waged his campaign in thousands of articles, most influentially in editorials he wrote for The Wall Street Journal during the 1970's. Though these editorials were unsigned, he worked hard at becoming known, once calling himself ''the most influential political economist of the last generation.''
 The columnist George Will, no shrinking violet himself, once remarked, ''I wish I was as confident about something as he is about everything.''
 Mr. Wanniski was eager to express big thoughts, like his explanation of the cause of the Depression in his 1978 book, ''The Way the World Works.'' He wrote that the day-to-day collapse of the stock market in 1929 coincided with votes on the Senate floor on the protectionist Smoot-Hawley tariff bill.
 National Review, a conservative magazine, called the book one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century. Mr. Wanniski suggested that the theories expressed in the book helped rehabilitate classical economics, as opposed to the Keynesian and monetarist theories, which were then clashing in a war of ideas.
 Since 1978, Mr. Wanniski had been president of Polyconomics, where he and his analysts advised corporations, investment banks and others. He has also been involved in political campaigns like that of Steve Forbes in 1996 for the Republican presidential nomination, which highlighted another novel economic idea: a single tax rate for everyone.
 How far Mr. Wanniski may have wandered from the traditional bounds of the Republican Party was suggested by his endorsement of Senator John F. Kerry in the 2004 presidential race. He called President Bush ''an imperialist.''
 Jude T. Wanniski was born on June 17, 1936, in Pottsville, Pa. His grandfather was a Pennsylvania coal miner and a dedicated Communist who gave his grandson a copy of ''Das Kapital'' for his high school graduation. He was raised in Brooklyn, and the Dodgers popped up regularly in his writings.
 He earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in journalism from the University of California, Los Angeles. He worked for The Las Vegas Review- Journal as a political columnist from 1961 to 1965 and reported to his next job as a Washington columnist for The National Observer in a silver convertible, shiny gold coat and mirrored sunglasses -- with a Las Vegas showgirl on his arm, according to ''Worldly Power: The Making of The Wall Street Journal'' by Edward Scharff.
 Robert L. Bartley, editor of The Journal's editorial page, hired Mr. Wanniski in 1972 as part of the team of bright and brash young conservative writers he had decided to field. The inspiration for supply-side economics partly came from Robert A. Mundell, an economist at Columbia University who had long championed tax cuts.
 The famous epiphany came when Arthur B. Laffer, an economist then at the Office of Management and Budget who had studied with Mr. Mundell, was sitting at a table in 1974 having drinks with Mr. Wanniski and Dick Cheney, then deputy White House chief of staff. Mr. Laffer drew on a cocktail napkin to explain his theory of how lower taxes generated greater economic growth, thus, almost miraculously, paying for themselves. That story became legend.
 Gradually, others joined The Journal in writing about supply-side economics. The columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak were early proponents, and in the late 1970's, BusinessWeek published articles about it.
 Mr. Wanniski, Mr. Bartley, the two economists and a few others met regularly to develop the theory. Mr. Wanniski was head cheerleader and chief propagandist -- ''a true zealot'' in his own words.
 Eventually, his political zeal became too much for The Journal's editorial page. Ray Shaw, then a top executive of Dow Jones & Company, The Journal's parent, saw Mr. Wanniski at a train station passing out literature for a New Jersey Republican running for the United States Senate. That was a violation of the company's ethical standards, and he was fired.
 Mr. Wanniski is survived by his wife, Patricia; his mother, Constance Wanniski; his sister, Ruth Necco; his brother, Terry; his sons, Matthew and Arnold; his daughter, Jennifer Harlan; and a granddaughter.
 In an interview in 2000 with The New York Observer, Mr. Wanniski characterized himself as a ''theologian,'' and supply-side economics as a ''mission.''
 ''I truly believe that I can save people and that the supply-side revolution can save the world from decline, poverty, disease and war,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Invasion of the Isolationists

BYLINE: By Francis Fukuyama. 
Francis Fukuyama, a professor of international political economy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is editorial board chairman of a new magazine, The American Interest.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
AS we mark four years since Sept. 11, 2001, one way to organize a review of what has happened in American foreign policy since that terrible day is with a question: To what extent has that policy flowed from the wellspring of American politics and culture, and to what extent has it flowed from the particularities of this president and this administration?
It is tempting to see continuity with the American character and foreign policy tradition in the Bush administration's response to 9/11, and many have done so. We have tended toward the forcefully unilateral when we have felt ourselves under duress; and we have spoken in highly idealistic cadences in such times, as well. Nevertheless, neither American political culture nor any underlying domestic pressures or constraints have determined the key decisions in American foreign policy since Sept. 11. 
 In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Americans would have allowed President Bush to lead them in any of several directions, and the nation was prepared to accept substantial risks and sacrifices. The Bush administration asked for no sacrifices from the average American, but after the quick fall of the Taliban it rolled the dice in a big way by moving to solve a longstanding problem only tangentially related to the threat from Al Qaeda -- Iraq. In the process, it squandered the overwhelming public mandate it had received after Sept. 11. At the same time, it alienated most of its close allies, many of whom have since engaged in ''soft balancing'' against American influence, and stirred up anti-Americanism in the Middle East.
 The Bush administration could instead have chosen to create a true alliance of democracies to fight the illiberal currents coming out of the Middle East. It could also have tightened economic sanctions and secured the return of arms inspectors to Iraq without going to war. It could have made a go at a new international regime to battle proliferation. All of these paths would have been in keeping with American foreign policy traditions. But Mr. Bush and his administration freely chose to do otherwise. 
 The administration's policy choices have not been restrained by domestic political concerns any more than by American foreign policy culture. Much has been made of the emergence of ''red state'' America, which supposedly constitutes the political base for President Bush's unilateralist foreign policy, and of the increased number of conservative Christians who supposedly shape the president's international agenda. But the extent and significance of these phenomena have been much exaggerated. 
 So much attention has been paid to these false determinants of administration policy that a different political dynamic has been underappreciated. Within the Republican Party, the Bush administration got support for the Iraq war from the neoconservatives (who lack a political base of their own but who provide considerable intellectual firepower) and from what Walter Russell Mead calls ''Jacksonian America'' -- American nationalists whose instincts lead them toward a pugnacious isolationism. 
 Happenstance then magnified this unlikely alliance. Failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the inability to prove relevant connections between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda left the president, by the time of his second inaugural address, justifying the war exclusively in neoconservative terms: that is, as part of an idealistic policy of political transformation of the broader Middle East. The president's Jacksonian base, which provides the bulk of the troops serving and dying in Iraq, has no natural affinity for such a policy but would not abandon the commander in chief in the middle of a war, particularly if there is clear hope of success. 
 This war coalition is fragile, however, and vulnerable to mishap. If Jacksonians begin to perceive the war as unwinnable or a failure, there will be little future support for an expansive foreign policy that focuses on promoting democracy. That in turn could drive the 2008 Republican presidential primaries in ways likely to affect the future of American foreign policy as a whole.
 Are we failing in Iraq? That's still unclear. The United States can control the situation militarily as long as it chooses to remain there in force, but our willingness to maintain the personnel levels necessary to stay the course is limited. The all-volunteer Army was never intended to fight a prolonged insurgency, and both the Army and Marine Corps face manpower and morale problems. While public support for staying in Iraq remains stable, powerful operational reasons are likely to drive the administration to lower force levels within the next year.
 With the failure to secure Sunni support for the constitution and splits within the Shiite community, it seems increasingly unlikely that a strong and cohesive Iraqi government will be in place anytime soon. Indeed, the problem now will be to prevent Iraq's constituent groups from looking to their own militias rather than to the government for protection. If the United States withdraws prematurely, Iraq will slide into greater chaos. That would set off a chain of unfortunate events that will further damage American credibility around the world and ensure that the United States remains preoccupied with the Middle East to the detriment of other important regions -- Asia, for example -- for years to come. 
 We do not know what outcome we will face in Iraq. We do know that four years after 9/11, our whole foreign policy seems destined to rise or fall on the outcome of a war only marginally related to the source of what befell us on that day. There was nothing inevitable about this. There is everything to be regretted about it.

HEADLINE: Casino Owners Look Toward Rebuilding

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

 BODY:
As Hurricane Katrina blew a destructive path through Biloxi, Miss., on Monday, the Grand Casino Biloxi, owned by Harrah's Entertainment, came unmoored and washed across U.S. 90. The giant casino, with its 134,200 square feet of gambling space, is probably a total loss, the company said. 
 ''It will have to be cut into pieces and moved out of there,'' Gary W. Loveman, Harrah's chief executive, told CNBC.
Harrah's Grand Casino Gulfport also suffered severe damage, the company said. The Casino Magic Biloxi, owned by Pinnacle Entertainment, sustained major damage as well, Pinnacle said. State rules in Mississippi require that casinos be built to float on water, rather than be placed on land, and in light of the heavy damage, that may be a requirement that the state and its casino owners now regret. 
 For years, gambling companies have chafed under state laws in Mississippi and elsewhere that require casinos to float. 
 The storm not only forced many Gulf Coast casinos to shut down indefinitely, but also put thousands of people out of work. The gambling industry employs more than 30,000 workers in Mississippi alone, and many could be idled for weeks or even months. 
 In a statement, Mr. Loveman pledged as much as 90 days' pay for workers.
 The casino closings could hurt Mississippi's ability to recover quickly. The state finances roughly 10 percent of its budget with tax revenues from gambling, and an interruption in those funds could hurt it as it shifts spending to help businesses and residents rebuild.
 The casinos had buoyed a formerly dismal tourism economy along the Gulf of Mexico, helping to bring the area up to the national average of about 1 percent of workers in tourism-related jobs, according to Steve Cochrane, a managing director at Economy.com. New Orleans, among nine cities Mr. Cochrane identified as vulnerable to the hurricane, has the strongest tourism base, with about 2 percent of workers employed in that category.
 Despite all the damage, some casino owners yesterday said they were already thinking about rebuilding bigger and better gambling sites. 
 And now the companies will be pressing the state to allow them to build on land, citing safety concerns.
 ''I'm sure that we will,'' said Allan B. Solomon, executive vice president for Isle of Capri Casinos. The company, based in Biloxi, owns a casino and large hotel there. Mr. Solomon, speaking from an office in Boca Raton, Fla., said he could not determine the property's condition as of yesterday afternoon. 
 Noting that Katrina was but the biggest of a series of hurricanes to batter the Southeast, Marc J. Falcone, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said in a report, ''we believe the Mississippi legislature will be more likely than ever to consider what we believe is critical legislation -- legalization of land-based casinos.''
 Mr. Falcone sees that, and possibly approval to build bigger and more luxurious casinos, as a silver lining for the industry. He and other analysts said the gambling companies are well-insured both for structural and equipment damage, as well as for business interruption. 
 Gamblers, meanwhile, tend to come back quickly. ''Vegas was back to close to normal in about 18 months after 9/11,'' said Dennis Forst, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets in Los Angeles. ''Customers forget about it.''
 Before many casino employees are back at work, Mr. Cochrane, the economist, said the region's economy will be feeling flush as insurance checks are cashed and a rebuilding boom occurs. ''There is sort of this perverse positive aspect to natural disasters,'' he said. By mid-September, he estimated, based on past disasters, construction work should be in full swing with workers drawn to the Gulf Coast from other regions.
 In the meantime, though, many businesses and their workers will be hurt. Good Time Tours, which operates 15 luxury buses between Pensacola, Fla., and Biloxi for day-trip gamblers, has nowhere to go for now, said Glen Hill, sales and marketing director. ''Predominantly we're a company that runs people back and forth to Biloxi,'' he said.
 The company, based in Pensacola, had been planning a mid-September tour -- the ''I survived Hurricane Ivan'' special.
 Trinity Tour and Travel, another among the 30 or so tour bus companies that carry gamblers to Biloxi, is likewise idle for now, said Ora Faulconer, sales manager. Watching television, she speculated, ''It's probably six months before they open over there.''
