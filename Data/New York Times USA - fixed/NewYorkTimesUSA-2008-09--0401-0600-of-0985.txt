HEADLINE: Auto Industry's Troubles Lead Big Decline in Industrial Output

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Government data shows the nation's industrial output plunged in August by nearly four times the amount that had been expected. It was the worst performance since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005. 
 The Federal Reserve reported Monday that industrial output dropped 1.1 percent last month, far worse than the 0.3 percent decline that economists had been expecting.
 The weakness was led by an 11.9 percent drop in production of motor vehicles and parts, reflecting the hard times facing the auto industry.
 The problems in autos contributed to a 1 percent overall drop in manufacturing, the first decline since a 0.9 percent fall in April.
 Production at the nation's utilities was off 3.2 percent in August after a 1.6 percent decline in July. Mild weather in much of the country last month contributed to lower demands for air-conditioning.
 Output in mining, the category that includes oil and gas drilling, fell 0.4 percent in August. The Fed said some of that weakness reflected precautionary shutdowns of oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of Hurricane Gustav.
 The manufacturing sector has been battered by a prolonged housing slump and feeble demand for autos, because of the weak economy and the big jump in gasoline prices that has occurred this year.
 The problems hurting domestic demand have been partly offset by a boom in export sales, helped by a weaker dollar. Economists worry, however, that that source of strength will come under pressure as some of America's biggest overseas markets in Europe and Asia face the threat of recessions.
 The 1.1 percent decline in total output in August came after gains of 0.1 percent in July and 0.2 percent in June, and was the largest drop since a 1.8 percent decline in September 2005.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Casualties

 BODY:
It is oddly reassuring that the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve let Lehman Brothers fail, did not subsidize the distress sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, and tried to line up loans for the American International Group, the troubled insurer, rather than making a loan themselves. Government intervention would have been seen either as a sign of extreme peril in the global financial system or of extreme weakness on the part of federal regulators.
 Instead, the dizzying events on Wall Street suggest that the system may be strong enough to absorb the downfall of Lehman and Merrill -- though the chaos at A.I.G. seems harder to swallow. However, the stock market's initial reaction -- a brutal drop, but not a Black Monday-style sell-off -- offered a ray of hope that the disruptions may be manageable. And, more important, barring the risk of cascading failures, regulators finally seem willing to hold Wall Street accountable for its mistakes. 
 Lehman's bankruptcy filing may even provide much-needed transparency to a financial system that has been hamstrung for more than a year by a lack of good information -- on who owns what and who owes how much and to whom. Lehman's creditors and other firms involved in its trades will now have to line up in bankruptcy court, detailing their positions for all to see -- and learn from. That did not happen in the spring when the Fed prevented a bankruptcy filing from Bear Stearns to avoid what it said would have been a systemwide failure. 
 Still, the disappearance in one weekend of two icons of American capitalism has negative repercussions, for taxpayers and for the economy.
 The Fed has broadened yet again its emergency-loan programs for Wall Street banks, agreeing to take risky and poor quality collateral, like junk bonds. That puts taxpayers at ever greater risk. Remember, the Federal Reserve already put the taxpayers on the hook by offering $29 billion in guarantees to quell the Bear crisis in March. This month, the Treasury Department pledged to make good if need be on trillions of dollars of obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 In addition to the sheer size of the government's commitments, the weakening economy is upping the odds that taxpayers will be footing the bill for the wipeout on Wall Street. As job losses have risen inexorably this year, foreclosures hit another record high in August -- 304,000 homes in some stage of default and 91,000 families losing their homes, according to RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed properties.
 As long as foreclosures continue, housing prices will continue to decline and banks and other financial firms will continue to suffer losses. Continuing losses, in turn, could force more taxpayer bailouts, by reigniting fears that ongoing failures may threaten the entire financial system. Preventing foreclosures is the key to stanching the crisis, but policy makers have been unconscionably slow to address that aspect of the crisis.
 It will require political will, but is not too late to try to decrease foreclosures by allowing homeowners to restructure their unaffordable mortgages in bankruptcy court. It is also not too late to stimulate the economy with intelligent government support, like aid to state and local governments, rather than campaign-year gestures like the tax rebates for virtually everyone that dominated the first stimulus package. 
 And it is certainly not too soon to look beyond the current crisis to the flaws and fallacies of the anti-regulatory ideology that has held Washington in its grip since the Reagan years and allowed the financial excesses that are now stressing the system to the breaking point. 
 Making and enforcing new rules is necessary, but that will not be enough. The nation needs a new perspective on the markets, one that acknowledges the self-destructive bent of unfettered capitalism and its ability, unchecked, to wreak havoc far beyond Wall Street.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Says Conflicts With Enclaves Shouldn't Keep Georgia Out of NATO

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY and STEPHEN CASTLE; Dan Bilefsky reported from Tbilisi, and Stephen Castle from Brussels. Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from Moscow.

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia 

 BODY:
The West should not use Georgia's conflicts with the Russian-backed breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as an excuse to keep Georgia out of NATO, the United States ambassador to the alliance said Monday.
 The NATO charter stipulates that potential members must resolve outstanding border issues before joining, which could block Georgia's aspirations. But the American ambassador, Kurt Volker, said in an interview that allowing Russia's actions to affect Georgia's chances of joining the alliance would be tantamount to the West's ''giving Russia a veto over Georgia's future.''
 In a two-day visit here, the NATO secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, and ambassadors from the 26 member nations inaugurated a NATO-Georgia commission, which Georgia hopes will help clear a path for its eventual membership. 
 But the war between Georgia and Russia has exposed deep fissures within NATO over how to respond to a newly assertive Russia, and Mr. de Hoop Scheffer made no commitment on when Georgia would be invited to join.
 In Brussels, European Union foreign ministers meeting on Monday sought to intensify pressure on Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia by affirming plans to send at least 200 peacekeepers to the Caucasus by the end of the month and promising Georgia up to about $710 million to help it rebuild areas destroyed in the war in August.
 Russia recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states last month and said it would maintain 7,600 troops in the enclaves, more than twice as many as before the war. 
 The United States and the European Union say this constitutes a breach of the cease-fire agreement, which called for all sides to withdraw to the positions they held before the hostilities began.
 NATO diplomats said that some members were increasingly concerned about the recent peace deal brokered by the European Union for the withdrawal of Russian troops, because Moscow interpreted it as allowing the troops to stay in the breakaway regions, in a violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and international law. 
 Moreover, Moscow has insisted that the European Union's 200 peacekeepers remain in areas just outside the territories, which could prevent them from closely monitoring Russian activities there.
 Georgia, for its part, is emphatic that European monitors be allowed to maintain the peace inside South Ossetia and Abkhazia, where ethnic tensions have risen since the end of the war.
 A NATO diplomat, requesting anonymity because he had not been authorized to speak on the matter, said, ''Unless the E.U. imposes conditions on Russia and is allowed to deploy across Ossetia and Abkhazia, then this risks becoming a frozen conflict, in which the E.U. monitors will be monitoring the Georgians while the Russians can do what they want.''
 The mission will be based in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and, at least initially, the peacekeepers will not enter South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although the European Union hopes they will have access to these areas eventually, the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said at the Brussels meeting. 
 Some European Union countries, led by Germany and France, have moved to block the Bush administration's efforts to bring Georgia and Ukraine into the alliance, mindful that if Georgia had already been in the alliance, the war last month could have led to a military confrontation with Russia. 
 Mr. Volker, the United States ambassador, was cautious on when Tbilisi would get a firm commitment to join.
 ''We stand with Georgia,'' he said. ''We want to be helpful. The actual decision on whether December is the time for the Membership Action Plan or not is something that will be taken later.''
 Some security analysts argued that the war with Russia had hindered rather than helped Georgia's NATO ambitions.
 Tomas Valasek, director of foreign policy and defense for the Center for European Reform in London, said the fighting last month made it less likely that Georgia would be offered membership this year. 
 ''One of the arguments on whether countries are ready for membership,'' he said, ''is whether they project stability.''

HEADLINE: Change Arrives, With a Sense That Wall St.'s Boom Times Are Over

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
The old Wall Street is giving way to a new one. 
 As the tectonic shifts within the American financial industry shook the world's markets on Monday, many experts predicted that events of the last 72 hours heralded a new period of painful change for Wall Street. 
 The predictions were sobering. Investment banks will be smaller. Their profits will be leaner. Jobs in finance will be scarcer. And the outsize role of Wall Street in the nation's economy will shrink. 
 That is the extreme case. But as investors tried to comprehend the abrupt downfall of two of Wall Street's mightiest firms -- Lehman Brothers, which spiraled into bankruptcy, and Merrill Lynch, which rushed into the arms of Bank of America -- even optimists said the immediate future would be difficult. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve are paving the way for the few strong survivors to lead an industry turnaround, while letting the weaker ones fail or be subsumed by larger rivals. 
 ''We've gone from a golden era of banking and financial services,'' Kenneth D. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, said in a press briefing on Monday, as the bank he heads prepared to buy Merrill Lynch. 
 ''It's going to be tougher,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''There are going to be fewer companies, and we are going to have to be better at what we do.''
 A debate is raging over what lies ahead for Wall Street now that only two major American investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, remain independent. While Wall Street has gone through tough times before only to emerge bigger and stronger, some question whether the industry can rebound quickly after using high levels of leverage, or borrowed money, to binge on risky investments. Those investments have proved to be disastrous. Worldwide, financial companies have reported more than $500 billion in charges and losses stemming from the credit crisis -- a figure some experts say could eventually exceed $1 trillion.
 Missteps in the mortgage market cost Merrill Lynch, a brokerage that is synonymous with Wall Street to many people on Main Street, more than $45 billion over the last year. Its sale could be a step toward the broader consolidation within the industry. 
 ''We are all in this business conditioned to cycles in crises and we're also conditioned to markets snapping back relatively quickly because the crisis can be identified and measured,'' said Donald B. Marron, chief executive of the private equity firm Lightyear Capital, which is focused on financial services, and former chief of PaineWebber Group. ''What's different now is you can't do either.''
 A marriage of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch in a sense would hark back to the past. During the Depression, Congress separated commercial banks, which take deposits and make loans, from investment banks, which underwrite and trade securities. The investment banks were allowed to do business with less oversight, while commercial banks operated with tighter supervision. 
 But after Congress repealed those Depression-era laws in 1999, commercial banks began muscling in on Wall Street's turf. As the new competition whittled down profit margins, investment banks used more of their capital to trade securities and also began developing financial derivatives to fuel profits. 
 Now, executives like John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill and a former Goldman executive, say investment banks will need large bases of deposits to shore up their capital for times of trouble. ''As we go forward, size is going to matter,'' Mr. Thain said Monday.
 Mr. Paulson has told Wall Street executives that he isn't happy about the shrinking number of investment banks, even though his own former firm, Goldman Sachs, is one of the two that are likely to benefit from the industry shakeout.
 Mr. Paulson has told executives that greater consolidation on Wall Street could increase risk in the financial system, because the risks will be concentrated in a smaller number of firms. But Treasury officials view risk as the lesser of two evils, if the alternative is to prop up sick firms and increase instability.
 Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expanding its back-door channel for financing what officials hope is an orderly shakeout on Wall Street. 
 But the Fed, and ultimately the taxpayers, could get left holding the bag. In allowing investment banks to post collateral that includes stocks, junk bonds and subprime mortgage-backed securities, the Fed said it would be mirroring the rules of two industry-operated overnight lending systems, known as tri-party repo systems, operated by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York. 
 Fed officials have themselves expressed concern that those lending programs needed to reassess their practices because lenders were holding collateral that might prove difficult to sell. In recent years, financial institutions have been making loans based on relatively less liquid assets, Donald Kohn, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned in a speech last May. 
 What seems to be clear to most everyone on Wall Street is that the era of high-octane trading profits and deals fueled by extreme bank borrowing is over, at least for now. That will clamp down profits across the industry for some time. Just as Americans are finding it harder to borrow to build a new room or to buy a new car, big players on Wall Street are being forced to rein in the amounts they borrow. 
 Borrowed money kept the lights on at investment banks like Lehman, because such pure investment banks do not have the consumer deposit base.
 Wall Street has always used other people's money to amplify its profit, but in recent years, the use of debt ballooned. The finance industry's credit market instruments increased more than one and a half times in the last decade, to $15 trillion last year, according to Moody'sEconomy.com, and climbed at a pace that was two times faster than the growth of the broad economy.
 At its peak last year, investment banks had borrowed $32 on average for every dollar of their assets, according to research from Ladenburg Thalmann. The borrowing helped the industry turn record profits, hire more people and pay out eye-popping bonuses. And it pumped up financial stocks, making them the largest segment of the Standard & Poor's 500-share index from 2001 until this spring.
 ''This is a bubble in financial services that was very similar to every other bubble,'' said Olivier Sarkozy, the head of financial service investing at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.
 Already, Wall Street firms are reducing their debt levels, and regulators are expected to create new rules about leverage, liquidity and capital levels. The rules, if strict, could force Goldman and Morgan Stanley to merge with a bank that has customer deposits, a steady source of capital, and thus is buffered from collapse. 
 Wall Street veterans are divided over the extent of the industry's problems. Some point out that Wall Street tends to go through a downturn or outright crisis every four or five years, and that it usually recovers quickly. But others argue what is happening now represents the end of a 30-year credit ''superbubble'' that affected the financial sector just as much as it did consumers.
 Whatever the case, the financial sector seems poised for lower paydays across the board. ''They can't borrow, so they're going to have cut down,'' said Peter J. Solomon, chairman of an independent investment bank that bears his name. ''As they cut down, they will have to fire people.''
 The weekend's events already increased analysts' expectations of job losses. Most of Lehman's 24,000 employees could lose their jobs, and Bank of America, the new owner of Merrill, is known for cost-cutting. Moody's Economy.com raised its New York area job-loss figures on Monday by 20,000 people, to 65,000 by 2010. 
 ''Massive leveraging created massive financial wealth, and that's over,'' said Orin Kramer, a partner at a hedge fund called Boston Provident and chair of the New Jersey State Investment Council.
 As Wall Street firms of all size reduce their borrowing to reduce risk, it comes in some cases at the cost of higher profits. The shift has forced senior executives to rethink business models, and more firms are focusing on their tried and true asset management units. Industry observers say the firms are grappling with the loss of relationship banking that occurred 30 years ago. 
 ''Wall Street for a number of years has been gripped by a quiet crisis, beneath all the financial wizardry and mathematical formulas, beneath all the financial engineering, there has been an increasingly desperate search for new sources of profit,'' said Ron Chernow, the author of a book about J. P. Morgan's empire, called ''The House of Morgan.''
 Wall Street reinvents itself all the time. Many executives say it will do so again, even as storied firms and others face questions about their futures. 
 ''This industry is a dynamic industry that has evolved in unanticipated ways in the last 30 years and created pools of earnings that previously did not exist,'' said James P. Gorman, co-president of Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: A Stylist Devoted to Making Idleness Look Chic

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Rachel Zoe, a blonde with a relaxed perm and roots that are visible on purpose, is a fashion stylist, which in her fortunate case means that she dresses celebrities, reportedly for up to $6,000 a day. As one of her assistants explained in the premiere episode of ''The Rachel Zoe Project'' (Tuesdays on Bravo): ''We don't just dress clients for award shows. We do premieres, personal appearances, personal shopping. We pretty much do everything.'' 
 Even that sells Ms. Zoe short. More than any other stylist working in Hollywood today, she doesn't merely peddle clothes, she emblazons an image, turning cipher nobodies into pretend somebodies. Although she has put grown women with viable acting careers into gowns -- Debra Messing, Cameron Diaz -- she is known more generally for forging a look of girlish vacancy, one that says: ''I get up at noon. And then I spend my day refusing solid foods.'' 
 A Starbucks cup is essential to the entire gestalt. If you have seen Mary-Kate Olsen, then you can envision Rachel Zoe. The look conveys idleness, and its uncanny effect has been to make people who don't do anything famous for doing nothing. Styling celebrities in her own strung-out '70s glam style -- Grecian tops over lean trousers, boxy miniskirts, visible clavicles, bug-eyed sunglasses, heavy gold necklaces, big rings -- Ms. Zoe has landed her clients on the pages of magazines like Us with an impressive regularity. 
 It was her foresight to notice that tabloids had pages to fill and couldn't always do that with photos of Angelina Jolie on her way to an orphanage. It is largely because of her that the name Nicole Richie is more familiar than the name Nicolas Sarkozy. The stylist is Frankenstein; all the world's Lindsay Lohans are her Creature.
 Given that Ms. Zoe is already a pox on humanity -- exploiting an aesthetic of dissipation, invading our collective consciousness and spraying it with dummy dust -- it is amazing that ''The Rachel Zoe Project,'' which focuses on her career, manages to send its audience deeper into the territory of smug NPR obsessives who won't stop ranting about triviality's conquest of the American soul. First I hated the show for passing Ms. Zoe off as an innovator when all she does is recycle a look that has held appeal since Tom Ford's days at Gucci. Then I hated it for turning me into Max von Sydow in ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' a cranky old person hungering for anachronisms. 
 How I cling to my memories of Diana Vreeland. Ms. Zoe replaces the fashion personality's eccentricity with perpetual dissatisfaction. She gets upset at an underling when rain water threatens to seep into her storage closet. She wants new pieces of furniture for her stark, modern Los Angeles house, even though she decorated it just two years ago.
 ''I love our furniture,'' she tells her husband, Rodger, ''but we've had it for a while.'' 
 His hesitation doesn't stop her. She charges ahead and buys an expensive credenza and a new sofa that looks exactly like her old sofa. ''I don't understand saving for the rainy day,'' she says. ''Live now. Live every day like it's your last day.'' Her whim isn't really driven by an inspiration for change: She wants furniture that she hopes will better brand her for a photo shoot for the British edition of Elle Decor. 
 When Ms. Zoe isn't talking about brand expansion -- ''I want to do my own clothing line. I want to do denim, obviously sunglasses, jewelry and bags''-- she is expanding her own wardrobe. At Decades, a well-known vintage store in Los Angeles, she picks up another Hermes Birkin bag. One of her assistants tries to dissuade her: ''You collect art. You don't collect Birkin.'' 
 ''The Real Housewives of Orange County'' has led the recent wave of reality programming about mad consumption. But it's a genre that feels downright unseemly as investment banks are dissolving, and unemployment stands at more than 6 percent. It isn't merely that ''Rachel Zoe'' lumbers along, asking us to get excited about a corporate work in progress -- it's also that the timing couldn't be nuttier.

HEADLINE: Firm's Creditors, Large and Small, Compete for a Piece of What's Left

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER and GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
 A worldwide battle began on Monday over the remains of Lehman Brothers as the biggest bankruptcy filing in history sent creditors scrambling to protect their investments. 
 Lawyers for global companies like JPMorgan Chase, the General Electric Capital Corporation and Credit Suisse rushed into court, as well as small investors, like Arapahoe County, Colo., and the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District in the suburbs of Dallas. All may be owed money by Lehman and want to preserve their interests in its reorganization, which will be overseen by a bankruptcy judge.
 Complicating matters greatly, some of Lehman's complex contracts, particularly credit default swaps, could allow some companies that owe Lehman money to walk away and other companies that are owed money to try to collect outside of bankruptcy court.
 Lehman lists total assets of $639 billion -- more than the gross domestic product of Argentina and roughly 10 times the size of Enron when it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. As the company's lawyers wrote in one court filing, ''That this case is large and complex is an understatement.'' 
 Still, everyone working on the carcass knows that taking too much time to sort things out will result in less money for creditors. 
 ''The lesson generally from these cases in terms of companies that own financial assets is that time is of the essence,'' said Luc A. Despins, a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy who advised a committee of creditors in the Enron bankruptcy. ''If you want to recover the maximum value possible, you have to move really fast, because any value there now may be frittering away.'' 
 How companies around the world weather the ripple effect of Lehman's collapse is a crucial question in coming days and weeks, lawyers said. Some smaller companies that relied on Lehman to provide capital could suddenly lose access to liquidity and fail, lawyers warned.
 ''I'm just wondering how that's going to affect all of these regional banks across the country as well as in Europe, as well as in Asia,'' said Peter Antoszyk, a partner at Proskauer Rose in Boston. ''That's sort of been the bogeyman that's been out there for a while.''
 The combination of Lehman's size and the complexity of its financial transactions promises to make bankruptcy proceedings quite difficult. Banks in Japan, Singapore and of course New York are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by Lehman and appeared on its initial list of 30 large creditors.
 While the holding company filed for bankruptcy protection, the broker dealer and other units aim to continue operating as normally as possible, with some, like Neuberger Berman, still moving toward a sale. 
 ''With this kind of business, I think the risk is that you have sort of a domino effect, the pieces start falling over and they can't keep anything together,'' said David Frauman, a partner in the London office of Allen & Overy.
 Guiding Lehman through the labyrinth will be Harvey R. Miller, a lawyer at Weil, Gotshal & Manges who has handled challenging corporate meltdowns in the past, notably the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990. But that was before the financial world was so thoroughly intertwined and before derivatives blossomed; today it is more difficult to figure out who was owed how much.
 Lehman asked the bankruptcy court to issue an order stating that bankruptcy law barred proceeding with claims against the company once it had filed for Chapter 11 protection -- something that people outside the United States might not know. Lehman lawyers are trying to protect its operations in other countries from being hauled into court by an angry party seeking to enforce a contract.
 Lawyers for Lehman made a strategic decision not to file for Chapter 11 protection for all of the company's subsidiaries, perhaps hoping to sidestep a problem that came up in the bankruptcy of Refco a few years ago. Under bankruptcy law, a brokerage firm must return customers' securities, and those securities are not included among the assets available to satisfy creditors; if that were Lehman's case, there might be little left after all the investment bank's customers were paid off.
 ''They do not want to join that issue right away,'' said one New York bankruptcy lawyer, whose law firm had advised Lehman on other matters and who therefore would speak only on condition of anonymity. ''I think they're probably hoping to negotiate through it.''
 Adding to the uncertainty in the Lehman filing is the unusual treatment assigned to derivative contracts in a bankruptcy. Under the 2005 bankruptcy reform, Congress once again exempted derivatives from the automatic stay that prevents creditors from collecting what they are owed by a company that files for bankruptcy. 
 Because derivatives are not subject to an automatic stay, their holders can close out the arrangements with a party in bankruptcy even as other contracts are frozen. While this does not mean that derivatives holders can jump ahead of other Lehman creditors to get the money they say they are owed, theirs are unsecured claims, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
 ''People are terminating their contracts with Lehman,'' said Robert G. Pickel, chief executive of the association. ''People are trying to close those positions and come up with values.''
 But legal experts say that exempting derivatives from the automatic stay can make it harder to track down parties that owe money to Lehman on such contracts. 
 ''People who have a contract that looks dicey now would rather just wash their hands of it,'' said David A. Skeel Jr., a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an authority on the treatment of derivatives in bankruptcy. ''This sets up a circumstance where these people can try to slip away into the night. It is a waste of precious time for the bankruptcy trustee to have to chase people down.'' 
 The market for derivatives contracts has grown significantly in recent years. The total value of credit default swaps, a type of insurance policy that protects against a corporation's defaulting on its debt, stood at $62 trillion recently. Derivatives transactions are struck privately and the market is unregulated, with no central exchange where trades are disclosed. 
 Lehman was one of the 10 largest parties in the market for credit default swaps, according to a Fitch Ratings report last year. In its most recent quarterly filing, Lehman reported $729 billion in total derivatives bought and sold, with a net fair value of $16.6 billion. 
 While the $16.6 billion would be considered an asset if in fact the contracts remained on its books and held their value, it is unclear whether the firm would be able to recoup that money. 
 ''The really interesting question that no one knows the answer to is, if you were to go into liquidation and sell off all the derivatives contracts, what is the value?'' said Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of San Diego and author of ''Infectious Greed: How Deceit and Risk Corrupted the Financial Markets.'' ''We are just learning that no one, not even the senior people within these banks, knows how much these contracts are worth.''
 Smaller investors around the world can take heart that they are in good company as they grapple with what a Lehman bankruptcy means for them.
 ''What we are looking at is just keeping track of the case in case they own any property inside our school district that we might have tax claims on,'' said Andrea Sheehan, the lawyer representing the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District in suburban Dallas. Because not all of Lehman's subsidiaries have filed for Chapter 11 protection, she said, it is not yet clear what they might own or where.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Declines, Trading Below $100

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After more than six months in triple-digit territory, oil prices dropped sharply on Monday, falling under the symbolic $100-a-barrel threshold as Wall Street's woes raised concerns about a slowing economy and slackening oil demand. 
 Oil futures in New York settled at $95.71 a barrel, down $5.47, their lowest level since February. 
 Uncharacteristically, oil and gasoline prices moved in opposite directions, with gasoline up 16 cents a gallon nationwide in recent days because of refinery disruptions caused by Hurricane Ike.
 Ike wreaked havoc along the Texas coast over the weekend. While it apparently caused only moderate damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and to refineries along the coast, those refineries had to shut down ahead of the storm, and many have yet to restart because of power failures. 
 That oil prices are falling despite the hurricane reflects a deep shift in the market's sentiment in recent weeks. Oil prices peaked at $145.29 a barrel in July but have since been falling as oil consumption has slowed markedly in Western countries. Some analysts expect oil prices to continue the slide in coming weeks, given the crisis on Wall Street and the darkening economic outlook.
 ''Wall Street now has everybody worried about the global economy,'' said Adam E. Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank. 
 Early this year, some analysts predicted that surging demand and the limited growth in new supplies would push oil prices to $200 a barrel by the end of the year. Many are now scaling back their forecasts. Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Eni, Italy's largest oil company, predicted on Saturday that the slowdown may push prices to $70 a barrel, a level that could bring average gasoline prices below $3.50 a gallon nationwide.
 In a sign that the lower oil prices will eventually reach consumers, contracts for future delivery of gasoline dipped sharply in New York trading.
 But the storm-related disruption in the gasoline market could continue for several weeks, analysts said. Gas at the pump rose to a nationwide average of $3.84 a gallon on Monday compared with $3.68 last week, according to AAA, the automobile group.
 President Bush said Monday that the storm had created ''an upward pressure on prices.'' In some parts of the country, shortages pushed gas above $5 a gallon.
 ''There's going to be a pinch,'' the president said after a briefing on hurricane recovery efforts. ''I wish it wasn't the case, but it is.''
 Ike, which came ashore near Galveston on Saturday, forced the closing of 14 refineries in Texas and Louisiana, or about 20 percent of the nation's refining capacity. Along with another hurricane two weeks earlier, it shut down all oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, or about a quarter of the nation's domestic production.
 Exxon Mobil said that its refinery in Beaumont, Tex., the nation's third-largest, was the most seriously hit when a storm surge flooded it. At the nation's largest refinery in Baytown, Exxon said power had been restored and the refinery sustained only limited damage.
 The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the nation's largest import terminal in the gulf, resumed offloading tankers on Monday, and both the Colonial and Plantation pipelines, two major product pipelines going from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, were operating at reduced flow rates, according to the Energy Department. 
 In contrast to the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, which led to extended power cuts that delayed refining operations, oil companies and utilities seemed better prepared this time. But energy executives and analysts cautioned that it was too early to say how long it would take to restore operations.
 ''My guess is the market thinks the hurricane was not as damaging as it might have been,'' said Roger B. Plank, executive vice president of the Apache Corporation, a large oil producer in the gulf. ''But I think it's premature to determine when production will be restored.'' 
 Power failures from the earlier hurricane, Gustav, are still slowing pipeline deliveries from Louisiana. Apache crews were flying over some of its hundreds of gulf platforms, and Mr. Plank said it was ''too early'' to make a general assessment of damages. 
 The Energy Department said it would make oil from the nation's petroleum reserves available to refiners to offset crude shortfalls. On Monday, Citgo Petroleum requested one million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Energy Department so far has approved loans for more than 900,000 barrels of oil this month.
 Many analysts are unsure how low oil prices will fall. Last week, the OPEC cartel signaled that it was concerned about prices reaching $100 a barrel. But Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, indicated it would keep pumping oil to get prices down to more manageable levels. ''The Saudis have been clear,'' Mr. Sieminski said. ''They think the global economy has got issues, and they would like prices to be lower for a while.''
 Oil demand remains the biggest wild card. Higher prices have caused consumers in developed countries, including the United States, to cut back on gasoline use. But in other parts of the world, particularly in developing economies in Asia and the Middle East, the demand remains strong. 
 ''Clearly we're in bearish territory, but not everything is bearish out there,'' said Michael Wittner, the global head for oil research at Societe Generale, in London. ''The bullish long-term story, Asia-led demand growth meets maturing and more expensive supplies, is still there.''

HEADLINE: Capitol Strives to Define 'Homeless'

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With unemployment and foreclosures rising and growing numbers of families struggling to find affordable housing, lawmakers in Congress are debating who should be considered homeless.
 For more than 20 years, federal housing law has counted as homeless only people living on the streets or in shelters. But now the House and the Senate are considering an expansion of the definition to include people precariously housed: those doubled up with friends or relatives or living day to day in motels, with money and options running out.
 In the House, which is expected to vote on the issue this month, lawmakers are discussing whether to expand the definition to include about a million additional people -- a subset within the group of children and their families in desperate need of stable housing -- or to add a much smaller group that would include only people fleeing their homes because of domestic violence and those who can prove they will lose their housing within 14 days. 
 The Senate is considering a still narrower expansion that would include only those forced to move three times in one year or twice in 21 days. Congressional aides say senators are willing to expand the definition further in consultations with the House that are now under way, but the Senate legislation is not expected to pass before lawmakers recess this month. 
 The outcome of the discussions will most likely broaden the categories of people eligible for emergency shelter, housing and other services provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's $1.7 billion budget for the homeless, which accounts for most federal spending on homelessness. Bush administration officials support the narrow expansion under consideration in the House.
 But none of the bills come with any additional financing. And with too few shelter beds and services available to help the homeless who are already living on the streets, the debate over whether to expand significantly the pool of people eligible for such limited aid has sharply divided advocates for the homeless and upended political alliances.
 In the House, Democratic leaders who pride themselves on their commitment to the poor find themselves arguing that there is simply too little money available to accommodate a broad expansion of the definition, and too little time left in the current Congress to accommodate any realistic expectation that new money can be added.
 Some House Republicans, meanwhile, accuse the Democrats of turning their backs on hundreds of thousands of struggling families who are forced to move from couch to couch and from house to house to keep a roof over their heads.
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said, ''It's one of the saddest things that we deal with, and it's entirely the result of inadequate funding.''
 ''When there's not enough money to cover 'all of the above,' you have to do priorities,'' Mr. Frank said. ''The question is, Which category of people are you going to leave unhelped?''
 He and other Democrats blame President Bush and Republicans in Congress, saying they have directed critical resources toward tax cuts and the war in Iraq instead of making programs for the poor a priority.
 Still, Mr. Frank has promised to keep negotiating with Republicans to reach agreement on a definition before the bill goes to a vote. And to help ease the strain where strict definition intersects with limited federal money, the bill would also give communities some flexibility in spending those dollars on people who do not meet the definition.
 The issue is particularly complicated because HUD's narrow definition of homelessness is not the only one used by the government. The Education Department, for instance, which assists homeless students, counts as homeless those children who live doubled up with other families or in motels.
 In the 2006-7 school year, the Education Department categorized 688,174 children as homeless. But only 32 percent of those children lived in shelters or outdoors. The rest failed to meet HUD's criteria for homelessness and so were ineligible to receive emergency shelter or priority on waiting lists for public or subsidized housing. 
 Several advocacy groups, including the National Coalition for the Homeless, argue that the HUD definition should more closely mirror the Education Department's. Their efforts have been championed by two House Republicans, Representatives Judy Biggert of Illinois and Geoff Davis of Kentucky, who would like those children identified as homeless by the Education Department or other federal agencies to be eligible for HUD's homelessness services.
 These advocates note that many families live in communities where shelters are full or nonexistent. In other places, some say, shelters sometimes bar large families, families with two parents or those with boys older than 10.
 ''I think we have to take care of our most vulnerable,'' Ms. Biggert said. ''Shouldn't children as well as the others be a priority?''
 Barbara Duffield, policy director at the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth, echoed those concerns. ''This is really about our nation acknowledging the extent of the housing crisis and the devastation it wreaks on children, youth and family,'' she said. ''The housing crisis is bigger than the emergency system put in place to address it 20 years ago.''
 Opponents of a broad expansion of the definition counter that demand for shelter beds already exceeds supply. About 700,000 people live in shelters or on the streets on any given day, housing officials say. But federal dollars finance only 170,000 beds. 
 Some advocates also fear that communities would shift resources from single, mentally ill or addicted people to doubled-up families who were newly classified as homeless. Such families are typically easier to serve and politically more appealing.
 ''Nobody thinks that these families are having an easy time of it,'' said Steve Berg, vice president for programs and policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. ''But when push comes to shove, when you've got people in apartments and people in shelters and on the streets, the people in the latter group need the help more.''
 No one knows precisely how many additional families would be helped by the modest expansion proposals under consideration in Congress, particularly since in practice, HUD already allows for a bit more than the current definition: it permits families who are doubled up to be considered homeless if they can show that they will be losing their housing within seven days.
 Whatever the number, ''we need to deal with the most desperate the best that we can and keep working'' toward greater expansion, said Representative Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. ''We don't want to create competition and have people at each other's throats for limited space.''

HEADLINE: Jury Selection Begins in Murder Trial of 7-Year-Old Brooklyn Girl's Mother

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
By way of introduction, the judge told prospective jurors in a Brooklyn courtroom on Monday that the case involved the death of a 7-year-old girl named Nixzmary Brown.
 ''The defendant in this case, Nixzaliz Santiago, is Nixzmary Brown's natural mother,'' the judge, Patricia M. DiMango of State Supreme Court, told the panel. 
 At that news, mouths opened and a wave of quiet gasps whispered through the jury box. Widened eyes focused on the heavyset woman in the brown blouse seated across the room beside her lawyers. 
 After a winding two-and-a-half year journey through the justice system, Ms. Santiago, 30, is finally going on trial, charged with murdering her daughter in 2006. The brutal beating death stunned the city and prompted an overhaul of the child welfare system.
 Nixzmary's stepfather, Cesar Rodriguez, 29, was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter earlier this year. He was sentenced to 26 1/3 to 29 years in prison. While Mr. Rodriguez was, by all accounts, the one who inflicted most of Nixzmary's injuries, Ms. Santiago, through a combination of prosecutorial discretion and timing, has been charged more harshly. 
 And if prospective jurors' comments were any indication, Ms. Santiago, as the girl's mother, may be held to a particularly high standard.
 ''The biggest part of being a mother is protecting a child from the world,'' a candidate for the jury, Melinda Reyes, told prosecutors on Monday when she was asked what it meant to be a parent.
 Ms. Reyes was dismissed from the jury pool by Ms. Santiago's lawyers, but her words echoed those of several jurors at Mr. Rodriguez's trial, who said that a mother had a higher duty to protect her children than a father or, in Mr. Rodriguez's case, a stepfather.
 Ms. Santiago is charged with second-degree murder, as was Mr. Rodriguez. But in the wake of his acquittal on the murder charge -- and after a conviction in a similar case in Manhattan -- prosecutors modified the charges against Ms. Santiago in July. 
 Originally, she, like Mr. Rodriguez, was charged with causing the girl's death by engaging in behavior that created a ''grave risk of death.'' Now, in addition, Ms. Santiago's murder charge has been amended to include the claim that she engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of ''serious physical injury.'' In the Manhattan case, a woman was acquitted of murdering her 2-year-old son under the first theory but convicted under the second.
 Ms. Santiago is accused in part of failing to get medical help for Nixzmary as she lay mortally injured in her family's apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
 Prosecutors declined to discuss their reason for adjusting Ms. Santiago's murder charge.
 Ms. Santiago's lawyers have said they intended to argue that she was so psychologically terrorized and traumatized by Mr. Rodriguez that she was incapable of protecting and helping Nixzmary. 
 This ''battered woman'' defense, usually invoked when women are charged with violence against their mates, has rarely been used in New York cases where women have been charged with harming their children. In earlier hearings, Ms. Santiago's lawyers submitted psychological reports depicting her as depressed, paranoid and unintelligent. On her bedroom dresser, according to testimony at Mr. Rodriguez's trial, Ms. Santiago kept a jar containing part of a fetus she had miscarried two months before Nixzmary's death.
 Nixzmary, a rail-thin girl who weighed as much as an average 4-year-old when she died, lived with five siblings and Ms. Santiago and Mr. Rodriguez, an unemployed security guard, in a three-bedroom apartment on Greene Avenue. There, she was subjected to frequent beatings and was isolated in a room where she was tied to a chair and forced to use a cat litter box.
 One evening in early January 2006, Nixzmary apparently took a container of pudding from the refrigerator without permission and jammed Mr. Rodriguez's computer printer with toys. Mr. Rodriguez told the police that he pounded her with his fists, held her head under cold water in the tub and left her naked on a bedroom floor. She lost consciousness a few hours later and was soon dead.
 What Ms. Santiago knew about Nixzmary's condition and when she knew it is likely to be a main focus at the trial. Prosecutors have charged her for her conduct in a two-month window leading up to Nixzmary's death. 
 Ms. Santiago told the police that on the last night of Nixzmary's life, she asked Mr. Rodriguez to stop beating the girl. She said she heard loud banging coming from the bathroom and her daughter moaning in pain, but was too busy with another child to go to her. Ms. Santiago said in an earlier court hearing that she later found Nixzmary cold but conscious on the bedroom floor, tried to warm her up, then left her again.
 Hours later, she told police, ''my son Javier told me my daughter was not making noise anymore.''
 By the end of Monday's session, the lawyers had chosen three jurors. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Europeans have long viewed Wall Street with a mix of awe, envy and skepticism, but the kind of gloating that might have accompanied the collapse of a Wall Street titan like Lehman Brothers in the past has been muted by fears of what it portends for Europe's own increasingly global financial institutions.
 ''Europeans like to have a bit of schadenfreude about the U.S., but not too much, because when it gets serious, we're all in the same boat,'' said Nicolas Veron, a research fellow at Bruegel, a research center in Brussels that focuses on Europe's place in the global economy. 
 Even a bank like UBS, which once embodied the conservative virtues espoused by Swiss bankers, has suffered tens of billions in losses because of its exposure to risky mortgage debt in the United States. On Monday, shares of UBS, which is based in Zurich, fell 14.5 percent, nearing an 11-year low, amid fears that the bank would be forced to take billions more in write-downs. Meanwhile, the Belgian bank Dexia announced that it owned unsecured Lehman bonds worth 500 million euros ($713 million), with additional exposure possible. Shares of Dexia fell 9.2 percent.
 But, most of all, the events of the weekend and Monday capped months of growing doubt about the so-called American model of investment banking.
 ''In Europe, there's a prevailing sense that the business model of the free-standing, highly leveraged investment bank that funds itself in the wholesale financial markets is virtually kaput,'' said Willem H. Buiter, a professor at the London School of Economics. 
 ''The pure investment bank was an American specialty,'' he added. ''But we've now seen three major American investment banks go down, so this model looks like a weakness, not a strength in a down market.''
 Indeed, the extraordinary fall of Lehman and the humbling of Merrill Lynch come as a shock to European bankers and business leaders who have long seen Wall Street as an extension of American power and have tried unsuccessfully to replicate the aggressive style and extraordinary profits of American investment banks.
 ''The financial sector was one of the main strengths of the United States, and the U.S. in general will be weakened by this,'' said Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chairman of Vivendi, the French entertainment giant, and a board member of several giant European companies. ''I hope there is enough strength and life in the country to rebound.''
 Across Europe, bank accountants and securities analysts nervously crunched numbers all day Monday, trying to determine how much pain Lehman might cause across the Atlantic.
 ''It's very difficult to see what the exposure is,'' said Pascal Decque, a banking analyst with Natixis in Paris. ''These are complex products and they can't do the pricing immediately. Some banks are still trying to figure out precisely what's on their balance sheet.''
 Despite the possibility of more pain to come, the news from New York also confirmed some of the darker suspicions many ordinary Europeans have long held about Wall Street and its outsize influence.
 ''The average European has a view that Wall Street is an extremely powerful center, and thinks finance is a pejorative word,'' said Charles Wyplosz, director of the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies in Geneva. ''A number of people will use it to say the U.S. model of capitalism isn't working.''
 Within the world of banking itself, there have been longstanding differences between the European and American approaches.
 While traditional ''universal'' banks like Deutsche Bank and UBS have long dominated the Continent, brash independent Wall Street investment banks like Lehman, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch muscled in on more profitable sectors like trading and underwriting in recent years, both in the United States and around the globe.
 Over the last two decades, the European banks have made costly attempts to emulate the investment banking model. UBS bought Dillon Read and Paine Webber and Deutsche Bank acquired Bankers Trust.
 With the disappearance of Bear and Lehman, and the absorption of Merrill into Bank of America, it appears that the European model has triumphed for the time being.
 In the wake of the events this weekend, ''I've heard people saying, 'I told you so,' arguing the European universal model is better,'' Mr. Wyplosz said. ''I'm not sure I buy that.''
 Europe may end up with some winners from the subprime mess, along with losers like UBS -- particularly in Germany, where the financial sector, long considered stodgy, stuck to its basic recipe of cultivating long-term relationships with big industrial companies and conservative retail clients.
 As a result, Commerzbank had the cash to execute its biggest-ever acquisition this month: a deal to buy Dresdner Bank from Allianz, an insurer that took its lumps in the financial crisis and decided to end a seven-year experiment in banking. Commerzbank is promising shareholders that it will steer clear of the volatile proprietary trading that burned so many over the last year in favor of an emphasis on less glamorous retail banking and expansion into Eastern Europe.
 And though Deutsche Bank suffered about $11 billion in losses linked to financial market chaos, it still managed to pay 2.8 billion euros ($3.99 billion) for a major stake in Postbank, the last big listed German lender that was for sale.
 On the other hand, though no big German bank suffered the same fate as Lehman, a few were laid low. The state lender SachsenLB was sold amid subprime-linked losses, while IKB Deutsche Industriebank went to the private equity firm Lone Star for a pittance.
 ''At the beginning of the crisis I heard a lot of schadenfreude,'' said Wolfgang Gerke, a professor of finance at the University of Erlangen in Germany. ''But after a year, everybody has ended up with a black eye here.''

HEADLINE: Stadium Perks For City Officials Raise Questions

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Rank has its privileges everywhere else -- so why not here?
That was the thinking, to hear city officials tell it, that drove them to demand free luxury suites and first dibs on the best available seats at the stadiums being built for the Yankees and the Mets.
The perks, which were negotiated in 2006 but came to light only in July, have antagonized fans, who are being asked to swallow higher ticket prices in the new ballparks. And they have drawn fire in Albany and Washington. 
''They're subsidizing this gigantic increase in ticket prices, and they're getting this luxury box for themselves? Gimme a break,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester, whose committee on public authorities is set to issue a report on Tuesday assailing the Yankees deal.
Mr. Brodsky said that the perks were negotiated in secret and that the city had yet to explain, despite repeated inquiries, why they were necessary and how they will be paid for.
The use of tax-exempt bonds to pay for the New York stadiums is being investigated separately by Mr. Brodsky and a Congressional subcommittee led by Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, whose panel is also examining the perks obtained by the city and has scheduled a hearing for Thursday.
It is still unclear where the luxury suites will be located, how the perks will be distributed, and whether any public records will be kept of who uses them.
Besides the free suites, the city will be allowed to buy up to 145 tickets to every Mets home game and up to 180 to every Yankees home game. (For these, the city will pay face value but will be able to reserve its tickets at least a day before they go on sale to the public.)
The rates for suites at Citi Field, where the Mets will play, are $275,000 to $500,000 a year, and the Yankees are charging $600,000 to $850,000 at their new stadium, according to published reports.
The city's economic development chief, Seth W. Pinsky, said he did not understand all the fuss over the deal.
''Why is that relevant?'' he said.
Mr. Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation, said suites for politicians were nothing new in New York or anywhere else. The city has one at Shea Stadium, as well as at the ballparks of the minor-league Brooklyn Cyclones and Staten Island Yankees.
But the city has never had a suite at Yankee Stadium. Yankees and Mets executives declined to comment for this article. One Yankees official, who insisted on anonymity to avoid repercussions, said the city got the new suite simply because ''Dan Doctoroff demanded a suite, like every other city.'' Mr. Doctoroff, who now runs Bloomberg L.P., did not respond to requests for an interview.
Mr. Pinsky, who reported to Mr. Doctoroff at the time, said Mr. Doctoroff did not say: ''I want this because everyone else has this, whether or not it makes sense.' I think what it was, was: It makes sense in these other places, it makes sense for us in the places where we have it, so why shouldn't we also have it in these two stadiums?''
Mr. Pinsky also said that he and other negotiators ''knew we were term-limited -- recent events and speculation put to the side -- so, at most, you're talking about one year's worth of personal benefit from this.'' Mr. Pinsky is an appointee of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose term is set to end next December but who has publicly flirted with overturning the term limits law so he can stay on.
Mr. Pinsky said the perks were meant to be used to entertain visiting dignitaries and to reward city workers, but that it would be up to the mayor's office to set up a policy for how to dole them out and ensure that it wasn't abused.
Nearly every other local or state government entity that has financed a stadium or arena in recent years has held on to a suite or some other perk for its officials. New York City's perks fall roughly in the middle of lavish and meager.
Perhaps the most extensive package was negotiated by the District of Columbia Sports and Entertainment Commission, the builder of the $611 million Nationals Park in Washington: two suites, 25 field-level tickets and free parking; use of the stadium on 18 nongame days; and, in a populist stroke, a promise to make 250,000 regular-season tickets available to fans at no more than 75 percent of full price.
Mr. Pinsky said the city could not rent out its suites or resell its tickets, so the perks could not be converted to currency that could be used on something more laudable, like money ''to run public schools in the South Bronx.''
Elsewhere, officials typically justify luxury suites as a unique setting for romancing potential business partners. But it takes unusual restraint for politicians to keep from using the perk with their pals, some team executives said anonymously for fear of angering those politicians.
''The legitimate reason is supposed to be to use it to market the city,'' said the president of a team that built a palatial building with public money and turned over a suite to the politicians responsible. ''But are they capable of it?''
If government-owned suites are nothing new, neither is outrage over the idea of officials living large at taxpayer expense.
The mayor of Denver in 2001, Wellington E. Webb, quietly agreed to exchange the ''Mile High Stadium'' trademark to the Denver Broncos for a 20-year lease, worth $1.7 million, on a suite at Invesco Field. The deal was voided after critics assailed it as an end-run around ethics and contracting rules.
In Arlington, Tex., meanwhile, Mayor Robert Cluck said he had ''nothing in writing'' but expected that the Cowboys would give the city a suite in their new stadium, when it opens next year. ''I don't think we should have demanded one,'' he said. ''We're building it for economic development reasons.'' Then again, he said, he would be unabashed in using it.
''Everybody has the opportunity to run for City Council or mayor,'' he said. ''Maybe that's just a perk of the job.''

HEADLINE: Fearing Worse to Come, Investors Drive Dow To Biggest Loss Since '01

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fearing that the crisis in the financial industry could stun the broader economy, investors drove stocks down almost 5 percent Monday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to their lowest levels in two years.
The Dow fell 504.48 points, its biggest one-day point drop since Sept. 17, 2001, the first trading day after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
In the minutes before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, dozens of traders were clustered around the specialists who oversee trading of American International Group and Bank of America, shouting bids and offers. As the opening bell clanged, dozens of flat-panel monitors around the specialists' posts pulsed with frantic trading.
With Lehman filing for bankruptcy and A.I.G. in distress, investors were worried that consumers and companies would have difficulty getting loans.
The credit markets, in turmoil for more than a year, showed new distress on Monday. Prices of credit default swaps, used by institutional investors for protection from potential bond defaults, rose sharply.
The prices of Treasury bills and notes soared as investors sought safe places to park their capital. Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday, on concerns that demand for energy would shrink as economies slowed down.
The market volatility was likely to continue for some time, economists and strategists said.
''By my own forecasts, it gets worse before it gets better,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs will report its earnings, and the Federal Reserve will decide whether to change short-term interest rates. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reports earnings.
''Markets will remain unusually volatile for a period of time,'' said Marc Stern, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, which manages about $50 billion. ''This isn't a fun period for most investors.''
Financial companies led the plunge Monday, with Goldman Sachs dropping 19 percent and Citigroup falling 15 percent. But stocks that investors view as particularly sensitive to a slower economy, like those of technology companies and manufacturers, were also punished.
On Monday, the Dow closed at 10,917.51, down 4.4 percent. The S.& P. 500 index of the biggest United States public companies fared even worse, falling 59.00 points, or 4.7 percent, to 1,192.69, its lowest close since October 2005.
The crisis on Wall Street caused by the bursting of the real-estate bubble has now lasted 13 months and has caused far more damage than analysts initially forecast.
In the last two months, the chaos has taken a vicious turn, with investors quick to attack any financial company whose balance sheet appears less than pristine. Three of the five biggest American investment banks have failed or been bought since March, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage companies, were effectively nationalized earlier this month.
Plunging housing prices have also crimped consumer spending and slowed the overall economy, which has lost 700,000 jobs this year. Even so, investors have generally seemed hopeful that the economy would avoid a full-scale recession. Now that confidence may be fading.
Every major sector of the S.& P. 500 fell Monday, with banks and insurers down 10 percent, energy companies down 7 percent, and technology stocks off 4 percent. Health care and consumer staples companies, which are generally viewed as less tied to the overall health of the economy, fell less than 2 percent.
High-yield -- or junk -- bonds, which are also sensitive to economic weakness, are also facing a sharp drop in economic activity, said Martin Fridson, chief executive of Fridson Investment Advisors, which manages about $240 million in junk bonds.
So far this year, the default rate on high-yield bonds is about 4 percent, in line with historical averages.
But a gauge of junk bond prices shows the default rate is likely to more than double over the next 12 months, Mr. Fridson said. And new junk bond issues have also dried up, preventing companies from raising capital, Mr. Fridson said.
Meanwhile, the rates at which banks make loans to each other also rose sharply, a sign that financial institutions feel they must hoard their capital rather than risk lending it and potentially losing it.
Mr. Stern of Bessemer said investors are concerned that the wave of Wall Street failures has not yet peaked.
''There's significant uncertainty about a number of large financial firms, including A.I.G., including Washington Mutual,'' he said.
''Until there's resolution on firms of that size, investors are going to be skittish.'' he said.
Still, Mr. Stern said he was cautiously optimistic that housing prices might be bottoming in many areas, setting the stage for an eventual floor for the financial sector and the overall stock market.
Asian Stocks Plunge
Asian stock markets tumbled sharply on Tuesday as investors were rattled by concerns over an expanding global financial crisis.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell 4.8 percent to 11,632.99, falling under than 12,000-point level for the first time since mid-March.
South Korea's Kospi shed 6.2 percent, and Taiwan's benchmark was off 4.6 percent. In Australia and New Zealand, important indices fell 2.4 percent and 2.7 percent.
Japan's central bank issued a statement on Tuesday that it would carefully watch developments and take appropriate measures to stabilize the market.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: A Pop-Up Agency Shows Off Emerging Talent

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE idea of the pop-up has always been popular in advertising and marketing. There are Kleenex tissues, which ''pop up one at a time,'' as the old slogan goes; pop-up stores, those temporary outlets for retailers like Target; and the snarky cable TV series ''Pop-Up Video.''
 Porter Novelli, a leading public relations agency, is popping up on the list with a short-term, pop-up agency inside its halls, staffed by younger employees who have spent the summer creating campaigns for clients with fledgling businesses to promote. 
 The entrepreneurial pop-up is named Jack & Bill, after Jack Porter and Bill Novelli, who joined forces in 1972 to found Porter Novelli, an agency now owned by the Omnicom Group with 100 offices in 60 countries.
 Eight Porter Novelli account supervisors and account executives -- average age, 26 -- have been running Jack & Bill on behalf of five clients that are receiving free services.
 ''We have an agency filled with millennials, with a need to feel empowered,'' said Lisa Rosenberg, partner and managing director of the Porter Novelli New York office, referring to the demographic group, also known as Generation Y, born between 1982 and 1994.
 ''This was an idea they were tremendously excited about,'' she added. ''And as a senior manager here, it's exciting to see the strength of our young people.''
 Ms. Rosenberg estimated the expense of the Jack & Bill project for Porter Novelli at more than $150,000 -- an economical sum for a summer's worth of publicity generation that generated its own share of publicity.
 One goal of Jack & Bill is ''showcasing our digital-media expertise,'' Ms. Rosenberg said, services ''that we may not always get to do for bigger clients.''
 So Jack & Bill has a microsite, or special Web site; a blog; and a channel on YouTube. The pop-up agency also has presences on Facebook, Flickr and Twitter.
 A decision was made that Jack & Bill would concentrate on clients in the fashion field because many of the younger Porter Novelli employees worked on accounts in areas like ''fashion and style and art and culture,'' said Erin Osher, a partner at Jack & Bill who is an account supervisor at Porter Novelli.
 ''It was really the chance of a lifetime to create an agency with the support and help of a big organization,'' said Ms. Osher, who has worked at Porter Novelli for three years.
 To give Jack & Bill's temporary life an appropriate end date, the work to be done by the staff members for their clients culminated with the annual Fashion Week, which took place last week in various venues across Manhattan. The pop-up project was wrapped up with a party on Sept. 8.
 Jack & Bill and its clients found one another in a way that turned upside-down -- or perhaps pop-up-side-down -- the traditional pitching process for selecting a public relations agency. Typically a client calls in several agencies to compete for an account; in this case, the partners of Jack & Bill asked potential clients to audition to win the pop-up's free services.
 ''More than 150 people showed up for the casting call'' in mid-July, Ms. Osher said, which was chronicled on the Jack & Bill Web site and blog as well as through Twitter and the other digital means of dissemination.
 ''We were taking photos on iPhones, which were sent to Flickr, and doing live blogging,'' she added, ''and we invited others like PR Week, Huffington Post and People to live-blog.''
 The winners of the free services from Jack & Bill were drawn from several areas of the fashion business.
 In women's apparel, the selection was Aira, a company started by two sisters, Karen and Annie Lin. Kalyn Johnson, a former lawyer, was chosen for her work as a fashion stylist; her company is Style by Kalyn Johnson.
 And there is a model, Christopher Fawcett, a 22-year-old from Aurora, Colo., who moved to New York about a year ago.
 One fashion item, jewelry, is represented twice: by Dannijo, a line created by two sisters, Danielle and Jodie Snyder, and by Badgley Sneed Designs, a collection from two long-time friends, Lynne Badgley and Jan Sneed. 
 If the name Badgley rings a bell, it is because Lynne's son, Penn, is an actor with a lead role in ''Gossip Girl,'' the buzzed-about series on the CW network. (Ms. Sneed is his godmother.)
 Asked to recall the Jack & Bill selection process, Ms. Badgley laughed. ''I spent years auditioning with him,'' she said, referring to Penn, ''and all of a sudden the tables were turned. Now I knew what he felt like.''
 Mr. Badgley accompanied his mother and Ms. Sneed to the audition, along with a co-star, Blake Lively, who plays his girlfriend on ''Gossip Girl'' and, as they say in the gossip columns, is seeing him off-camera, too.
 Their presence drew considerable attention for Jack & Bill as well as for Badgley Sneed Designs, which has since added a ''Gossip Girl'' necklace to its offerings.
 ''Every other contestant asked: 'What are they doing here?' 'They make jewelry, too?' '' Mr. Badgley said about his appearance with Ms. Lively.
 Ms. Sneed, who is executive vice president for corporate communications at MPG, a media agency owned by Havas, praised the young staff members of Jack & Bill for their work.
 ''They know what's out there,'' she said, ''and how to use it.''
 Mr. Fawcett agreed, pointing to coverage he received after working with Jack & Bill that included a fashion blog on the Web site of New York magazine.
 ''I thought you had to be really famous to have P.R. representation,'' Mr. Fawcett said. ''They really do make me feel like a star.''
 Ms. Osher said it was possible that ''Jack & Bill may live on after this,'' to assist ''emerging talent needing help to get off the ground.''
 The Jack & Bill partners, in addition to Ms. Osher, were: Claire Buxton, Alyson Campbell, Erin Crumpacker, Erica Lichtenberger, Richard Small, Lauren Szczerba and Emily Zanovich.

HEADLINE: Asian Stocks Down Sharply in Wall Street Turmoil

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Asian stock markets dropped sharply on Tuesday, as the shock waves from Wall Street's weekend financial turmoil continued to roil global markets.
 Equity markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul all fell in their first day of trading since Sunday's bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and takeover of Merrill Lynch. Those markets were closed Monday for national holidays. 
 Even Asian markets that had traded on Monday fell for a second day, in a sign that the global stock sell-off would continue. The drops followed a dismal Monday on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 504.48 points, or 4.24 percent, its biggest one-day decline since the trading following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
 In Tokyo, Asia's largest stock market, the benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped more than 5 percent to a three-year low, down 605.04 points to close at 11,609.72. The broader Topix index was down 5.1 percent, ending at 1,117.57
 South Korea's Kospi index fell 6.1 percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 5.9 percent in morning trading.
 Among markets that were open Monday, Taiwan's benchmark index was down 4.6 percent, following a 4 percent drop the previous day, and leading indexes in Australia and New Zealand were down about 2.5 percent.
 In Japan, as in much of Asia, there is fear of a slow down in the United States economy, which would deprive the region of one of its largest export markets. If American consumers buy fewer cars, televisions and cameras, especially in the coming Christmas shopping season, it could spell trouble across manufacturing-based economies across the region, which depend on exports for profits.
 Shares also fell on concerns of direct losses by Asian and particularly Japanese financial companies as a result of the problems on Wall Street. In its bankruptcy filing, Lehman Brothers revealed that some of its biggest creditors were Japanese banks. According to the filing, seven Japanese banks have $1.62 billion in outstanding loans to Lehman, including Aozora Bank, with an exposure of $463 million, and Mizuho Corporate, with $289 million. 
 Aozora said Tuesday in a statement that its actual exposure is ''significantly smaller'' than what Lehman reported. 
 Shares of these and other banks dropped sharply on Tuesday, leading the overall Tokyo market down. Aozora fell 19 percent, while two other large Japanese financial companies, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Nomura Holdings, both dropped 10 percent.
 On Tuesday, Lehman's Tokyo-based unit suspended operations on the orders of Japan's Financial Services Agency, the government financial regulatory body. The agency also said it is investigating Japanese banks and brokerages to determine the size of their exposure to the bankrupt American financial company.
 Still, banks in Asia had far less exposure to the collapsing American housing market than banks in the United States and Europe, leaving them in much better shape during the current crisis. This was reflected in the currency market, where the Japanese yen was seen as a haven from the battered American dollar.
 The yen has jumped against the dollar amid a loss of confidence in the American economy and currency. On Tuesday morning, the yen was trading around 104 yen to the dollar; it had been trading at more than 107 yen per dollar on Friday.

HEADLINE: European Central Banks Ready to Inject Billions

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY. 
Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Major European central banks prepared on Monday to inject billions into global money markets to ensure that the weekend's turmoil on Wall Street did not spread to the rest of world's financial systems. 
 The European Central Bank said that it lent 30 billion euros, or $42.7 billion, at 4.25 percent, in an almost identical repeat of an episode that started the financial crisis in Europe in August 2007. 
 Then, as now, the central bank was worried that banks would abandon the interbank lending market, a vital financial conduit in which banks lend to one another to keep the financial system running on a daily basis. The central bank's latest injection was far less, however, than the 94.8 billion euros it put into money markets in August 2007. 
 The central bank said it was ''ready to contribute to orderly conditions in the euro money market'' and that it would lend as much cash as banks wanted at its benchmark interest rate of 4.25 percent. The Swiss National Bank offered money at 1.9 percent, and said it would act ''flexibly and generously.''
 The Bank of England will also lend $:5 billion over the next three days at 5 percent. The loans will mature on Thursday, when the British central bank conducts its regular refinancing operation.
 ''Following the announcements overnight, the Bank of England will be monitoring carefully the conditions in sterling money markets and will take appropriate actions if necessary to stabilize those markets,'' it said in a statement.
 Central bankers say they believe that a purging of losses and some bankruptcies will be necessary for the financial crisis to end. But the pace and scope of the changes in the United States over the weekend has opened the door to fresh turmoil with policy implications worldwide.
 Some central banks are also banking supervisors, but all of them have to be worried about the potential for losses in the financial sector to result in a lending squeeze to the rest of the economy. So far, that has not been a problem in Europe.
 The central fear in the current situation is that the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers, combined with potential losses linked to the American International Group insurer, will drag down European banks. The extents of their exposure to the American crisis is hard to know.
 ''Is this part of the healing process -- some institutions need to go to get over this -- or does this have the potential to be a new source of uncertainty?'' said Ken Wattret, chief Europe economist at BNP Paribas in London.
 The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said German banks had ''manageable'' exposure to Lehman Brothers, Reuters reported.
 In any case, European central banks -- the lenders of last resort -- seem to have opted for a policy of preventive action, rather than waiting for Wall Street's woes to cause new cracks in the financial foundation.
 The central banks have resisted aggressive interest rate cuts as a solution to the financial crisis, however, an approach the Federal Reserve has embraced. The Fed's response at a meeting due to begin Tuesday is now a central question among investors, but few are daring to hope the central bank will cut rates.
 ''The E.C.B. would probably need to be convinced that credit markets have seized up or see a vicious downward spiral in equity markets to participate,'' said Jacques Cailloux, chief Europe economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, according to Reuters.
 Mr. Wattret at BNP Paribas said: ''There is an increasing pressure on central banks to act. The Fed is more likely to cut rates than the E.C.B. What the Fed doesn't want is a sustained drop in house and equity prices at the same time. The E.C.B. won't be at the forefront of cutting rates because it remains focused on inflation.''
 Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, said that European authorities pondered responses to the unfolding events in the United States at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers at a weekend meeting in Nice, France.
 ''All the monetary, banking and treasury authorities have been consulting for several days, we worked again last night and the mechanisms are in place, the central banks are on alert, there is no panic,'' she told Europe 1 radio.
 France holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation European Union.

HEADLINE: Red Sox Hit Six Homers And Claim Share of 1st

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
David Ortiz, Mike Lowell, Jason Bay, Jason Varitek, Kevin Youkilis and Jacoby Ellsbury each hit home runs as the visiting Boston Red Sox defeated the Tampa Bay Rays, 13-5, on Monday night, climbing into a virtual tie atop the American League East. 
 The Red Sox (89-61) won for the first time in seven games at Tropicana Field this season, moving within percentage points (.002) of the Rays for the first time in two months. 
 The Rays (88-60) went 21-7 in August and were a season-high five and a half games up on the Red Sox heading into September. But they have lost 9 of 13, with 6 of the losses coming against the Red Sox and the Yankees. 
 Ortiz, who finished with four runs batted in, hit a three-run homer in the first after Scott Kazmir (11-7) threw nine straight balls to begin the game. Two batters later, Lowell hit a solo shot for a 4-0 lead.
 Bay and Varitek homered in the fourth off Kazmir, who allowed nine runs and six hits in three-plus innings -- his shortest outing of the season. The four homers he yielded were a career high.
 Youkilis hit his 26th homer, a two-run blast in the fourth against Mitch Talbot. Ellsbury also homered off Talbot to give the Red Sox a 12-1 lead in the fifth.
 INDIANS 3, TWINS 1 Scott Lewis pitched six shutout innings in his second career start for host Cleveland. Lewis (2-0) has not allowed a run in 14 innings since being called up from the minors Sept. 7. Kelly Shoppach hit his 21st homer in the fourth inning against Kevin Slowey (12-10) to put Cleveland ahead, 1-0, and Shin-Soo Choo hit a two-run homer in the fifth to make it 3-0. Minnesota remained one and a half games behind the first-place Chicago White Sox in the A.L. Central.
 ROYALS 3, MARINERS 0 Kyle Davies matched a career high with eight strikeouts in eight innings for host Kansas City. .
 RANGERS 11, TIGERS 8 The rookie Taylor Teagarden had his first career grand slam, and Michael Young hit a tie-breaking single for host Texas. DODGERS 8, PIRATES 2 Hiroki Kuroda allowed three hits in seven shutout innings for his first road win in more than two months, and Manny Ramirez had three hits for Los Angeles at Pittsburgh. The first-place Dodgers remained four and a half games in front of Arizona in the National League West. 
 DIAMONDBACKS 3, GIANTS 1 Adam Dunn homered with two outs in the bottom of the eighth for host Arizona. Justin Upton added his 13th home run for the Diamondbacks, who won for the second time in 10 games.
 PADRES 11, ROCKIES 5 Adrian Gonzalez homered and drove in four runs, and Wade LeBlanc earned his first career win for visiting San Diego. The rookie Matt Antonelli hit his first career home run for the Padres. 
 AROUND THE MAJORS The Minnesota Twins will call their new ballpark Target Field as part of a 25-year partnership with Target Corp. ... The Cleveland Indians signed a lease through 2023 with Cleveland's Gateway Economic Development Corp.

HEADLINE: City and State Brace for Greater Demands on Diminishing Resources

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Reporting was contributed by Charles V. Bagli, Michael Barbaro, Jeremy W. Peters and Danny Hakim.

 BODY:
When Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday it had debts of $613 billion. That may be too large a number to contemplate. But a few other figures -- like 23 and 3 and 280,000 -- illustrate just how deep and broad the effects of the crisis on Wall Street could be for New York City.
 The first, 23, is an estimate of the percent of all income earned in the city that goes to people who work in the securities industry. 
 Although Wall Street provides only one of every 20 jobs in the city, those jobs pay so much that, as a group, they have accounted in recent years for almost one-fourth of all the wages and salaries, including bonuses, paid out in the city. 
 The average income of Wall Streeters last year was about $280,000, or nearly five times as high as the average of all other workers in the city. Those outsize paychecks have allowed workers on Wall Street to support many other businesses, like restaurants, luxury auto dealerships and interior decorators. Economists in the state comptroller's office estimate that each job on Wall Street creates three other jobs in the metropolitan area.
 Wall Street has already shed about 25,000 jobs this year. With the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rushed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, which was announced on Sunday, the number of lost jobs could rise by another 10,000 in a hurry. 
 Those layoffs, and the fear of more to come at other ailing financial companies, could have a dire impact on the budgets of the city and state, as well as on the sale of apartments and vacation homes, the construction of office space and the health of a wide range of stores, restaurants and service industries throughout the metropolitan area, economists said.
 Some of those repercussions may be short-lived, economists said, but for the next few months, at least, they will shake the confidence of many workers and consumers in the region.
 ''This is amazing, it's almost like a tectonic shift,'' said Rosemary Scanlon, an associate professor of economics at N.Y.U.'s Schack Institute of Real Estate. ''The loss of jobs at Lehman will be terrible. But the income piece is what's really pivotal for the city's economy.''
 What, then, will Wall Street's woes mean for the city and state budgets? 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Monday that it was too soon to quantify the effect of the latest job losses, but he acknowledged that they would put the city in a bind.
 ''The amount of money we are going to have to spend to pay our labor force, make investments and contract for services is going to be less, while the demand for services from New Yorkers in need is certain to grow,'' the mayor said.
 Tax revenues collected on the profits of Wall Street banks and the incomes of their employees account for about 10 percent of all city revenue, according to the state comptroller's office. 
 Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, estimated that the city loses about $50 million in revenue for every 1,000 jobs that disappear from the financial sector.
 This year's budget anticipated a 6 percent decline in tax revenue, Ms. Lowenstein said. ''The bigger concern is how to bring the next year, which starts July 1, into balance,'' she said. ''It's quite possible that the city will be looking to make additional cuts.''
 Although the financial sector is concentrated in the city, particularly in Manhattan, the state's budget is likely be hurt worse than the city's. Wall Street accounts for a higher share of the state's tax revenue, about 20 percent, because the state does not collect property tax.
 Gov. David A. Paterson, who has been warning for months about the hole the credit crisis could create in the state budget, said on Monday at a news conference that in the worst case, financial sector layoffs could rise by 30,000.
 ''We have seen some of the companies that have served as the bedrock of our financial system unraveling right before our eyes,'' Mr. Paterson said.
 Later, he said in interviews that the latest calamities on Wall Street might cause him to call legislators to Albany for a second special session to cut spending before the end of the year. 
 In New Jersey, which is home to thousands of investment bankers, traders and brokers, Gov. Jon S. Corzine said more budget cutting would probably be necessary. Mr. Corzine, a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said about one-third of New Jersey's economy depended on Wall Street, more in the northern part of the state. 
 Both Lehman and Merrill Lynch have operations in New Jersey, making the state unquestionably vulnerable, Mr. Corzine said. He said the state had cut its budget by $600 million in anticipation of the downturn, but he added, ''We certainly didn't anticipate the kind of historic crisis that we are seeing.''
 As government revenues decline, unemployment is expected to go up, economists said. 
 As Mr. Bloomberg noted on Monday, the city's unemployment rate is still a relatively low 5 percent. Job market analysts expect that number to rise, though, as former Lehman employees show up in the statistics, along with peers from other firms whose severance payments are running out.
 Ms. Scanlon noted that almost certainly there would be no big bonuses on Wall Street this year, making the effect of layoffs more immediate than in the past. In 1987, for instance, the stock market crashed in October, after most bonuses had been paid, so the worst economic pain was not felt until the following year. 
 ''The restaurant jobs, certain services, they will go away pretty much at once,'' especially in the suburbs, Ms. Scanlon said. In the city, though, employment in stores and hotels that attract tourists should hold up better for the rest of the year, she added. The housing market may also hold up in the city, but for how long is far from clear. 
 The demand for apartments in the city had declined even before this week, and the collapse of Lehman and sale of Merrill Lynch will only make matters worse, said Jonathan J. Miller, president and chief executive of Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraisal and consulting firm.
 ''I'm not so sure that people really understood how serious this situation was,'' Mr. Miller said. ''This weekend put an exclamation point on it.''
 Some Lehman employees had already suspended their searches for apartments to purchase, said Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive of Corcoran Group, a real estate brokerage.
 Others called Monday to put their houses in the Hamptons on the market. ''We had a couple of calls from people who said, 'I need to sell my house,' or, 'I want to sell my house,' '' Ms. Liebman said. ''We listed a few homes today.'' Still, she said she thought the apartment market in the city was still sound. 
 The future of the commercial real estate market, however, might be in greater doubt. 
 Over the last eight years, investment banks have fueled the development of new office towers in Manhattan that can meet their need for new technology and ever larger, column-free floors for trading operations. More than half the new skyscrapers built since 2000 were for financial firms, including the headquarters of now-defunct Bear Stearns at Madison Avenue and 46th Street and Lehman's at Seventh Avenue and 49th Street.
 With the prospect of Lehman's space going on the market, the likely result will be a drop in rents at some of the city's premier buildings and fewer new towers going up, said real estate executives, urban planners and government officials. Those that are built will probably be smaller, they said. 
 ''It's clear that financial institutions are not going to drive new construction, in the immediate, if not the mid-term future,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's lobbying organization.
 Real estate brokers and landlords are especially nervous about downtown, where state and city officials have sought to maintain the financial district. Merrill Lynch had contemplated a new base of operations at the World Trade Center site. But Bank of America's takeover of Merrill is expected to put an end to that idea because the bank just built 420,000 square feet of new trading floors at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas.
 The crisis on Wall Street does not bode well for the proposed towers designed for financial firms at some of the city's most important projects, either, including the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan.

 So when you walk into that voting booth in 50 days, ask yourself, Can your family afford to take a chance on an economic policy that offers $200 billion in tax breaks to the biggest corporations, including the oil companies, but not one penny of relief to more than 100 million Americans? ...

HEADLINE: California Legislature Ends Standoff Over Budget

BYLINE: By JESSE MCKINLEY; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Legislature on Monday night began mulling a budget agreement that could end a record-breaking 77-day standoff between statehouse Democrats and Republicans, although the signature of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was not assured.
 The state Assembly and Senate began voting on a range of budget bills and amendments after cobbling them together during weekend negotiating sessions and finalizing items Monday night. Many initial votes were quickly approved by the Assembly, but voting and deliberations on the mass of legislation continued late, often interrupted by caucus meetings among lawmakers anxious for an end to the state's longest budget impasse. 
 ''This is truly a compromise,'' said John Laird, a Democratic assemblyman from Santa Cruz. ''Everyone has something in this budget they don't like, but everybody had a greater fear that they are not realizing in this budget.''
 Supporters said Monday that the $104 billion budget would close a $15.2 billion shortfall for the fiscal year that began July 1 and includes items desired by Democrats, including restoration of financing on Medi-Cal payments and none of the new taxes strongly opposed by the state's Republicans.
 But whether the lawmakers gave enough to Governor Schwarzenegger remains to be seen. On Monday, the governor wrote to two leading majority Democrats in the Assembly and the Senate and their Republican counterparts seeking guarantees on contributions to a ''rainy day fund,'' central to his plans for reform in a state that often has trouble balancing -- and passing -- budgets. He also asked for controls on spending from the account.
 ''Without these changes,'' he wrote, ''I cannot sign this budget.''
 Aaron McLear, a spokesman for the governor, later wrote in an e-mail the legislature had ''not yet taken up'' budget reform, leaving open the question whether California would end a stalemate that has left some of the state's bills unpaid, its new laws unsigned and the political damage spreading.
 The proposal outlined by California legislators on Monday included about $9 billion in cuts, with the remainder of the gap expected to be closed by ''revenue solutions'' like eliminating tax loopholes, one for yacht owners, as well as accelerating collection of future taxes.
 Plans for new taxes, including a proposed penny increase in the sales tax, were shelved.
 Several elements, including a change to allow the state to sell bonds against future lottery revenues, would have to be put to a public vote. Some budget changes demanded by Mr. Schwarzenegger, including the ability to make midyear cuts in hard times, would also have to be approved by voters. A special election could come as soon as March, said Karen Bass, the Speaker of the Assembly.
 But some analysts were questioning whether the proposed deal was an actual solution or merely a stopgap made up of accounting maneuvers and temporary measures to goose state coffers, including a proposal to withhold additional income tax from some taxpayers.
 ''I think we are seeing a level of tricks, gimmicks and borrowing that is potentially unprecedented,'' said the executive director of the nonpartisan California Budget Project, Jean M. Ross. Ms. Ross noted that one element of the plan to close this year's gap the budget would temporarily eliminate deductions businesses can claim on losses. But those deductions would grow in several years, which ''obviously sets you up for deeper problems,'' she said.
 The standoff grew from the state's tough economic times and its unique tax laws, which require a two-thirds majority vote to pass a budget or new taxes. That effectively allowed Republicans, the minority party, to block many Democratic proposals.
 And voter propositions have allocated large parts of the budget to various areas, including education, leaving legislators little wiggle room.

Two babies in China have died and more than 1,250 have been sickened by contaminated milk powder, the Ministry of Health says. More than 340 infants, 53 of whom are still in critical condition, remain hospitalized. The milk products have been traced to the Sanlu Corporation, one of China's largest dairy producers, and a chemical additive called melamine, normally associated with plastics and fertilizer. Page A6
IRAN IN A NUCLEAR STALEMATE
Iran's nuclear centrifuges have been vastly improved, according to a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. While the report indicated that Iran had overcome some technical challenges, it accused the country of stonewalling about what some Western nations have claimed to be a nuclear weapons program. The agency acknowledged a lack of progress in that aspect of its investigation. Page A13

WALL STREET CASUALTIES
It is oddly reassuring that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve let Lehman Brothers fail, refused to subsidize the distress sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and tried to line up loans for A.I.G., the troubled insurer, rather than making the loan themselves.

 '' America is in a crisis today. Unemployment is on the rise, and our financial markets are in turmoil. Americans are concerned about our economic future. Let me say something: the economic crisis is not the fault of the American people. Our workers are the most innovative, the hardest working, the most skilled, the most productive, the most competitive in the world. That's the American worker. My opponents may disagree, but those fundamentals of the American worker, their innovation and entrepreneurship, the innovation of small businesses, those are the fundamentals of America, and I think they are strong. But they are being threatened today, those fundamentals are being threatened today because of the greed and corruption that some engaged in on Wall Street. We have got to fix it. We have got to reform the way they do business.''

HEADLINE: In a Tight Race, Interest Groups Step Up

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MICHAEL LUO; Jim Rutenberg reported from Washington, and Michael Luo from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After largely staying on the sidelines, the types of independent groups that so affected the 2004 presidential campaign are flooding back as players in the final sprint to the election this fall, financing provocative messages on television, in mailboxes and through the Internet.
MoveOn, a progressive group started a decade ago, says it will double its advertising budget to $7 million and start a campaign this week that ties the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, to lobbyists. 
The Service Employees International Union has begun a $2.1 million advertising campaign that criticizes Mr. McCain's economic record, while a smattering of smaller liberal groups are testing out more limited television campaigns, including one by two groups -- Brave New PAC and Democracy for America -- that asserts his experience as a prisoner of war ''is not a good prerequisite'' to be president.
The Minutemen, a group calling for stricter border security, has filed paperwork with election officials reporting that it is running mailers against Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic nominee for president.
An anti-abortion group, BornAliveTruth.org, announced Monday it would begin running an advertisement against Mr. Obama in New Mexico and Ohio that features a woman who survived a botched abortion.
And the American Issues Project, a conservative group whose main backer is a major fund-raiser for Mr. McCain, said it was considering whether to expand its efforts beyond its existing advertisement that links Mr. Obama to the 1960s radical William Ayers Jr.
Hewing to their reformist themes, the McCain and Obama campaigns initially tried to discourage such activities on their behalf. But as the race has intensified in its closing weeks, the campaigns have increasingly turned a blind eye to the activities of these groups, which sometimes operate outside campaign finance rules and with little accountability.
The activities have led aides to both candidates to trade accusations that the other is secretly behind the new attacks by the independent groups. Campaign watchdogs are on the lookout for whether the activities run afoul of election laws that prohibit coordination between the groups and the campaigns.
Citing changes to the rules that make it easier for outside groups to advertise right up to Election Day, political advertising analysts predicted that the new efforts would be the start of a crescendo of attacks.
''I think in the next two weeks you are going to see a lot more of these coming out of the woodwork,'' said Evan Tracey, chief operating officer of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which monitors expenditures on advertising. ''They want to get messages out there that are the most disruptive politically, and the closer you are to Election Day the more disruptive you are by definition.''
Mr. Tracey said he doubted that the efforts, many of them at their nascent stages, would come anywhere near matching the level of activity in 2004. So far this year, the outside groups have spent roughly a tenth of the $75 million that their predecessors had at this point four years ago on television advertising. Then, most flocked to help the campaign of the Democratic nominee that year, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, when it was short of cash.
The leaders of the groups say their donors and members have stepped up their efforts because polls suggest the race has gotten closer and become increasingly dominated by harsh exchanges between the campaigns.
Eli Pariser, the executive director of MoveOn, said he decided to step up the group's advertising plans after donations rose significantly when Mr. McCain decided to pick as his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, a social conservative whose addition to the ticket gave Mr. McCain a boost in several public polls.
''We're just following our members' mandate,'' Mr. Pariser said.
MoveOn's membership has grown to 4.2 million from 3.2 million in the past year, largely because of the popularity of Mr. Obama's candidacy. The group is also planning to spend $4 million on voter registration efforts in swing states, focusing on young voters.
Other Democratic strategists said that donors' fears about how the Obama campaign might react to an independent media effort had faded amid what they believed to be more encouraging signals from Obama officials, as well as a growing sense of urgency as the race has tightened.
Steve Phillips, the president of PowerPAC.org, an independent group that supported Mr. Obama in the Democratic primary, said it was moving ahead with plans for a $10 million effort focused on turning out black and Latino voters. Mr. Phillips is also talking to others about an outside media effort that attacks Mr. McCain.
''There is another set of conversations going on about advertising -- and around hard-hitting advertising, frankly,'' he said. ''A lot of people want to hit back hard.''
Mike Lux, a Democratic political consultant, and Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, are leading another set of discussions on the left about supporting an outside effort. The pair convened a conference call last week for potential donors to discuss where they might funnel their money, specifically encouraging a focus on older white women.
Similar activity continues on the right, with new donors like Raymond Ruddy -- a former supporter of Mitt Romney, who sought the Republican nomination this year -- kicking in $350,000 for the advertisement against Mr. Obama on abortion by BornAliveTruth.org.
One of the largest groups, American Issues Project, received its initial $2.8 million from the financier Harold Simmons, who, aside from raising tens of thousands of dollars for Mr. McCain, also financed the anti-Kerry group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.
The group's president, Ed Martin, said that donations continued to come in and that his group was weighing its options as it contemplated its final moves.
''Certainly there's going to be a lot of action down the stretch, and we want to be part of it,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It's not like the election isn't close.''

HEADLINE: 5 Days of Pressure, Fear and Ultimately, Failure

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Reporting was contributed by Jenny Anderson, Michael J. de la Merced, Andrew Ross Sorkin, Louise Story and Ben White.

 BODY:
A crisis of confidence in financial markets on Wall Street culminated in a weekend of brinksmanship and failed appeals that caused the demise of some of the nation's storied financial institutions. 
 It began on Tuesday, just two days after the Bush administration took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants. Fears began to mount in earnest on Wall Street that Lehman might founder -- and that the government might not ride to the rescue this time. As stock markets around the world tumbled, Lehman's shares were hit by waves of selling that wiped out nearly half its value. 
 The next day, skittish employees inside Lehman's Times Square headquarters held their breath as Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman's chief executive, held an urgent conference call with investors and analysts to announce the biggest quarterly loss in the company's 158-year history -- as well as a master plan to pull the firm back from the brink. The blueprint centered on splitting Lehman into a ''good'' bank and a ''bad'' one that would get rid of troubled mortgages and real estate. Lehman would also sell most of its investment management division and cut its dividend to shareholders. 
 But there was little new in Mr. Fuld's remarks, and by the end of the day, Lehman's share price had fallen an additional 7 percent, leaving the shares down 55 percent over three days. 
 Employees who had clung to the belief that Lehman would never go under started polishing resumes in earnest, taking calls from headhunters and openly passing around job offers. 
 On Thursday, executives established a war room at the headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. As confidence in Lehman's survival ebbed, Mr. Fuld redoubled efforts to execute his plan to sell parts of the firm. The once unthinkable notion of selling Lehman in its entirety was also put on the table. Traders, meanwhile, were instructed to start pulling together data so that potential buyers could start examining Lehman's positions. 
 When the shares plunged to a bargain-basement price below $4, potential suitors came out of hiding, including Barclays of Britain and Bank of America, as well as several private equity firms. With fresh memories of the government-arranged fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, and the weekend bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, each sought assurances from the Federal Reserve to help make an acquisition palatable. 
 Meanwhile, Wall Street surveyed the landscape for the next financial domino, setting its sights on Merrill Lynch and the American International Group, which were exposed to Lehman, and on Washington Mutual, the long-troubled giant savings and loan that was having problems raising capital. 
 On Friday, the uncertainty surrounding Lehman sent a new wave of fear rippling through the markets. Federal Reserve officials convened the heads of the major Wall Street banks for an emergency meeting at 6 p.m. in Lower Manhattan. The goal was to hash out a plan to rescue Lehman Brothers and stabilize the global markets. The group included the heads of 10 to 15 Wall Street banks, flanked by their top lieutenants and finance and risk chiefs. Among them were James Dimon of JPMorgan, Brady Dougan of Credit Suisse, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, John Thain of Merrill Lynch and John Mack of Morgan Stanley. Also participating were officials from Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. 
 Kenneth D. Lewis of Bank of America phoned in from Charlotte, N.C. Vikram S. Pandit delayed his trip to a Citigroup board meeting in London to participate. Lehman Brothers was conspicuously absent. 
 The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve had been preparing for a failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for months. Some on Wall Street say they believe that Lehman Brothers' crisis caught the government flat-footed and without a contingency plan. 
 ''They thought that if they rescue Fannie and Freddie, there would be such support for the market that things would stabilize,'' said one observer who spoke on condition of anonymity because his institution was involved in the discussions. ''They also thought Lehman management would have things under control.'' 
 The clock, however, was ticking. Timothy F. Geithner, the president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, appearing with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Christopher Cox of the Securities and Exchange Commission, struck a serious tone. Over the next two hours, he and Mr. Paulson stressed that the government would not put taxpayer money on the line. They wanted an industry solution to prevent the crisis from worsening, according to two people who did not attend the meeting but were briefed on it. 
 Mr. Geithner made an impassioned appeal to the group for an industry solution. His message, these people were told, was clear: it is not about any individual bank, it is about the industry; if you don't create an industry solution, you will be next.
 Most of the bankers quietly listened. But some questioned the need for them to play a role in a bailout. Lehman Brothers had overreached and brought its troubles upon itself, they argued. Why should they put up their own money in a rescue? 
 Both Bank of America and Barclays, a large British bank, expressed interest in making a bid. HSBC also suggested it might pursue Lehman, though its interest quickly faded. 
 Because they had little time to inspect Lehman's toxic assets, Barclays and Bank of America made it clear that any deal would be contingent on the government's agreement to absorb a portion of the losses. The government had committed about $30 billion to supporting JPMorgan Chase's emergency takeover of Bear Stearns, and just last weekend put up $200 billion in its rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 But fearing they had created a moral hazard and were already pushing the Fed's budget, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Geithner were adamant that the government would not participate in a bailout. With all sides digging in their heels, one thing was clear: Lehman was, as one participant at the meeting put it, a ''dead bank walking.'' 
 Mr. Geithner told the Wall Street firms to start developing plans for an orderly liquidation. Lehman Brothers hired Weil, Gotshal & Manges to start drafting bankruptcy plans. 
 The tense session was similar to one held a decade ago with the leaders of Wall Street to stave off the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that plunged into esoteric derivatives and other complex investments. Its failure threatened to send shock waves through the global markets. 
 But the potential fallout from Lehman Brothers could be more severe. It is a vastly larger institution with trading partners around the world. There also was another problem. When Wall Street bailed out Long-Term Capital Management, its banks were healthy. This time around, they have already been weakened by heavy losses credit problems of their own. 
 On Saturday, shortly before 9 a.m., black town cars carrying a who's who of Wall Street arrived at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York for several hours of meetings. At an opening session, Mr. Geithner echoed his remarks from Friday evening: put aside your competitive interest to preserve the health of the markets. If you all do it together, nobody will point the finger at any of you, he said, according to a person briefed on the meeting but who did not participate in the talks. 
 Meanwhile, senior Wall Street executives met at their corporate offices to examine their exposure to Lehman Brothers and other wobbly institutions, with an eye toward mapping out emergency plans for the next week. Senior traders began overseeing huge efforts to find banks with offsetting trades with Lehman Brothers and take them out so that the troubled firm was no longer involved. Bankers with two or three decades of experience used the words ''scary,'' ''terrifying'' and ''horrible'' to describe the situation. 
 The broad outlines of two proposals began to take shape. One option was to have the major banks and brokerage firms agree to keep doing business with Lehman while the bank unwound its positions over several months. Another was a daring rescue, in which Barclays or Bank of America would buy the good assets of the bank with a group of 10 to 15 Wall Street firms agreeing to absorb the losses. 
 At 3. p.m., Mr. Paulson called a meeting to brief the participants. Fears were swirling about troubles gripping financial companies. A.I.G., the global insurance giant, needed to raise $30 billion and $40 billion to avoid severe ratings downgrade that would lead to its swift demise, and the financial health of Washington Mutual was quickly deteriorating. The prospect of the failure of Lehman and others would send shockwaves through the global markets.
 Some of the banks requested that the S.E.C. reinstate its temporary short-selling ban to try to limit the market impact, though it ultimately never agreed to such a move. Others feared that relatively healthier institutions might get swept up in the fallout. Merrill Lynch and then Morgan Stanley -- and even Goldman Sachs -- could be next. 
 By Saturday evening, Bank of America's interest in a bid was fading. It insisted that it would not buy the embattled bank without government support. The proposal involving Barclays appeared to be gaining steam.
 But on Sunday morning the last hope unraveled. As the group of banks reconvened at the Federal Reserve Bank, Barclays said it was withdrawing its proposal. It could not obtain a shareholder vote to approve a transaction before Monday morning, which was required under London Stock Exchange listing rules, one person close to the matter said. Other people involved in the talks said the British securities regulator, the Financial Services Authority, had discouraged Barclays from pursuing the transaction. Peter Truell, a Barclays spokesman, declined to comment.
 By 2 p.m., Barclays was officially out of the deal. Bank of America, meanwhile, remained uninterested. Its executives had already been meeting privately with their counterparts at Merrill Lynch to settle the framework for a shotgun merger.
 That effectively put Lehman on the track for a bankruptcy filing. The goal, then became, figuring out the best possible way to unwind Lehman without adding to the turmoil.
 Across Wall Street, traders rushed in to work to try to make sure they were out of the Lehman positions. ''Every single person I know in New York is at work today,'' one long-time banker said. ''Everybody who isn't blown up is figuring out their counterparty risk. Everybody who is, is cleaning out their desk.''
 That sent the first indications that the markets were awry. Traders had to pay 80 cents on every dollar to buy protection against Lehman defaulting on its bonds. Insuring $10 million in bonds against default, in other words, required a payment of $8 million. Lehman traders, meanwhile, were called back to their desks as news seeped out about their pending bankruptcy. Most said they believed it would be the last time.
 They sent out goodbye messages to colleagues and gathered their belongings. Some huddled in a corner on the fourth floor, eating pizza and drinking beer, according to a person who was there. They were dumbstruck that their firm could evaporate in days. Its employees left their offices unsure if they should return to work.
 Lehman did not file for bankruptcy until early Monday morning. Some employees were planning to head in Monday around 9 a.m. as they normally do. Others were planning to head to the local unemployment office for the very first time.

HEADLINE: In Candidates, 2 Approaches To Wall Street

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Reporting was contributed by Kitty Bennett, Michael Luo, Adam Nagourney and Jeff Zeleny.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The crisis on Wall Street will leave the next president facing tough choices about how best to regulate the financial system, and although neither Senator Barack Obama nor Senator John McCain has yet offered a detailed plan, their records and the principles they have set out so far suggest they could come at the issue in very different ways.
On the campaign trail on Monday, Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, struck a populist tone. Speaking in Florida, he said that the economy's underlying fundamentals remained strong but were being threatened ''because of the greed by some based in Wall Street and we have got to fix it.''
But his record on the issue, and the views of those he has always cited as his most influential advisers, suggest that he has never departed in any major way from his party's embrace of deregulation and relying more on market forces than on the government to exert discipline. 
While Mr. McCain has cited the need for additional oversight when it comes to specific situations, like the mortgage problems behind the current shocks on Wall Street, he has consistently characterized himself as fundamentally a deregulator and he has no history prior to the presidential campaign of advocating steps to tighten standards on investment firms.
He has often taken his lead on financial issues from two outspoken advocates of free market approaches, former Senator Phil Gramm and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman. Individuals associated with Merrill Lynch, which sold itself to Bank of America in the market upheaval of the past weekend, have given his presidential campaign nearly $300,000, making them Mr. McCain's largest contributor, collectively.
Mr. Obama sought Monday to attribute the financial upheaval to lax regulation during the Bush years, and in turn to link Mr. McCain to that approach.
''I certainly don't fault Senator McCain for these problems, but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to,'' Mr. Obama told several hundred people who gathered for an outdoor rally in Grand Junction, Colo.
Mr. Obama set out his general approach to financial regulation in March, calling for regulating investment banks, mortgage brokers and hedge funds much as commercial banks are. And he would streamline the overlapping regulatory agencies and create a commission to monitor threats to the financial system and report to the White House and Congress.
On Wall Street's Republican-friendly turf, Mr. Obama has outraised Mr. McCain. He has received $9.9 million from individuals associated with the securities and investment industry, $3 million more than Mr. McCain, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. His advisers include Wall Street heavyweights, including Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary who is now a senior adviser at Citigroup, another firm being buffeted by the financial crisis.
If many voters are fuzzy on the events that over the weekend forced Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. into bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch & Company to be swallowed by the Bank of America Corporation, the continuing chaos among the most venerable names in American finance -- coming on top of the recent government seizure of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the demise of the Bear Stearns Companies -- has stoked their anxiety for the economy, the foremost issue on voters' minds.
So it was that first Mr. Obama and then Mr. McCain rushed out their statements on Monday morning before most Americans had reached their workplaces.
To the extent that travails on Wall Street and Main Street have both corporations and homeowners looking to Washington for a hand, that helps Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats who see government as a force for good and business regulation as essential. Yet Mr. McCain has sold himself to many voters as an agent for change, despite his party's unpopularity after years of dominating in Washington, and despite his own antiregulation stances of past years.
Mr. McCain was quick on Monday to issue a statement calling for ''major reform'' to ''replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight in Washington and bring transparency and accountability to Wall Street.'' Later his campaign unveiled a television advertisement called ''Crisis,'' that began: ''Our economy in crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it. Tougher rules on Wall Street to protect your life savings.''
Mr. McCain's reaction suggests how the pendulum has swung to cast government regulation in a more favorable political light as the economy has suffered additional blows and how he is scrambling to adjust. While he has few footprints on economic issues in more than a quarter century in Congress, Mr. McCain has always been in his party's mainstream on the issue.
In early 1995, after Republicans had taken control of Congress, Mr. McCain promoted a moratorium on federal regulations of all kinds. He was quoted as saying that excessive regulations were ''destroying the American family, the American dream'' and voters ''want these regulations stopped.'' The moratorium measure was unsuccessful.
''I'm always for less regulation,'' he told The Wall Street Journal last March, ''but I am aware of the view that there is a need for government oversight'' in situations like the subprime lending crisis, the problem that has cascaded through Wall Street this year. He concluded, ''but I am fundamentally a deregulator.''
Later that month, he gave a speech on the housing crisis in which he called for less regulation, saying, ''Our financial market approach should include encouraging increased capital in financial institutions by removing regulatory, accounting and tax impediments to raising capital.''
Yet Mr. McCain has at times in the presidential campaign exhibited a less ideological streak. As he did on Monday, he from time to time speaks in populist tones about big corporations and financial institutions and presents himself as a Theodore Roosevelt-style reformer. He supported the Bush administration's decision to seize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants, and he has backed as unavoidable the promise of taxpayer money to help contain the financial crisis.
Other than Mr. Gramm, who as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee before his leaving Congress in 2002 worked to block efforts to tighten financial regulation, Mr. McCain's closest adviser on matters of Wall Street is John Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, who has raised about $500,000 for Mr. McCain. Unlike Mr. Gramm, Mr. Thain has a reputation as a pragmatic, nonideological, moderate Republican. That the men are Mr. McCain's touchstones is typical of his small and eclectic mix of advisers, making it hard to generalize about how Mr. McCain would act as president.
A prominent McCain supporter, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, signaled how Mr. McCain would try to make his antiregulation record fit the proregulation times that the next president will inherit. Mr. Pawlenty suggested in an interview on Fox News that, given the danger that ''any future administration'' would go too far, Mr. McCain would be the safer bet to protect against ''excessive government intervention or excessive government regulation.''
Mr. Obama also does not have much of a record on financial regulation. As a first-term senator, he has not been around for the major debates of recent years, and his eight years in the Illinois Senate afforded little opportunity to weigh in on the issues.
In March 2007, however, he warned of the coming housing crisis, and a year later in a speech in Manhattan he outlined six principles for overhauling financial regulation.
On Monday, he said the nation was facing ''the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression,'' and attributed it on the hands-off policies of the Republican White House that, he says, Mr. McCain would continue. Seeking to showcase Mr. Obama's concerns, his campaign said Mr. Obama led a conference call on the crisis early Monday that included Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve; Mr. Rubin; and his successor as treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers.
Later, citing Mr. McCain's remarks about the economy's strong fundamentals, he told a Colorado crowd that Mr. McCain ''doesn't get what's happening between the mountain in Sedona where he lives and the corridors of power where he works.''
One reason for both men's sketchy records on financial issues is that neither has been a member of the Senate Banking Committee, which has oversight of the industry and its regulators. Under both parties' leadership, the committee often has been a graveyard for proposals opposed by lobbyists for financial institutions, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which last week were forced into government conservatorships.
Industry lobbyists' success in killing such regulations meant senators outside the banking panel did not have to take a stand on them.

HEADLINE: Mayor Draws on Old Ties In Dealing With a Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
As New York City's banking industry descended into turmoil last weekend, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg picked up the telephone for a painful conversation with the president of Merrill Lynch, Gregory J. Fleming.
 Thirty years earlier, Merrill had taken a bold bet on Mr. Bloomberg's fledgling, cash-starved start-up, becoming the first Wall Street firm to invest in the strange new financial data machines that would make him a billionaire.
 But now, in an unsettling role reversal, it was Merrill that needed help -- desperately. It was on the verge of collapse. 
 ''What can I do to help?'' Mr. Bloomberg asked Mr. Fleming, aides said on Monday. So it went for Mr. Bloomberg, who has spent the last three days dialing up the heads of the city's most venerable banks and the nation's top financial regulators, offering solace and support to those he has known as friends, colleagues, clients and golfing partners. 
 Those close ties, forged over decades as a Wall Street trader and as the head of the financial data company Bloomberg L.P., have given the mayor an unusual window into the unfolding crisis and an influential role in how it is resolved.
 The city's authority in international financial markets is severely limited, but that has not stopped the mayor from stepping in as a diplomat and elder statesman on Wall Street, where he remains a largely revered figure. 
 Since Friday, when it became clear that Merrill and Lehman Brothers could fail, Mr. Bloomberg has spoken to Richard S. Fuld Jr., the chief executive of Lehman Brothers; Kenneth D. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America; Henry M. Paulson Jr., secretary of the Treasury; Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said aides to the mayor, who helped reconstruct his activities over the weekend.
 His conversation with Mr. Fuld, whose firm filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, was especially poignant. Mr. Bloomberg has known Mr. Fuld for three decades, largely through the city's charity circuit. Both men are involved with Prep for Prep, a charity for low-income students. At Mr. Bloomberg's invitation, Mr. Fuld has given to the Gracie Mansion Conservancy and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. And as a board member at Mount Sinai Hospital, Mr. Fuld solicited donations from Mr. Bloomberg. 
 The conversations have extended well beyond official pleasantries. Mr. Bloomberg warned Mr. Cox about the serious threat to the remaining banks posed by short sellers, who bet that stock prices will fall -- and profit handsomely when they do. What, Mr. Bloomberg wanted to know, could the S.E.C. do about it?
 In dealings with City Hall staff members last weekend, Mr. Bloomberg acted with the same determination. On Sunday night, as it became clear that Lehman would not survive and Merrill would be sold to Bank of America, he canceled a trip to California, where he was to meet with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, passing on his regrets through aides. 
 In telephone conversations and e-mail messages sent from his BlackBerry, Mr. Bloomberg ordered his deputies to start preparing for an early strategy session the next day. His one request was to bring lots of data.
 By 7 a.m. on Monday, Mr. Bloomberg was at his desk in City Hall, his eyes glued to a bank of Bloomberg computer screens, which showed the early reports from jittery stock markets in Europe and Asia. 
 By 8:30 a.m., his top aides had gathered around his desk -- Edward Skyler, deputy mayor for operations; Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation; Robert C. Lieber, deputy mayor for economic development; and Mark Page, director of the city's Office of Management and Budget.
 Mr. Bloomberg grilled them on the city's economic indicators, asking for the city's office vacancy rate, unemployment figures and tax revenue numbers for the first quarter of the year to understand the potential impact of thousands of job losses. 
 Next, Mr. Bloomberg took a call from Gov. David A. Paterson, in which the two compared notes about the health of the American International Group, the New York insurance giant, which is also in serious financial trouble. 
 By midmorning, Mr. Bloomberg had told aides that he wanted to address the public about the crisis. The mayor, who usually leaves speechwriting to the speechwriters, became deeply involved in drafting Monday's lengthy remarks on the banking crisis. As his revisions dragged on, a news conference scheduled for 12:45 p.m. was delayed nearly an hour. 
 But he was determined to send a clear message: despite the troubles on Wall Street, New York City would survive, and it would thrive. ''We have a great hand to play,'' he told aides. 
 In the final draft of his speech, Mr. Bloomberg repeatedly sounded that theme: ''New Yorkers have gotten through the ups and downs of Wall Street before,'' he wrote, ''and we will get through this one, too.''

A DAY OF HUGE LOSSES Investors experienced their deepest losses since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001, while government officials battled to keep the financial crisis from growing. 
 HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? How can it even be possible that we woke up on a Monday morning to discover that Lehman Brothers is bankrupt and that Merrill Lynch has been sold to Bank of America? Talking Business: Joe Nocera. [A23.] 
 THE CANDIDATES RESPOND The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, says it was good for the government not to bail out Lehman and vows to update the financial regulatory system, while the Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, seizes on the crisis to highlight lax regulation. [A1.]
 HELP FOR A.I.G. People briefed on the matter are saying that the Federal Reserve has asked JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to lend the giant insurance company American International Group up to $75 billion to help prop it up. Gov. David A. Paterson, left, of New York announced that the state would allow A.I.G. to borrow $20 billion from its subsidiaries. [C1.] 
 BLEAK DAY AT LEHMAN Lehman's bankruptcy filing ignited events around the globe that will play out for months as creditors lined up, employees awaited word on paychecks and benefits and Lehman's counterparties rushed to limit their exposure. [C1.]
 NEW PAIN FOR CREDIT MARKETS Credit markets that have been in turmoil for more than a year suffered anew as prices of credit default swaps and of Treasury bills rose sharply. [C7.] 
 PAINFUL CHANGE AHEAD Many experts forecast a period of difficult change for Wall Street after the last 72 hours. [C1.] 
 THE ACQUISITION IT WANTED On Friday, Kenneth D. Lewis, chief executive of the Bank of America Corporation, walked away from a Lehman acquisition because the government would not safeguard buyers from possible losses. On Saturday, he had a new goal: Merrill Lynch. [C9.]
 RUSH BY LEHMAN CREDITORS A worldwide battle has begun over the remains of Lehman Brothers as the biggest bankruptcy filing in history sent creditors scrambling to protect their investments. [C8.]
 ADVICE FOR CONSUMERS Despite the market turmoil, it almost never makes sense to sell everything or to stop contributing to a 401(k) in the hope that you will know when the market has hit bottom. But beyond that? [C6.] 
 THE MAYOR'S ROLE Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's close ties to Wall Street, forged over decades as a trader and as the billionaire head of the financial data company Bloomberg L.P. gave the New York mayor an unusual view into the unfolding financial crisis and a role in its resolution. [C6.] 
 OIL PRICES FALL BACK Oil prices have fallen under the symbolic $100-a-barrel, but oil and gasoline prices are moving in opposite directions. [C10.] 
 CHANGING PERCEPTION The collapse of an American titan like Lehman Brothers has made Europeans think about what it portends for the union's own increasingly global financial institutions. [C7.] 
 INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT DROPS Government data shows the nation's industrial output plunged in August by nearly four times the amount that had been expected. [C12.]

HEADLINE: McCain's Radical Agenda

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Talk about a shock to the system. Has anyone bothered to notice the radical changes that John McCain and Sarah Palin are planning for the nation's health insurance system?
 These are changes that will set in motion nothing less than the dismantling of the employer-based coverage that protects most American families.
 A study coming out Tuesday from scholars at Columbia, Harvard, Purdue and Michigan projects that 20 million Americans who have employment-based health insurance would lose it under the McCain plan. 
 There is nothing secret about Senator McCain's far-reaching proposals, but they haven't gotten much attention because the chatter in this campaign has mostly been about nonsense -- lipstick, celebrities and ''Drill, baby, drill!''
 For starters, the McCain health plan would treat employer-paid health benefits as income that employees would have to pay taxes on. 
 ''It means your employer is going to have to make an estimate on how much the employer is paying for health insurance on your behalf, and you are going to have to pay taxes on that money,'' said Sherry Glied, an economist who chairs the Department of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.
 Ms. Glied is one of the four scholars who have just completed an independent joint study of the plan. Their findings are being published on the Web site of the policy journal, Health Affairs. 
 According to the study: ''The McCain plan will force millions of Americans into the weakest segment of the private insurance system -- the nongroup market -- where cost-sharing is high, covered services are limited and people will lose access to benefits they have now.''
 The net effect of the plan, the study said, ''almost certainly will be to increase family costs for medical care.''
 Under the McCain plan (now the McCain-Palin plan) employees who continue to receive employer-paid health benefits would look at their pay stubs each week or each month and find that additional money had been withheld to cover the taxes on the value of their benefits.
 While there might be less money in the paycheck, that would not be anything to worry about, according to Senator McCain. That's because the government would be offering all taxpayers a refundable tax credit -- $2,500 for a single worker and $5,000 per family -- to be used ''to help pay for your health care.''
 You may think this is a good move or a bad one -- but it's a monumental change in the way health coverage would be provided to scores of millions of Americans. Why not more attention?
 The whole idea of the McCain plan is to get families out of employer-paid health coverage and into the health insurance marketplace, where naked competition is supposed to take care of all ills. (We're seeing in the Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch fiascos just how well the unfettered marketplace has been working.)
 Taxing employer-paid health benefits is the first step in this transition, the equivalent of injecting poison into the system. It's the beginning of the end. 
 When younger, healthier workers start seeing additional taxes taken out of their paychecks, some (perhaps many) will opt out of the employer-based plans -- either to buy cheaper insurance on their own or to go without coverage.
 That will leave employers with a pool of older, less healthy workers to cover. That coverage will necessarily be more expensive, which will encourage more and more employers to give up on the idea of providing coverage at all.
 The upshot is that many more Americans -- millions more -- will find themselves on their own in the bewildering and often treacherous health insurance marketplace. As Senator McCain has said: ''I believe the key to real reform is to restore control over our health care system to the patients themselves.''
 Yet another radical element of McCain's plan is his proposal to undermine state health insurance regulations by allowing consumers to buy insurance from sellers anywhere in the country. So a requirement in one state that insurers cover, for example, vaccinations, or annual physicals, or breast examinations, would essentially be meaningless.
 In a refrain we've heard many times in recent years, Mr. McCain said he is committed to ridding the market of these ''needless and costly'' insurance regulations.
 This entire McCain health insurance transformation is right out of the right-wing Republicans' ideological playbook: fewer regulations; let the market decide; and send unsophisticated consumers into the crucible alone.
 You would think that with some of the most venerable houses on Wall Street crumbling like sand castles right before our eyes, we'd be a little wary about spreading this toxic formula even further into the health care system.
 But we're not even paying much attention.

HEADLINE: WALL ST. IN WORST LOSS SINCE '01 DESPITE REASSURANCES BY BUSH

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In another unnerving day for Wall Street, investors suffered their worst losses since the terrorist attacks of 2001, and government officials raced to prevent the financial crisis from spreading.
Trading opened sharply down Monday morning, and the mood later turned even gloomier, despite efforts by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., in separate appearances at the White House, to reassure markets that Wall Street's deepening problems would not weaken an already anemic economy.
Amid worries that the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch over the weekend might not be enough to stop the downward spiral, stocks fell sharply in the last half hour of trading. By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had dropped 504.48 points, or 4.4 percent, as a record volume of more than 8 billion shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the biggest decline since Sept. 17, 2001 -- the day the index reopened after the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- when it fell 7 percent, or 684.81 points. 
A concern hanging over the market is the fate of other financial companies, most notably the American International Group, one of the world's largest insurers. After the Fed rebuffed a request by the company for a $40 billion temporary loan, federal and state officials worked on Monday to stabilize A.I.G., with the State of New York relaxing rules to allow the company to borrow as much as $20 billion in much-needed cash, while the New York Federal Reserve Bank was engaged in talks with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs on a $75 billion loan for the insurer.
Market participants fear that without a cash infusion for A.I.G., losses on its financial insurance contracts could cause a ripple effect that would damage other companies. Shares of A.I.G., already battered in recent weeks, plunged another 60 percent on Monday, closing at $4.76. Last year, the company had traded as high as $72.
The stock market's descent in the closing minutes Monday could set the stage for more fallout on Tuesday, when Asian markets that were closed for a holiday the day before will reopen. In response to the market turmoil, officials at the Federal Reserve were considering lowering interest rates at the regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday of the Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. Such a move would follow a pattern -- the Fed lowered rates after the Sept. 11 attacks and after the crash of 1987 to help calm the markets -- though a rate cut is far from a certainty.
The Fed also took steps to ease rules separating banks and investment banks, a move intended to make it easier for healthy companies on Wall Street, like Goldman Sachs, to buy up troubled institutions.
Wall Street was still reeling on Monday from a tumultuous weekend in which Treasury and Fed officials told top bank executives that they needed to work together to resolve the financial industry's problems, because the government did not intend to bail out Lehman, a decision that led to Lehman's bankruptcy filing.
Dispirited employees of Lehman arrived at work in Midtown Manhattan with little to do, with many spending their time polishing their resumes and sharing dark humor. Traders at other firms arrived at work before dawn to brace themselves for a heavy day and continued to limit their losses by unwinding their trading positions with Lehman. Nervous investors around the nation logged onto their investment accounts on the Internet to see what toll the financial tumult had taken on retirement and college-education funds.
Workers at Merrill Lynch, stunned by the respected institution's demise as an independent brokerage firm, came to work after learning about the sale on Sunday of the company to Bank of America. While the acquisition may have saved Merrill from what some worried would be a fate similar to Lehman's, it will come at a cost to Merrill workers. Bank of America said it planned to wring $7 billion in costs from Merrill over four years from the consolidation, a plan that could result in thousands of layoffs. At a news conference on Monday, Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's chairman, would not discuss job losses, but he repeatedly praised Merrill's 16,000 financial advisers, calling them ''the crown jewel of the company.''
Merrill employees who are laid off will have plenty of company, as many financial workers have lost jobs in the last year, leaving many without a paycheck. Appearing briefly in the morning before reporters in the Rose Garden, Mr. Bush characterized the recent events as short-term market adjustments that would have a limited effect on an otherwise sound economy.
''I know Americans are concerned about the adjustments that are taking place in our financial markets,'' Mr. Bush said at a ceremony to welcome the president of Ghana.
He added: ''In the short run, adjustments in the financial markets can be painful -- both for the people concerned about their investments, and for the employees of the affected firms. In the long run, I'm confident that our capital markets are flexible and resilient, and can deal with these adjustments.''
But, seeking safer places for their money, investors drove down the yields of Treasury notes. Widening spreads in the credit market indicated deep skepticism about mortgage-backed securities. The price of crude oil dropped more than $5 a barrel to close to at $95.71, as investors seemed to conclude that an economic decline would cause a significant decrease in the demand for energy.
A senior administration official, recounting the fall of Lehman, said that for weeks Mr. Paulson had been pressing Richard S. Fuld Jr., the company's chief executive, to sell the company, but that ultimately no one in the market wanted it because of billions of dollars in bad investments the company had made in subprime mortgages and real estate. They said that Mr. Paulson told Mr. Fuld after the company reported dreadful second-quarter earnings that Lehman had to be sold or it would not survive.
The official said that, several weeks ago, Mr. Paulson had a list in his mind of major institutions that might not be able to resolve their huge investments in troubled real estate and that the list consisted of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Washington Mutual. The official said that Mr. Paulson also decided that it was paramount to first resolve the problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two huge mortgage finance companies, before turning to the others. In addition to A.I.G., the difficulties of Washington Mutual, the nation's largest savings and loan, remain unresolved. On Monday, the shares of Washington Mutual closed down nearly 27 percent, to $2.
Mr. Paulson concluded that the financial system could survive the collapse of Lehman, which has shown signs of weakness for months.
The rapid deterioration of Bear Stearns, in contrast, took top officials by surprise last March. And Fannie and Freddie are government-created companies that are simply too large to fail -- together they own or guarantee nearly half of the nation's residential mortgages.
As throughout most of the year, Mr. Bush and the White House left most of the details about the crisis to Mr. Paulson, who told reporters at a White House briefing that the problems in the housing markets at the heart of the financial crisis would take months to resolve themselves.
''I believe that there is a reasonable chance that the biggest part of that housing correction can be behind us in a number of months,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''I'm not saying two or three months, but in months as opposed to years.''
Mr. Paulson sought to distinguish the government's decision to provide financial assistance to Bear Stearns last March, as well as to rescue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last week, from its rejection of aid requests from Lehman Brothers and A.I.G.
''The situation in March and the situation and the facts around Bear Stearns were very, very different to the situation we are looking at here in September,'' he said. ''I never once considered that it was appropriate to put taxpayer money on the line in resolving Lehman Brothers.'' He called the discussions on assisting A.I.G. ''a private sector effort.''
Still, Mr. Paulson did not reject any future Washington bailouts.

HEADLINE: Harmonic Convergence: When Julian Met Placido

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
Julian Schnabel paints portraits the way the old masters did, starting with a dark background and then layering on light and color. Where the masters varnished their pictures, Mr. Schnabel sometimes coats his with resin. The main difference is that the old masters took weeks or even months to complete a portrait, and Mr. Schnabel can finish one in several hours, which, even allowing for several centuries' worth of inflation, makes for a much sweeter payday.
 On Thursday Mr. Schnabel painted Peddrick Sheffer, a truck driver from York, Pa., who had won a Schnabel portrait as part of the MasterCard ''priceless'' campaign. (Or not quite priceless: the contest rules estimated the value of the painting at $350,000.) He played some Willie Nelson tunes to put Mr. Sheffer at ease and also tried to talk him into voting for Barack Obama. ''I told him, 'If you like my work, trust me on this,' '' Mr. Schnabel said. 
 On Friday, using a giant, dolly-mounted Polaroid camera from the '70s, Mr. Schnabel took the B-list actor Mickey Rourke's photograph for a forthcoming Village Voice article about his new film, ''The Wrestler.'' And then he painted Placido Domingo. 
 That portrait was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera to commemorate the anniversary of that tenor's Met debut, and is to be unveiled at a gala there on Sept. 28, 40 years to the day after Mr. Domingo, then 27, stepped in for an ailing Franco Corelli and sang the role of Maurizio in ''Adriana Lecouvreur.''
 ''Most tenors don't last 14 years, let alone 40,'' said Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met. ''We were just trying to think of an appropriate way to honor a career of such duration and excellence.''
 He added: ''The Met has a long history of very large and not necessarily well-painted portraits of singers in costume. Some of them are quite good, but some are the painting equivalent of what you'd see in a wax museum.'' Ever since Mr. Gelb took over in 2006, the Met has reached out to visual artists; in approaching Mr. Schnabel, the opera house was hoping to buff up its collection still further, Mr. Gelb said, and to expand on its mission of rebuilding connections to contemporary culture and society.
 Before he got down to painting, Mr. Schnabel, 56, wearing purple pajama pants and maroon slippers, took off his shirt and posed, barrel-chested, for some pictures with Mr. Rourke and Mr. Domingo. Using a black marker, Mr. Rourke inscribed over Mr. Schnabel's right pectoral a Rourke-like tattoo that said ''Got Milk.'' Mr. Domingo looked straight ahead. They took up a lot of room, three towers of ego burning oxygen by the barrelful. But luckily Mr. Schnabel's studio, on a lower floor of his 17-story palazzo in the West Village, is airy and enormous, with ceilings as tall as a church.
 Mr. Rourke, deeply tanned, shone with a slightly unnatural glow: he has, after all, come back from the dead more times than any actor since Burt Reynolds. Mr. Domingo was patient and relaxed, giving no indication that he leads a whirlwind life that would be the ruin of most people. Not only has he sung more roles, and sung them better, than probably any tenor in history, but at an age when most singers have begun to trim their repertory, he is also still expanding his. He runs two companies, the Los Angeles Opera and Washington National Opera, and in his spare time he conducts.
 ''My secret is that I enjoy so much what I'm doing,'' he said. ''Yes, sometimes one gets tired, but my work also gives me so much energy.'' And he added: ''You have to be lucky, and keep the voice in good shape, and then you have to do this job with a passion. It's not a job where you go to the office and just check in. You have to dedicate all you have.''
 Mr. Schnabel is himself a singer of sorts, and in the '90s recorded a rock album, ''Every Silver Lining Has a Cloud.'' More recently he has made headlines as the director of prizewinning films like ''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.'' But Mr. Schnabel, who once said of himself, ''I'm the closest you'll get to Picasso in this life,'' remains a painter of prodigious energy, productivity and self-confidence.
 A couple of days before painting the portraits, with the help of some black-clad assistants, he sorted through the summer's work, most of it done outdoors at his house on Long Island, picking some pictures for a coming exhibition in London, some for a show in India, keeping a few for himself. ''I'm like a whaler who just came in, and I'm taking in the whale oil,'' he said. 
 There were dozens of paintings, most of them huge, and most made from photographs or from some antique French hospital X-rays that had been blown up on canvas and then Schnabelized with ink, paint, resin and blobs of gesso. In some a figure shimmered faintly in the background; in some surfing pictures the waves seemed about to roll right through the canvas and flood the studio. 
 ''I like when I'm looking at something that's just about to form itself,'' Mr. Schnabel said, adding, ''The disagreement between the surface and what's behind it -- that space in between is what interests me.'' 
 About painting portraits, he said: ''I never paint from photographs. The idea of accident or surprise is very much a part of it. I'm putting myself where there's no guarantee of a return trip. You hope your painting looks like the subject, and mine seem to do that. When I paint paintings of people, I really get them. It's very important to me to capture the soul of the person.''
 He had never met Mr. Domingo, he said, adding: ''I think he's probably a good man -- he has a nice face. I don't want to paint anybody. I don't want to paint Fidel Castro. I wouldn't make a painting of George Bush.''
 After Mr. Rourke took his leave, Mr. Schnabel schmoozed with Mr. Domingo for a while, sometimes speaking in Spanish, and led him on a tour of the studio. He also took a few photographs with the giant Polaroid, which with sepia-tinted film tends to make people look as if they'd been exhumed from the Mathew Brady era. 
 ''It's very mature, but I guess that's me,'' Mr. Domingo said, uncertainly, of one that made him look almost marmoreal. He stroked his beard. ''It's making me very old.''
 Later he cautioned a newspaper photographer snapping his picture, ''The light tends to make hollows in the head, you know.''
 For the portrait, an assistant from the Met had brought along Mr. Domingo's Act III costume from Verdi's ''Simon Boccanegra'' -- tights, brocaded robe, shin guards, breastplate, gauntlets, cape -- and after Mr. Schnabel announced, ''O.K., kids, we can dress him up,'' Mr. Domingo retired to a corner.
 ''The tights wear out the hair on my legs,'' he said, wriggling into them, and after putting on the breastplate, he remarked: ''Oh, it's hotter than I remember. I thought it was just the stage lights.''
 When he was done, he struck a heroic pose for Mr. Schnabel and said: ''One of my strongest roles, for which I am best known, is Otello. There is also Adorno, from 'Simon Boccanegra.' But this could be Otello.''
 Mr. Schnabel said: ''I'm just going to paint you as you.'' He stationed Mr. Domingo in the shadow of a pillar, explaining to him, ''I like painting in oscurida, because the face comes out more,'' and told an assistant to tune his iPod to some songs his daughter's boyfriend had recorded.
 A jazzy, rocklike melody filled the room, and holding a cigarette in one hand, his brush in the other, Mr. Schnabel began quickly sketching, almost scratching, in white on a brown canvas roughly seven feet square. After about 20 minutes, the shape of a head emerged, a halo of hair, a glint of armor, the outline of a torso. Mr. Schnabel stepped back and ordered all bystanders to leave the studio. ''I'm just painting the light in,'' he said. 
 He started at 3:15 p.m., and at a little after 6 someone from the Met came by to collect the costume, and Mr. Domingo left for the airport. He had to be in Washington the next day for his company's season opener, ''La Traviata,'' an opera about a woman who burns herself out.

HEADLINE: NATO Tries to Reduce Afghan Casualties

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER; Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Graham Bowley and Eric Schmitt from New York.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The senior American military commander in Afghanistan said Tuesday that in an effort to reduce civilian casualties, he had tightened the rules around when NATO troops here may use lethal force.
 The commander, Gen. David D. McKiernan, also said that the military mission in Afghanistan was still short-handed by thousands of troops. General McKiernan was speaking to reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who arrived here after attending the ceremony for the change of American commanders in Baghdad.
 President Bush has ordered that an additional Marine Corps battalion and an Army brigade combat team arrive in Afghanistan by early next year. But even then, General McKiernan said, the Afghan mission requires at least three more combat brigades. The total of additional combat and support troops needed could exceed 15,000. 
 The additional forces are required to stem violence across Afghanistan, which is up about 30 percent compared with this time last year, the general said in an interview at his headquarters here.
 Because of the troop shortage, he said, the military was relying more on air power; that has contributed to the rise in civilian casualties, which has outraged Afghans and brought international condemnation.
 The civilian casualties have also become one of the greatest sources of tension between NATO forces and the Afghan government. 
 Hoping to reduce that toll, General McKiernan said, he issued a ''revised tactical order'' to NATO troops on Sept. 2, which emphasized putting Afghan forces out front in searches of homes and requiring multiple sources of information before attacking targets. 
 It also set rules calibrating how quickly troops may increase their use of force to lethal levels, the general said. 
 Most of the rules were already in place, General McKiernan said, but the revised order also was meant to re-emphasize proper procedures, especially as new forces are scheduled to enter the combat zone in the coming months.
 The revised order was issued after an American strike in Western Afghanistan in August, but fell short of the formal status-of-forces agreement demanded by the Afghan government in the wake of that strike. 
 The Afghan government and the United Nations said that the strike had killed about 90 civilians. The United States military says only 5 to 7 civilians were killed, along with more than 30 insurgents. But General McKiernan has reopened the military's investigation of the episode. 
 For civilians and American and NATO forces, this year has been the deadliest since the Taliban were ousted in 2001, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which released its latest casualty figures on Tuesday.
 It said 1,445 civilians were killed in the first eight months of this year, compared with 1,040 for the same period in 2007. 
 Of those deaths, 800, or 55 percent, were attributed to the Taliban and other insurgent forces, twice the number from last year, as they press a campaign of intimidation aimed at civilians who support the government. 
 In a common refrain of military commanders, General McKiernan said ultimate success in the war depended on competent government and economic development. 
 He also acknowledged that a particularly vexing problem facing the military effort was that the insurgents have found a haven across the border in tribal areas of Pakistan, where American commandos carried out an incursion from Afghanistan on Sept. 3.
 That incursion, along with a rising number of strikes by unmanned drones, has severely strained relations between the United States and Pakistan. 
 The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, made a hastily arranged visit to Pakistan on Tuesday for talks aimed at easing those tensions. Like Mr. Gates, he arrived after attending the ceremony in Baghdad where Gen. Ray Odierno took over command of American forces in Iraq from Gen. David H. Petraeus.
 Admiral Mullen's visit also coincided with conflicting accounts about a possible second American raid on Monday, as well as a warning by the Pakistan military that it would shoot at any foreign forces that crossed the border.
 A Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said the Pakistani Army reserved the right to use force to defend the country and its people, but he said there was ''no change in policy.'' 
 Asked what the Pakistan military would do if there was a future incursion by American troops, he said: ''There is a big 'if' involved. We will see to it when such a situation arises.''
 A Pakistani governor made a televised appearance on Tuesday to insist that American forces had tried to cross the border early Monday and had been repulsed by Pakistani fire, as local residents and a Pakistani government official had said the day before. 
 But the Pakistani and United States military publicly denied any such incursion, and a Pakistani intelligence official said an American helicopter had mistakenly crossed the border briefly, leading Pakistani ground forces to fire into the air. 
 In an interview on Pakistani television on Tuesday, the governor, Owais Ahmed Ghani of North-West Frontier Province, said that only Pakistan had ''a right to conduct operations on its soil.'' 
 He said that Pakistan ''will jealously guard its right,'' and that incursions will not be tolerated. 
 The Pakistani leadership, meanwhile, has warned that American attacks on Pakistani soil threaten to undermine the country's democratically elected government.
 ''This situation doesn't help democracy,'' Pakistan's newly elected president, Asif Ali Zardari, was quoted as saying after meeting in London on Tuesday with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. 
 Asked about future cross-border raids, Mr. Zardari said, ''I don't think there will be any more.''

HEADLINE: The Fed Holds Rates Steady, and Wall Street Turns a Bad Start Around

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Vikas Bajaj, Keith Bradsher, Martin Fackler, Andrew Kramer and Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve, bucking expectations, decided to keep interest rates steady at its meeting on Tuesday, making no mention of the dramatic shake-ups on Wall Street, more than a few stock watchers held their breath and braced for the market to plummet.
 The Fed appeared to be taking a gamble on a day when the stakes were immensely high: stocks were less than 24 hours removed from their worst session since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
 But after an initial drop, stocks rose, surging into positive territory and finishing near their highs for the day. The Dow Jones industrial average made up 141.51 of the 504 points it lost a day earlier.
 It was a positive end to a wild day on Wall Street, where the tremors of the stock chart resembled the readout of a seismograph in Pompeii.
 But the gain was by no means an end to investors' uncertainty -- nor did it placate investors and borrowers who remained deeply troubled by the last week's events.
 Banks raised the rates they charge one another for short-term loans, a sign that financial institutions are increasingly wary that even the most well-capitalized outfits could be vulnerable in the current crisis. Benchmark gauges of anxiety, including the Libor, more than doubled. And the value of a prominent fund in the usually serene world of money market funds fell below $1 a share, a benchmark rarely breached.
 ''Investors are looking for safety and looking for liquidity,'' said Peter Crane, whose company, Crane Data, publishes data about money market funds.
 The sudden demise of Lehman Brothers and the lightning-quick acquisition of Merrill Lynch -- firms that only months ago appeared to stand on solid ground -- have left financial players scared. Investors also remained concerned about the prospects of the American International Group, the big insurer, which was desperately seeking capital to avoid a collapse. 
 On Tuesday, many investors were moving their assets into ultrasafe government notes, helping send the yield on the one-month Treasury bill to 0.259 percent, down from 1.507 percent a week earlier.
 Longer-term rates rose, however, as the benchmark 10-year Treasury bill climbed to 3.44 percent, from 3.39 percent late Monday and the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 14/32, to 104 22/32. 
 Investors remained concerned about the prospects of A.I.G., which was working to seal a deal with the Federal Reserve for $85 billion in capital to avoid a collapse. Shares of A.I.G., which fell 61 percent on Monday, lost another 21 percent Tuesday, to close at $3.75. 
 On Tuesday, shares of some financial firms showed gains, with Merrill Lynch rising 30 percent and Bank of America gaining 11.3 percent as investors appeared to warm to their new partnership. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended higher by about 1.8 percent after losing 4.7 percent on Monday. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 1.3 percent. 
 But financial stocks were already dropping again in after-hours trading. And the modest rise in the American stock market was a sharp contrast with big declines on exchanges around the world on Tuesday. Indexes in London and Paris fell about 2 percent, and the major exchange in Frankfurt tumbled 1 percent.
 European investors remained pessimistic that interbank lending would remain stagnant for some time and continued to worry about exposure of local insurers and banks to assets held by the troubled firms. 
 ''Yesterday it looked like a Category 4 hurricane,'' said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Wealth in London. ''Today it looks more like a tropical storm -- still destructive but maybe not devastating.'' 
 Those declines, however, did not match the steep losses in the Asian markets, where indexes in Tokyo and Shanghai fell 5 percent. The Kospi index in Seoul lost 6.1 percent. Because of a holiday on Monday, it was the first day of trading in those markets since the weekend shake-up on Wall Street. 
 Analysts said the sell-off in Tokyo was led by foreign investors. ''The United States is in trouble, so they think everywhere else is also in trouble,'' said Kiichi Fujita, a strategist at Nomura Securities, the largest Japanese brokerage firm. 
 But the worst pain occurred in Russia, where the nation's largest stock market, the Micex, lost 17.45 percent, its biggest single-day decline in more than a decade. Both of Russia's major exchanges halted trading in midafternoon. 
 ''Asia was catching up after being closed on Monday,'' said Simon Hallett, chief investment officer of Harding Loevner Management, an investment firm based in Somerville, N.J. ''Russia is in a separate case. I don't think what is happening in Russia is directly related to what is happening in the rest of the world.''
 Half of the value of the Russian market has vanished since May on declining oil prices and the violence in Georgia.
 Gazprom, the big Russian energy company, closed down 17.2 percent, erasing all the gains the company had lured out of investors by raising gas prices in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
 Asian stock markets opened with strong gains on Wednesday morning following Wall Street's rally at the close in New York. But the Asian rally quickly began to lose steam as worries returned about the extent of harm to the global financial system.
 The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was down 0.7 percent by late morning after jumping 1.7 percent in early trading, while Australia's market had fallen 0.6 percent. But markets in Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul were still ahead, although this partly reflected the closing of the Tokyo market for the daily lunch break before heavier selling hit other Asian markets.

HEADLINE: Japan Banking Stocks Suffer Biggest Drop Since 1987

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused panicked selling of banking shares in Tokyo, where many of the failed American company's biggest creditors were based. But analysts and bankers said the actual effect here would be limited. 
 In its bankruptcy filing in New York on Sunday, Lehman said it had outstanding loans worth $1.6 billion to seven Japanese banks, including the Tokyo-based Aozora Bank, to which it owes $463 million. Lehman also said it owed $289 million to Mizuho Corporate and $231 million to Shinsei, among other banks.
 The disclosures helped initiate a sharp sell-off of Japanese banking stocks on Tuesday in Tokyo, which as a group posted their biggest one-day loss since 1987. The declines were led by Aozora, whose shares plunged almost 16 percent. 
 Lehman's local unit also added to unease on Tuesday when it filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo court. Teikoku Data Bank, a market research company, estimated the local unit's total liabilities at $32.7 billion, making it the second-largest bankruptcy in Japanese history. Calls to Lehman's Tokyo corporate communications unit went unanswered.
 Trying to control the damage, the Japanese banks said Lehman's figures greatly overstated their potential losses from Lehman's collapse. They said they had limited their exposure by means of derivatives, collateral and selling parts of the loans to other investors. 
 Analysts agreed, saying that Japanese banks' losses were most likely much smaller than Lehman's filing indicated. But they also cautioned that the losses could be greater than the banks believed.
 That is because the full impact of the bankruptcy is not known in global financial markets, and particularly in derivatives markets where Lehman was a big player. Analysts said banks in Japan and elsewhere might find these complicated and sometimes arcane financial instruments suddenly made worthless by the Lehman collapse. 
 Still, even with the additional losses, Lehman's collapse is unlikely to inflict more than minor financial damage to banks here in Tokyo, Asia's largest financial center, analysts said.
 ''There won't be any big shock to Japan's financial industry,'' said Reiko Toritani, a senior director at the Tokyo office of Fitch Ratings, a credit rating company. ''The banks have hedged their risk.''
 Tsutomu Jimbo, a spokesman for Aozora, said the bank had about $25 million at risk from the Lehman collapse, only about 6 percent of the amount declared by Lehman and a fraction of the bank's total $7.4 billion capitalization. 
 He explained the difference by saying the bank had reduced its original exposure by $255 million using a type of derivative called a credit-default swap, which hedged the bank against loan losses. Mr. Jimbo said the bank also had another $180 million worth of collateral from Lehman, though he would not say what those assets were.
 Mizuho Corporate also used credit-default swaps, and sold off much of its loans to other investors in a practice called syndicated lending, said Hiroaki Kanno, a spokesman. As a result, Mr. Kanno said the bank's actual exposure to Lehman was ''much smaller'' than the amount declared in the filing, though he did not give a figure.

HEADLINE: Asian Markets Rally Early, Then Lose Steam

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Stock markets surged at the opening across much of Asia on Wednesday in response to the Federal Reserve's rescue of the struggling insurer American International Group, but the rally began to lose steam by lunchtime on concerns about the United States financial system and China's economy. 
 Economists and fund managers welcomed the opening rally in Asian markets but were concerned about what comes next.
 ''It seems related partly to the A.I.G. announcement but also partly the positive finish on Wall Street,'' said Thomas Lam, the senior treasury economist at the United Overseas Bank in Singapore. ''I don't think the financial markets are out of the woods, they're still pretty edgy.''
 The Dow Jones Industrials finished Tuesday up 141.51 points, or 1.3 percent at 11,059.02.
 The CSI 300 Index of shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 2 percent by midday as worries persisted about a real estate slowdown in mainland China. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was down 1 percent by late morning after jumping 1.7 percent in early trading, while Singapore's market had dipped 0.5 percent and Australia's market had fallen 0.3 percent.
 But the Tokyo market was still ahead by 1.5 percent after trading resumed there following that market's daily lunch break.
 Stock markets elsewhere in Asia also fared better, with the Seoul and Jakarta markets each up 2.4 percent in early afternoon trading. The Taipei market was up 1.4 percent, dragged down from a strong opening by the selling in mainland China markets.

HEADLINE: Adobe's Profit Down, but Tops Forecasts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The publishing and design software maker Adobe Systems said Tuesday its quarterly profit fell 7 percent but was better than Wall Street had expected. 
 Investors also were heartened by positive signals from Adobe for the current quarter.
 Adobe said sales of its Acrobat and LiveCycle products and a diverse business drove the quarter's results, even amid the bad economy. 
 Adobe, based in San Jose, Calif., said it earned $192 million, or 35 cents a share, down from $205 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier.
 The company had fewer outstanding shares in the latest quarter, raising per-share earnings. Higher operating costs and lower interest income contributed to the quarter's lower net profit.
 Excluding one-time items, however, Adobe earned 50 cents a share, above Wall Street's expectations for 46 cents, according to ThomsonReuters. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 29 and was the third quarter of Adobe's fiscal year, climbed 4 percent to $887 million, beating the forecast of $877 million.
 ''It is clear the cumulative benefit of our increasingly diversified business across product lines, customer segments, and geographies, is contributing to Adobe's success,'' the chief executive, Shantanu Narayen, said on a conference call with investors.

HEADLINE: Shares Slip As Dell Sees Cutbacks In Its Sector

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
For the second time in as many months, Dell rattled its investors by warning that its customers are reluctant about spending on computers and servers. 
 On Tuesday, the computer maker cautioned that slumping demand for technology equipment across the globe was affecting its business. The somber message, issued halfway through Dell's third quarter, caused a drop of more than 11 percent in the price of the company's stock. Dell closed Tuesday at $15.98, down $2.01. 
 Dell has frequently cited lackluster demand for technology for less than stellar financial results. In August, Dell warned that weakness in spending in the United States had carried over to Europe and Asia. It said that decline in spending contributed to a 17 percent drop in quarterly profit. The company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early September that it planned to shrink its worldwide network of factories. 
 ''We saw a very weak August,'' Dell's chief financial officer, Brian T. Gladden, said Tuesday at a Bank of America investors conference in San Francisco.
 Only about 20 percent of Dell's revenue comes from consumers. Its reliance on business spending, and on the government, military and education sectors, is causing Dell to feel the impact of the slowing economy ahead of some major rivals. 
 Small and medium-size businesses and the federal government are reining in technology purchases. ''Corporate spending has been relatively balanced for us in the U.S. and the consumer market continues to be pretty strong,'' Mr. Gladden said. 
 Some analysts have questioned whether Dell's problems are of its own making. In August, the company blamed ''self-inflicted'' factors, like price cutting, for part of its woes. Mr. Gladden deflected these critiques Tuesday and emphasized that there was ''more broad-based slowing'' in the economy.
 Dell warned of particular weakness in Britain and southern Europe. It also cited difficulty selling in China. ''We saw weakness in China as part of the Olympic period and expected it to snap back,'' Mr. Gladden said. ''We have dug a bit of a hole there.'' 
 Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. have proved more resilient than some of their competitors in recent months, and in recent statements they remain optimistic. Both companies have a broad range of products sold globally. Hewlett-Packard's customers are balanced between consumer and business customers. But a number of analysts expect the two companies to face increasing pressure because of the recent strengthening of the dollar.
 H.P.'s chief financial officer, Cathie Lesjak, said at the Bank of America event that the technology company is ''very confident'' in the recent guidance it gave its investors. 
 With uncertainty rife in the financial markets and more financial services companies facing difficulties, Forrester Research scrambled this week to revise its forecast for technology spending in the United States. Forrester is now forecasting that year-over-year growth in sales of computers, software and outsourcing services will slow significantly, while spending growth for communications equipment and technology services should actually increase at a faster rate in 2008. 
 The research firm said it expects that softness in technology purchases will begin in the latter part of 2008 and early 2009 as companies pull back on capital spending. It is now predicting an increase in tech spending in 2009 of 6.1 percent, down from its previous forecast of 9.4 percent.
 Softness in the financial sector is of particular concern to the large hardware makers, as Wall Street firms tend to spend heavily on technology.

HEADLINE: FATHER WAS A SPY, SONS CONCLUDE WITH REGRET

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
They were the most famous orphans of the cold war, only 6 and 10 years old in 1953 when their parents were executed at Sing Sing for delivering atomic-bomb secrets to the Soviet Union. Then they were whisked from an unwanted limelight to urban anonymity and eventually to suburban obscurity. 
 Adopting their foster parents' surname, they staked their own claim to radical campus politics in the 1960s. Then in 1973, they emerged to reclaim their identities as the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, determined to vindicate their parents. 
 Now, confronted with the surprising confession last week of Morton Sobell, Julius Rosenberg's City College classmate and co-defendant, the brothers have admitted to a painful conclusion: that their father was a spy. 
 ''I don't have any reason to doubt Morty,'' Michael Meeropol said after several conversations with Mr. Sobell over the weekend. 
 Their conclusions, in separate interviews, amount to a milestone in America's culture wars and the culmination of the brothers' own emotional and intellectual odyssey. 
 It began in July 1950, when F.B.I. agents arrested Julius Rosenberg in the family's Lower East Side apartment, thrusting the boys onto a global stage as bit players in their parents' appeals, in the government's efforts to extract their parents' cooperation, and in Soviet propaganda campaigns to cast the Rosenbergs as martyrs. 
 Their journey became public again nearly a generation later when the brothers proclaimed that their parents were framed to feed cold war hysteria and compensate for America's counterespionage lapses. Amid the Watergate-era revelations of criminal conspiracies and cover-ups, they began a legal battle to release all the government records in the case. 
 While they were vested in a single outcome, they insisted all along that they would follow the facts, wherever they led. 
 ''We believed they were innocent and we tried to prove them innocent,'' Michael Meeropol said on Sunday. ''But I remember saying to myself in late 1975, maybe a little later, that whatever happens, it doesn't change me. We really meant it, that the truth is more important than our political position.''
 This is how they still see things: whatever atomic bomb information their father passed to the Russians was, at best, superfluous; the case was riddled with prosecutorial and judicial misconduct; their mother was convicted on flimsy evidence to place leverage on her husband; and neither deserved the death penalty. 
 But after digesting Mr. Sobell's confession, in an interview last week with The New York Times, that he and Julius stole nonatomic military and industrial secrets, the Meeropols have now concluded that continuing to claim that their father was innocent of an espionage conspiracy was no longer defensible. 
 ''I had considered that a real possibility for some time,'' Robert Meeropol said, ''and this tips the balance.''
 Today, both brothers are grandfathers. Michael, 65, is a professor and chairman of the economics department at Western New England College in Springfield, Mass. Robert, 61, is a lawyer and runs the Rosenberg Fund for Children, which advocates on behalf of young people whose parents have suffered because of their progressive politics. Both live in western Massachusetts.
 Robert's daughter Rachel is a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights. In 2004, Michael's daughter, Ivy, produced a documentary about the case, ''Heir to an Execution.'' In that film, Michael recalled the other day, he said he was ''perfectly happy to live with the ambiguity'' about the case. But that ambiguity, as far as his father is concerned, ended last week with Mr. Sobell's confession and left Mr. Meeropol philosophical but, presumably, less happy.
 ''It's different,'' he said.
 Ethel Rosenberg was arrested in August 1950. The boys were shuttled to shelters and from one home to another after their grandmother, Ethel's mother, said she could no longer care for them. After their parents were executed, they were adopted by Abel and Anne Meeropol. He was a Bronx schoolteacher and lyricist, who, under a pen name, wrote ''Strange Fruit'' and ''The House I Live In.'' 
 The brothers became talismans for a lost cause. They would literally be embraced by Rosenberg defenders, dwindling in number but unflagging in their faith, as touchstones of an era when the world was reflexively defined as black or white (or red). If you believed the Rosenbergs were not guilty, you were considered a fellow traveler. If you believed the government, you were viewed as a McCarthyite. 
 First, the brothers sued Louis Nizer, a lawyer, for unauthorized use of their parents' death-house letters in his book about the case. They fought protracted legal battles to release F.B.I. files and were buoyed when those raw investigative records and interrogations disgorged a minefield of inconsistencies. 
 They knew, and acknowledged, that their parents were committed Communists, but discovered, as Robert Meeropol once said, that ''it's much harder to prove someone innocent than to prove them guilty.''
 For more than three decades, that path to proof twisted and turned precariously. As the new revelations shrank the brothers' defensive perimeter, the Meeropols seemed to be tiptoeing toward the posture they expressed this week. Meanwhile, they raised their families and wrote a book, ''We Are Your Sons.'' Robert, after editing the Socialist Review in California, returned to Springfield and enrolled in law school. Their attendance at periodic commemorations of the case and of their parents' execution became less obligatory. 
 In the 1990s, the government released decrypted wartime Soviet cables that further implicated their father. Then their uncle, David Greenglass, who was an Army machinist at Los Alamos, N.M., where the atomic bomb was made, and was recruited by Julius Rosenberg as a spy, admitted that he fabricated the most damning testimony against their mother, but insisted that Julius was guilty of the formal charge, conspiracy to commit espionage. 
 Five years ago, in a memoir, ''An Execution in the Family,'' Robert Meeropol recalled the criticism that his parents had engaged in high-risk activities that could orphan their children, but he said their decisions deserved to be judged in the context of their time. 
 ''I became more careful about my political activities when I became a parent,'' he wrote. ''This may be because I knew from painful experience the terrible toll activist parents' decisions can take on their children, and I did not wish my childhood nightmare visited on my children.'' 
 The boys visited Sing Sing prison in Ossining, N.Y., on Thursday, June 18, 1953, their parents' 14th wedding anniversary. Michael interrupted the death-house decorum by wailing: ''One more day to live.'' The following day, their parents wrote: ''Always remember that we were innocent and could not wrong our conscience.'' 
 Do the brothers feel betrayed by their parents' protestations of innocence? Did they, themselves, betray other supporters of the cause by seeking vindication?
 ''I don't feel that way,'' Robert said. ''I can understand that they didn't do the thing they were being killed for. The grand jury testimony taught me more about my parents' social circle. It's a description of a whole bunch of 20-somethings, people who came out of the Depression, not only survived but went to the top of their class and they thought they could change the world. They were going to do what they could to make their mark. Until it all came crashing down.
 ''What Julius was asked to do was send his best friendsto jail, and he could not do that. My parents would have to have made a bigger betrayal to avoid betraying me, and frankly I don't consider myself that important.''

HEADLINE: Winning Against Hopelessness

BYLINE: By RYAN GOLDBERG

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
For several months in 1989, in neighborhoods that had been devastated by gang violence and drugs, the sight of a red Toyota Land Cruiser would scatter teenagers loitering on street corners and in public housing projects.
 The driver would shout at them, hoping to convince them that he was not an undercover police officer. They might have stayed and listened had they known this man was there to help. Or if they had known about his past.
 ''The kids would whisper 5-0 under their breath,'' the man, Roynell Young, recently recalled with a laugh. ''The red truck became a giveaway.''
 At the time, Young was one year removed from an N.F.L. career that had spanned nine years and included an All-Pro season and a Super Bowl appearance. A tough 6-foot-1 defensive back for the Eagles, he had been a fan favorite at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. 
 But when he retired, he ducked from the spotlight and resurfaced here, where he said his real calling resided. He had passed through this city in college and figured that few here would know much about his football life. He said he did not want his fame to interfere with his message. 
 ''My job is to interrupt the pipeline that is causing young men to go from the cradle to prison,'' Young, 50, said recently.
 His modest idea was to create an after-school program. It has blossomed into something far more comprehensive. 
 Through the years, he said, more than 1,000 at-risk young people have arrived at his doors. And early next month, his programs, known collectively as Pro-Vision, a nonprofit organization, will move from a tiny schoolhouse to a 16-acre campus financed by private contributions. Young says he hopes his new campus -- with its nature trail, garden, tree farm, amphitheater and N.F.L.-sponsored football field -- will help revitalize the city's Sunnyside community.
 Young, the chief executive of Pro-Vision, said he expected the move to occur by the end of this month, but Hurricane Ike foiled that plan last week.
 ''At the new site, we don't have power, trees were ripped out of the ground, fences knocked down,'' he said by telephone Tuesday, adding that his staff and students were safe.
 For Young, who lives in Houston with his wife, Kathleen, and has a son, Roynell Jr., the motivation for all this was personal. 
 ''In a nutshell,'' he said, ''I'm one of those kids. The only difference is, I had a community to support me.'' 
 He started his after-school program in 1990. Five years later, he introduced an all-male charter middle school. Then he created a job-training program. 
 Many of the young people who have entered his programs are black or Hispanic and from homes headed by single women. Young has encouraged them to find purpose and meaning through faith and community. Young became their last chance. His school, he said, became their refuge.
 Those who work for the Houston Independent School District see his work as essential to building a healthier city.
 ''Roy is trying to make Houston a better place to live,'' said Debbie Singleton, the school district's director of alternative education. ''He's the whole package to offer kids, and that does not happen in schools.''
 Young uses his own background to relate to troubled youths. He grew up in the Uptown section of New Orleans, the third of six children in a solid household. But in his senior year of high school, he said, he began hanging out in a rough crowd and abusing marijuana. This continued after he enrolled at Alcorn State. Football was his anchor, yet he nearly quit the team his sophomore year.
 ''It is one black hole; I can't remember that life,'' he said. ''I was a good person. I had a quiet desperation, and I needed someone to come along and help me out.''
 Help came from a friend who urged him to stay on the team and introduced him to a deacon during his winter break in New Orleans.
 ''Based on my encounter with him that night, I had a spiritual conversion,'' he said. ''This spiritual part of me exploded.''
 Young, who majored in physical education and health, had been on the brink of flunking out of college. Instead, he earned his way onto the dean's list and became a first-round draft pick by the Eagles in 1980. He considered himself a reluctant star in Philadelphia, and by the middle of his career, he was considering life after football. 
 ''I went outside of the parameters of what, quote, a celebrity athlete is supposed to be and how he's supposed to live,'' he said. ''So I explored different areas, which ultimately took me down to north Philadelphia, which ultimately led to me seeing some things that wasn't so pretty about life.''
 He started his after-school program, known today as the Manhood Development Program, during his first year in Houston. It began with a pickup basketball game at a middle school. Young and a friend challenged a few students. If the adults were to win, the youngsters would have to stay and talk about their lives. If the youngsters were to win, the adults would buy them pizza. Young's side won.
 ''I had never seen men of such character in my life,'' said one of those boys, Jartis Watts, now 32. ''I had never been around men I could trust fully. They were educated. I had never seen that.''
 Watts and his friends were hooked, and they told others. The game swelled each week, and ultimately, 50 students decided to join an official program. The first office was the back of that red Land Cruiser. 
 In the summer, Young and the youths ventured around the country for manual service projects -- building a playground, painting a school -- in cities like New Orleans; Camden, N.J.; and Philadelphia. Young became a surrogate father to many in that earliest group, especially for Watts, who said he grew up fatherless in a violent household. 
 ''Pro-Vision was an escape for me,'' Watts said. ''My family wouldn't come see me play sports. They did. When I made all A's, they would take me out to restaurants.''
 When Watts was recruited for football in high school, Young met with the coaches. At Sam Houston State, where Watts captained the team and earned a scholar-athlete award, he and Young spoke on the phone often. Today, the engineering company Watts set up because of Young's advice is wiring Pro-Vision's campus.
 After about five years of running the Manhood Program, Young decided to create an all-boys middle school. 
 Rod Paige, the federal secretary of education from 2001 through 2005, was the head of the school district at the time and granted Young's charter. He said he remembers what Young told him in their first meeting.
 ''Before these kids can get engaged enough to learn in math and reading and writing and stuff like that, they got to find some meaning in their lives,'' Paige said in an interview at his Houston office. He paused. ''Meaning in their lives.''
 For the past eight years, Pro-Vision has occupied a one-story brick building at the corner of Balkin Street and Cullen Boulevard in an area known as the Third Ward. Deserted buildings, auto shops and ramshackle houses line Cullen, a main artery through the south side. 
 The school's walls are thin. Young's students return home to encounter drug deals, domestic and gang violence, and neglect. More than 90 percent of the 120 middle school students in fifth through eighth grade live at or below the poverty line.
 But a study conducted by the school found that 81 percent of its students ultimately graduate from high school. Citywide, the figure is about 60 percent. 
 ''I paint the picture of what could be if only you would invest in yourself,'' Young said. ''And then I explain to them that no one here makes anyone do anything. The commitment has to come from deep down within you.''
 That commitment starts with discipline and structure. On a recent morning, boys patiently filed in the rear entrance after being searched. Throughout the day, students asked for permission to speak and used ''sir'' or ''ma'am'' when answering questions. Young and his administrators paced the hallways, narrow and low. Students did pushups for any infraction. At the sight of a problem, teachers flocked around the student in question to offer encouragement and support.
 It was obvious that staff and students were restless with the new campus only weeks away from opening. But the chatter had already turned to a plan that would extend Young's considerable reach.
 ''In our master design, we have a high school wing that can be added,'' he said. ''And I think at the end of the day, that's where we'll end up. That's exactly where we'll end up.''

HEADLINE: Jitters From Wall Street to Main Street

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Wall St. in Worst Loss Since '01 Despite Reassurances by Bush'' (front page, Sept. 16):
 First it was Bear Stearns, then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and now the word is of a possible bailout of Lehman Brothers. Where does the emergency aid come from when the government steps in? Ultimately from my wages and yours. 
 The Republicans talk a good game about tax cuts. But when untold billions are siphoned off of public funds that might go to any number of worthy causes -- what is that if not an abuse of our tax money?
 Indeed, after the fact, intervention is the only option. But the Republicans can't have it both ways. They can't tout tax-cutting credentials and condemn government spending while refusing to regulate financial markets and letting them run amok. If that isn't lavish government spending in the extreme, what is? 
 We wouldn't be in this situation if the Bush administration had cared about the hard-earned money of average Americans, which it gladly takes from us every pay period. It would be one thing if this were an entirely new phenomenon. But we've been down this road before, in the 1980s, under another Republican administration that also touted tax cuts, even as it poured a chunk of our wages down the drain of bailouts.
 Donald Mengay Brooklyn, Sept. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 It would be interesting to tally all the employee bonuses over 50 percent of base salary that have been paid by Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers over the last 10 years. My bet is that the total, with compounded interest, would be a sizable bailout fund.
 Maarten Persenaire Phoenixville, Pa., Sept. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Bailout Hide and Seek'' (editorial, Sept. 14) did not mention a most telling analogy: Enron. Have we forgotten already the problems that arise from off-balance sheet liabilities of controlled entities? 
 Ben Stein's Sept. 14 column (''Where to Direct All That Rage,'' Money and Business) correctly blamed Washington's failure to adequately regulate and prosecute for the key economic debacles of the last 25 years. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted to prevent future Enron behavior in the private sector. The Congressional Budget Office's alternate budget -- perhaps the government equivalent of a post-Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblowing auditor? -- does not fix anything. The government needs to apply the lessons learned from Enron and the other financial disasters of the last several years to its handling of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Susan Bernhardt Denver, Sept. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial is right on target. As a former member of Congress and a certified public accountant, I have been sounding the alarm for several years about how the federal government has been using convenient accounting methods to manipulate the federal budget. 
 Administration after administration has grossly understated the annual federal budget deficit, the national debt and, as a result, the true cost of federal guarantees and bailouts. It is time to make these practices illegal, as they are in the private sector.
 The second Hoover Commission in 1956 saw this clearly, and it pushed Congress to amend the 1950 Budget and Accounting Procedures Act to require all government agencies to maintain their accounts on the accrual basis, which the Securities and Exchange Commission imposes on publicly traded companies. 
 To protect the taxpayers, it is time to end 50 years of a double standard and fraudulent federal accounting by implementing this law. Joseph J. DioGuardi Ossining, N.Y., Sept. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As some of our biggest, oldest and most respected financial firms crash and burn, there is one thing to be thankful for: that we prevented President Bush from privatizing our Social Security. That, at least, is safe from the greed-driven recklessness of the barons of Wall Street.
 Sam Abrams Rochester, Sept. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman said it best (''Financial Russian Roulette,'' column, Sept. 15): ''If institutions need to be rescued like banks, they should be regulated like banks.'' 
 The free marketeers vehemently oppose regulations when they are inventing more ways to gain profits, but they expect taxpayer bailouts when they get into trouble.
 There is something very wrong with opposing regulations on the profit side but expecting handouts on the losing side. Isn't that the behavior they decry when ordinary citizens default on their usury-adjusted loans? Or when they can't pay off the balances on credit cards because interest rates have jumped to 30 percent plus fees? 
 When will we accept the fact that unregulated, free markets don't work for anyone, banks or people? And that socialism for banks and corporations is not -- by any stretch of the imagination -- a free market.
 Georgia Kelly Sonoma, Calif., Sept. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 John McCain's swipe at the ''greed'' of Wall Street bankers recalls another famous Republican politician, who was elected president 80 years ago this fall (''In Candidates, Two Approaches to Wall Street,'' front page, Sept. 16).
 Amid the worst economic crisis in American history, the president was asked to comment on the problems of capitalism. ''The only trouble with capitalism is capitalists,'' he said. ''They're too darn greedy.''
 But the real problem lay in the president's free-market ideology, which he refused to revise in light of new knowledge and experience. 
 It also reflected his outsized ego, which made him believe that he could alter business behavior simply through the force of his own personality.
 You already know his name: Herbert Hoover. Jonathan Zimmerman New York, Sept. 16, 2008
 The writer is a professor of education and history at New York University.
 To the Editor:
 If there is a silver lining to the Wall Street meltdown, it is the timing. The public will have time to consider and evaluate each candidate's plans to address the present economic crisis. 
 The McCain and Obama campaigns should be called upon to list the names and credentials of their top policy advisers on economic issues. This list should be easy for anyone to locate and understand.
 Furthermore, each candidate should state clearly and specifically the key components of his strategies for correcting the wild course that has been charted by this country's financial institutions over the past number of years. No more vague rhetoric. 
 It's time to stop slinging mud and give us some crucial information about what we can expect in terms of presidential leadership, after seven years of letting the profiteers run amok, at home and abroad.
 Leah Middlebrook Portola Valley, Calif., Sept. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I find it surprising that Wall Street investment ''wizards'' bet the bank on risky mortgage securities. I thought that they were supposed to be among the best and the brightest, but it turns out that too many of them thought they would make a killing on selling subprime mortgages to people who didn't know better. Now we all have to suffer the consequences. Whatever happened to investing for the long term?

HEADLINE: Challenged On 2 Fronts, Fed Leaves Rate Alone

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers kept their benchmark lending rate unchanged at 2 percent on Tuesday, highlighting the conflicting pressures of an epic financial crisis and nagging inflation.
 Although the decision initially disappointed investors, analysts said it reflected the Fed's determination to separate basic monetary policy from the specific credit and cash problems on Wall Street. 
 Even as the Fed announced its decision to stand pat, officials were rushing to complete a huge loan package for American International Group, the troubled giant insurance company. 
 Some economists said the decision on rates also reflected the unhappy truth that a cut in the overnight federal funds rate might have merely highlighted the Fed's limited ability to solve a problem that entails the entire housing and mortgage markets.
 By holding steady on interest rates, the Fed is reflecting the uncomfortable fact that interest rates have little to do with the credit crisis stemming from staggering losses on poorly underwritten mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.
 The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee ''has decided to stand pat despite the market turmoil,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at California State University, Channel Islands, who studies financial markets. 
 ''Lower interest rates at this time would not solve any problems in the financial markets,'' he said. ''The market is not short of liquidity; it is short of confidence.''
 Even though consumer prices actually declined slightly in August, largely because of a drop in oil prices, the Fed noted that inflation had been high and that the outlook for prices ''remains highly uncertain.''
 ''The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern,'' said the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. 
 Policy makers said they would ''monitor economic and financial developments carefully,'' adding that they would ''act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.''
 Below the surface, the Fed continued to flood the markets with extra cash through its open-market operations in New York. On Tuesday morning, the Fed injected an additional $50 billion into the markets simply to keep the federal funds rate at its target level of 2 percent. The effective funds rate had climbed as high as 4 percent when markets opened. 
 The Fed indicated that it was watching closely to see if the broader economy would further stumble because of Wall Street's illness, which could happen if businesses and home buyers were unable to obtain credit. 
 ''The financial markets aren't frozen because the federal funds rate is too high,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''The markets are frozen because there is a crisis of confidence. It's not a matter of whether the short rate is 2 percent or 1.5 percent.''
 By any measure, the economy has already slowed sharply. The United States has lost an average of 75,000 jobs a month since January, for a total loss of 605,000 jobs through August. The unemployment rate hit 6.1 percent last month, up from 4.9 percent in January.
 Some sectors of the economy have been surprisingly strong. Exports have received a boost from the dollar's sharp drop against other major currencies, which makes American products cheaper in foreign markets, and from healthy growth in other parts of the world. But most forecasters predict that the export boom will probably fade as slower growth in the United States spills over to foreign markets. 
 The technology sector, which had been strong despite the economy's other problems, on Tuesday showed some signs of weakening. Dell warned that worsening conditions across the globe might hurt its third quarter -- a message that set off a 10 percent drop in the price of Dell shares.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Prices Rise, but at a Slower Pace

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
The surge in gasoline prices slowed a bit on Tuesday as oil companies reported that the damage from Hurricane Ike to production platforms and refineries appeared to be relatively minor.
 The upbeat reports, though preliminary, were one of several reasons oil prices continued their slide Tuesday, dropping to $91.42 a barrel, down $4.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the second consecutive day of big retreats that have brought crude down more than $50 below its peak of $145.29 a barrel in July. 
 The collapse in oil prices appears to be stem mainly from a growing perception that the global economy is sliding into a recession. It comes despite escalating rebel attacks on oil operations in Nigeria and two major hurricanes that have shut down 20 percent of the nation's refining capacity and almost all of the oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 But even as oil prices are sliding, gasoline prices are going up because of tightening supplies. The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose overnight, to $3.85, according to AAA, the automotive club. That was considerably slower than the 16-cent-a-gallon rise in recent days as Ike passed through the Gulf and damage reports began to come in. 
 The oil companies have flown over their oil and gas platforms and begun sending crews to their most important production and refining facilities. The preliminary news is good, with only 28 mostly older and smaller platforms out of a total of 3,800 oil and gas platforms reported destroyed and little flooding or structural damage to more than 20 refineries in and around Hurricane Ike's path.
 Gulf oil and gas production trickled back Tuesday, but 97.2 percent of oil production and 84.2 percent of gas production was still off line, according to the Minerals Management Service.
 ''We did better than we thought,'' said Chip Johnson, president and chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas.
 Experts are predicting that half of the 14 refineries in Texas and Louisiana shut down by Ike will be at or near normal operation in a week or so when power supplies are back on line. But other refineries may take longer to restart, and some energy analysts predict that up to 10 percent of the nation's refining capacity could be off line for several weeks.
 Some facilities, like Valero's Port Arthur, Tex., refinery and ConocoPhillips's Alliance refinery in Belle Chasse, La., have suffered some flooding.
 Mr. Johnson of Carrizo said the price picture for gasoline over the next month was uncertain. ''Demand is going to be down, but so is supply,'' he added.
 Christopher Ruppel, an energy analyst at Execution, a brokerage and research firm, warned that the gasoline price increase in many regions had so far come mostly in response to Hurricane Gustav two weeks ago, and the shock from Ike might still come in the weeks ahead.
 He noted that it took about 18 days for oil products to travel from the gulf coast to New Jersey by pipeline, so shortages around the gulf could take time to be reflected in price increases in the Northeast. ''It will be another week or so before you get the full impact of Hurricane Ike,'' he predicted.
 The average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline is now about 10 cents more than a month ago, and more than a dollar above a year ago. 
 Oil company executives and other energy experts said it could take several more days to assess all damages from the latest hurricane. They note that inspectors still need to go below the rigs and check pipelines for possible damages.

HEADLINE: Keep It in Vegas

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Watching some financial stocks just get wiped out in recent months, I often hear a voice in the back of my head, and it is the same voice as one of those dealers in Las Vegas who coolly tells you as he sweeps up your chips after you've busted in blackjack: ''Thank you for playing, ladies and gentlemen.''
 That's what happens when bubbles burst. You feel wiped out, and the coolness with which the dealers -- in this case the markets -- sweep away all your chips is unnerving. It's easy to over-react, and it is important that we don't. Now is the time for coolly sorting out what markets can do best and what governments need to do better. 
 Let's understand what happened here. Wall Street -- the financial industry -- became a bubble in recent years thanks to an excess of liquidity and the oldest bubble maker in history: greed. Some of the smartest people forgot one of the oldest rules of investing: There is no such thing as a risk-free return. When you reach too far for yield, sooner or later you get burned.
 In the '90s, the no-lose, risk-free, high-yield return was supposed to be dot-com stocks. This decade's version are subprime mortgages and financial stocks. Just like the dot-comers in the 1990s, the financial stocks got inflated to ridiculous levels and salaries for Wall Street executives reached ridiculous heights. You are now watching live and in color that bubble burst: ''Thank you for playing, Lehman Brothers.'' That's really sad for a 158-year-old company. 
 The market is now consolidating this industry, with the strong eating the weak, which will impose its own fiscal discipline. Good. Maybe then more of our next generation of math geniuses will think about going into engineering the next great global industry -- energy technology -- rather engineering derivatives.
 But we also need to understand the uniqueness of this bubble in order to identify where smart government needs to step in. One reason this financial bubble got so big is now well known: you and your neighbor went out and got subprime mortgages, which enabled many more people to become homeowners -- a real blessing. Your local finance company or bank, which extended those mortgages, later resold them to an aggregator who put them into big packages with thousands of other subprime mortgages. Then those loan packages were chopped up and sold in small pieces as corporate bonds to all kinds of institutions, who were reaching for extra yield. Your subprime mortgage payments went to pay the interest on those bonds.
 But as the housing market collapsed, and people couldn't cover their mortgages or sell their houses, the bonds lost value and, therefore, the banks that held them lost capital, and the whole pyramid started to crumble. This infected the entire housing market, so banks no longer knew the value of their mortgage-backed assets. The result? They stopped lending. Hence, the current credit crunch. This credit crunch is what makes this crisis so lethal. We can't tolerate a prolonged situation where banks won't lend to good companies.
 That's why Congress needs to create another Resolution Trust Corporation like we used to get out of the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s. As then, so now, we need a government agency to buy the toxic mortgages off the banks' balance sheets, hold them and sell them in an orderly way later. That would prevent a fire sale of homes and mortgages now and restore confidence to banks so they start lending again. 
 In the long run, though, regulators need to find ways to limit the amount of leverage investment banks or insurance companies can take on at any one time, because given how intertwined they all are in today's global economy, one bank blowing up can now take down many.
 ''We are at the end of an era -- the end of 'leave it to the markets' and of the great cop-out that less government is always better government,'' argues David Rothkopf, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration and author of a book about the world's financial leaders who brought about this crisis: ''Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making.'' ''I think, however, it is important to stress the difference between smart government and simply more government.
 ''We do not need a regulatory 'surge' on Wall Street,'' he added. ''We need a complete rethinking of how we make global financial markets more transparent and how we ensure that the risks within those markets -- .many of which are new and many of which are not well understood even by the experts -- are managed and monitored properly.'' 
 In sum, government's job is to police that fine line between the necessary risk-taking that drives an innovation economy and crazy gambling with other people's savings in ways that threaten us all. We need to make sure that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas -- and doesn't come to Main Street. We need to get back to investing in our future and not just betting on it.

HEADLINE: A Failure Tax

Jonathan G S Koppell is the director of the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at Yale.

DATELINE: New Haven 

 BODY:
 AS venerable American financial institutions topple like dominoes, the concept of ''too big to fail'' is being sorely tested. Bear Stearns gets help. Lehman Brothers does not. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department are acting like insurance claims adjusters, selectively providing assistance when a company's failure seems too much for the financial markets to withstand. 
 Why not make investment banks and other companies pay premiums for this catastrophic risk insurance? The government already provides flood, bank and crop insurance. Unlike participants in those programs, however, the companies that qualify for ''too big to fail'' insurance do not pay for the privilege. 
 Designing this too-big-to-fail insurance would be tricky but feasible. The potential economic impact of financial companies' failure and the risk in their portfolios would have to be evaluated to determine which companies would be required to obtain this protection, and to calibrate premiums. 
 The goal should be to limit the contagion of failure rather than to prevent failure itself. Thus the payouts, which could still take the form of loan guarantees to parties willing to cover the failing institutions' obligations, should not go to shareholders, who would lose all or most of their equity, but to counterparties -- the banks, hedge funds and pension funds that are jeopardized by default. Still, these parties must share in the losses to reinforce the need for due diligence in securities transactions. 
 Critics might denounce institutional risk insurance as a tax. But so what? Forcing companies to pay for undesirable side effects is routine. The risk of a financial meltdown introduced by companies intertwined through Byzantine financial transactions imposes a burden on the government as real as pollution. The premiums could cover the costs of better regulation, a trade most stockholders would happily make today.
 What's truly radical is that government officials are empowered to determine when corporate failure is not tolerable. The question now is who should pay for the intervention.

HEADLINE: Yankees' Deal May Have Violated Law, Report Says

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
New York City and the Yankees may have violated federal tax regulations and state laws in using $943 million in tax-exempt bonds to build the baseball team's new stadium, according to a report issued on Tuesday by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky.
 Saying the taxpayers are footing the bill for the $1.3 billion Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and are getting little in return other than higher ticket prices and the loss of parkland, Mr. Brodsky, a frequent critic of the deal, said that the report stems from a review of thousands of pages of previously unreleased documents. 
 Although city officials and the Yankees hotly disputed many of the findings, the report concluded that the city and the state invested as much as $850 million in cash and tax breaks in the new stadium, which sits across 161st Street from the team's historic home in the South Bronx.
 ''This stadium is being built by the people of the city and the state of New York,'' Mr. Brodsky said during a press conference at the north end of the new stadium, at 164th Street and Jerome Avenue. ''In return, they're getting almost nothing. This deal does not serve the public's interest. It serves the Yankees' interest.''
 Mr. Brodsky and other critics have argued that the city violated federal tax regulations by manipulating the assessed value of the land beneath the stadium so that the team's annual payment in lieu of taxes would effectively equal the annual payments to bondholders, or debt service, of $56.7 million beginning in 2010.
 Mr. Brodsky's 34-page report previews testimony he plans to give on Thursday at a Congressional subcommittee hearing sponsored by Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio that is looking into public financing for sports complexes. The Yankees plan to testify next month, while the Bloomberg administration is negotiating a date.
 The release of the report ignited a rancorous exchange with the city and the team. In a spirited defense of the city's position, Seth W. Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation, suggested that at this point Mr. Brodsky may be ''willfully choosing to ignore'' the documents and information the city provided during the last year.
 ''This is a project that is in fact privately financed,'' Mr. Pinsky said. ''It's creating thousands of union jobs, spurring city and state investments in the area and relieving the city of the ongoing cost of maintaining an aging stadium. It's a project that went through numerous hearings, almost 20 public hearings, and was approved at every level, including by the assemblyman himself.''
 Despite the report's heavy use of footnotes referring to project documents, the Yankees also took Mr. Brodsky to task for using ''inaccurate facts'' for personal aggrandizement. Alice McGillion, a spokeswoman for the Yankees, said in a statement released on Tuesday that stadium construction had had an enormous impact on the Bronx, both in terms of hiring construction workers who live in the Bronx and by providing 30,000 tickets a year to neighborhood organizations.
 Although stadiums generally have mostly low wage, seasonal jobs, Yankees executives said that they will employ an additional 1,000 people, not the 15 listed in project documents. A large Yankees team store and restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafe will be open year round, they said.
 The Yankees are aiming to complete the stadium by February 2009, in time for the new season. Next month, workers will lay down sod on the infield and the outfield, which has been designed using the same dimensions as the current stadium.
 The Yankees and the Bloomberg administration have always insisted that the team is paying for the new stadium, unlike almost every other professional sports team. The use, however, of tax-exempt bonds, will provide the team with savings of about $181 million over the life of the bonds, according to the Independent Budget Office.
 Mr. Brodsky contends that because the Yankees will pay the city an annual sum in lieu of taxes, that money, in turn, is being diverted from city coffers to pay the debt service on the bonds.
 There is no question that taxpayers are making a sizable investment in the new Yankee Stadium, as well as a new stadium for the Mets in Queens. The city and the state agreed to provide the Yankees with more than $300 million in cash subsidies for garages, a Metro-North train station, replacement parks and road work. But the teams do not pay rent for playing on city land, nor do they pay property taxes.
 The Bloomberg administration successfully lobbied the Internal Revenue Service to approve the use of the tax-exempt bonds for the stadium, which did not initially qualify. But the I.R.S. later issued a proposal that would tighten the rules governing such bonds so it would be nearly impossible for this kind of financing to be used again by a profitable sports franchise.
 The Yankees are awaiting a ruling on whether they can issue a second bond offering of about $250 million.
 ''We do things for professional sports we wouldn't do for any other business,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''When it comes to professional sports, we become socialists; for everyone else, we're capitalists.''

HEADLINE: Risky Real Estate Deals Helped Doom Lehman

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Significant losses that Lehman Brothers suffered from its part of the acquisition of Archstone-Smith, a national apartment portfolio, helped to bring down the investment bank, one of the most venerable firms on Wall Street.
 But the deal, undertaken with Tishman Speyer, was not the only high-risk commercial deal that Lehman sealed weeks, and even months, after ratings agencies warned the real estate industry that underwriting standards had become too lax and rental growth projections too robust. 
 In July 2007, just as the credit squeeze began, Lehman teamed up with Prologis, a publicly traded logistics company, to buy a national portfolio of warehouses for $1.85 billion from Dermody Properties and the California State Teachers Retirement System. To get the deal done quickly, Lehman not only supplied the debt financing but also provided 80 percent of the equity. 
 But then Lehman found itself unable to pool the warehouse mortgages with other loans and sell them to investors, said Cedrik Lachance, an analyst for Green Street Advisors, a research company based in Newport Beach, Calif. Nor was it able to find buyers for its equity position.
 At the same time, the warehouse industry, whose fortunes depend on a healthy retail industry, began suffering the effects of the economic downturn, ''Property values started declining shortly after the deal closed,'' said Mr. Lachance, who estimated that the portfolio had lost 15 percent of its worth.
 In addition to the industrial portfolio, Lehman was also involved in large office deals in Arlington, Va., in May 2007, and Austin, Tex., in June 2007. By this time, there was already considerable anxiety in the market, prompted by the spate of high-priced deals that occurred after the Blackstone Group, the private equity company, bought the nation's largest office portfolio, Equity Office Properties, for $39 billion and then began immediately to dismantle it.
 That April, Moody's Investors Service said it would adjust its ratings to reflect a growing concern that lending practices had become too risky. 
 ''Lehman always had a reputation for being one of the most aggressive lenders in the commercial space,'' said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm. 
 One real estate investment broker described Lehman as ''the real estate A.T.M.'' 
 ''They definitely were the mavericks out there,'' said the broker, who did not want to be identified to protect his business relationships. ''If you needed money, you could get it.''
 Though Lehman reduced its commercial real estate exposure in the third quarter to $32.6 billion, from $39.8 billion, this broker said it was slower than other banks to sell its real estate positions at a discount. Last week, before its announcement that it would file for bankruptcy protection, Lehman said it planned to spin off its real estate assets into a separate company rather than sell them in a depressed market. 
 Lehman has said that 57 percent of its commercial real estate assets are in the United States, with 26 percent in Europe and 17 percent in Asia. Of its real estate positions, debt represents 58 percent and equity, 26 percent. Another 16 percent is in securities. The investment bank did not respond to a request for comment.
 Though Lehman may have been quick to finance deals, it did better as a loan originator than some of its competitors, said Frank Innaurato, a managing director of Realpoint, a credit rating agency in Horsham, Pa., that monitors commercial mortgage-backed securities. These are created when mortgages are packaged together and sold to investors as bonds. 
 Of the 2,845 loans that Lehman originated for this bond market, only 0.5 percent are currently listed as delinquent, in line with the average for all the loans backing these securities. Loans originated by Bank of America, for example, have a delinquency rate of 0.7 percent, Mr. Innaurato said. And none of Lehman's defaulted loans poses a major credit risk, he said. 
 But Lehman itself continues to hold debt and equity positions that have dropped significantly in value, including several investments that were made after the market peaked. 
 In October 2007, Lehman joined Tishman Speyer in buying Archstone-Smith, a publicly traded company with about 360 upscale apartment buildings across the country. Lehman put in $250 million in equity and led a group of lenders that contributed $4.6 billion in bridge equity for the $22.2 billion deal, which was financed in part by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 Both Lehman and Tishman Speyer have written down their investment in Archstone by 25 percent. The partners sold a majority interest in 16 apartment buildings when the deal was completed. Since then, they have sold 13 additional Archstone properties, according to Jessica Ruderman, a senior marketing analyst at Real Capital Analytics. 
 In June 2007, Lehman teamed up with Thomas Partners, a real estate investment trust based in Los Angeles, and the California State Teachers Retirement System in a $1.15 billion deal to buy 10 office buildings, including the new Frost Bank Tower, in Austin, Tex., that Blackstone was flipping from its Equity Office Properties acquisition. By last July, Lehman still had a $1 billion equity and debt investment in the deal, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, a trade publication.
 Lehman and its partners paid an average price of $328 a square foot for the Austin deal. In the last year, however, buyers of office buildings in Austin paid an average of just $221 a square foot, said Mr. White of Real Capital Analytics. 
 But an Austin broker, Jeff Coddington, a senior vice president of Oxford Commercial, an affiliate of Cushman & Wakefield, said the bulk of the portfolio bought by the Lehman consortium consisted of prime downtown office buildings. ''Obviously, you pay a premium for this real estate,'' he said.
 In another deal that occurred at the peak of the market, Lehman and its partner, Monday Properties, bought 10 office buildings in the Rosslyn section of Arlington, Va., for $1.3 billion. Lehman managed to sell its debt financing, but it continues to own 75 percent of the equity.
 Prices in Arlington have declined by about 12 percent, Ms. Ruderman said. ''Compared to the rest of the market, that's not so bad,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Arctic Ocean Ice Retreats Less Than Last Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The annual summer retreat of the sea ice cloaking the Arctic Ocean appears to have ended with the ice not quite matching last year's extraordinary recession, polar scientists said Tuesday. 
 Still, the scientists, at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., said that the ice in the Arctic this summer was 33 percent below the average extent tracked since satellites started monitoring the region in 1979 and that the trend continued toward an ice-free Arctic Ocean within a few decades.
 This summer also was notable because scientists confirmed that two fabled shipping routes, the Northwest Passage over Canada and the Northern Sea Route over Russia, were briefly open simultaneously.
 The ice, which is now expanding as the sun dips toward the horizon for the winter, hit a minimum extent of about 1.74 million square miles on Sept. 12, said Walter Meier, a research scientist at the center. In 2007, the minimum extent was 1.59 million square miles, he said.
 Federal biologists have said that this long-term ice retreat is the main reason they had concluded that polar bears, which hunt seals from the ice, deserved protection under the Endangered Species Act. The Bush administration listed the species in May as threatened with extinction.
 Global warming from the buildup of human-generated greenhouse gases almost certainly contributes to the Arctic ice retreats, according to a host of Arctic specialists. But many say natural variations in Arctic winds and cloud cover probably had a role in shaping the particularly large ice losses in the past two summers. 
 Dr. Meier said that small variations from one year to the next were less significant than the long-term trajectory, which remained toward progressively more open water. ''It's hard to see the summer ice coming back in any substantial way,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Hard Times for Drivers of the Wall St. Powerful

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; C.J. Hughes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Emmy Perez was hit doubly hard when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. 
 Ms. Perez is a dispatch supervisor at a black-car company that, until this week, did a large portion of its business with the investment bank. She also moonlighted for Lehman during the holiday season, when she worked at a succession of glittering corporate parties, steering bank employees and clients to their waiting cars. The second job has meant $2,000 or more in additional income for Ms. Perez.
As the aftershocks of the Lehman collapse ripple through the city's economy, many businesses are likely to feel the impact, from restaurants and bars to fancy clothiers. Few industries rely as heavily on Wall Street clients as the black-car companies, which chauffeur the financial titans, stockbrokers, bankers and their accountants and lawyers. 
 ''We're trying to cope with the situation and hopefully we'll be able to bounce back, but any account that you lose at this time in this industry, it hurts,'' Ms. Perez said on Tuesday during a job break at All City Corporate Transportation, in the Bronx. She estimated that drivers for her company gave hundreds of rides a week to Lehman employees and that All City was just one of several firms that served the bank.
 ''A lot of people think, 'This doesn't affect me, I don't play the stock market,' '' Ms. Perez said, ''but it does affect us. It affects me personally. It affects the little guy.''
 Estimates vary, but officials in the industry said there were about 12,000 to 15,000 black-car drivers working for more than 70 companies, known as bases. 
 Most drivers said they worked 12-hour shifts, often 6 days a week. Even before Lehman crumbled, they said they had begun feeling pain from Wall Street's turmoil this year. 
 George Milczynski, 54, a driver for Admire Limo, said that a year ago he usually made 25 trips a week but now just 15. On Tuesday, he had parked his black Mercedes S430 outside Lehman's headquarters on Seventh Avenue at 49th Street, just north of Times Square, waiting for an employee of Barclays, who was inside, apparently talking about the possible acquisition of some of Lehman's assets. 
 ''Everything is very tough right now,'' said Mr. Milczynski, who lives in New Jersey. ''We are in this together with the banks.''
 In most cases, drivers buy their own car, often a used Lincoln Town Car, and associate themselves with a base. The base, in turn, contracts with companies, like banks and law firms, to provide cars for the use of their employees. Those employees typically give drivers a voucher that allows the base to bill the company for the trip. 
 Robert John, 35, of Cambria Heights, Queens, has been driving for All City for two years. He, too, was parked in front of Lehman waiting for a Barclays employee. 
 Mr. John said that he usually made 6 trips during a 12-hour shift, with an average fare of $60. In a six-day week, that makes 36 trips for a gross of $2,160. After deducting All City's 20 percent commission ($432 a week), as well as payments for his radio dispatch unit, car loan, insurance, gas and other expenses, his take-home pay is $840 a week. 
 ''It's not an easy living,'' Mr. John said. ''And one less client in the industry is bad news for us.''
 Many drivers make even less. 
 Researchers for the New York City Investment Fund estimated that, after expenses, the average driver took home $20,000 to $25,000 a year, or about $385 to $480 a week, said Maria Gotsch, the president and chief executive. of the fund. The fund, an arm of the Partnership for New York City, is working to create a program to help black-car drivers buy fuel-efficient vehicles. 
 Ms. Gotsch said that in August the fund surveyed a pair of large bases and a financial sector firm that is a large user of black cars and found that for the month the number of trips was down 15 to 20 percent from the same month the previous year. 
 Despite the drop in business, many drivers stick with it because they have invested so much in their cars and fees. Many bases are cooperatives, and drivers pay large amounts for an ownership share. 
 With fewer rides to go around, Ms. Gotsch said, each driver takes fewer trips, and everyone makes less money. 
 ''Rich you don't get in this industry,'' said Victor Dizengoff, the executive director of the Black Car Association, a trade group. ''But I look at it as the glass half-full, and say this is all going to come back.'' 
 Still, Ms. Perez, the dispatch supervisor, said many people in the industry were worried about what comes next, much like the employees at the Wall Street firms they serve. 
 ''We think there might be a little domino effect going on,'' she said. ''Everybody's like Chicken Little right now, watching for the sky to fall. Being that it's our livelihood, it's a little bit grim right now.''

HEADLINE: FED IN AN $85 BILLION RESCUE OF AN INSURER NEAR FAILURE

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington. Michael J. de la Merced and Mary Williams Walsh reported from New York. David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington and Eric Dash from New York..

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This article was reported by Edmund L. Andrews, Michael J. de la Merced and Mary Williams Walsh and written by Mr. Andrews.
 Fearing a financial crisis worldwide, the Federal Reserve reversed course on Tuesday and agreed to an $85 billion bailout that would give the government control of the troubled insurance giant American International Group.
 The decision, only two weeks after the Treasury took over the federally chartered mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is the most radical intervention in private business in the central bank's history. 
 With time running out after A.I.G. failed to get a bank loan to avoid bankruptcy, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, convened a meeting with House and Senate leaders on Capitol Hill about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to explain the rescue plan. They emerged just after 7:30 p.m. with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke looking grim, but with top lawmakers initially expressing support for the plan. But the bailout is likely to prove controversial, because it effectively puts taxpayer money at risk while protecting bad investments made by A.I.G. and other institutions it does business with. 
 What frightened Fed and Treasury officials was not simply the prospect of another giant corporate bankruptcy, but A.I.G.'s role as an enormous provider of esoteric financial insurance contracts to investors who bought complex debt securities. They effectively required A.I.G. to cover losses suffered by the buyers in the event the securities defaulted. It meant A.I.G. was potentially on the hook for billions of dollars' worth of risky securities that were once considered safe. 
 If A.I.G. had collapsed -- and been unable to pay all of its insurance claims -- institutional investors around the world would have been instantly forced to reappraise the value of those securities, and that in turn would have reduced their own capital and the value of their own debt. Small investors, including anyone who owned money market funds with A.I.G. securities, could have been hurt, too. And some insurance policy holders were worried, even though they have some protections.
 ''It would have been a chain reaction,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics at Princeton University. ''The spillover effects could have been incredible.''
 Financial markets, which on Monday had plunged over worries about A.I.G.'s possible collapse and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, reacted with relief to the news of the bailout. In anticipation of a deal, stocks rose about 1 percent in the United States on Tuesday. Asian stock markets opened with strong gains on Wednesday morning, but the rally lost steam as worries returned about the extent of harm to the global financial system.
 Still, the move will likely start an intense political debate during the presidential election campaign over who is to blame for the financial crisis that prompted the rescue.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke had not requested any new legislative authority for the bailout at Tuesday night's meeting. ''The secretary and the chairman of the Fed, two Bush appointees, came down here and said, 'We're from the government, we're here to help them,' '' Mr. Frank said. ''I mean this is one more affirmation that the lack of regulation has caused serious problems. That the private market screwed itself up and they need the government to come help them unscrew it.''
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly criticized the rescue, calling the $85 billion a ''staggering sum.'' Ms. Pelosi said the bailout was ''just too enormous for the American people to guarantee.'' Her comments suggested that the Bush administration and the Fed would face sharp questioning in Congressional hearings. President Bush was briefed earlier in the afternoon.
 A major concern is that the A.I.G. rescue won't be the last. At Tuesday night's meeting. lawmakers asked if there was any way of knowing if this would be the final major government intervention. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson said there was not. Indeed, the markets remain worried about the financial condition of major regional banks as well as that of Washington Mutual, the nation's largest thrift. 
 The decision was a remarkable turnaround by the Bush administration and Mr. Paulson, who had flatly refused over the weekend to risk taxpayer money to prevent the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. Earlier this year, the government bailed out another investment bank, Bear Stearns, by engineering a sale to JPMorgan Chase that left taxpayers on the hook for up to $29 billion of bad investments by Bear Stearns. The government hoped at the time that this unusual step would both calm markets and lead to a recovery by the financial system. But critics warned at the time that it would only encourage others to seek bailouts, and the eventual costs to the government would be staggering.
 The decision to rescue A.I.G. came on the same day that the Fed decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent, turning aside hopes by many on Wall Street that the Fed would try to shore up confidence by cutting rates once again.
 Fed and Treasury officials initially turned a cold shoulder to A.I.G. when company executives pleaded on Sunday night for the Fed to provide a $40 billion bridge loan to stave off a crippling downgrade of its credit ratings as a result of investment losses that totalled tens of billions of dollars. 
 But government officials reluctantly backed away from their tough-minded approach after a failed attempt to line up private financing with help from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which told federal officials they simply could not raise the money given both the general turmoil in credit markets and the specific fears of problems with A.I.G. The complexity of A.I.G.'s business, and the fact that it does business with thousands of companies around the globe, make its survival crucial at a time when there is stress throughout the financial system worldwide. 
 ''It's the interconnectedness and the fear of the unknown,'' said Roger Altman, a former Treasury official under President Bill Clinton. ''The prospect of the world's largest insurer failing, together with the interconnectedness and the uncertainty about the collateral damage -- that's why it's scaring people so much.''
 Under the plan, the Fed will make a two-year loan to A.I.G. of up to $85 billion and, in return, will receive warrants that can be converted into common stock giving the government nearly 80 percent ownership of the insurer, if the existing shareholders approve. All of the company's assets are being pledged to secure the loan. Existing stockholders have already seen the value of their stock drop more than 90 percent in the last year. Now they will suffer even more, although they will not be totally wiped out. The Fed was advised by Morgan Stanley, and A.I.G. by the Blackstone Group.
 Fed staffers said that they expected A.I.G. would repay the loan before it comes due in two years, either through the sales of assets or through operations.
 Asked why Lehman was allowed to fail, but A.I.G. was not, a Fed staffer said the markets were more prepared for the failure of an investment bank. Robert B. Willumstad, who became A.I.G.'s chief executive in June, will be succeeded by Edward M. Liddy, the former chairman of the Allstate Corporation. Under the terms of his employment contract with A.I.G., Mr. Willumstad could receive an exit package worth as much as $8.7 million if his removal is determined to be ''without cause,'' according to an analysis by James F. Reda and Associates. 
 A.I.G. is a sprawling empire built by Maurice R. Greenberg, who acquired hundreds of businesses all over the world until he was ousted amid an accounting scandal in 2005. Many of A.I.G.'s subsidiaries wrote insurance of various types. Others made home loans and leased aircraft. The diverse array of companies were more valuable under a single corporate parent like A.I.G., because their business cycles offset each other, giving A.I.G. a relatively smooth stream of revenue and income. 
 After Mr. Greenberg's departure, A.I.G. restated its books over a five-year period and instituted conservative new accounting policies. But before the company could really rebuild itself, it became embroiled in the mortgage crisis. Some of its insurance companies ended up with mortgage-backed securities on their books, but the real trouble involved the insurance that its financial products unit offered investors for complex debt securities. 
 Its stock tumbled faster this year as first the debt securities lost value, and then the insurance contracts, called credit default swaps, came under a cloud. 
 The Fed's extraordinary rescue of A.I.G. underscores how much fear remains about the destructive potential of the complex financial instruments, like credit default swaps, that brought A.I.G. to its knees. The market for such instruments has exploded in recent years, but it is almost entirely unregulated. When A.I.G. began to teeter in the last few days, it became clear that if it defaulted on its commitments under the swaps, it could set off a devastating chain reaction through the financial system.
 ''We are witnessing a rather unique event in the history of the United States,'' said Suresh Sundaresan, the Chase Manhattan Bank professor of economics and finance at Columbia University. He thought the near brush with catastrophe would bring about an acceleration of efforts within the Treasury and the Fed to put safety controls on the use of credit default swaps.
 ''They're going to tighten the screws and say, 'We want some safeguards on this market,' '' he said of the Fed and the Treasury. 
 The swaps are not securities and are not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And while they perform the same function as an insurance policy, they are not insurance in the conventional sense, so insurance regulators do not monitor them either.
 That situation set the stage for deep losses for all the countless investors and other entities that had entered into A.I.G.'s swap contracts. Of the $441 billion in credit default swaps that A.I.G. listed at midyear, more than three-quarters were held by European banks.
 ''Suddenly banks would be holding a lot of bondlike instruments that were no longer insured,'' Mr. Sundaresan said. ''They would have to mark them down. And when they marked them down, they would require more capital. And then they would have to go out and raise capital in these markets, which is very difficult.''
 Mr. Sundaresan said that for a new market arrangement to succeed, it would have to create a clearinghouse to track swaps trading, and daily requirements to post collateral, so that a huge counterparty would not suddenly find itself having to come up with billions of dollars overnight, the way A.I.G. did.

A22) CHART: A.I.G.'s Troubles and Why They Matter: American International Group is a giant insurance company that provided $440 billion of insurance to investors who bought securities backed by mortgages.
Banks wrote mortgages and sold them to investment banks. The investment banks packaged the mortgages into securities and sold them to investors.
To protect investors against defaults, A.I.G. sold insurance on those securities. A.I.G. put up collateral to guarantee it could repay investors, if needed.
The contracts said that if A.I.G.'s credit ratings were cut, it would have to provide additional collateral.
Credit rating agencies, concerned about the declining value of A.I.G.'s own investment portfolio, cut the company's credit ratings on Monday, forcing the company to put up more collateral.
 If A.I.G. had failed to put up collateral, investors' holdings would have been at risk, perhaps leading to losses around the world. Chart details example.

HEADLINE: A Las Vegas Show With a Short Season but a Big House

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
A $3 billion development that is fully used only two weeks a year is proving to be a lucrative gamble in Las Vegas, its developers say. In only three years, the World Market Center Las Vegas has already become the leading showcase of the home furnishings industry in the western part of the nation, and it is still less than half built.
 Planned as one of the world's largest commercial complexes, it is ultimately envisioned as a collection of eight buildings totaling 12 million square feet on 57 acres in this city's downtown. 
 The center currently consists of three buildings of five million square feet, the third having opened in July. When fully built, the development will be almost as large as the World Trade Center in Manhattan was before Sept. 11, 2001 (it had seven buildings totaling 13.4 million square feet). 
 Financing has already been obtained for a fourth World Market Center building, though developers have not yet broken ground on the 1.8 million-square-foot structure, and won't do so, they say, until they have leased most of the building. 
 The center, which rises out of the Nevada desert like a huge cruise ship on a calm ocean, has space devoted solely to home furnishings and some ancillary industries. Much like a city's football stadium, it remains largely dark for the greater part of the year, with only two five-day furniture shows, each attracting more than 50,000 buyers. 
 But the formerly unproved real estate business model has thus far been a success, the center's owners said.
 ''We really believe in the consolidation of this industry to Las Vegas, and if you speak to people in the industry today, it's clear that will be the ultimate outcome here,'' said Jeffrey T. Blau, president of the Related Companies, one of the nation's largest mixed-use property developers, which joined the project after the first building opened in July 2005.
 Mr. Blau said the concept of a piece of commercial real estate sitting largely idle most of the time might seem counterintuitive, but it makes sense for furniture makers, who keep their furniture in the center's showrooms all year, even though they do almost all of their business in July and February.
 ''Because their product is so heavy and bulky, it makes it more economically attractive to pay rent year-round than to ship their goods in and out,'' Mr. Blau said.
 The center's developers would not reveal the annual rents charged for the five-year leases offered because the range is so broad, but said they were comparable to midlevel Las Vegas retail rents, which for showrooms run about $200 a square foot.
 The center was originally envisioned by Shawn Samson, who at one time led the real estate development company that built the two largest malls in the world, and Jack Kashani, who has 20 years of experience in commercial and residential real estate development in the United States. The two men sought out an experienced real estate partner -- the Related Companies -- as they prepared to develop the second building, a huge and largely windowless structure without precedent in Las Vegas. 
 ''When we began studying the furniture industry nine years ago, we came to the conclusion that there was an opportunity to create a state-of-the-art, 21st-century facility in Las Vegas for the trade,'' Mr. Samson said. ''The idea was to create an entirely new platform for the furniture manufacturers, who have essentially given up manufacturing to Asia, and have become branding, sales, distribution and marketing companies.''
 Because manufacturing has been moving offshore -- foreign companies have more than doubled their United States market share in the last decade --Mr. Blau said that the country's historically largest furniture market, held twice a year in 180 buildings scattered around High Point, N.C., which is served by only about 1,000 hotel rooms, seemed vulnerable.
 ''Marts existed in High Point because that's where all the manufacturing was,'' he said. ''The industry, the shows, built up around the manufacturers.''
 Mr. Samson and Mr. Kashani ''believed there was a much better way to showcase the annual shows for the industry,'' Mr. Blau said. ''They studied locations in terms of air lift, and where people like to go, and Las Vegas was a natural. And they were able to tie up a large parcel downtown.''
 Because of the lack of alternative show space for furniture manufacturers, the long leases and the nature of the industry, the Las Vegas developers said they were protected from economic down cycles.
 ''Manufacturers need to sell and display their goods whether the economy is good or bad,'' Mr. Samson said. ''When it comes to marts dedicated to the home furnishings industry, there are only a few of them throughout the United States.'' 
 The Las Vegas center has already attracted a large number of West Coast manufacturers and retail buyers, and aims to differentiate itself by reaching out to their foreign counterparts who want to visit Las Vegas, said Robert Maricich, the center's president and chief executive. He said its success has in effect shut down what was once the largest West Coast furniture market, in San Francisco. 
 ''San Francisco had a furniture market that effectively has closed,'' Mr. Maricich said. ''Dallas had a furniture market that has been very much marginalized because of us.''
 The latest biannual furnishings market, held in July at the center, had 1,200 showrooms, including 320 new ones, Mr. Maricich said. About 120 companies had expanded the size of their showrooms since the previous market in January. Showrooms average 5,000 to 7,500 square feet, but about 15 are more than 20,000 square feet, and one is 100,000 square feet, he said. The center is currently 85 percent occupied.
 Furniture retailers, designers and others in the $86.5 billion furnishings industry can attend the market free, but must receive credentials to enter.
 The World Market Center also has a Design Center, which covers about 700,000 square feet, and is open daily all year selling furnishings and accessories exclusively to interior designers.
 Referring to two prominent New York City buildings with tenants consisting of wholesalers of home furnishings and fabrics, Mr. Maricich said, ''If you think about the D & D Building in New York or 200 Lexington, that's the same business model.'' , 
 Mr. Maricich said the World Market Center would evolve into a ''furnishings campus,'' which might include industries related to home furnishings like rugs and floor coverings, lighting or gifts and ''home accents.'' These ancillary industries may have temporary shows or set up permanent showrooms.
 ''In February, we're launching a gift show, and we've started launching permanent gift space,'' he said. ''Those 50,000 people coming to the furniture shows are most likely interested in the gift category as well.'' 
 Anthony Manrique, the brand manager for Kathy Ireland Home by Omnia Furniture, based in Chino, Calif., which has 6,500 square feet in the Design Center, said it might cost twice as much to set up a showroom in Las Vegas as it did in High Point, but wholesalers saw three times more foot traffic.
 ''People may start to realize they can't afford to show in both places,'' he said. ''In my view, everybody's going to say, 'Let's make our vacation around Vegas, and that's where we'll do our purchasing.' ''

HEADLINE: Mr. McCain and the Economy

 BODY:
John McCain spent Monday claiming as he had countless times before -- that the economy was fundamentally sound. Had he missed the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the sale of Merrill Lynch, which were announced the day before? Did he not notice the agonies of the American Insurance Group? Was he unaware of the impending layoffs of tens of thousands of Wall Street employees on top of the growing numbers of unemployed workers throughout the United States? 
 On Tuesday, he clarified his remarks. The clarification was far more worrisome than his initial comments. 
 He said that by calling the economy fundamentally sound, what he really meant was that American workers are the best in the world. In the best Karl Rovian fashion, he implied that if you dispute his statement about the economy's firm foundation, you are, in effect, insulting American workers. ''I believe in American workers, and someone who disagrees with that -- it's fine,'' he told NBC's Matt Lauer.
 Let's get a few things straight. First, no one who is currently running for president does not ''believe in American workers.''
 More to the point, the economy is stressed to the breaking point by fundamental problems -- in housing, finance, credit, employment, health care and the federal budget -- that have been at best neglected, at worst exacerbated during the Bush years. And as a result, American workers have taken a beating. 
 In clarifying his comments, Mr. McCain lavished praise on workers, but ignored their problems. That is the real insult.
 For decades, typical Americans have not been rewarded for their increasing productivity with comparably higher pay or better benefits. The disconnect between work and reward has been especially acute during the Bush years, as workers' incomes fell while corporate profits, which flow to investors and company executives, ballooned. For workers, that is a fundamental flaw in today's economy. It is grounded in policies like a chronically inadequate minimum wage and an increasingly unprogressive tax system, for which Mr. McCain offers no alternatives.
 As for Wall Street, Mr. McCain blamed the meltdown on ''unbridled corruption and greed.'' He called for a commission to find out what happened and propose solutions. His diagnosis and his cure are misguided. The crisis on Wall Street is fundamentally a failure to do the things that temper, detect and punish corruption and greed. It was a failure to police the markets, to enforce rules, to heed and sound warnings and expose questionable products and practices. 
 The regulatory failure is rooted in a markets-are-good-government-is-bad ideology that has been ascendant as long as Mr. McCain has been in Washington and championed by his own party. If Mr. McCain adheres to some other belief system, we would like to hear about it.

NATO TIGHTENS RULES
To Lower Afghan Casualties
Gen. David D. McKiernan, the top American military commander in Afghanistan, said he had tightened the rules on when NATO troops can use lethal force, in an effort to lower civilian casualties there. General McKiernan also said that the military mission in Afghanistan still needed thousands of troops. PAGE A8
FARMS TO FACTORIES IN INDIA
India is struggling with how to divert scarce fertile farmland to industry when more than half of its 1.1 billion people still live off the land. Barely a month before Tata, one of India's most powerful conglomerates, was due to roll out the world's cheapest car from a new factory on former potato and rice fields, above, a peasant uprising has forced the company to suspend work on the plant and consider pulling out altogether. PAGE A6 
RISING TENSIONS IN BOLIVIA
Army troops in a rebellious northern region of Bolivia arrested a governor accused of overseeing a massacre of peasants. The arrest raised tensions between the central government of President Evo Morales and authorities in the tropical lowlands and came amid growing concern in Washington about the safety of American citizens in Bolivia. The tensions also reflect a severe waning of American influence in Bolivia, which has blamed Washington for the crisis while it strengthens ties with its closest ally, Venezuela. PAGE A16
REVELERS KILLED IN MEXICO
Explosions from grenades tore through a crowded Independence Day celebration in the Mexican state of Michoacan, killing at least seven people and injuring more than 100. President Felipe Calderon gave a nationally televised address in the wake of the attacks, condemning those responsible as ''cowards hidden in the crowds of patriotic people.'' Suspicion immediately fell on the drug cartels that have been behind the unprecedented violence the country has faced in recent months. PAGE A6
IN JAPAN, CHANGE OR JUST KABUKI?
Japan's usual penchant for backroom politics has moved front and center, as the Liberal Democratic Party -- which has controlled the government for 50 years -- parades its five candidates, including the first woman to seek the job of prime minister, on street corners and live television, where they have called for change. But some analysts say that it's just an act designed by the party to give the eventual winner a populist gloss and high approval ratings, without giving the winner the clout to change the way Japan does business.

ALASKA LAWMAKERS FILE SUIT
To Halt Investigation of Palin
Five Republican state lawmakers in Alaska filed a lawsuit in the state's Superior Court asking to stop an inquiry into Gov. Sarah Palin's dismissal of her public safety commissioner. They say the Legislature has exceeded its authority by conducting a '' McCarthyistic investigation.'' The move comes as the McCain-Palin campaign has escalated its involvement in the bipartisan inquiry, providing Ms. Palin's local lawyer with outside legal help and mounting a public relations offensive. PAGE A20
$3 MILLION VOTE FOR 8-MONTH MAYOR
The financially troubled city of Detroit will have to spend about $3 million to hold a special election in the wake of Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick's resignation in the face of scandal. It also means that Detroiters will be asked to vote for mayor four times in 2009: a primary vote and general election in February and May to determine who will finish Mr. Kilpatrick's term in 2009, and others in August and November to determine who will serve a four-year term starting Jan. 1, 2010. PAGE A19
TRAIN ENGINEER DID NOT USE BRAKES
A federal investigator said that the engineer of a commuter train that slammed into a freight train in Los Angeles, killing 25 people, never applied the brakes even after he passed a red signal and closed in on certain disaster. The engineer on the freight train, a 17-car Union Pacific, did slam on his brakes, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said. The commuter train's engineer, Robert M. Sanchez, was killed in the crash. PAGE A19
GOVERNOR VOWS TO VETO BUDGET
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California said he would veto a long-overdue state budget, and he threatened also to veto hundreds of other pieces of legislation, as the state's 78-day budget crisis dragged on. The state's Legislature passed a $104 billion general fund budget by potentially veto-proof two-thirds majorities, after setting a record for tardiness. Page A18
IN TEXAS, BLACKOUTS AND UNEASE
In the wake of Hurricane Ike, Texas is grappling with the largest power failure in the state's history, and some officials worry that it could be weeks before some places, like Galveston and the towns near the Louisiana border, have their power restored. In Houston, there were signs of prolonged blackout everywhere -- in long lines at the few gasoline stations with power to run pumps, in the huge demand for ice at government food-distribution centers, in the low number of grocery stores that are open, and in the grumbling of ordinary residents.

COULD BANKING CRISIS OPEN DOOR
For Another Bloomberg Term?
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's financial expertise and visibility have many wondering if the turmoil on Wall Street could strengthen the argument for Mr. Bloomberg to overturn the term-limits law and serve four more years. Others say that for all his experience as a Wall Street trader, he might prove unable to do much practically to stop the hurt, and would be as vulnerable as any other politician to the fate that meets elected officials when people are broke.

DRIVERS FEEL WALL STREET'S TREMORS
Black-car drivers who did a big chunk of their business with firms like Lehman Brothers are already feeling the fallout from the shake-ups in the financial markets. ''A lot of people think, 'This doesn't affect me, I don't play the stock market,' '' one car service employee said. ''But it does affect us. It affects me personally. It affects the little guy.''

NEW VULNERABILITY SEEN
In Money Market Fund
Managers of the Primary Fund said that customers might lose money in the money market fund, a type of investment that has long been considered as safe and risk-free as a bank savings account. This is only the second time in history that a money market fund has ''broken the buck,'' or reported a share's value below a dollar. PAGE C1
WALL STREET HOLDS STEADY
When the Federal Reserve, bucking expectations, decided to keep interest rates steady at its meeting, making no mention of the dramatic shake-ups on Wall Street, more than a few stock-watchers held their breath and braced for the market to plummet. But after an initial drop, stocks rose, surging into positive territory and finishing near their highs for the day, in a reassuring end to a wild day on Wall Street. PAGE C8
LOANS SOUGHT TO MEET FUEL GOAL
Executives from General Motors and the Ford Motor Company pressed their case for $25 billion in federal loans in a series of high-level meetings with lawmakers in Washington. The appearances by G.M.'s chairman and Ford's executive chairman underscored how vital the industry considers the loans as it tries to meet tougher fuel-efficiency regulations. PAGE C3

HER HEART GOES ON, SPARKLY
Celine Dion does not do subtle. There are the bright, shiny outfits, the impassioned gesticulations and, of course, the very big voice. All those pieces were on colorful display Monday during her show at Madison Square Garden, if awkwardly employed, as Jon Caramanica writes. ''It felt like a technical exercise, a singer practicing her vocal workout in front of thousands of people,'' he wrote of one song. PAGE E1
AN OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR 'SNL'
Much has been made of Gov. Sarah Palin's resemblance to Tina Fey. And so it was something of a given that ''Saturday Night Live'' would tap Ms. Fey, its former head writer, to portray Ms. Palin in the skit that opened the show last week. It was the highest-rated episode of ''SNL'' since 2002. The bigger concern, cast members said, was being fair to Ms. Palin. PAGE E2
AN AUCTION HOUSE IN A STORM
Troubling economic news did not dampen the mood at Sotheby's, where works from the British artist Damien Hirst were snatched up at a dizzying clip, to the tune of $200.7 million. That was higher than the auction house's high estimate and broke the record for a single-artist auction. PAGE E1

INSTEAD OF EATING TO DIET,
They're Eating to Enjoy
When it comes to dieting, the numbers don't lie. Fat free, sugar free, low calorie: these types of prepared meals haven't contributed much to weight loss, nutrition experts say, but to a national epidemic of obesity. So after decades of obsessing about fat, calories and carbs, many dieters have made the unorthodox decision to simply enjoy food again, shunning deprivation diets and instead focusing on adding seasonal vegetables, nuts, berries and other healthful foods to their plates.

To Mentor of At-Risk Youth
After Roynell Young's nine-year N.F.L. career ended, he headed to Houston to open an after-school program in order to, as he put it, ''interrupt the pipeline that is causing young men to go from the cradle to prison.'' But his plan became much bigger. Later it was an all-male charter middle school. Then he created a job-training program. And early next month, his programs, known collectively as Pro-Vision, will move from a tiny schoolhouse to a 16-acre campus financed by private contributions. PAGE D1
HEY, NEW GUY: FIX IT
After an ill-timed four-game sweep by the Philadelphia Phillies, the Milwaukee Brewers fired their manager and named Dale Sveum, the team's third base coach, its new manager. Sveum has been charged with righting the listing ship of the Brewers, who are still in strong playoff contention at the start of a three-game set with the Cubs, but who are also in the middle of a late-season free fall like the one they had last year, when a bad September cost them a playoff berth.

HEADLINE: Perhaps, Time to Play Offense

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Late last week, as Lehman Brothers was collapsing, an all-star group of economists was meeting here to ponder the lessons of the financial crisis. The group included Donald Kohn, the vice chairman of the Fed, and Edward Lazear, the top White House economist, as well as Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, and a few dozen others. 
 The discussion revolved around a handful of academic research papers, but it really boiled down to this: How do we get out of this mess?
 At one point, Benjamin Friedman of Harvard raised his placard to inject a little sunshine into the room. If somebody had told the economists a year and a half ago what was about to befall Wall Street and then asked them to predict the economic impact, Mr. Friedman said, they almost certainly would have forecast a steeper downturn, with many more layoffs, than has occurred. 
 The fact that it hasn't, so far, should be considered a victory for Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson, the point men on the crisis. After some early missteps, they have acted aggressively to keep the financial system functioning -- including Tuesday's stunning takeover of A.I.G. -- while still forcing Wall Street to suffer for its sins. The problem, unfortunately, is that neither man has done much to deal with the problems that caused the crisis in the first place.
 For the past two and a half months, I've been on a break from column writing, and I'm struck by how much has changed during that time -- and yet how little the big picture has changed. Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have all essentially collapsed. But just as at the start of the summer, economists can't even agree whether the country is in a recession.
 The Bush administration, the Fed and Congress, meanwhile, continue to focus on the immediate crises, with little attention to the underlying reasons that the economy has gotten into this mess -- a stagnation of incomes, an explosion of debt and a decidedly outdated, and limp, approach to government oversight. Remarkably, the presidential campaign has gotten less serious, while the economy's problems have become more so.
 So, yes, Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson have done a nice job of playing defense. But when will someone start playing offense?
 A good way to see the problems with a fingers-in-the-dikes strategy is to look back to the first big bailout of modern times. Before A.I.G., before Fannie and Freddie, before Bear Stearns, there was Chrysler.
 In 1979, when it was still the 10th largest company in the country, Chrysler found itself on the verge of collapse, largely because high oil prices had made its gas guzzlers unappealing. Company executives and union leaders came to Washington, hat in hand, arguing that Chrysler's demise would wreak unacceptable damage on the American economy. Congress and the Carter administration responded by arranging for $1.2 billion in subsidized loans. The Reagan administration helped further in 1981 by restricting Japanese imports.
 On its face, the Chrysler rescue was a huge success. Under Lee Iacocca, the company came out with the K-car line of smaller vehicles, like the Dodge Aries, as well as the original minivan. By the mid-'80s, Chrysler had repaid the loans. Mr. Iacocca appeared on the cover of Time magazine as ''Detroit's comeback kid,'' and his autobiography became a No. 1 best seller.
 You can draw a clear line from the Chrysler bailout to the recent attempts to steady Wall Street. Back then, Washington insisted on a few pounds of flesh, like a wage freeze for Chrysler workers, in exchange for aid. Mr. Paulson has done something similar by insisting that shareholders of the Wall Street firms benefit little from any bailout. 
 In 1979, the government structured the Chrysler deal so that taxpayers might earn a profit from it (which they did). This year, the Fed effectively purchased securities from Bear Stearns that it hopes to sell for a gain when the financial markets calm down. While it's way too early to know if the strategy will succeed as well as it did three decades ago, it's certainly conceivable.
 But if you take a moment to think through the full Chrysler story, you start to realize that it's setting a really low bar. The Chrysler bailout may have saved the company, but it did nothing, after all, to stop Detroit's long, sad decline. 
 Barry Ritholtz -- who runs an equity research firm in New York and writes The Big Picture, one of the best-read economics blogs -- is going to publish a book soon making the case that the bailout actually helped cause the decline. The book is called, ''Bailout Nation.'' In it, Mr. Ritholtz sketches out an intriguing alternative history of Chrysler and Detroit.
 If Chrysler had collapsed, he argues, vulture investors might have swooped in and reconstituted the company as a smaller automaker less tied to the failed strategies of Detroit's Big Three and their unions. ''If Chrysler goes belly up,'' he says, ''it also might have forced some deep introspection at Ford and G.M. and might have changed their attitude toward fuel efficiency and manufacturing quality.'' Some of the bailout's opponents -- from free-market conservatives to Senator Gary Hart, then a rising Democrat -- were making similar arguments three decades ago. 
 Instead, the bailout and import quotas fooled the automakers into thinking they could keep doing business as usual. In 1980, Detroit sold about 80 percent of all new vehicles in this country, according to Autodata. Today, it sells just 45 percent. 
 There is a similar chance for us to be fooled about the extent of today's problems. Some day, house prices will stop falling and the financial markets will calm down. But the underlying problems aren't going away on their own. 
 At its core, the current crisis stems from two problems. Regulators, starting with Alan Greenspan, assumed that a real estate bubble couldn't happen and that Wall Street could largely police itself. And households, struggling with incomes that haven't kept up with inflation in recent years, said yes when those lightly regulated banks offered them wishful-thinking loans. No bailout can solve either problem. 
 The past week has offered a glimmer of hope that the policymakers want to get beyond short-term fixes. Mr. Paulson drew the line at Lehman Brothers last weekend, refusing to save it from bankruptcy. On Tuesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate steady, rather than pretending that ever-cheaper borrowing was a cure-all. 
 Now should come the harder part: a much more serious attack on our economic problems. Earlier this week, I called Mr. Hart, who has written some thoughtful things about the economy lately, for his take on all this. ''We've been consuming more than we've been producing. We've been spending more than we've been earning,'' he told me. ''It's been a big holiday.''
 His list of solutions is a pretty good one. The tax code, he said, should be changed to reward savings far more than consumption. The resulting savings would help families prepare for retirement -- and also become a pool of money that companies could invest in productive ways. The federal government should lend a hand, by investing in areas like basic science and technology, which could, in turn, help create more good-paying jobs than the economy has been able to create recently. The government also needs to bring down Medicare costs, which is the key to solving its long-term budget deficit. 
 That's one path. Another would be to add to the deficit by paying for one bailout after another.
 Speaking of which, Detroit's Big Three have come back to Capitol Hill lately, lobbying for billions of dollars in handouts. This time, their executives insist, they'll use the money to solve their problems.

Banks wrote mortgages and sold them to investment banks. The investment banks packaged the mortgages into securities and sold them to investors.
To protect investors against defaults, A.I.G. sold insurance on those securities. A.I.G. put up collateral to guarantee it could repay investors, if needed.
The contracts said that if A.I.G.'s credit ratings were cut, it would have to provide additional collateral.
Credit rating agencies, concerned about the declining value of A.I.G.'s own investment portfolio, cut the company's credit ratings on Monday, forcing the company to put up more collateral.
 If A.I.G. had failed to put up collateral, investors' holdings would have been at risk, perhaps leading to losses around the world. Chart details example.

HEADLINE: Obama Looks To Shift Focus Of Campaign To Economy

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: GOLDEN, Colo. 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama has delivered at least four major addresses on the economy in the course of his presidential candidacy. Yet even his advisers conceded that voters might not have noticed until he spoke here Tuesday as turmoil rippled through the financial markets.
 ''Let's be clear,'' Mr. Obama said sternly. ''What we've seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed.'' 
 In the closing weeks of the presidential race, Mr. Obama is urgently working to seize the economic issue, using the collapse of Wall Street firms to illustrate a need for greater regulation and stronger oversight in the financial sector. But he is facing a challenge on that front from Senator John McCain, who has adopted a populist reformer message in vowing to ''clean up Wall Street.''
 Mr. Obama originally built his campaign on his opposition to the Iraq war, but his message has shifted to the economy. And now the financial crisis is presenting Democrats with a fresh political argument as they try to win back the White House.
 The question remains whether Mr. Obama can define his candidacy around the economy, as other Democrats have done, and be seen as connecting with the struggles of Americans.
 He is using the nation's worsening economy to draw ever-sharpening distinctions with his Republican rivals. He scoffed at a proposal offered on Tuesday by Mr. McCain to create a commission to study the calamity in the nation's financial markets.
 ''Instead of offering up concrete plans to solve these issues, Senator McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book: you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But here's the thing -- this isn't 9/11. We know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out.''
 While Democrats believe Mr. Obama has gained ground winning over working-class voters after the party's divisive primary fight, challenges remain in persuading some voters in economically depressed reaches of battleground states who have experienced Main Street versions of the Wall Street financial crisis.
 Mr. Obama spoke forcefully about the economy on Tuesday during a 40-minute address at the Colorado School of Mines, essentially hitting the rewind button as he reprised ideas he has offered before. He called for more aggressive regulation on Wall Street and a renewed emphasis on innovation before returning to bread-and-butter issues like opposing extending the administration's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
 With Mr. Obama drawing so much early attention for his opposition to the Iraq war -- not a message of economic populism -- many of his economic proposals have received limited notice. So using a teleprompter, he gave a speech here intended to set the framework for the rest of the campaign.
 ''It's hard to understand how Senator McCain is going to get us out of this crisis by doing the same things with the same old players,'' Mr. Obama told a cheering crowd of about 2,000 people. ''Make no mistake: my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance. His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he wasn't offering them more tax cuts.''
 Through those words, Mr. Obama is striving to boil down the argument of Wall Street to make it more applicable to the lives of all voters, no matter where they are. In hundreds of town meetings with voters in the last 19 months, he has heard countless stories about Americans who have lost their jobs, their homes and their quality of life.
 While many stories are similar to his own -- growing up with a single mother of modest means -- even some supporters concede he has not always made the connection. His advisers play down the possibility that his race has hampered his effort to build the trust of some voters.
 ''I've always believed that for those who have questions about Senator Obama, their comfort level will be increased as their focus on this election becomes more intense and they get to see him day after day,'' said David Axelrod, the campaign's top strategist. ''They get a greater sense of where he came from and what he believes, what his values and sensibilities are.''
 Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. McCain won their respective nominations through their economic messages. Mr. Obama was a candidate of change, who campaigned on his judgment in opposing the Iraq war. And Mr. McCain largely appealed to Republicans because of his national security credentials and support for the war. The economy may not have been their initial playing field, but both have no choice but to urgently adapt.
 Tom Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa who briefly entered the Democratic presidential race, said Mr. Obama had to emphasize strongly his plans to rebuild the middle class and drive home the message for each of the remaining days of the campaign.
 ''There is a tremendous opportunity for him at a time when undecided voters focus on the election,'' Mr. Vilsack said Tuesday in an interview. ''Any time the campaign is about the economy, Democrats do well. Any time the campaign is about dissatisfaction and angst over the economy, the party in power suffers.''
 For 48 days, that is Mr. Obama's challenge.

HEADLINE: MCCAIN LABORING TO HIT RIGHT NOTE ON THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington, Adam Nagourney and Larry Rohter from Florida, and Brian Stelter from New York.

 BODY:
VIENNA, Ohio -- On Monday morning, as the financial system absorbed one of its biggest shocks in generations, Senator John McCain said, as he had many times before, that he believed the fundamentals of the economy were ''strong.''
Hours later he backpedaled, explaining that he had meant that American workers, whom he described as the backbone of the economy, were productive and resilient. By Tuesday he was calling the economic situation ''a total crisis'' and denouncing ''greed'' on Wall Street and in Washington.
The sharp turnabout in tone and substance reflected a recognition not only that Mr. McCain had struck a discordant note at a sensitive moment but also that he had done so with regard to the very issue on which he can least afford to stumble.
With economic conditions worsening over the course of this year and voter anxiety on the rise, Mr. McCain has had to labor to get past the impression -- fostered by his own admissions as recently as last year that the subject is not his strongest suit -- that he lacks the experience and understanding to address the nation's economic woes. 
In the most recent case, he first sought to explain away his remarks about the economy's fundamental soundness by saying he had been referring to the American people, almost daring his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, to contradict him on that score. But within hours his aides were scheduling appearances for him Tuesday on all the morning television news shows so that he could try to erase the notion, being promoted aggressively by Democrats, that he was out of touch.
His campaign also sent to reporters the text of a speech he was delivering later Monday that included much starker language about the nation's financial troubles, and by Tuesday had produced a new advertisement asserting that his experience and leadership were necessary in a ''time of crisis.'' Aides and advisers repeated to anyone who would listen the words that Mr. McCain has frequently spoken following his comments about the economy's fundamental strengths: that ''these are very, very difficult times.''
Beyond striking a more populist tone and more explicitly acknowledging the nation's economic problems, his campaign also began an effort Tuesday to cast him as a strong leader with profound experience on economic issues, given his service on the Senate Commerce Committee, where he was chairman for six years. That effort quickly hit a pothole when one of his economic advisers suggested that he had helped to create the BlackBerry, by virtue of his role in brokering telecommunications legislation; the McCain campaign later disavowed that, calling the suggestion ''boneheaded.''
For much of this year, Mr. McCain has seemed to struggle to strike a balance between conveying the optimism that many voters want in their leaders, and the I-feel-your-pain empathy that they crave during hard times. His task is complicated by the tension between his plans to continue many of the economic policies of the unpopular incumbent Republican president he hopes to succeed, and his pledges to improve the American economy and shake up Washington.
As recently as January, Mr. McCain argued at a Republican debate that Americans were better off than they were eight years ago; by this summer he had released an advertisement that said ''we're worse off than we were four years ago.''
His first big speech on the mortgage crisis warned against excessive government intervention; a month later he released his plan for government action to help people keep their homes.
And a tour on which he embarked in July to emphasize his understanding of Americans' economic pain was overshadowed when one of his top economic advisers, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, was quoted as saying that the United States was only in a ''mental recession'' and had become ''a nation of whiners.''
The most recent episode began Monday morning at a rally in Jacksonville, Fla., where Mr. McCain spoke of the troubles in the financial sector.
''There's tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and on Wall Street,'' he said. ''People are frightened by these events. Our economy, I think still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong. But these are very, very difficult times. And I promise you we will never put America in this position again. We will clean up Wall Street. We will reform government. And this is a failure.''
His statement about the strength of the economy's fundamentals was one he has made for nearly a year now, usually adding that times are tough or people are hurting. And in some ways, given that the recession that many have feared all that time has yet to be officially proclaimed, he has been borne out.
But his repeating the remark on Monday, even as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was helping send the stock market plunging to its steepest loss since the terrorist attacks of 2001, quickly became a political problem.
His campaign swung into action then, to try to put the remark ''in context,'' as one top aide said, and to push back against what the McCain organization deemed unfair attacks coming from the Obama camp. In short order Mr. McCain's campaign sent reporters the advance text -- a step usually reserved for major speeches or pronouncements -- of remarks he planned to deliver in Orlando, Fla., on Monday afternoon proclaiming that ''the American economy is in crisis'' and redefining what he had meant when he spoke about the ''fundamentals.''
On Tuesday morning, Mr. McCain was interviewed for CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and CNBC. Again and again, he explained that he understood the ''crisis'' and called for a new commission to study it, modeled on the one that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.
On the NBC News television program ''Today,'' Matt Lauer asked Mr. McCain how he could say that ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong'' while his campaign was releasing an advertisement that said the economy was in crisis.
''Well, it's obviously true that the workers of America are the fundamentals of our economy, and our strength and our future,'' Mr. McCain replied. ''And I believe in the American worker, and someone who disagrees with that -- it's fine. We are in crisis. We all know that. The excess, the greed and the corruption of Wall Street have caused us to have a situation which is going to affect every American. We are in a total crisis.''
Mr. McCain's economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, told reporters Tuesday that the senator, who has often favored deregulation, would push for new regulations as president.
''This story line that people want to write that somehow McCain himself or the McCain campaign doesn't understand what's going on with the economy is wrong,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. ''You shouldn't run for president by denigrating everything in sight and trying to scare people. Let's be accurate. This is an economy that has serious problems.''
By the end of the day, the campaign had gone back on offense. Here in Vienna, outside Youngstown, Mr. McCain noted at a joint rally with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, that Mr. Obama had originally chosen a former head of the recently bailed-out Fannie Mae to lead his vice-presidential search (though the head of Mr. McCain's search committee was himself a past lobbyist for Fannie Mae).
And Ms. Palin said that Mr. Obama's ''tax plans really would kill jobs and hurt small businesses and make even today's bad economy look like the good old days.''

HEADLINE: Downtown's Bull, No Longer Emblematic but Still Popular

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
''We want to know where the bear is,'' said Loretta Garnsey of Camden, Australia, as she stood Monday at the foot of Broadway with her husband, Raymond. 
 In one sense, of course, the bear was everywhere, after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection and Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired.
 But Mrs. Garnsey was referring to something in bronze, which would be a fitting counterpoint to ''Charging Bull,'' Arturo Di Modica's monumental 1989 tribute to the resiliency of the American financial system.
 The Garnseys were among dozens of foreign visitors crowding around the 7,000-pound, 11-foot-tall creature, who seems perpetually frozen in the middle of a wild charge up Broadway from Bowling Green.
 To the extent that the bull symbolizes the potency of Wall Street, it should be noted that many visitors posed for snapshots under an unmistakable symbol of its virility. They laughed and smiled, suggesting that they did not take its power too seriously.
 Though he joined younger people in crouching gamely between the bull's hind legs, Mr. Garnsey was not amused by the unfolding crisis.
 ''Like many people in the world, my superannuation depends on what happens here,'' he said, referring to his pension fund. ''I cannot understand how the brains of Wall Street allowed the subprime crisis to happen.''
 Merrill Lynch, he said, had ''gobbled up a lot of companies'' in Australia, and so its acquisition would greatly affect the Australian stock market.
 Mr. Garnsey, 58, said his pension fund had lost 35 percent to 40 percent of its value in the last 10 months and that he now imagined having to work at least through his late 60s. 
 Positioned at that critical spot under the bull, Mr. Garnsey said, gave him the feeling of control for just a moment.
 Unknown to the Garnseys -- and probably most New Yorkers -- there is a handsome bear specimen not far from Wall Street, in the Alfred E. Smith Playground at Catherine and Monroe Streets. It is a grave figure, rendered in 1946 by Paul Manship, the sculptor of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center.
 Far from looking for a bear, however, the Department of Parks and Recreation hopes to make ''Charging Bull'' a permanent part of Bowling Green.
 Though it has been there 19 years, it is technically a temporary installation. The sculpture still belongs to Mr. Di Modica and its installation on public land has never been approved -- as it must be -- by the municipal Design Commission, formerly the Art Commission.
 Mr. Di Modica has been trying since 2004 to find a donor who would buy the sculpture ($5 million was the original asking price) and give it to the city in turn.
 Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, said Mr. Di Modica was negotiating with a potential buyer.
 ''The best thing would be if it stayed there and helped reincite another strong economic return,'' Mr. Benepe said.
 But as he mentally surveyed all the sculpture in the city's parks, Mr. Benepe reached a conclusion that still might give one pause. ''There are probably more bears than bulls,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The C.E.O. Challenge

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Don't expect to see Carly Fiorina on television talking up her candidate, Senator John McCain, for at least the next few days. The public face of Mr. McCain's economic policy has already canceled an appearance on CNN's ''American Morning'' on Wednesday, and McCain aides said she might be hard to find on the remote for a few days. 
 The fade-out follows Ms. Fiorina's statements Tuesday about both Gov. Sarah Palin's and Mr. McCain's fitness to run the company she once headed, Hewlett-Packard.
 Speaking on the McGraw Milhaven Show on KTRS radio in St. Louis, Ms. Fiorina was praised by Mr. Milhaven as having worked her way up from being a secretary to being what some called the most powerful woman in business, before she was ousted from Hewlett-Packard. Mr. Milhaven went on to say that in tapping Ms. Palin, Mr. McCain ''thinks she has the experience to be president.'' But, he continued, ''Do you think she has the experience to run a major company like Hewlett-Packard?'' 
 ''No, I don't,'' Ms. Fiorina said. 
 But, added Ms. Fiorina, ''that's not what she is running for.'' Returning to the McCain campaign message, Ms. Fiorina went on to say she found it ''quite stunning actually'' that the Obama campaign was questioning Ms. Palin's executive experience. 
 Later in the day, Ms. Fiorina went on television to defend her comment, which was largely perceived to have been harmful to Mr. McCain while he is struggling to prove that he is the best steward of the nation's troubled economy. Appearing on MSNBC, she did not retract her remark but went on to add others to the list of people who also could not run Hewlett-Packard. Yes, they included Senator Barack Obama and his Democratic running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., but they also included Mr. McCain, as well. 
 The Obama campaign could not have been more gleeful: ''If John McCain's top economic adviser doesn't think he can run a corporation,'' said Tommy Vietor, an Obama spokesman, ''how on Earth can he run the largest economy in the world in the midst of a financial crisis?''

HEADLINE: As Long-Term Answer, Some Seek Agency to Buy Bad Debt

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Bush administration has lurched from pillar to post in the financial crisis, some lawmakers and experts were considering a longer-term legislative solution that would create a new agency to dispose of the mortgage-related assets at the core of Wall Street's woes.
Proponents of a more systematic government role to help relieve financial institutions of their toxic securities range from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary under President Clinton, to former Federal Reserve chairmen Paul A. Volcker and Alan Greenspan.
In Congress, the idea that is gaining traction centers on the creation of a new agency that would buy troubled assets from hobbled companies. The idea was floated on Tuesday by Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee. Among those signaling that it merited serious consideration were Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. 
With seven weeks until the presidential elections, no one expects Congress or the White House to move quickly to create a new federal agency that puts taxpayers at risk for hundreds of billions of dollars in bad assets. Steny H. Hoyer, the House majority leader, said there was no time to consider any new proposals in the two weeks before Congress adjourns.
But in its ad hoc approach to the crisis, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have, in effect, already embarked on a course similar to the proposals in Congress.
In the case of Bear Stearns, the Fed took $29 billion of the investment bank's mortgage-related assets as collateral for a Fed loan to JPMorgan Chase, which then agreed to acquire Bear Stearns.
In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Treasury Department placed the companies in a conservatorship and explicitly backed the $5.3 trillion of mortgages they own or guarantee.
Treasury also agreed to buy an unspecified amount of Fannie's and Freddie's mortgage-backed securities on the open market, starting with a $5 billion purchase this month. Those securities are to be managed and ultimately sold for the government by an investment house on Wall Street.
But federal officials remain concerned about the plight of other institutions, including Washington Mutual, the nation's largest savings association. Experts estimate that a government bailout of Washington Mutual could cut in half the size of the federal deposit insurance fund, which protects bank depositors at thousands of banks and savings and loan institutions.
Mr. Frank was among the House and Senate leaders who were hastily called to a meeting Tuesday with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to hear about the Fed's latest rescue plan, this time of the American International Group.
Mr. Frank said that one of the issues discussed in the meeting was a potential need for broader, longer-term federal action in the marketplace.
''We have had a series of ad hoc interventions; this is one more ad hoc intervention,'' he said. ''I do think, because you can't be sure this is the last one, the question of a broader more systemic action in which the government tries to help resolve these things is very important.''
In concept, the proposal would resemble the Resolution Trust Corporation, which disposed of bad assets held by hundreds of crippled savings institutions. Created in 1989, Resolution Trust closed or reorganized 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400 billion. It did so by seizing the assets of troubled savings and loans and then reselling them to bargain-seeking investors.
By 1995, the S.& L. crisis abated and the agency was folded into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which Congress created during the Great Depression to regulate banks and protect the accounts of customers when they fail.
But the parallels to Resolution Trust are inexact. The federal government, unlike now, had no choice but to acquire the assets from savings associations because they were backed by federal deposit insurance. The mortgages now at the heart of Wall Street's woes are not backed by federally insured deposits.
Moreover, the mission of the corporation was to dispose of the assets as quickly as possible for maximum value. Its goal was to reduce taxpayer exposure.
In the current crisis, the goal is more debatable. Should the government be helping homeowners, housing or financial markets, or large companies in trouble? Moreover, policy makers already have been seeking ways to reduce the impact of hard-to-sell assets on the books of companies by encouraging healthier institutions to acquire troubled ones.
The issue is whether Congress, after the election, should create a more formal and accountable mechanism, such as a federal agency, that would provide a relief valve for the troubled assets now causing havoc on Wall Street.
''The question is, and it's just a question, is, 'Are we at the point where the private market has made so many bad decisions and is so depressed that it can't get out from under?' '' said Mr. Frank, who is planning to hold a hearing next week to explore whether Congress should create an agency to help the markets dispose of hard-to-sell assets.
''The question we have to address is, 'Is it the case that market psychology has so depressed assets that no entity has capacity to buy and hold these assets except for the government?' ''
Mr. Frank said it would be more appropriate for a new agency, rather than the central bank, to be relieving the markets of the troubled assets.
''It is not appropriate for the Federal Reserve either in a financial sense or in a democratic sense to take on this role,'' Mr. Frank said in an interview.
But Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate banking committee, said at a news conference announcing hearings later this week on the crisis that he wondered whether such an agency was necessary if Treasury and the Fed were already performing such a function and had the authority to continue to do it.
''I'm not opposed to it,'' he said of Mr. Frank's proposal. ''I'm anxious to hear what the administration would have to say about this.''
Administration officials said they had no plans to make such a proposal, and that they would leave it to the next administration.
Mr. Frank emphasized that any legislation creating a new agency would have to be accompanied by ''tough new regulations'' to discourage companies from making more risky investments. He acknowledged that the decision about such an agency would be in the hands of the next Congress and the next president.
In recent days, aides to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama have said it would be premature to consider creating a new agency. But after the election, the political imperatives could significantly change, particularly if the housing markets remain depressed and Wall Street continues to choke on the billions of dollars in mortgage-backed assets.

HEADLINE: 'Barbies For War!'

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 Carly Fiorina, the woman John McCain sent out to defend Sarah Palin and rip anyone who calls her a tabula rasa on foreign policy and the economy, admitted Tuesday that Palin was not capable of running Hewlett-Packard.
 That's pretty damning coming from Fiorina, who also was not capable of running Hewlett-Packard.
 Carly helpfully added that McCain (not to mention Obama and Biden) couldn't run a major corporation. He couldn't get his immigration bill passed either, but now he's promising to eliminate centuries of greed on Wall Street. 
 The Wall Street Journal reported that McCain was thinking about taking Palin to the U.N. General Assembly next week so she can shake hands with some heads of state. You can't contract foreign policy experience like a rhinovirus. To paraphrase the sniffly Adelaide in ''Guys and Dolls,'' a poy-son could develop a cold war. 
 The latest news from Alaska is that the governor keeps a tanning bed in the Juneau mansion. As The Los Angeles Times pointed out, when Palin declared May 2007 Skin Cancer Awareness Month in Alaska, the press release explained that skin cancer was caused by ''the sun and from tanning beds.''
 I sauteed myself in Sarahville last week.
 I wandered through the Wal-Mart, which seemed almost as large as Wasilla, a town that is a soulless strip mall without sidewalks set beside a soulful mountain and lake.
 Wal-Mart has all the doodads that Sarah must need in her career as a sportsman -- Remingtons and ''torture tested'' riflescopes, game bags for caribou, machines that imitate rabbits and young deer and coyotes to draw your quarry in so you can shoot it, and machines to squish cows into beef jerky.
 I talked to a Wal-Mart mom, Betty Necas, 39, wearing sweatpants and tattoos on her wrists.
 She said she's never voted, and was a teenage mom ''like Bristol.'' She likes Sarah because she's ''down home'' but said Obama ''gives me the creeps. Nothing to do with the fact that he's black. He just seems snotty, and he looks weaselly.''
 Ten Obama supporters in Wasilla braved taunts and drizzle to stand on a corner between McDonald's and Pizza Hut. They complained that Sarah runs government like a vengeful fiefdom and held up signs. A guy with a bullhorn yelled out of a passing red car: ''Go back to the city, you liberal Communists!''
 At gatherings in The Last Frontier, pastors pray for reporters, drilling evokes cheers and Todd Palin is hailed as a guy who likes to burn fossil fuels.
 I had many ''Sarahs,'' as her favorite skinny white mocha is now called, at the Mocha Moose. ''I've seen her at 4 a.m. with no makeup,'' said manager Karena Forster, ''and she's just as beautiful.''
 I stopped by Sarah's old Pentecostal church, the Wasilla Assembly of God, and perused some books: ''The Bait of Satan,'' ''Deliverance from PMS,'' and ''Kissed the Girls and Made them Cry: Why Women Lose When They Give In.'' (Author Lisa Bevere advises: ''Run to the arms of your prince and enter your dream.'')
 In Anchorage Saturday, I went by a conference conducted by James Dobson's Focus on the Family and supported by Sarah's current church, the Wasilla Bible Church, about how to help gays and lesbians ''journey out'' of same-sex attraction. 
 (As The Times reported recently, in 1995, Palin, then a city councilwoman, told colleagues she had seen ''Daddy's Roommate'' on the shelf of the library and did not approve. The Wasilla Assembly of God tried to ban ''Pastor, I Am Gay'' by Howard Bess, a liberal Christian preacher in nearby Palmer.)
 Anne Heche's mother, Nancy, talked about her distress when her daughter told her she was involved with Ellen. Jeff Johnston told me he had ''a struggle'' with homosexuality ''for a season,'' but is now ''happily married with three boys.'' (Books for sale there included ''Mommy, Why Are They Holding Hands?'' and ''You Don't Have to Be Gay.'')
 I covered a boisterous women against Palin rally in Anchorage, where women toted placards such as ''Fess up about troopergate,'' ''Keep your vows off my body,'' ''Barbies for war!'' ''Sarah, please don't put me on your enemies list,'' and ''McCain and Palin = McPain.''
 A local conservative radio personality, Eddie Burke, who had lambasted the organizers as ''a bunch of socialist, baby-killing maggots,'' was on hand with a sign reading ''Alaska is not Frisco.''
 ''We are one Supreme Court justice away from overturning Roe v. Wade,'' he excitedly told me.
 R. D. Levno, a retired school principal, flew in from Fairbanks. ''She's a child, inexperienced and simplistic,'' she said of Sarah. ''It's taking us back to junior high school. She's one of the popular girls, but one of the mean girls. She is seductive, but she is invented.''

HEADLINE: Energy Led Consumer Prices Down in August

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
After climbing for months, the price of consumer goods and services fell in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. 
 Economists noted, though, that prices were still much higher than they were a year ago, and that the one-month decline might not provide any lasting relief. 
 The Consumer Price Index, a measure of retail goods and services in a selection of American cities, fell 0.1 percent in August from the previous month, after a 0.8 percent monthly increase in July and a 1.1 percent increase in June. Year over year, prices were up 5.4 percent, just below July's 17-year high of 5.6 percent.
 ''You have to recognize that there's still considerable inflation in the economy in the sense that the year-over-year rate is elevated,'' said Jared Bernstein, the senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute. ''For the 11th month in a row, weekly paychecks have lagged behind prices on a year-over-year basis, this time by 2.5 percent,'' he said, referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics earnings report, also released Tuesday. ''That's a big decline in workers' buying power.''
 While the price index is usually considered a major market-mover, analysts said the report was overshadowed on Tuesday by worries about the nation's major financial institutions and the Federal Reserve's decision to leave its benchmark lending rate steady. 
 ''We got an on-the-screws report on a day nobody cares about it,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''If we weren't losing major investment banks every other day, people ought to care about these inflation numbers. They are too high.''
 The decline in consumer prices was led largely by transportation costs and energy. Transportation costs fell 1.5 percent in August, after rising the previous three months. Energy prices fell 3.1 percent during August and have since dipped below the psychological benchmark of $100 a barrel for light, sweet crude oil. But they are still 27.2 percent above where they were a year ago. 
 Stripping out energy and food prices, the so-called core inflation rate that economists consider to be a good sign of the economy's health was 0.2 percent. 
 ''Before you pop the Champagne cork to celebrate declining prices,'' Mr. Bernstein said, ''remember that this is precisely what prices do when demand goes south.''

HEADLINE: Crews From 31 States Work to Restore Power in Storm-Ravaged Texas

BYLINE: By JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Houston, and Thayer Evans from Galveston, Tex.

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
An army of line crews from 31 states has converged on eastern Texas to help deal with the largest power failure in this large state's history.
 In the wake of Hurricane Ike, officials fear it could take weeks to restore power in some places, like Galveston and the towns near the Louisiana border, because major transmission lines have been knocked out, substations have been swamped and trees have fallen on neighborhood lines.
 ''It's a rare event when you will see physical damage to most of the grid,'' said Mayor Bill White of Houston. ''Hurricane Ike, with our power company, was that kind of event.'' 
 About two million customers remained without power across eastern Texas as of Tuesday afternoon, three days after the hurricane hit. 
 Hundreds of thousands of students were still out of school, mail delivery was suspended, most businesses had yet to open, hundreds of intersections lacked traffic signals and government agencies were struggling to provide services. Some hospitals, including the main hospital in Galveston, operated on generators. 
 Entergy, the utility that serves the area east of Houston, has restored power to about 40,000 of its 395,000 customers. CenterPoint, which serves Houston and Galveston, had made more progress, but still had 1.5 million customers in the dark. 
 In Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city and the center of its oil industry, signs of prolonged blackout are everywhere -- in long lines at the few gasoline stations with power to run pumps, in the huge demand for ice at government food-distribution centers, in the low number of grocery stores that are open, and in the grumbling of ordinary citizens. Refineries in Texas remain closed. 
 Most of Houston was coping without refrigerators, air-conditioners and pumps to provide water pressure both for drinking water and for sewage plants. 
 ''I got no ice, no water, no electricity, no nothing,'' said Maria Phillips, 25, of the Houston suburb of Baytown, echoing the comments of many others. Ms. Phillips's house, which had been flooded, was nearly uninhabitable, she said.
 President Bush, who visited Houston and Galveston on Tuesday, discussed the blackout with local officials.
 ''Obviously people are concerned about electricity,'' Mr. Bush said, ''and what I look for, is there enough help to get these energy companies to do what they instinctively want to do, which is get the grid up and running?'' 
 Throughout the day, tree-trimming crews and line workers were arriving from states as far away as California and Pennsylvania to help the local utilities, which had already deployed about 8,500 workers. 
 Beleaguered residents, many of whom have been without power since Friday, treated the utility workers like heroes. 
 Near Ball High School in Galveston late Tuesday afternoon, two line workers in a cherry picker worked on a leaning, splintered power pole. A crane helped anchor the pole, while one of the men cut it in half with a chain saw. A crowd gathered to watch.
 Herman Marino, a line worker from Denver, said the damage to Galveston's power lines was the worst he had ever seen, including the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
 ''That wasn't as bad as this one,'' said Mr. Marino, 48. ''This is pretty good damage.''
 In eastern Texas, near the Louisiana border, the hurricane knocked down more than 100 towers holding high-voltage transmission lines, damaged 272 substations and flooded the Sabine Power Station in Bridge City, driving snakes and wild animals into the plant, officials at Entergy Texas said.
 The infrastructure around Houston fared better. Most high-voltage lines remained intact and the main damage was to the distribution lines in neighborhoods, officials at CenterPoint said. On Tuesday, about 24 high voltage transmission lines were still out of service, five of them running into Galveston. 
 In part because there is no electricity, Galveston officials declared their battered island city on the brink of a public health disaster. Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas asked residents to stay away. 
 A program that had allowed residents to return briefly to check on their properties was suspended after a crush of residents descended within a few hours, said the city manager, Steve LeBlanc. ''We were totally overwhelmed.'' Mr. LeBlanc said. ''We expected a lot of people to come back, but it was like all at once.'' 
 He said the policy would be re-evaluated, adding, ''We're really going to go backwards if everybody's here and we're having to deal with that.'' 
 For some residents, the days and nights without electricity have become more and more intolerable.
 ''It's very hard,'' said Phoebe Crump, 33, a homemaker. ''You don't know where you are going to step. You can't see where your food's at. You don't know where your water is at. You can't see nothing.''
 ''Life is hard enough,'' Ms. Crump added. ''It's harder without power.''
 As crews hacked away at downed trees and replaced blown-out transformers and cut lines, state and local officials contended with a plethora of other problems, among them a tiger on the loose. 
 James D. Yarbrough, the Galveston County judge, said a pet tiger, well known to locals, had escaped during the storm and was wandering the ruins of houses on Bolivar Peninsula. ''I understand he's hungry, so we are staying away from him,'' Mr. Yarbrough said. 
 Officials reported six more deaths in Texas attributed to the storm, bringing the toll in this state alone to 15. Some of the latest victims died of carbon monoxide poisoning from gasoline-powered generators; others died trying to cut up fallen trees and in fires caused by candles.
 More than 33,000 people, meantime, remained housed in temporary shelters around Texas, waiting for the green light to go home, a signal some local officials said might not come for weeks.
 Mr. Bush, making his third trip to inspect storm damage in two weeks, said the government had a plan in place to reimburse displaced residents for hotels for at least the next 30 days. He also announced that the federal government would absorb the cost of removing debris.
 A former Texas governor, Mr. Bush took a rapid helicopter tour of the devastated areas around Galveston, then jetted back to Washington to meet with economic advisers about a different sort of storm on Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Crisis Sharpens Debate On Wisdom of Term Limits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID W. CHEN; Fernanda Santos contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg, a Wall Street miracle, today finds himself mayor of a city that is home to a Wall Street crisis.
 Over the last 72 hours, Mr. Bloomberg has showcased his business expertise by reassuring the public about the health of the city's economy, consulting with regulators and banking executives, grilling his aides about potential tax revenue decline, and holding court on esoterica like the strength of the city's office vacancy rate. 
 The mayor's high visibility -- and the near-collapse of two major New York City financial institutions -- have stirred discussions among his advisers and outside analysts about whether the turmoil could strengthen the argument for Mr. Bloomberg to overturn the term limits law and serve four more years. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, asked at a press conference Tuesday whether the Wall Street woes bolstered such a case, said he could see both sides. 
 ''There is an argument for experience,'' he said. ''There is an argument for change, and I think it's purely a question of what you think the appropriate level of balance is.''
 In fact, many are divided about whether the events would give new ammunition to a quiet campaign under way to overturn the 15-year-old law, which restricts elected officials to two terms or eight years in office.
 ''He can say, 'Look, this is not about me. I need to finish this job,' '' said Eric N. Gioia, a city councilman from Queens, who opposes changing term limits without a voter referendum. ''There aren't a lot of people who have his experience, connections and gravitas.'' He said the argument for keeping Mr. Bloomberg in office ''is pretty compelling.''
 Others suggested that Mr. Bloomberg, for all his experience as a Wall Street trader and his relationships with banking executives, might prove unable to do much practically to stop the hurt. And that he would be as vulnerable as any other politician to the fate that meets elected officials if the economy really sours.
 A third term under those circumstances, they suggest, might be less than appealing -- for Mr. Bloomberg and for voters.
 ''As the economy goes south, so will his popularity ratings,'' said City Councilman John C. Liu, a Democrat from Queens. ''No one, not even this mayor, can control the economy.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg should know. He took over in 2002, when the city's economy was still faltering from the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, and watched his popularity fall as he increased the property tax. His approval ratings rebounded after he nursed the city back to financial health. But there is no guarantee that his background and track record would be enough to make a difference this time.
 Still, many of Mr. Bloomberg's colleagues and associates see an opportunity in the current climate to make a case for a third term. 
 ''He is uniquely situated to understand this crisis and to cope with it,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University and a former Bloomberg adviser.
 No matter what Mr. Bloomberg decides to do, the shock waves from Wall Street are forcing his potential successors to recalibrate their strategies and message as they strive to project a Bloomberg-like command of the city's finances. 
 William C. Thompson, the city comptroller and a likely candidate for mayor, has become a fixture on the television news circuit, discussing the city's financial health and his efforts to plan for a downturn. Over the last two days, he has appeared on NY1 and CNBC, and was a guest on ''Week in Review,'' a Sunday night radio program on WRKS-FM. 
 ''We have planned for a downturn,'' Mr. Thompson said during the CNBC appearance on Tuesday morning. ''We've got money set aside. We are in decent shape over the next 18 months.''
 Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, another likely mayoral candidate, has similarly cast herself a voice of fiscal conservatism. And she has emphasized her close alliance with Mr. Bloomberg.
 ''The council and mayor have been incredibly fiscally prudent, together,'' she said during a City Hall press conference on Monday. ''The thing that New Yorkers need to know is that we planned for a day like today.''
 Another mayoral hopeful, Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who sits on the energy and commerce committee, said that he is talking to business leaders about ways to improve the nation's financial regulations and was studying a variety of proposals to shore up the financial system. Among other things, he said he was examining the government's response during the savings and loan crisis 20 years ago to understand the lessons of that period. 
 Mr. Weiner, who has differed with Mr. Bloomberg, struck a conciliatory tone on Tuesday, saying ''I want the mayor to be successful here, and there's plenty of things for us to do.'' 
 Political consultants say that if Mr. Bloomberg is allowed to seek a third term, and runs, he would prove formidable, if nearly unbeatable. 
 The question is whether the financial crisis and Mr. Bloomberg's appeal are sufficient to change term limits, which have been approved by New York City voters twice, in 1993 and 1996. There is growing opposition to revising the term limits law through legislation, the most likely route for a change. 
 Several members of the Council have introduced bills that would require the rule to be altered only through a voter referendum, a position embraced by some officials and good government groups.
 Mr. Bloomberg is not the first mayor to mull rewriting the rules to remain in office. In 2001, immediately after Sept. 11, Rudolph W. Giuliani sought to extend his term as mayor by several months, to oversee the cleanup of ground zero and revive the city's economy.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Ford Officials Seeking U.S. Loans to Meet Fuel Goal

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Executives from General Motors and the Ford Motor Company pressed their case on Tuesday for $25 billion in federal loans in a series of high-level meetings with lawmakers in Washington.
 The appearances by G.M.'s chairman, Rick Wagoner, and Ford's executive chairman, William C. Ford Jr., underscored how vital the industry considers the loans as it tries to meet tougher fuel-efficiency regulations.
 Mr. Wagoner traveled to Washington shortly after G.M. unveiled the production version of its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle in Detroit. The timing was coincidental, given that G.M. was celebrating its 100th anniversary on Tuesday. 
 But G.M. executives said advanced alternative-fuel vehicles like the Volt are the type of project that would benefit from the loan program created last year in fuel-economy legislation.
 ''It certainly could help us finance this vehicle,'' said Frederick A. Henderson, G.M.'s president. ''This is exactly the kind of vehicle that was contemplated when the money was put in the bill.''
 House Democrats are hoping to attach financing for the loans in an energy bill, an economic stimulus package or a broader appropriations measure.
 Auto executives, however, are concerned that Congress will not complete the loan financing during its abbreviated session this month.
 Moreover, Detroit is doing all it can to distinguish the loans from the crisis on Wall Street and the Bush administration's decision not to rescue the investment bank Lehman Brothers from a bankruptcy filing.
 ''The Wall Street crisis will diminish the chances of Detroit getting what it wants,'' said John A. Casesa of the investment firm Casesa Shapiro Group. 
 In a speech Tuesday night to the Economic Club of Washington, Mr. Wagoner emphasized that the loans were an integral part of legislation that mandates a 40 percent increase in corporate fuel economy.
 ''Nobody called it a bailout then, because it wasn't,'' Mr. Wagoner said. ''And it still isn't.''
 Mr. Ford and two other Ford Motor executives, Mark Fields and Joseph R. Hinrichs, met Tuesday with lawmakers who have auto plants in their districts.
 Lawmakers are also expected to hear Wednesday from Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, as well as Chrysler's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli.
 Some lawmakers and media outlets have called the loan program an unwarranted subsidy for Detroit's Big Three, which have recorded billions in losses in the last three years.
 While the loans are not restricted to the Detroit companies, the program is intended primarily to retool factories like those run by Chrysler, Ford and G.M.
 G.M., for example will build the Volt in a plant in Michigan that makes large Cadillac sedans.
 ''Clearly, the Volt represents a huge improvement in fuel economy over those cars,'' Mr. Henderson said.
 G.M. is committed to building the Volt by late 2010. The car will be driven by electricity stored in a lithium-ion battery pack that allows it to run 40 miles without gasoline.
 When the battery runs down, a small gasoline engine turns on and generates enough electricity to drive an additional 300 miles.
 Analysts who have driven early versions of the Volt have been impressed with its performance.
 ''It's completely silent and very powerful,'' Mr. Casesa said. ''It shows what G.M. can do when they really focus their energies on engineering and design.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Is Down, and So Are They

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON; Reporting was contributed by Ann Farmer, Daryl Khan, Colin Moynihan and Nate Schweber.

 BODY:
The sign of the times for Wall Street is that familiar jagged line, the one that starts on the upper left and drops like a weighted corpse in a cold lake. 
 But on the streets and avenues away from Wall Street, the signs, while less obvious than a black line on a white sheet, are no less clear. They are the piles of little Dora the Explorer socks piled up in the narrow K. S. Hosiery on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side, socks that are not selling like they used to. 
 They are the suits around the corner on Canal Street at S. A. Clothing, celebrating 80 years in the neighborhood this year, if you can call it a celebration: the owner, Ronald Salstein, 59, stands outside, smoking, less out of habit than avoiding the boredom of his empty shop. 
 Economic indicators in black, brown, red and blonde come walking through the doors of Flora International Hair Design, a salon in Queens Village. ''My customers still come, but they come less often,'' said Flora, the 50-year-old owner. ''They let their hair grow longer. They have longer roots.'' 
 These and other New Yorkers interviewed on Wednesday, as the Dow Jones industrial average was falling another 449 points, paused to consider the volatile week on Wall Street, the effect they expected it to have on their own lives, and who should be held accountable. 
 Their replies were as colorful and varied as one would expect from a random sampling in this city -- at times fearful and discouraged, at others optimistic and sarcastic -- and went something like this: Whatever is going on with Wall Street is bad, maybe very bad, but tell me something I don't know. 
 As for pointing fingers, some people needed both hands: the fallen financial titans who invested in the debts of others, to the politicians who stood by, down to the people who overextended themselves for a home they could not afford. Some blamed the Republicans, others the Democrats, and several others the war in Iraq. 
 Many spoke of their own woes, while others thanked their luck and frugal habits. 
 Carmine Morales, 56, is about as recession-proof as a builder of coffins. He owns the 32-year-old Classic Coffee Shop on Hester Street, selling coffee, breakfast and sandwiches to neighbors and the teachers and parents swirling through the school across the street. 
 ''I don't have any money in the stock market,'' he said, less concerned than others about the news from downtown. ''By the time it gets down to a guy like me, it all might be over.''
 He said he sympathized with anyone who lost a job, be it pushing a broom or pushing piles of money around with a pen. But he, like many others, said he believed that people in charge should have seen this coming. ''The big guys just keep making more money and giving themselves raises,'' he said. ''Do I give myself a raise? No. I wish I could.'' 
 In Queens Village, Edna Tomlinson, 69, a retired nursing aide, was less confident. Her home, bought in the 1970s, was paid for, but the events on Wall Street left her feeling uneasy about the future. 
 ''I've got money in the bank and I don't know what to do,'' she said. ''You don't know if you're going to lose it.'' 
 Down Jamaica Avenue, Gilbert DeLarosa, 46, said the economic story was told on the shelves of his pawnshop. ''People have maxed out their credit card rating or credit card, and they come to the pawnshop with precious pieces of jewelry,'' he said. ''The sales department is slow, but the pawn department is doing well.'' 
 He said he could not blame people who bought homes they could not afford. ''It's the American dream to own your own house,'' he said, and with optimism: ''We're resilient. We'll pick up and bounce back.'' 
 A purveyor of door hardware in the Lower East Side, who gave only his first name, Henry, 43, said he had seen problems with subprime lending long ago. ''I never understood,'' he said. ''I didn't think I was sophisticated enough, but apparently I was. I thought it was just my old-world way of thinking.'' Now, he said, he is sure to feel the effects, as the stores to whom he sells doorknobs and hinges sell fewer to Wall Street's offices and the homes of its workers. 
 The Canal Street clothier, Mr. Salstein, said that men tended to buy first for their children, second for their wives and last for themselves, and that lately there is little left at the end. ''People are buying exactly what they need,'' he said. ''If they want black pants, you better have black pants, not blue. I'm not serving Wall Street clientele here. But my customers, the lawyers, the business people, they're all jumpy. They have investments. Clothing is the last thing on their minds. I blame the lobbyists, the politicians and Wall Street. Nobody's looking out for the little guy.'' 
 Men with similar backgrounds offered very different views of Wall Street. 
 Misael Cortrera, 22, a construction worker in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan who has not found work in weeks, said he blamed the companies that handed out the risky loans. ''Now they're trying to say, 'Oh, it's not our fault, it's the fault of the people,'' '' he said. ''But I think the banks have the major fault. If they don't want to, they don't give you nothing.''
 But in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, Ernest Cooper, 53, a forklift operator out of work on disability, said he sympathized with the executives in suits who left work with cardboard boxes in their arms this week.
 ''I don't like to see that come about, because they are people, too, and they earned that position, that prestige. They worked for it,'' he said. ''Now that's being taken away because of what the government's doing, the people we'll never meet, the powerful, the political people, the players. They're taking the money out of the economy and sending it to Uncle Sam. This government is corrupt.'' 
 In Washington Heights, Jessy Torres, 35, a medical secretary, said she blamed the war and its effect on the economy, and used colorful language in bemoaning the bailouts and the president. But she said she felt relatively secure in her own future, as she makes about $35,000 a year -- too little, she believes, for anyone to bother laying her off. And if she did lose her job, she could find something else. 
 She took some comfort in her small piece of the pie: ''You always need somebody to clean the toilets.''

HEADLINE: Broadway Guys and Gals, Hanging Out in an Alley

BYLINE: By APRIL DEMBOSKY

 BODY:
It's opening night, but this cast is not at Lincoln Center. The boys of ''South Pacific,'' all clad in black T-shirts, are roaring in Lanes 25 and 26. They throw high fives, blow kisses and strike stageworthy poses. One curly haired actor knocks down six pins on his first throw of the frame, warranting a graceful split leap back to the ball return.
 The Broadway Show Bowling League's fall season has begun. Every Thursday, after the final curtain call on the members' respective stages, the makeup comes off, the bowling shoes come out, but the performance doesn't exactly stop. 
 ''Bowling isn't just a sport,'' says Christian Delcroix, the ''South Pacific'' team's captain. ''It's a culture.'' 
 He recalls the culture of his childhood bowling alley in Pittsburgh: grimy, smoky and packed with blue-collar union workers. Now he's bowling at the sleek, subtly lighted Leisure Time Bowl, in the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue, and the predominant union is Actors' Equity. The place is packed with more than 100 Broadway actors, stage managers and crew members.
 Mr. Delcroix, who plays Herbert Quayle in the show, identifies the trait that separates this crew from the regulars in western Pennsylvania.
 ''The drama,'' he says definitively. ''If someone gets a strike, people are doing pirouettes. People are jumping up and down, people are hugging, yelling. That's what we're trained to do.'' 
 Over in Lane 20 are the Rama Lama Ding Dongs -- yes, the team from ''Grease.'' Ashley Spencer, who plays Sandy, picks up her pastel-striped bowling ball for her second throw. She swivels in her bowling shoes, white socks folded neatly at her ankles, and looks through her feathered blond bangs at her teammates. 
 ''I'm channeling 'Grease 2' with this one,'' she says. She saunters up the lane, conjuring images of the Pink Ladies about to break out singing ''Score Tonight.'' Ms. Spencer picks up a spare, then bops over to the bar for another pink drink in a martini glass. 
 Only a handful of players here seem invested in breaking 100. Though scores are tallied throughout the four-month fall season (there is also a spring season), and trophies are awarded at the end, generous handicaps are awarded to quite a few players to keep things interesting. 
 The league was started sometime in the 1960s, when people bowled without irony, and for years it has donated part of the bowlers' fees to the charity Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. While some participants are serious enough that they bring their own bowling balls, for the most part the league is just a bunch of co-workers unwinding after a late night at the office.
 ''It's neat to get to see people who aren't covered in green makeup or wearing a house of a costume,'' says Lindsay Northen, a member of the ensemble in ''Wicked'' and an understudy for Glinda. 
 While the league effectively takes over the alley every Thursday night at 11, several lanes are always open for the public. But once they happen upon this scene, most would-be bowlers prefer to sit and watch. 
 The mood is light. Marvin Murphy, 24, a waiter at the alley, says the Broadway bowlers are more laid back and better at tipping than the regular clientele, perhaps, he suggests, because they have little to prove in the lanes. People talk, sing, dance and drink. One of the league's commissioners, Steve McDonald, takes over the sound system each week with one of his CD mixes, mostly '80s music. 
 ''One time, they put on Broadway show tunes,'' Mr. Murphy recalls. ''Everybody booed.''
 There's also a summer Broadway show softball league that dates to the 1950s. But Eddie Pendergraft, an ensemble member in ''Wicked,'' jokes that there is an athletic divide, at least in his show. 
 ''Softball is usually all the tech guys,'' he says. ''Bowling is all the girls and the gays.''
 Between the pregame chants and post-strike poses, socializing is the priority. Co-stars decompress with co-stars. Friends catch up with friends who have moved on to other shows. The unemployed network. 
 ''I've gotten a lot of work here,'' said Avi Rosenberg, who works as a freelance stage carpenter and is a member of the team Will Bowl for Beer, made up of carpenters, electricians and other technicians. They pass on tips about job openings or shows striking a set or building one. ''We help each other out,'' Mr. Rosenberg says. 
 John (Jack) Curtin is the hair supervisor for ''Grease,'' in charge of 67 wigs. He has been styling hair ''since God was a boy,'' otherwise calculated as 23 years, 13 of them on Broadway. He says he has hired people at bowling night. 
 ''If I need someone to cover one of my stylists or to cover me, I can ask someone here,'' he says, adjusting his ''I Bowl for Jesus'' bowling shirt. ''It's a great way to network.''
 Sometimes the networking veers toward the frisky. Amber Wedin, the league's other commissioner, first bowled in the league in 2006, when she was a stage manager for ''Avenue Q.'' That show's team bowled against Will Bowl for Beer. Ms. Wedin was player No. 5, matched up directly with the other team's No. 5, Jake White, now a props assistant for the show ''13,'' soon to open on Broadway. 
 ''We became friends, started dating several months later and have now been together for two and a half years,'' Ms. Wedin says. ''Everyone assumes that we met working on some project together. But we didn't. We met bowling.''
 While fraternizing is at the forefront, there are a few teams, usually those with matching team shirts, that take bowling -- and winning -- seriously. ''South Pacific's'' all-male team is in the process of creating shirts. 
 Mr. Delcroix describes the design. ''On the back, it'll say: 'Strike Hard. Strike Fast. Show No Mercy,' '' he says.
 ''The thing is,'' notes a teammate, Victor Hawks, ''we're not very good.''

HEADLINE: Giving Their Regards By Skewering the Shows

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Can this really be the end of ''Forbidden Broadway''? It's true that this venerable satiric revue was looking a bit peaked when I checked in on it a year ago, as if the exertions of searching for shows distinctive enough to caricature in a bland Broadway season had sapped it of its natural vim and vinegar.
 But having announced that it would be officially ending its nearly 27-year reign of merry terror on Jan. 15, Gerard Alessandrini's long-lived show appears to have been blessed with that burst of have-to-win energy that descends on weary racers as they near the finish line. Its latest incarnation, which opened Wednesday night at the 47th Street Theater, finds an old war horse of spoofery with muscles tautened, nostrils flaring and teeth polished and sharpened -- the better to kick, snort at and bite the institution that has fed it for so many years. 
 Its title is ''Forbidden Broadway Goes to Rehab.'' And though the clinic where the show rehabilitated itself is never identified, it's clearly the place to send anyone and anything in need of rejuvenation. (Is it possible to book a reservation for the American economy?) Written (as always) by Mr. Alessandrini, who directed with Phillip George, and performed by a talent-packed five-member ensemble, this is the liveliest, sauciest and saddest ''Forbidden Broadway'' in over a decade.
 I say saddest because if Mr. Alessandrini is serious, he's putting the show to bed when this version ends its run -- at least as an annual event in New York. ''When Broadway becomes too theme-park-like, it makes it too difficult,'' said Mr. Alessandrini in a recent interview in The New York Times, reflecting on the paucity of new subjects worthy of his mockery.
 This awareness of Broadway's creative poverty lent a crabby listlessness to his last show, which often had the feeling of a singing whinefest. This time he explores the same subjects but with an air of angry glee instead of defeat. The long arm of Disney, the reliance on brand-name song books and movie titles, the reduction of talented performers to moveable scenery parts: all these targets are set up for shooting once again.
 Yet even vignettes recycled and retweaked from earlier ''Forbidden'' editions have new asperity and crispness. Listen and weep, hysterically, to that know-it-all nanny Mary Poppins as she breaks down the formula practiced by the Disney Company and the producer Cameron Mackintosh, to the tune of ''Feed the Birds'':
 Feed the 'burbs Tepid a show Tepid, vapid, titles they know Feed the 'burbs Humongous size While overhead A scared actress flies.
 Of course it helps that the song is delivered by Gina Kreiezmar in a voice that milks every drop of condescension from a purer-than-thou soprano and received British accent.
 The strapping Ms. Kreiezmar has the essential parodist's gift of magnifying without melting whatever she's sending up. So, happily, does the rest of the cast members, who come in a clownish assortment of shapes and sizes: the tiny Christina Bianco; the matinee-idol-chiseled Jared Bradshaw; and the hard-bodied, joker-faced Michael West. (David Caldwell is the protean pianist and musical director.)
 When a show has its own personality, the creative team here knows exactly how to attack. Mr. West memorably vivisects the distracting angular rapster's gestures of Lin-Manuel Miranda in a number that portrays the Tony-winning musical ''In the Heights'' as '' 'West Side Story' lite.''
 Tracy Letts's much-acclaimed drama ''August: Osage County'' is presented as a vicious boxing match between its quarreling mother and daughter characters, in which blows are steadily dealt to the show's claims of originality. And last season's first-rate spoof of ''Spring Awakening,'' in which boys keep microphones beneath their zippers, is reprised in high style. 
 Not all shows -- make that very few shows -- have their own voices these days, a point made excruciatingly clear by a reinterpretation of the score of the new musical ''A Tale of Two Cities'' (which opens Thursday night), in which Mr. West (imitating James Barbour as Sidney Carton) sings, ''You thought the British op'ricle was hell/ But try to sing this retread 'Scarlet Pimpernel.' ''
 Mr. Alessandrini will occasionally graft one show onto another with far more inspired results than those practiced by the body-part-stitching title character of ''Young Frankenstein'' (which gets the crude but lethal parody it deserves here). For the revival of ''Equus,'' young Daniel Radcliffe (a winningly coy Mr. Bradshaw) sheds his ''Harry Potter'' robes in a striptease to the tune of ''Let Me Entertain You.'' (''Let me enter naked/Let me strut un-cut.'')
 Which brings us to what ''Forbidden Broadway'' calls ''this year's annual revival of 'Gypsy.''' Mr. Alessandrini must have sung hallelujah when he learned Patti LuPone would be returning to Broadway in the role of Momma Rose. Ms. LuPone is one of the few outsized, hyper-stylized personalities left in the musical theater. And Ms. Kreiezmar, mouth atwist and eyes aglitter, knows just what to do as she sings, ''Everything's commming out Patti!'' (She also does a spot-on Liza, but then, who doesn't?)
 While another, younger Broadway original, Kristin Chenoweth, appears to have forsaken the stage for the small screen, Mr. Alessandrini uses this transfer of allegiance for a number based on the ''Candide'' show-off piece ''Glitter and Be Gay,'' retitled ''Glitter and Be Glib.'' Ms. Bianco brilliantly delivers the number in Ms. Chenoweth's two voices: the cute nasal one and the operatic soprano. 
 Inevitably there's an undercurrent of elegy to ''Forbidden Broadway Goes to Rehab.'' A caricature of Kelli O'Hara and Paulo Szot in ''South Pacific'' turns ''Some Enchanted Evening'' into ''Some Endangered Species.'' And the show's last number is a largely sincere tribute to Stephen Sondheim, presenting him as the last of a race of titans. Who can blame Mr. Alessandrini for feeling it's time to close shop? 
 A witty ensemble piece about Internet showbiz chat rooms (called ''All That Chat,'' in an apparent reference to the so-named chat area on the theater Web site talkinbroadway.com, and led by Ms. Bianco as Bebe Neuwirth in ''Chicago'') suggests that gossip about Broadway shows has become more entertaining than the shows themselves. ''Who needs theater tix, when you can get your kicks on 'All That Chat'?'' the song asks.
 But such Web-dipping is a poor substitute for the barbed Cliffs Notes ''Forbidden Broadway'' has regularly provided. Anyone who wanted to be well-informed about the state of New York theater without having to shell out the ever-inflating big bucks need only have turned to Mr. Alessandrini and company. What will the simple folk do without them?

HEADLINE: Metallica Tops Charts

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO; Compiled by JULIE BLOOM

 BODY:
With just three days at stores, Metallica's ''Death Magnetic'' (Warner Brothers) cruised to the top of this week's Billboard album chart with 490,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Released on Friday -- albums usually come out on Tuesdays, and SoundScan tracks weekly sales from Monday to Sunday -- ''Death Magnetic'' is Metallica's fifth to open at No. 1, breaking the four-way tie it had held with the Beatles, U2 and the Dave Matthews Band for the group with most bows in the top spot. ''Do You Know'' (Columbia Nashville), the new country album by Jessica Simpson, is No. 4 with 65,000 in sales, and LL Cool J opens in the Top 10 for the sixth time in a row with ''Exit 13'' (Def Jam), which sold 44,000 copies to reach No. 9. Last week's top seller, Young Jeezy's ''The Recession'' (Def Jam), fell to No. 2 with 90,000, Kid Rock's ''Rock N Roll Jesus'' (Atlantic) is No. 3 with 75,000.

HEADLINE: Construction Of Housing At Pace of '91

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments fell to the lowest level in 17 years last month, showing that the country is still gripped by a severe housing downturn that has brought on billions of dollars of losses and is reshaping the nation's financial industry. 
 The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that housing construction dropped a surprising 6.2 percent in August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 895,000 units. It was the slowest construction rate since January 1991, another period when housing was going through a painful correction.
 The decline is larger than the 1.6 percent drop that analysts had expected, and it showed weakness everywhere in the country except the West. The data was bound to shake Wall Street, already rattled by a crisis in the financial system. 
 The housing downturn has depressed overall economic activity and pushed the country close to a recession. Thousands of construction jobs have been lost, contributing to an economic slowdown that drove the overall unemployment rate to a five-year high of 6.1 percent in August.
 The decline last month in housing reflected a 1.9 percent decline in construction of new single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 630,000 units. Construction of multifamily units fell 15.1 percent to an annual rate of 265,000 units.
 Construction over all was down in all parts of the country with the exception of the West. Construction fell 14.5 percent in the Northeast, 13.6 percent in the Midwest and 7.4 percent in the South.
 All the declines left construction activity 33.1 percent below the level of a year ago. Analysts believe that construction will continue falling for many more months as builders struggle to reduce the backlog of unsold homes in a sluggish market.
 Building permits, considered a good indicator of future activity, dropped 8.9 percent in August to an annual rate of 854,000 units.
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the nation's current account deficit widened to $183.1 billion during the second quarter, from $175.6 billion in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Regulators Seeking to Change Rules to Ease Bank Mergers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal officials issued a raft of proposed and final rules this week aimed at shoring up the weakened financial markets and strengthening the eroding balance sheets of banks. 
 With little notice, regulators at four agencies that oversee the nation's banks and savings associations on Monday and Tuesday proposed a significant change in accounting rules to bolster banks and encourage widespread industry consolidation by making them more attractive to prospective purchasers. The regulators and the Bush administration have decided to resort to further loosening of the accounting rules to try to get the industry through problems that some experts have attributed in large part to years of deregulation.
 Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission imposed new limits on short-selling and issued guidelines to help financial institutions prop up money market accounts in light of losses reported Tuesday by a large fund. 
 In addition, the chairman of the S.E.C., Christopher Cox, proposed a disclosure rule that would require hedge funds and other large investors to disclose their short positions. Managers with more than $100 million invested in securities would be required to begin public reporting of their daily short positions. He also said that the enforcement division would expand its inquiry into possible market manipulation and would obtain details from hedge funds and other institutional traders about their investments in specific securities. 
 And on Sunday, the Federal Reserve announced that it had eased restrictions that had prevented regulated companies from transferring money to less regulated and more risky affiliates. That action would, for instance, enable one arm of a giant financial company, like the commercial banks of Bank of America or Citigroup, to move money to another arm, like their investment units.
 The action by the four banking agencies provides more favorable accounting treatment of so-called good will, an intangible asset that reflects the difference between the market value and selling price of a bank. The move is similar to a step taken in the midst of the savings-and-loan crisis that helped many institutions in the short run. 
 Over the longer term, that decision increased the overall costs of the bailout after the government took away the good will benefits. Under the proposal issued this week, the regulators would permit buyers of banks and thrifts to count some of the good will toward meeting their regulatory capital requirements.
 Already this year, 11 banks have failed. The proposed accounting change could help other faltering banks by making them more attractive to suitors.
 The agencies that issued the proposal -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Reserve -- indicated that it would be adopted after only 30 days of public comment. Regulators said the proposal was a reasonable response to calls by the industry for help in raising and accounting for capital. Over the last week, the banking industry has lost about $36 billion in capital it had booked in the form of preferred stock held in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government took over.
 Banking industry executives who have long sought changes in accounting treatment of good will applauded the decision.
 ''Easing the good will restriction is huge to many of our members because a good many of our members in acquisitions have a great deal of good will on their books,'' said Camden R. Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade group that lobbied for the changes.
 Mr. Fine said that while many community banks remained well capitalized, hundreds of banks had suffered significant erosion in their capital cushion.
 ''As a bank's capital begins to decline, the bank becomes more conservative and it pulls in its horns,'' he said. ''That exacerbates broader economic problems in their communities.''
 Some experts said bank regulators had few good options. 
 ''It's a desperate thing,'' said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, a consulting company. 
 ''If we've learned anything,'' she added, ''it's that capital at risk is the way to protect the financial system. Giving any institution a capital incentive to double down the federal backstop would be dangerous.''
 The new S.E.C. rules seek to curb what is known as naked short-selling. Under a normal short sale, which is a bet that a stock's price will fall, an investor borrows shares and then sells them. If the price drops, the investor purchases shares to return the borrowed ones and pockets the difference, thus making a profit. With naked short-selling, investors do not borrow the shares but seek to cover their positions after the sale.
 Under the new rules, short sellers and brokers must deliver borrowed shares three days after the transaction or face trading restrictions. The S.E.C. also eliminated an exception on restrictions for options market makers. And the S.E.C. made it clear that lying about the ability to deliver shares would be a fraud violation. 
 Congress is also getting in on the act. A House committee on Tuesday voted to overturn a ban on so-called seller-funded down payments for Federal Housing Administration mortgages, which was included in a just-passed housing law meant to protect taxpayers. 
 Under seller-funded down payments, a home seller covers the buyer's down payment with help from a charity, but typically adds that sum to the price of the house. Such deals are particularly attractive to lower-income buyers and sellers in depressed markets, according to Congressional officials. The F.H.A. supported the ban, blaming high default rates on some of its home loans on the program.

HEADLINE: Savoring the Day, But Eyeing the Clouds

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 Most of them come every Wednesday to the small lot next to City Hall, and there they were yesterday.
 The woman in the ''Tuskegee University Mom'' T-shirt was there. So were the Guatemalan women pushing strollers, the office workers carrying their gym bags from their workouts at lunch, the suburban women with plastic bags full of white sweet corn and plump red tomatoes and carrots as big as batons. Domenico Diglio was hawking his peppers, cucumbers and watermelons (a little too vociferously for most of the other vendors) from his stall at the rear of the lot. Joni Wengerd, the Mennonite farmer, drove the 200 miles from Mifflinburg, Pa. Mike Castaldo, wearing his ''Cheese Guy'' T-shirt, came up from the Bronx.
 There were fat cantaloupes; bins full of corn; the peach, cherry and strawberry-rhubarb pies baked by Mr. Wengerd's sister, Laura; and assorted semi-exotica: baby Dominican eggplant, purple peppers, red Kalle pears. It smelled of cilantro and basil and provolone, and, like everything else this week, the scene resided in the twilight zone between utter normalcy and vague dread. 
 ''What I think is that the boys on Wall Street went too deep with the knife for their own personal gain,'' said Mr. Castaldo, who sells cheese and sausage and Italian bread at what he calls his Italian Deli on the Road. ''They sliced too much off for themselves. They got greedy and overextended. It's like a rock that hits a windshield. Shhhhhhsss. It goes off in every direction.'' 
 His best hope, he says, is that maybe a downturn would lead more people to farmers' markets and simple pleasures like his ripe provolone and Italian sausage. 
 ''If they can save a dollar, they will,'' he said. ''I'm doing O.K. Not growing by leaps and bounds. Not going to order a BMW. But doing O.K.''
 It was not as if people chattered about the fed funds rate, the Lehman Brothers stock price or which derivatives caused particular problems for A.I.G. But still, like a faint smell of smoke from a distant fire, on a lovely clear September day, under the red, white and blue awnings and the fold-up tents, over the banana bread and the basil-spinach pesto, the small emblems of comfort and continuity, there it was.
 ''People are frightened,'' said Susan Boshi, a retiree from White Plains. ''I have one recent college graduate and another still in college, and you wonder what kind of a world we're leaving them. Who's going to ever pay off this massive debt we're dumping on the next generation? Will there be health care for them? How can they ever afford to buy a house? These are very frightening times.''
 Laura Schwartz, who heads the Child Abuse Prevention Center in White Plains, said she worried both about her family's finances and what a catastrophic economic downturn would mean to nonprofits like hers.
 The vendors at what's billed as the weekly International Market, some farmers, others selling $5 car pillows, Mexican and Peruvian soccer jerseys, organic toilet paper, and cosmetics, figured that, for the most part, there wasn't a lot they could do, so why worry about it.
 ''People still have to eat,'' Mr. Wengerd said. ''I usually think that you go over the mountain when it comes.'' 
 Daniel Chen, a native of Hong Kong who was selling Burmese jade jewelry, went back and forth as if balancing a scale. Yes, people would be hurt. But most would keep their jobs and go about their life. Yes, the situation on Wall Street looks catastrophic. But compare it with the war in Iraq, which drags on invisibly as we go about our lives.
 ''It's going to affect us, don't get me wrong,'' he said. ''But I think people will still look at something and say, 'Oh, I like that, I've got to put it on my credit card.' And they'll pull out that piece of plastic, even if that's part of what got us into this in the first place.''
 For others like Mr. Diglio, there was a harder edge. People, after all, have been struggling economically for years, he said. ''If we can bail out the big companies, how come we couldn't bail out the people who've been starving? Believe me, I'm very bitter about our government.''
 But then no one could predict how bad things would get, whether the economic center would hold, or what they would do. Shoppers stopped and started, lingering in the warm sun to soak it in. The fare was still the kind of bounty that Americans consider their birthright. Life on this splendid mid-September day was still more what we had come to know than what we were beginning to fear. It was still a place defined more by the blueberry bread, the red and yellow peppers, the easy banter of buyers and sellers that was tangible and real than by the inscrutable train wreck on Wall Street.
 ''Look at the size of that celery.''
 ''I've never seen a purple pepper.''
 ''Cheese. Yum.''
 ''Thanks. Have a good one.''
 ''See you next week.''

HEADLINE: Arizona: Employer Sanctions Upheld

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A federal appeals court upheld an Arizona law that penalizes businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants and requires them to verify the employment status of their workers. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected a challenge by business and Hispanic groups who contend that the law infringes on federal immigration powers. The law, intended to lessen the economic incentive for immigrants to sneak into the country, imposes civil penalties on employers by suspending or revoking their business licenses when they are found to have knowingly hired illegal immigrants. A lower court judge upheld the law in February, before it took effect.

HEADLINE: For Wall Street, Greed Wasn't Good Enough

BYLINE: By PAUL WILMOTT. 
Paul Wilmott is the founder of Wilmott, a journal of quantitative finance.

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
 I'M fairly risk-averse by nature and so have always ignored the offers from my bank to help me ''manage my money more successfully.'' Put the money in a savings account, earn a bit of interest, but mainly work hard, that's been my philosophy. Like everyone else, though, I've been looking into the small print lately to see just how safe my safe-as-houses account really is. 
 In Britain, the government will guarantee roughly the first $62,000 in a bank account. If you have more than this saved up then an obvious solution is to spread the money around several accounts. Fine in theory, but this rapidly becomes tedious if you want to protect the savings of a lifetime. So finally I succumbed to the calls from my bank manager. As of the middle of last week I have a man who will give me advice day or night, and crucially can help someone as conservative as me to not suffer while all hell breaks loose. 
 At our first meeting, one of the questions I raised was how to deal with the money I owe the tax man. Could he recommend a safe yet interest-bearing haven where I could keep the money until Her Majesty's Government asks for it? He proposed an insurance bond that will mature on the date I have to pay my taxes. Insurance bonds have the nice feature that 90 percent of your money is insured, with no cap, and so even in a disaster I would lose ''only'' 10 percent. This is how my first venture outside my comfort zone ended with me being invested in American International Group.
 When I hear about the potential collapse of A.I.G. shortly thereafter, I contacted my manager. ''We are in talks with A.I.G.,'' he tells me.
 ''I want out!'' I tell him. 
 Luckily for me, I'm within a cooling-off period in which I can get my money back, losing none of the principal. At least I think I am. I hope. I'll know more in the next couple of days. Even though A.I.G. has now apparently been rescued by the Federal Reserve and downgraded relatively little -- and even though I can theoretically lose only 10 percent, with the rest being insured -- I want to play it safe. 
 That last sentence contains quite a few important concepts that are all worth thinking about. First of all, ''the rest being insured ...'' Insured by whom, exactly? The main problem with the current crisis is not just that all financial institutions are now intertwined, but rather the new manner of this interlacing through their complex derivatives transactions. In the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund mess of 1998, the transactions were fairly transparent and with obvious counterparties. The cancer, if I may use that dramatic word, was contained and operable. (The long-term impact for me, as someone who researches and lectures on finance, is that I can tell some great tales about the fall to earth of Nobel laureates who tried to put their theories to work in the real world.)
 The current crisis, however, is nowhere near as simple. The cancer has metastasized -- it has spread through all the organs of the financial markets and a straightforward excision is probably not possible. That's what makes the question of whether to rescue each institution such a difficult one. Sure, people have to learn a lesson. But, and this is my final surgical analogy, would that be cutting off one's nose to spite one's face? 
 Back to my money with A.I.G., I ask myself, ''Who insures the insurers?'' I want out.
 I mentioned ''downgrading.'' Institutions and products are graded by various credit-rating firms so as to supposedly give an objective view of the risks and of the possibilities of default. Can anyone say, while keeping a straight face, that the current system of having the institutions themselves pay for this service is a good idea? The moral hazard is so obvious you can almost taste it. 
 I spend a great deal of time speaking to people in banks about their mathematical models. I know which are using good models (a very few banks) and which are using bad models (most banks). I know of the dangers present, from a quantitative-finance and risk-management perspective. And for many years I have explained these dangers to anyone who would listen, and I will continue to do so. So it is incredible to think that ratings agencies, which must also have detailed knowledge of the nature and, more important, size of the toxic transactions, will happily give out their multiple A grades without any feeling of shame. 
 And then the word ''theoretically'' becomes very important. I have attended many conferences on quantitative finance, at which professors and practitioners describe their latest models for derivative instruments and the like. All the time I'm sitting in the audience thinking that these models are far too simplistic and based on countless unrealistic assumptions. I tell people that these instruments are dangerous, that no one understands the risks. But no one cares.
 As long as people are compensated hugely for taking risks with other people's money, and do not suffer equally on the downside, then those risks will inevitably become outrageous. Whether markets are efficient or not I don't know for sure, but I do know that if there's a way for someone to make money at another's expense, he will. In spades. I want out. 
 So where next? And, most important, what should be done? 
 I've taken to comparing the current situation to ''Hamlet.'' We've had the deaths of Polonius, Claudius and Laertes -- that is, the falling house prices, the rising commodity prices and the collapse of banks. As of now there is no sign of Hamlet himself, a catastrophic fall in the markets. Yet it's difficult to believe that markets are not going to undergo a climactic implosion some time soon. If the current situation doesn't fill investors with fear, then what are they smoking?
 I believe that to get to the root of the matter, we have to address the bad side of greed. We know from Ivan Boesky and Gordon Gecko that greed can be good. Greed makes the world go around; it makes people take risks that ultimately lead to economic or scientific advances. But the greedy must also face the consequences of taking those risks. 
 Thus the current system of compensation at financial companies does not lead to anything good at all. If you give $10 million to random people on the street and tell them that they'll get 20 percent of any profit they make, without any consequences if they lose it, then many of them will go into the nearest casino and bet it all on red. (The really clever ones will find a way to leverage it up first -- after all, a $2 million bonus is nothing; you can't seriously expect people to live in New York or London on less than eight figures, can you?) 
 Many Lehman Brothers employees received some of their compensation in Lehman shares. They aren't feeling too happy right now. But a system run on that principle could achieve exactly what is needed: a closer link between a person's paycheck and the longer-term success of his trading. At the moment, a trader can sell a 10-year toxic contract, pocket a nice bonus after a few months based on some theoretical valuation, and then disappear to another bank or off into the sunset, leaving nine years in which that contract could blow up. 
 These companies need to tie compensation to long- rather than short-term performance. This won't be popular on Wall Street, but if we want to turn investment banking back to performing something useful and positive rather than some sort of riverboat-gambling scheme on which we are all unwitting participants,then there's not much choice.
 Meanwhile, I will be in contact with my new best friend, the bank manager, day and night. I will be closely monitoring every twitch of A.I.G.'s share price, balance sheet and credit rating. And I'll just hope that if all does not end well, Her Majesty's Government is understanding of this loyal, faithful and increasingly risk-averse subject.

HEADLINE: Russia Halts Stock Trading as Indexes Decline

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
In the last several years, the Russian stock market has muscled its way onto the global financial stage in a remarkable oil-driven boom that has also enhanced Russia's political influence. Now, at a time when the Kremlin is asserting its might abroad, all that is drawing to a close.
 Russian financial regulators halted stock trading for the second time this week on Wednesday in a move that immediately stirred memories of Russia's traumatic financial crisis in 1998. The Micex index was down 3.09 percent by 12:10 p.m. on Wednesday, when regulators halted trading. The other main index, RTS, was down 6.39 percent when trading was stopped. 
 Half of the value of the Russian market has evaporated since May on declining oil prices and the violence in Georgia, although much of the recent decline was hastened as the collapse of Lehman Brothers this week made already jittery investors more fearful of taking on risk.
 Dedicated hedge funds from New York to London to Stockholm focused on the Russian market as oil prices rose to records, enriching a generation of investors. But its sharp fall is a reminder that it has remained, in many ways, a wobbly emerging market. 
 In the last three days, the main stock index slid more than 25 percent, as the collapse of Lehman and the rescue of the American International Group prompted a flight from such investments. 
 The finance minister, Aleksei Kudrin, on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of pledging $44 billion in federal funds for three state-controlled banks to jump-start a rebound and halt a spiral of margin-call selling. Reserve requirements for commercial banks were also reduced sharply to encourage billions of dollars to circulate more freely in the financial sector. 
 ''Russia has the reputation of being one of the most trust-challenged places to do business in the world to start with,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard. The war heightened those concerns, he said. ''Rightly or wrongly, the conflict with Georgia was viewed as a retreat from connections with global markets and global standards.''
 American officials seized on to the precipitous slide in Russian markets as evidence that investors had grown disenchanted with Russia after it began a military incursion into Georgia on Aug. 8. 
 ''Capital is fleeing Russia, with $7 billion leaving on Aug. 8 alone,'' William J. Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs, told a Senate hearing, according to Reuters. ''Russia and the Russian people are paying a considerable price for their country's disproportionate military action,'' he said. 
 Russian state television showed an image that could sum up the broader disaffection with emerging markets: a once-bustling trading floor in Moscow, all but deserted Wednesday, its screens blank, while one trader sat fiddling idly with a computer mouse.
 Russian regulators have so far hewed to orthodox economic stimulus policies, in spite of calls last week for the government to invest the nation's primary sovereign wealth fund in domestic stocks to raise prices. Their response so far, which rests on conventional support for the banking system, suggests that Mr. Kudrin and other economic liberals in the Russian government have won the policy debate on how to respond to the crisis, at least for now.
 But the problems in Russia run deep, and Mr. Kudrin cautioned against expecting a quick recovery. ''Rebuilding will take some time,'' he said.
 Russian stocks have fallen faster than would be justified by dropping oil prices or in response to financial turmoil in the United States, economists say. Part of the reason is that Russia is spending more on its military. On Tuesday, Vladimir V. Putin, the former president and now the prime minister, said 2.4 trillion rubles ($94.4 billion), would go to the military in the 2009 budget.
 The average price-to-earnings ratio -- the most widely used method of valuing stocks, was 4 for Russian stocks Wednesday, far lower than the ratio of 10 found on average in developed markets, according to Steven Dashevsky, chief analyst of Aton, a brokerage firm in Moscow. 
 Surgutneftegaz, one of the largest companies in Russia, was trading Wednesday at just over the value of the cash in its bank account, meaning investors valued its vast oil fields, its thousands of employees and other assets as nearly worthless under its current Russian management.

HEADLINE: A New Role for the Fed: Investor of Last Resort

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The mighty Federal Reserve is being stretched to its limits, both in the range of problems it is being asked to fix and in its financial firepower.
 The central bank has also transformed itself almost overnight into the Fed Inc. by essentially taking over American International Group after already taking on hundreds of billions of dollars in mortgage securities to help ailing financial institutions.
 Instead of just setting monetary policy in its Ivory Tower-like setting, the Fed now must wear several hats -- that of insurance conglomerate, investment banker and even hedge fund manager. 
 ''This is unique, and the Fed has never done something like this before,'' said Allan Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie-Mellon University and author of a sweeping history of the Federal Reserve. ''If you go all the way back to 1921, when farms were failing and Congress was leaning on the Fed to bail them out, the Fed always said 'It's not our business.' It never regarded itself as an all-purpose agency.'' 
 The Fed has often been described as the nation's lender of last resort -- the one institution that would lend money when everything else had failed. But by acquiring almost 80 percent of A.I.G. in exchange for lending it $85 billion, and holding $29 billion in securities once owned by Bear Stearns, the Fed is now becoming the investor of last resort as well.
 That could put the central bank in an increasingly complicated and contradictory position. It will be responsible for stabilizing the financial system, but also for minimizing losses to taxpayers. Those responsibilities are likely to conflict even more than the traditional tension between the Fed's dual mandate to keep inflation low and promote full employment.
 The Fed's balance sheet, moreover, is being stretched in ways that seemed unimaginable one year ago. As recently as last summer, the central bank's entire vault of reserves -- about $800 billion at the time -- was in Treasury securities.
 By last week, the Fed's holdings of unencumbered Treasuries had dwindled to just over $300 billion. Much of the rest of its assets were in the form of loans to banks and investment banks, which had pledged riskier securities as collateral.
 In a sign of how short the Fed's available reserves had become, the Treasury Department sold tens of billions of dollars of special ''supplementary'' Treasury bills on Wednesday to provide the Fed with extra cash. The Treasury sold $40 billion of the new securities on Wednesday morning and will sell $60 billion more on Thursday. More money-raising is sure to follow. 
 ''The Fed is very stretched, and that's why they've asked the Treasury to go ahead with these proposals,'' said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP and a longtime analyst of the Fed's market operations. ''You don't want the market wondering whether the Fed has enough reserves to handle the next supplicant.''
 Indeed, the role of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, almost seemed to unnerve a leading House Democrat.
 ''He can make any loan he wants under any terms to any entity or individual in America that he thinks is economically justified,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
 ''I asked the chairman if he had $85 billion to bestow in this way. He said 'I have $800 billion.' ''
 ''No one in a democracy unelected should have $800 billion to dispense as he sees fit,'' Mr. Frank said.
 Fed officials contend that they have ample resources to handle all their new obligations. Unlike a company or a household, the Fed can raise as much cash as it wants by printing money and buying up Treasuries and other securities at will.
 But in the last few months, the central bank has transformed itself from a regulator of the money supply to a white knight for troubled financial institutions. 
 The first step across the Rubicon occurred last March, when the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department prevented the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns by engineering its shotgun marriage to JPMorgan Chase.
 To make the deal work, the Fed agreed to hold and manage a huge pool of hard-to-sell securities from Bear Stearns as the collateral for a $29 billion loan to JPMorgan. The Fed has disclosed little about the securities it is holding, but the pool is believed to include billions of dollars worth of securities backed by troubled subprime mortgages.
 At the time, Fed officials hired the money-management firm BlackRock Inc. to oversee the Bear Stearns pool, which appears as ''Maiden Lane L.L.C.'' on the Fed's balance sheet. But while Fed officials said their goal was to ''maximize returns'' on those assets, officials appear to have made no changes in the portfolio yet.
 But the Maiden Lane portfolio will be small potatoes compared to the businesses owned by A.I.G. 
 The failed insurance conglomerate held countless billions of dollars in credit-default swaps, which are insurance contracts that protect bond holders from losses if a company defaults on its loans. It also holds vast amounts of real estate, which could have a depressing impact on property prices if the company's new overseers decided to unload quickly.
 Fed officials said on Tuesday that they did not plan to manage the A.I.G. holdings themselves. Instead, the Fed has a claim on just under 80 percent of the equity in A.I.G. as collateral to cover loans on which A.I.G. will have to pay a steep interest rate of about 12 percent.
 Fed officials appear to be hoping that the high rate will encourage the company to pay off its loans as quickly as possible. But if the company's new executive cannot fix its problems quickly, Fed officials might need to get more directly involved. That could make them tantamount to real estate investors and hedge fund managers at the same time.
 Beyond its foray into corporate management with A.I.G., the Federal Reserve is becoming an increasingly important force in the market for risky debt securities.
 Analysts say they believe that Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm that filed for bankruptcy on Monday, is borrowing tens of billions of dollars through the Fed's six-month-old emergency loan program for big investment banks. 
 For months now, investment banks have shunned the Fed's lending program because they feared being perceived as weak. But Mr. Crandall, of Wrightson ICAP, predicted that Lehman and other investment banks might have already tapped it for $50 billion since last weekend.
 If they did, Fed officials will be holding collateral that is even riskier than what they already have.

HEADLINE: Dealing With Mr. Mugabe

 BODY:
There are so many reasons not to trust Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's dictatorial president. But the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai -- the man who would have won the presidency in a fair election -- has decided to take a chance by agreeing this week to a vaguely defined power-sharing agreement. 
 With luck, and continued international pressure, the agreement could be the start of an extended transition to democracy and economic revival for Zimbabwe's brutalized citizens. That is, undoubtedly, why Mr. Tsvangirai accepted it, despite Mr. Mugabe's history of bad faith.
 Washington and the European Union are right to keep their sanctions in place until it becomes clearer whether this agreement can produce real change or is just another devious maneuver. 
 Mr. Tsvangirai told a radio interviewer on Wednesday that he was ''quite certain'' about his rival's commitment to the deal. We are less certain, especially after an aide to Mr. Mugabe announced that certain aspects of the agreement would not go into effect until next month.
 In a democratic Zimbabwe, or in an Africa that insisted on respect for democratic elections, Mr. Tsvangirai would be president and Mr. Mugabe would be gone. Instead, Mr. Mugabe will remain president, with Mr. Tsvangirai becoming prime minister. 
 Mr. Mugabe's party will hold 15 ministries, Mr. Tsvangirai's 13, and a splinter opposition party 3. The deal is very precise on these numbers, but not on how the powers of the president and the prime minister will be apportioned. Both will exercise ''executive power.'' 
 The crucial question is how much power Mr. Mugabe will retain to intimidate opponents and veto economic reforms. The deal affirms the principles of free speech and multiparty democracy, but it also appears to declare Mr. Mugabe's disastrous land reform untouchable. Some reports say that Mr. Mugabe will keep control over the army, while Mr. Tsvangirai will control the police. The army must be kept out of domestic politics. 
 With its rich agricultural land and abundant mineral resources, Zimbabwe should be thriving. Instead, Mr. Mugabe has turned it into a land of famine and desperation, with an annual inflation rate estimated to be 11 million percent. These man-made disasters cannot be reversed overnight and without substantial help.
 The United States, Europe and others should be getting ready to provide technical support and aid. But first, they must make sure that this agreement is real and not just another trick by Mr. Mugabe to stay in power.

HEADLINE: U.S. Court, a Longtime Beacon, Is Now Guiding Fewer Nations

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK; Tom Torok and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Judges around the world have long looked to the decisions of the United States Supreme Court for guidance, citing and often following them in hundreds of their own rulings since the Second World War. 
 But now American legal influence is waning. Even as a debate continues in the court over whether its decisions should ever cite foreign law, a diminishing number of foreign courts seem to pay attention to the writings of American justices.
 ''One of our great exports used to be constitutional law,'' said Anne-Marie Slaughter, the dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. ''We are losing one of the greatest bully pulpits we have ever had.''
 From 1990 through 2002, for instance, the Canadian Supreme Court cited decisions of the United States Supreme Court about a dozen times a year, an analysis by The New York Times found. In the six years since, the annual citation rate has fallen by half, to about six. 
 Australian state supreme courts cited American decisions 208 times in 1995, according to a recent study by Russell Smyth, an Australian economist. By 2005, the number had fallen to 72.
 The story is similar around the globe, legal experts say, particularly in cases involving human rights. These days, foreign courts in developed democracies often cite the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in cases concerning equality, liberty and prohibitions against cruel treatment, said Harold Hongju Koh, the dean of the Yale Law School. In those areas, Dean Koh said, ''they tend not to look to the rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court.''
 The rise of new and sophisticated constitutional courts elsewhere is one reason for the Supreme Court's fading influence, legal experts said. The new courts are, moreover, generally more liberal than the Rehnquist and Roberts courts and for that reason more inclined to cite one another.
 Another reason is the diminished reputation of the United States in some parts of the world, which experts here and abroad said is in part a consequence of the Bush administration's unpopularity around the world. Foreign courts are less apt to justify their decisions with citations to cases from a nation unpopular with their domestic audience.
 ''It's not surprising, given our foreign policy in the last decade or so, that American influence should be declining,'' said Thomas Ginsburg, who teaches comparative and international law at the University of Chicago.
 Aversion to Foreign Law
 The adamant opposition of some Supreme Court justices to the citation of foreign law in their own opinions also plays a role, some foreign judges say.
 ''Most justices of the United States Supreme Court do not cite foreign case law in their judgments,'' Aharon Barak, then the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Israel, wrote in the Harvard Law Review in 2002. ''They fail to make use of an important source of inspiration, one that enriches legal thinking, makes law more creative, and strengthens the democratic ties and foundations of different legal systems.''
 Partly as a consequence, Chief Justice Barak wrote, the United States Supreme Court ''is losing the central role it once had among courts in modern democracies.''
 Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court of Australia said that his court no longer confined itself to considering English, Canadian and American law. ''Now we will take information from the Supreme Court of India, or the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, or the Constitutional Court of South Africa,'' he said in an interview published in 2001 in The Green Bag, a legal journal. ''America'' he added, ''is in danger of becoming something of a legal backwater.''
 The signature innovations of the American legal system -- a written Constitution, a Bill of Rights protecting individual freedoms and an independent judiciary with the power to strike down legislation -- have been consciously emulated in much of the world. And American constitutional law has been cited and discussed in countless decisions of courts in Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere.
 In a 1996 decision striking down a law that made it a crime to possess pornography, for instance, the Constitutional Court of South Africa conducted a broad survey of American First Amendment jurisprudence, citing some 40 decisions of the United States Supreme Court. That same year, the High Court of Australia followed a 1989 decision of the Supreme Court in a separation-of-powers case, ruling that a judge was permitted to prepare a report for a government minister about threats to aboriginal areas because the assignment did not undermine the integrity of the judicial branch.
 Sending American ideas about the rule of law abroad has long been a source of pride. ''The United States Supreme Court is the oldest constitutional court in the world -- the most respected, the most legitimate,'' said Charles Fried, a law professor at Harvard who served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration.
 But there is an intense and growing debate about whether that influence should be a one-way street.
 Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a speech before her retirement from the Supreme Court, advocated taking as well as giving.
 ''I suspect that with time we will rely increasingly on international and foreign law in resolving what now appear to be domestic issues,'' Justice O'Connor said. ''Doing so may not only enrich our own country's decisions; it will create that all-important good impression. When U.S. courts are seen to be cognizant of other judicial systems, our ability to act as a rule-of-law model for other nations will be enhanced.''
 But many judges and legal scholars in this country say that consideration of foreign legal precedents in American judicial decisions is illegitimate, and that there can be no transnational dialogue about the meaning of the United States Constitution.
 The Constitution should be interpreted according to its original meaning, said John O. McGinnis, a law professor at Northwestern, and recent rulings, whether foreign or domestic, cannot aid in that enterprise. Moreover, Professor McGinnis said, decisions applying foreign law to foreign circumstances are not instructive here. 
 ''It may be good in their nation,'' he said. ''There is no reason to believe necessarily that it's good in our nation.''
 In any event, said Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, many Americans are deeply suspicious of foreign law.
 ''We are used to encouraging other countries to adopt American constitutional norms,'' he wrote in an essay last month, ''but we have never accepted the idea that we should adopt theirs.''
 ''It's American exceptionalism,'' Professor Posner added in an interview. ''The view going back 200 years is that we've figured it out and people should follow our lead.''
 Fiery Debate
 Yet citations to foreign and international law in recent Supreme Court decisions ignited an enormous furor in Congress and in the popular consciousness. 
 ''The opinion of the world community,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority in Roper v. Simmons, the 2005 decision that struck down the death penalty for juvenile offenders, ''while not controlling our outcome, does provide respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions.'' Justice Kennedy cited, among other things, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the Criminal Justice Act from the United Kingdom.
 In Lawrence v. Texas, the 2003 decision striking down a Texas law making homosexual sex a crime, Justice Kennedy cited three decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, noting that homosexual conduct was accepted as ''an integral part of human freedom'' in many countries.
 Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting in Roper v. Simmons, fired back. ''The basic premise of the court's argument -- that American law should conform to the laws of the rest of the world -- ought to be rejected out of hand,'' he wrote. 
 The issue has rankled Justice Kennedy. ''There's kind of a know-nothing quality to the debate, it seems to me, of being suspicious of foreign things,'' he said in remarks at a judicial conference in July. 
 At their confirmation hearings, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. indicated that they were opposed to the citation of foreign law in constitutional cases. Chief Justice Roberts noted that foreign judges were not accountable to the American people and said that allowing the use of foreign precedent expanded judicial discretion.
 ''Foreign law, you can find anything you want,'' Chief Justice Roberts said. ''Looking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends.''
 The controversy over the citation of foreign law in American courts is freighted with misconceptions. One is that the practice is somehow new or unusual. The other is that to cite such a decision is to be bound by it.
 Even conservative scholars acknowledge that American judges have long cited decisions by foreign courts in their rulings. ''The Supreme Court has been doing it for basically all of our history, and with some degree of gusto,'' said Steven G. Calabresi, a law professor at Northwestern and a founder of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. Professor Calabresi said he generally opposed the citation of foreign law in constitutional cases.
 Judicial citation or discussion of a foreign ruling does not, moreover, convert it into binding precedent. 
 Chief Justice John Marshall, sitting as a circuit court judge, discussed the question in 1811. ''It has been said that the decisions of British courts, made since the Revolution, are not authority in this country,'' he said. ''I admit it -- but they are entitled to that respect which is due to the opinions of wise men who have maturely studied the subject they decide.''
 Indeed, American judges cite all sorts of things in their decisions -- law review articles, song lyrics, television programs. State supreme courts cite decisions from other states, though a decision from Wisconsin is no more binding in Oregon than is one from Italy.
 ''Foreign opinions are not authoritative; they set no binding precedent for the U.S. judge,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a 2006 address to the Constitutional Court of South Africa. ''But they can add to the story of knowledge relevant to the solution of trying questions.''
 But Professor Fried said the area was a minefield. ''Courts have been citing foreign law forever, but sparingly, for very good reason,'' he said. ''It is an invitation to bolster conclusions reached on other grounds. It leads to more impressionistic, undisciplined adjudication.''
 The trend abroad, moreover, is toward decisions of a distinctly liberal sort in areas like the death penalty and gay rights. ''What we have had in the last 20 or 30 years,'' Professor Fried said, ''is an enormous coup d'etat on the part of judiciaries everywhere -- the European Court of Human Rights, Canada, South Africa, Israel.'' In terms of judicial activism, he said, ''they've lapped us.''
 American Foundations
 The rightward shift of the Supreme Court may partly account for its diminished influence. Twenty years ago, said Anthony Lester, a British barrister, the landmark decisions of the court were ''studied with as much attention in New Delhi or Strasbourg as they are in Washington, D.C.''
 That is partly because the foundational legal documents of many of the world's leading democracies are of quite recent vintage. The Indian Constitution was adopted in 1949, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, the New Zealand Bill of Rights in 1990 and the South African Constitution in 1996. All drew on American constitutional principles.
 Particularly at first, courts in those nations relied on the constitutional jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, both because it was relevant and because it was the essentially the only game in town. But as constitutional courts around the world developed their own bodies of precedent and started an international judicial conversation, American influence has dropped.
 Judge Guido Calabresi of the federal appeals court in New York, a former dean of Yale Law School, has advocated continued participation in that international judicial conversation.
 ''Since World War II, many countries have adopted forms of judicial review, which -- though different from ours in many particulars -- unmistakably draw their origin and inspiration from American constitutional theory and practice,'' he wrote in a 1995 concurrence that cited the German and Italian constitutional courts. 
 ''These countries are our 'constitutional offspring,' '' Judge Calabresi wrote, ''and how they have dealt with problems analogous to ours can be very useful to us when we face difficult constitutional issues. Wise parents do not hesitate to learn from their children.'' (Judge Calabresi is Professor Calabresi's uncle.)
 The openness of some legal systems to foreign law is reflected in their constitutions. The South African Constitution, for instance, says that courts interpreting its bill of rights ''must consider international law'' and ''may consider foreign law.'' The constitutions of India and Spain have similar provisions.
 Many legal scholars singled out the Canadian Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court of South Africa as increasingly influential. 
 ''In part, their influence may spring from the simple fact they are not American,'' Dean Slaughter wrote in a 2005 essay, ''which renders their reasoning more politically palatable to domestic audience in an era of extraordinary U.S. military, political, economic and cultural power and accompanying resentments.''
 Frederick Schauer, a law professor at the University of Virginia, wrote in a 2000 essay that the Canadian Supreme Court had been particularly influential because ''Canada, unlike the United States, is seen as reflecting an emerging international consensus rather than existing as an outlier.''
 In New Zealand, for instance, Canadian decisions were cited far more often than those of any other nation from 1990 to 2006 in civil rights cases, according to a recent study in The Otago Law Review in Dunedin, New Zealand. 
 ''As Canada's judges are, by most accounts, the most judicially activist in the common-law world -- the most willing to second-guess the decisions of the elected legislatures -- reliance on Canadian precedents will worry some and delight others,'' the study's authors wrote. 
 American precedents were cited about half as often as Canadian ones. ''It is surprising,'' the authors wrote, ''that American cases are not cited more often, since the United States Bill of Rights precedents can be found on just about any rights issue that comes up.''
 American popular attitudes toward the citation of foreign law, by contrast, Mark C. Rahdert wrote in the American University Law Review last year, ''tap into a longstanding tradition of exceptionalism.'' 
 That tradition is rooted in a popular devotion to the Constitution unknown in the rest of the world. It is supported by aspects of the American character that were formed by the nation's initial geographic isolation and pioneer spirit, which emphasized freedom, private property and individual responsibility. That has led, for instance, to a near-absolute commitment to free speech and a particularly tough approach to crime.
 In '' 'A Shining City on a Hill': American Exceptionalism and the Supreme Court's Practice of Relying on Foreign Law,'' a 2006 article in the Boston University Law Review, Professor Calabresi concluded that the Supreme Court should be wary of citing foreign law in most constitutional cases precisely because the United States is exceptional. 
 ''Like it or not,'' he wrote, ''Americans really are a special people with a special ideology that sets us apart from all the other peoples.''

HEADLINE: A House Marked by 9 Years of Local Financial Change Now Falls Into British Hands

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
For a vivid perspective on the fall and rise and fall of Wall Street during the last nine years, few places in Manhattan could be more revealing than the incandescent office tower at 745 Seventh Avenue.
 Until this week, that 32-story structure, whose lower floor exteriors are wrapped in video screens, has been the world headquarters of the Lehman Brothers investment bank. Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, bought the building in a hurry during the last period of severe dislocation in New York's financial markets, the days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and rushed right into it.
 On Wednesday, Barclays Capital, a London-based firm, announced that it would acquire the building as part of a deal to buy Lehman's main securities-trading operations for about $1.75 billion. Those businesses employ about 10,000 people, most of whom work at 745 Seventh Avenue and most of whom are expected to stay on with Barclays, said people who had been briefed on the company's plans. 
 Though it appears to be an after-the-fall bargain, Barclays' purchase was greeted by city officials and business leaders as an illustration of the resilience of New York's economy. Barclays may have saved thousands of jobs and kept a building worth at least $750 million from being emptied out and dumped onto a softening market for office space, they said. 
 ''Barclays has had a rather modest presence here, so this is a big new commitment to New York,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City. ''Given the role that many of our New York-based firms have played in building London's presence in the world's financial markets, it seems like a good quid pro quo.''
 The transaction also highlights what a tumultuous period the last decade has been for New York and for the financial sector, which has been the main engine of its economy.
 The building Barclays is buying -- pending approval from the federal bankruptcy court -- was originally meant for another financial giant, Morgan Stanley. Having financed some of the biggest successes of the tech-stock boom of the 1990s, like Netscape, Morgan Stanley was thriving and expanding beyond the capacity of its headquarters in Times Square.
 In 1999, it began constructing the building a few blocks away on Seventh Avenue at 49th Street, a million-square-foot tower of granite, steel and glass with open floors designed to accommodate trading desks. Not long after the frame was completed and the 15,000 square feet of video screens were installed, terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center and awakened corporate executives to the hazards of having their operations concentrated on an island.
 The core of Lehman's American operations was housed across the street from the trade center in a building that was damaged and could not be reoccupied for months. Lehman executives began searching for a new home just when Morgan Stanley executives started rethinking the idea of filling two high-rises a few blocks apart in Midtown. (Morgan Stanley, which later bought a campus in Westchester, was reported to be considering an offer on Wednesday to sell itself to Wachovia, a banking company based in North Carolina.)
 Four weeks after the terrorist attack, Lehman arranged to buy the unfinished building for about $700 million and soon became the first major financial firm to abandon Lower Manhattan after 9/11. The pace of fitting out the interior of the building was accelerated to reunite Lehman's employees, who had scattered to temporary quarters around the region, and Morgan Stanley's ambitious plans for using the video screens were scrapped.
 Rather than selling space on the signs for the sort of consumer advertising that lights up Times Square, executives at Morgan Stanley had considered using the screens to illustrate the constant flow of commerce with live images, according to Peter Frankfurt, the creative director at Imaginary Forces, the company that designed and programmed the screens for the building before Morgan Stanley sold it.
 ''They realized it could become a great brand opportunity for Morgan Stanley,'' Mr. Frankfurt said. ''The sign could actually play an almost organic role in terms of reflecting activity in the markets'' -- markets of all kinds, from the stock exchange in Hong Kong to local supermarkets.
 Lehman shelved that plan and opted for montages of crashing waves and rippling fields of wheat punctuated frequently with the firm's name. ''They took a super-basic approach: This is a motion billboard that's not live,'' Mr. Frankfurt said, not bothering to hide his disappointment.
 Mr. Frankfurt said he thought it was ironic that the screens became the symbol of Lehman's demise this week when they served as the 24-hour-a-day backdrop for televised reports from around the world. He said he did not know what Barclays would do with the building or the screens, but he said they could be effective tools in building the company's image in New York.
 ''It's basically a very cool canvas from which to broadcast and communicate any number of their messages,'' Mr. Frankfurt said. ''You can use that screen very articulately to describe yourself. Or they could just do what Lehman did, but look what happened to Lehman.''
 A spokesman for Barclays Capital, Seth Martin, declined to say whether the company would make the building its American headquarters or to comment about how it might use the screens. Barclays Capital has about 4,000 employees in the United States, many of them in offices on several floors of the MetLife building above Grand Central Terminal.
 Barclays has agreed to pay $40 million for the naming rights to the arena planned for Brooklyn that is supposed to be the next home of the New Jersey Nets basketball team. It would be called the Barclays Center. But long before the arena is built, there could be another Barclays center a couple of blocks north of Times Square.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 19, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Thursday about an announcement by Barclays Capital that it would purchase Lehman Brothers's headquarters in Manhattan as part of a deal to buy Lehman's main securities-trading operations misstated the sum that Barclays has agreed to pay for the naming rights to the New Jersey Nets basketball arena planned in Brooklyn. It is $400 million, not $40 million.

HEADLINE: Asia Rethinks America

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Tremors from Wall Street are rattling Asian confidence, leading many investors to question the wisdom of being invested in the United States to the tune of trillions of dollars. 
 Asian investors were starting to show hesitation even before the financial earthquake of the last week. Now, a wariness toward the United States is setting in that is unprecedented in recent memory, reaching from central banks to industrial corporations, from hedge funds to the individuals who lined up here to withdraw money from the American International Group on Wednesday.
 Asia's savings have, in essence, bankrolled American spending for decades, and an Asian loss of confidence in American financial institutions and assets would have dire consequences for both the United States government and American taxpayers.
 The potential for panic is stoked by Asian news organizations, which tend to focus more on business and economics than on politics, which can be touchy here. Their coverage has been obsessive and unrelentingly negative about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch's rush to find a buyer and the turmoil at A.I.G. 
 The nonstop deluge of bad publicity for American investments seems to be seeping into the consciousnesses of the rich and middle class across Asia.
 ''I do not believe in U.S. financial institutions anymore; I don't think any U.S. bank is safe anymore,'' said Wang Xiao-ning, a Hong Kong homemaker. Even after the Federal Reserve had taken control of A.I.G., she waited in line with dozens of other anxious policyholders at one of the insurer's customer service centers for the chance to close her investment account.
 The asset management operations of American banks have steered many Asian investors into American securities for years. But Thomas Lam, the senior treasury economist at United Overseas Bank in Singapore, said many of these investors had not fully understood what they were buying. They became more curious and more concerned when, for example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship.
 ''All these top executives, Indonesians and others, started asking, 'What do they really do?' '' Mr. Lam said. ''They bought because the next company did.''
 Some experts say that with Asia's phenomenal economic growth, savings are piling up so quickly that those funds will inevitably start flowing again to the United States at a fast clip. (The Chinese economy grew 23 percent in dollar terms last year.)
 ''The interest for the moment is depressed, but the trend is, we have a lot of savings in Asia and this is a bargain time'' for assets in the United States, said Paul Tang, the chief economist at the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong.
 For now, though, Asian interest in American assets is wilting, a trend that seems to have started over the summer.
 Little-noticed data released by the Treasury Department on Tuesday showed that a sharp shift in international capital movements began in July. Private investors pulled a net $92.9 billion out of the United States, after putting $46.8 billion into American securities in June.
 Many investors in Asia think that Asian economies will bounce back from the current global economic downturn faster than the American economy, said Henry Lee, the managing director of the Hendale Group, a well-known Hong Kong investment advisory firm. So they are putting their money in Asian companies.
 ''When the dust settles, I think Asia will come out ahead of the U.S.,'' he said.
 Central banks, mainly Asian, did continue buying American securities in July. But they did so at a slower pace than usual. They made net purchases of $18.2 billion, compared with an average monthly purchase of $22.3 billion in the first half of this year, according to the latest Treasury data.
 The central banks also changed the allocation of their purchases. They bought short-term Treasury bills while slowing their purchases of longer term Treasury bonds and American corporate bonds. And they abruptly switched from being large buyers of bonds from government-sponsored enterprises, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to becoming net sellers -- one of many factors that contributed to the Bush administration's decision to put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.
 If cash is king during the current global financial crisis, then Asian governments and financial institutions are emperors. China's central bank alone has $1.8 trillion in foreign reserves. Those reserves grew $280.6 billion in the first half of this year -- a pace of $64 million an hour.
 Americans have a huge stake in what China does with that money. Foreign cash coming into the United States to buy American assets holds down interest rates by making plenty of money available for the federal government to borrow to cover its budget deficit, and for consumers to borrow so that they can afford imported cars, DVD players and other goods.
 Commerce Department data released on Wednesday showed that the nation's current-account deficit, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, had a deficit of $183.1 billion in the second quarter.
 Changing Asian sentiments have not yet eroded the value of the dollar -- although market reaction to the A.I.G. bailout seemed to be doing that Wednesday. Asian skittishness has coincided with heavy selling by Americans of their holdings of stocks and bonds in foreign markets. 
 ''It's almost a case of everyone bringing money back home,'' Americans and Asians, said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Royal Bank of Scotland.
 But the withdrawal of money from the United States in July was the largest since August of last year, when the subprime housing crisis and resulting credit squeeze first started to seize global markets. Back then, private investors pulled out $140 billion from the United States and central banks withdrew $22 billion.
 Mr. Simpfendorfer and other economists cautioned that if the July pattern endured, it could quickly become a problem for the United States. Surprisingly, so far, China's central bank has actually emerged as a big winner from the American turmoil. Its bond holdings of government-sponsored enterprises, estimated by credit rating agencies at $340 billion, rose in value by billions of dollars in a single day when the Bush administration made explicit the government guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds, causing their interest rate spreads compared with Treasury bonds to narrow by 5 to 35 basis points within hours.
 The exact amount of China's gain cannot be calculated without knowing the maturity and composition of its holdings of these bonds, which Chinese officials have not released, according to specialists in fixed-income securities.
 Beijing officials regulate international capital flows so tightly that the central bank dominates China's overseas investments. It holds more than 90 percent of all Chinese-owned bonds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example.
 ''The average person on the street in China has no channel to invest in the U.S.,'' said Jing Ulrich, the chairwoman of China equities at JPMorgan.
 But most private investors elsewhere in the region have considerably more freedom to park their assets in whatever country they please, Mr. Lee, of the Hendale Group, said, and they are very interested these days in assets in Asia.

HEADLINE: Pell Grants Said to Face A Shortfall Of $6 Billion

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON and TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Battered by a worsening economy, college students are seeking federal financial aid in record numbers this year, leading Bush administration officials to warn Congress that the most important federal aid program, Pell Grants, may need up to $6 billion in additional taxpayer funds next year. 
 Driving the increased applications for federal aid, in part, have been nontraditional students returning to school to improve their job skills during the economic downturn, said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president for public affairs at the American Council on Education, which represents colleges and universities. 
 Estimates by the Department of Education suggest that the new president will face an unusually burdensome financing shortfall or the fallout that would accompany trimming the nation's leading college aid program.
 ''There are a lot of things going on -- more people are applying for student aid, more people are going to college, more people who qualify for the aid are showing up at school,'' said Thomas P. Skelly, the Department of Education's director of budget service, who wrote a memorandum detailing the problem to Congress. 
 As of July 31, 800,000 more students had applied for grants than on that date last year, according to the memorandum, which called the increase one of the largest ever year to year. 
 This year, more than six million low-income college students will receive Pell Grants ranging from $431 to $4,731, federal officials said.
 Congress appropriated $14 billion for the grants for the current fiscal year, but because of the increase and because of accumulated shortfalls from previous years, lawmakers will need to add $6 billion in new funds next year or cut the size of the grants, Department of Education officials said.
 ''There may need to be an announcement in February 2009,'' the memorandum warns, that Pell grants for the following academic year will be reduced.
 ''It's the mother of all shortfalls,'' said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. ''There's more unmet need than anyone predicted.'' 
 The Pell Grant, created in 1972, has long been the most important form of aid to needy students, and for millions, whether recent high school graduates or those who have been working for years, higher education would be impossible without such aid.
 ''Without a Pell, I could never have even afforded the textbooks,'' said Rita Gaglio, a 35-year-old mother of two who dropped out of high school, held several jobs she called ''mediocre'' and now uses her grant to study at Empire State College in Albany.
 Rhonda Piedmonte, 43, is also a nontraditional student who counts on Pell Grants. She is studying Italian at the State University of New York at Binghamton because her income as a flight attendant fell sharply after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
 ''The airlines have had problems, and the flight crews have had 60 percent cuts,'' said Ms. Piedmonte, who will soon earn her bachelor's degree. ''I stuck it through till last year, then I just couldn't do it any more, financially. I could never have gone back to school without a Pell Grant, and my financial hardship is so great that I'm getting other aid, too.'' 
 While the grants are only available to the most needy students -- 9 out of 10 recipients have family incomes of $40,000 or less -- the number of students seeking all kinds of federal aid is growing rapidly. In the first six months of 2008, almost nine million students nationwide completed the federal aid application required for federal grants and loans, a 16 percent increase over last year. 
 Many community colleges are experiencing record enrollments. At Onondaga Community College in Syracuse, for example, there are 3,006 first-year students this fall, the largest freshman class in its history, and Kristine Duffy, the associate vice president for enrollment services, said more students were enrolling full-time. In Florida, Palm Beach Community College has the biggest fall term for-credit enrollment in its 75-year history -- more than 23,000 students, a 10 percent increase over last year.
 ''When the economy declines, our enrollment increases,'' said Grace Truman, director of college relations. ''When jobs are plentiful, that competes with students coming to school. But when they can't find a job, or can't get enough hours on their job, they take more classes.''
 Still, rising tuition, shrinking state aid to colleges and the shaky economy are pushing college out of reach for many low-income students. Although Congress increased the size of the Pell Grants last year, the portion of college costs they cover has been declining. According to the College Board, the maximum grant covered half a year's study at the average public four-year college in 1987-8, but last year, it only covered about a third.
 This fall, many community colleges are enrolling students who had planned to attend more expensive four-year public or private colleges, but as the economy worsened chose a less expensive alternative. 
 ''People are feeling pinched,'' said Melissa Gregory, director of student financial aid at Montgomery College in Rockville, Md., who this month has worked with new students who originally planned to attend the University of Maryland, American University, George Washington University and others. ''These are students who had good aid packages, but there were a lot of loans in there, and at this point, people don't want to take out loans.'' 
 With tuition at Montgomery running about $3,900 for county residents, she said, many students with maximum grants can cover their tuition and still have money left for books.
 ''This is the college I can afford now,'' said Sharmistha Chowdhury, 19, who emigrated from Bangladesh to study in the United States and hopes to be a lawyer. ''I'm really grateful for the Pell. Because I'm a woman, it's hard to do something in Bangladesh, so I decided to come here to be on my own, to be an independent girl.'' 
 The very popularity of Pell Grants may insulate them from cuts. 
 ''If it is threatened, you'll hear about it,'' said Edward M. Elmendorf, senior vice president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. ''The decibel level will be deafening.''
 After the Department of Education briefed the House Education and Labor Committee on the problem, Rachel Racusen, the committee's spokeswoman, said its chairman, Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, was ''committed to ensuring that the scholarship doesn't decrease in the future.''

HEADLINE: For South Korea's Blind, a Livelihood Is Challenged

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
By the time Lee Hye-gyeong received a diagnosis of glaucoma in 2005, she had already lost much of her vision. By now, Ms. Lee, a former shop assistant, can see only shapeless colors as she fumbles through Seoul's crowded subway. 
 Still, for the past year and a half, commuting has been part of her daily routine. She awakens at 5:30 a.m., cooks breakfast for her husband and two teenage sons and then takes the subway to a government-run school. There, Ms. Lee, 42, trains for the one job that for most of the past century has been reserved exclusively for the legally blind: masseur. 
 But lately she fears her prospects in this new profession could be threatened. Sighted people who are practicing, but unlicensed, masseurs have asked the Constitutional Court of South Korea to declare unconstitutional a law that allows only the legally blind to become professional masseurs. They contend that the law violates their right to employment. A ruling could come as soon as next week. 
 Passions are intense on both sides of the debate over whether to preserve the restriction. Three people have died in protests over who is permitted to practice the trade. 
 Ms. Lee is concerned that the law might change and, with it, her chances for employment. ''Massage is the only job we blind can do,'' she said. ''In the name of free competition, they are trying to take away our right to survive.'' 
 Japanese colonialists in 1913 introduced to Korea the idea of reserving the role of masseurs solely for the blind. The prohibition against people with healthy sight was abolished in 1946 by the United States military government but was later reinstated in 1963. In a country where prejudice and a lack of official support have long restricted opportunities for the disabled, the blind have fiercely defended their exclusive right to the business. 
 About 7,100 legally blind people work in about 1,000 massage parlors in South Korea, and they are the only legally registered masseurs in the country. But they can hardly meet the demand, and so tens of thousands of so-called sports massage centers, skin-care salons, barber shops, hotels and public bath houses employ sighted, but illegal, massage workers. Estimates of their number range from 150,000 to 700,000. 
 National sports teams hire masseurs with healthy vision. During the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, the government offered free massage training to the unemployed, regardless of the state of their eyesight. ''Every bride gets a full-body massage before her wedding, nearly always from unlicensed masseurs,'' said Park Yoon-soo, president of the Massager Association of Korea, which is leading the legal challenge to the law. ''This shows how absurd the law is.'' 
 Members of Mr. Park's association, which represents 120,000 unlicensed masseurs, are working openly and in defiance of the law. His office keeps a growing file of members who have been accused of practicing without a license. Those people are usually fined, with the fines ranging from $450 to $4,500, although the law calls for up to three years in prison. 
 ''It breaks my heart when I think that what I am doing every day, what I consider my calling, is a crime,'' said Mr. Park, whose strong fingers have kneaded the backs of numerous politicians and celebrities over the past 25 years. ''We are not trying to steal jobs from the blind. We just want to share the market. We want to live as normal citizens, not as criminals.'' 
 The South Korean Constitution guarantees people the freedom to choose jobs, but it also requires the state to protect the disabled. 
 The two principles clashed in 2003, when sighted massage workers challenged the prohibition before the Constitutional Court. That time, the court ruled in favor of continuing to restrict the trade. 
 But in 2006, a reconstituted court issued a ruling that favored the sighted, saying that restricting people's choice of jobs by government directive -- the prohibition was not then a formal law -- was ''excessively'' discriminatory. 
 That set off weeks of protests by the blind. Some blind masseurs leaped from buildings and jumped on to subway tracks. Two blind people died. The police fished blind activists from the Han River in Seoul after they jumped from a bridge to highlight their cause. The protests continued until the National Assembly passed legislation enshrining the massage monopoly into law. 
 Then the sighted staged their own protests in response to the new law. One activist killed himself by jumping from the same Han River bridge. More than 7,300 sighted masseurs have joined in the current lawsuit, which asks the Constitutional Court to strike down the 2006 law. 
 Earlier this month, blind protesters again jumped from the Han River bridge, this time to protest a government proposal to license skin-care specialists to also give massages. The protesters demanded that the skin-care specialists be permitted only to massage heads and hands, leaving the rest of the body to the blind. 
 Over all, conditions for the disabled in South Korea have generally improved in recent years. Subways and buildings have begun improving access to the handicapped. The government now provides tax cuts for businesses that hire the disabled. 
 But the disabled say much remains to be done. Few buses are equipped to board people in wheelchairs, and many people who use canes or wheelchairs complain that taxis will not stop for them. 
 Still, some blind people sense a persistent social stigma. ''Many of us don't go to our children's graduation ceremonies for fear they might be ashamed of us,'' said Lee Gyu-song, secretary general of the organization representing blind masseurs, the Korea Masseurs Association. 
 Dong Seong-geun, a blind masseur, staged a lone protest in front of the Constitutional Court recently. 
 ''I have a wife and two children to support,'' he said. ''If I lose this job, I will have to beg on the streets. How can taking away one job from people who only have one compare with taking one job away from sighted people who have a hundred jobs to choose from?'' 
 The sighted masseurs, for their part, argue that the law is holding the blind back by confining them to a single vocation. 
 ''What blind people must realize is that by clinging to the one benefit the government tossed their way, they are actually impeding their own welfare,'' said Kim Myong-bo, a sighted masseur.

HEADLINE: Torre Hovers Over Razing Of Yankee Stadium

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
At first, I was not going back to Yankee Stadium for one more nostalgic glimpse before it is torn down. But then I spotted Tony La Russa in the stands the other night, taking a sentimental journey on a night off, and I decided to take one more look around.
 This is not the same Yankee Stadium where, as a youngster, I saw a dying Babe Ruth in 1947, or, as a young reporter, covered Mickey Mantle's shot off Barney Schultz in the 1964 World Series. But it is the same renovated Stadium, on the same site, where I covered the Yankees of Williams, Rivera, Jeter, Pettitte, Posada -- and Torre. 
 Joe Torre. Yes. There is change all over the New York area. The Yankees, Mets, Giants, Jets and Nets are all building pleasure palaces based on tax breaks, legal or otherwise, and the presumption that all those rich and giddy American corporations will subsidize luxury boxes for the shrimp-eaters and the wine-sippers. Let us hope that this economic gamble works better than the Yankee owners' zeal to run Torre out of the manager's office last October.
 Remember how George Steinbrenner delivered his blast from the past, blustering that if the Yankees could not get past Cleveland in the postseason, then Torre was surely gone? That's exactly what happened. Now the Yankees are going down as listlessly as any version of the team since the Stump Merrill years. This is not necessarily the fault of Joe Girardi, the current manager, but it is instructive nonetheless.
 Soon the bulldozers of the front office will tear down this Yankee team, followed by widespread urban renewal for the Mets, who are falling apart before our eyes for the second straight season.
 While all is gloom and doom in New York ballparks, there is one constant in baseball: Joe Torre will be going to the postseason. A faithful reader, Noah Buschel, reminded me in an e-mail message that Torre is about to qualify for the postseason for the 13th consecutive season, to move within one of the record, held by Bobby Cox of Atlanta.
 Torre won four World Series in his first five seasons, taking three straight rounds each time. (Casey Stengel won five straight World Series from 1949 through 1953, in a simpler one-tier format.) Torre's 12 straight postseasons are pretty neat, but as a reward he was run out of town by the bumptious owners. 
 It was probably time for Torre to go for his own sake, and maybe he knew it when he refused a humiliating offer of a one-year contract. He was not about to produce miracles with this lot, but he still had the respect of the veterans and the newer players, whose bodies and work habits have fallen apart under Girardi, for whatever reasons. 
 Torre looked great last spring -- 5 or 10 years younger, when I saw him in Florida -- like a guy who could breathe again, away from the grim forces of the Steinbrenners. Torre has since dealt with the disintegration of Andruw Jones and made the most of the gift from the gods, the mysterious Manny Ramirez deposited on his doorstep. 
 Not only that, but Torre managed the Dodgers without the backdrop of jackhammers and cranes and rerouted traffic that has given New York its unstable aura this season, on both sides of the Hudson.
 Both New York baseball teams have bet their money, our tax money and government-supported infrastructure, on corporate-subsidized luxury boxes and seats, backed up, theoretically, by individuals with fortunes to burn on conspicuous consumption like waiter service at ballparks. 
 I always thought of baseball as a Depression sport. In tough times, a latter-day Studs Lonigan could always plunk down a few quarters and spend a few hours at the ballpark. But now the two New York clubs, and their football cousins, have committed their core personality and economic future to corporations that we, all of us, are subsidizing with our own dwindling dollars.
 Forget about the Naming Rights Jinx that has struck a large number of corporations-on-the-make that put their names on sports palaces in the past generation. What about the companies that have underwritten all that munching and sipping by visitors who are vaguely aware of the event taking place outside the soundproof windows? What happens when those folks tap out?
 In these Final Days, I have received a number of e-mail messages from Yankee fans second-guessing the tearing down of the second version of the House That Ruth Built. It is too late, of course, but these fans say they could have put up with the inconveniences of that living museum. 
 My non-nostalgic opinion is that Yankee Stadium is physically outmoded as well as overly reliant on automobiles. Decades late, the jokers who run our region are finally building train stations at Yankee Stadium and the Meadowlands. (Shea Stadium was a dump the day it opened in 1964, but the new place looks quite pretty from the outside.)
 The Yankee ownership did not have the loyalty to the historic Stadium that many of the fans did. How smart are the Steinbrenners? They pushed Joe Torre out. Now he is heading for his 13th consecutive appearance in the postseason. Did I mention that?

HEADLINE: Abroad, This Bailout Is a Shocker

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Is the United States no longer the global beacon of unfettered, free-market capitalism?
 In extending a last-minute $85 billion lifeline to American International Group, the troubled insurer, Washington has not only turned away from decades of rhetoric about the virtues of the free market and the dangers of government intervention, but it has also probably undercut future American efforts to promote such policies abroad.
 ''I fear the government has passed the point of no return,'' said Ron Chernow, a leading American financial historian. ''We have the irony of a free-market administration doing things that the most liberal Democratic administration would never have been doing in its wildest dreams.'' 
 The bailout package for A.I.G., on top of earlier government support for Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has stunned even European policy makers accustomed to government intervention -- even as they acknowledge the shock of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. 
 ''For opponents of free markets in Europe and elsewhere, this is a wonderful opportunity to invoke the American example,'' said Mario Monti, the former antitrust chief at the European Commission. ''They will say that even the standard-bearer of the market economy, the United States, negates its fundamental principles in its behavior.''
 Mr. Monti said that past financial crises in Asia, Russia and Mexico brought government to the fore, ''but this is the first time it's in the heart of capitalism, which is enormously more damaging in terms of the credibility of the market economy.''
 In France, where the government has long supported the creation of ''national champions'' and worked actively to protect select companies from the threat of foreign takeover, politicians were quick to point out the paradox of what is essentially the nationalization of the largest American insurance company.
 ''Today the actions of American policy makers illustrate the need for economic patriotism,'' said Bernard Carayon, a lawmaker of President Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right governing party, UMP. ''I congratulate them.''
 For the ''evangelists of the market, this is a painful lesson,'' he added.
 National economies are entering ''an era where we have much more regulation and where the public and the private sector will mix much more.''
 In parts of Asia, the bailouts stirred bitter memories of the different approach the United States and the International Monetary Fund adopted during the economic crises there a decade ago.
 When the I.M.F. pledged $20 billion to help South Korea survive the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, one of the conditions it imposed was that the Korean government allow ailing banks and other companies to collapse rather than bail them out, recalled Yung Chul Park, a professor of economics at Korea University in Seoul, who was deeply involved in the negotiations with the I.M.F.
 While Mr. Park says the current crisis is different -- it is global rather than limited to one region -- ''Washington is following a different script this time.''
 ''I understand why they do it,'' he added. ''But they've lost credibility to some extent in pushing for opening up overseas markets to foreign competition and liberalizing economies.''
 The ramifications of the rescue of A.I.G. will be felt for years within the United States, too.
 A.I.G. was a different kind of company than Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which enjoyed government sponsorship, or Bear Stearns, which was regulated by the federal government.
 ''This was an insurance company that wasn't federally regulated,'' said Gary Gensler, who served as a top official in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration. Nor did A.I.G. have access to Federal Reserve funds or deposit insurance, like a commercial bank. 
 ''We're in new territory,'' Mr. Gensler added. ''This is a paradigm shift.''
 A.I.G. is also in a different league because of the breadth of its businesses and its extensive overseas operations, especially in Asia.
 What's more, it fell into something of a regulatory gap under the current rules.
 While the company, based in New York, is better known for selling conventional products like insurance policies and annuities overseen by state regulators in the United States, it is also deeply involved in the risky, opaque market for derivatives and other complicated financial instruments that operate largely outside regulation.
 Along with the threat to the plain-vanilla insurance policies held by millions of ordinary consumers, it was the threat posed by these arcane financial instruments that led Washington to bail out A.I.G.
 So far that rescue has not steadied markets.
 ''It's pure crisis management,'' Mr. Chernow said. ''It's the Treasury and the Federal Reserve lurching from crisis to crisis without a clear statement on how financial failures will be handled in the future. They're afraid to articulate such a policy. The safety net they are spreading seems to widen every day with no end in sight.''

HEADLINE: Helping New Technologies Grow Into Businesses, the San Diego Way

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SO far, San Diego remains a fertile breeding ground for entrepreneurs, despite the problems in the broader economy. 
 That is due in large part to a nonprofit organization, Connect, that was created 23 years ago to bring together people knowledgeable about business and investment capital with researchers at the universities and research institutes in San Diego.
 ''In 2007, we helped 54 companies start up, and there are 150 in the queue,'' said Duane Roth, chief executive of Connect. 
 Connect is neither a business nor a philanthropy. It offers prospective biotechnology, telecommunications, computer software and electronics companies advice and programs that introduce them to investment and venture capital firms. It does not charge for those services, but it relies on contributions from 200 members, among them business, legal and financial people, as well as the directors of research institutes in the San Diego area like the Scripps Research Institute, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the Burnham Institute for Medical Research. 
 This idea of combining scientific potential and financial heft was the brainchild of the founders of the Qualcomm Corporation, which became a telecommunications giant; Hybritech, a pioneering firm in biotechnology that is now owned by Eli Lilly; and Richard Atkinson, the president of the University of California, San Diego. In 1985, they formed Connect as an extension of the university to turn faculty ideas into commercial products. Connect did just that under the leadership of William Otterson, a computer executive who built the organization over 13 years, despite his long struggle with cancer, which ultimately took his life at age 69 in 1999. 
 ''Bill Otterson created the culture here, telling scientists and research people to share ideas and then compete in the marketplace,'' said Mr. Roth, a pharmaceutical industry entrepreneur who took Connect's reins in 2004. Today, he says of San Diego, ''We have a chance to become the premier region in the country for innovation.'' 
 Rolf Muller, a founder and chief scientific officer of Biomatrica Inc., is one of the people Connect has helped. Mr. Muller and his wife, Judy Muller-Cohn, chief executive of Biomatrica, are molecular biologists. They met at Oregon State University, married, went to Paris to earn doctorates at the Pasteur Institute and came to San Diego 14 years ago to work in bioscientific research. 
 As Mr. Muller recounts it, some of their work involved storing samples of genetic DNA and RNA, which requires preserving cell structures in freezers capable of extremely low temperatures. 
 ''For 80 years, we have stored tissue samples and cellular structures in freezers. The costs are huge -- $60,000 a year at least for each freezer, and 500 university laboratories have hundreds of freezers to store 10,000 samples a week,'' Mr. Muller said. 
 The Mullers were studying small animals called tardigrades that exist in extreme environments, like the Sahara desert. Tardigrades can suspend their metabolism by dehydrating themselves and living in such a state for as long as 10 years. 
 ''They dry up completely but come back to life when you put them in water,'' Mr. Muller explained. So, he said, he and his wife got to thinking: what if such a state could be duplicated technologically in a simple plastic matrix in which shrink-wrapped molecules are stored at room temperature, eliminating the need for freezers?
 Four years ago, they decided to give their idea a try. Mr. Muller kept his job at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies ''to support our four children'' while Judy Muller-Cohn left her job at a biotechnology firm to work at their new company. ''We mortgaged the house, took the college money out of savings and threw it all in,'' Mr. Muller said in a recent interview at Biomatrica's headquarters while Mrs. Muller-Cohn was traveling. 
 Connect ''was a huge help because scientists need help from people who know something about business,'' Mr. Muller said. Connect helped Biomatrica get a $1 million investment from an angel investor and then advised the company on securing technical partners in molecular diagnostics.
 In 2006, Biomatrica presented its story to investors in what Connect calls its Springboard competition. ''We were looking for $2 million, but before the competition was finished, we were oversubscribed,'' Mr. Muller said. 
 For Benchmark Revenue Management, a company with a software program for hospital management, Connect played a different role. Tyson S. McDowell, 26, the chief executive, founded the company six years ago. A software writer, Mr. McDowell founded one company in high school and sold it. With Benchmark, he and associates devised a software system that helps hospitals train employees and organize patient information in such a way that it is easier to qualify for cost reimbursement from insurance companies. 
 But when Benchmark needed money to expand, Mr. McDowell said, he came away from venture investors empty-handed. He realized after working with Connect, he said, that he was the problem. ''I used to think the guy on the other side of the table was an idiot,'' Mr. McDowell said. ''But Connect helped me to articulate the pitch about my company so that the people really do believe me.'' 
 He secured $1.7 million from investors, and now Benchmark has 13 employees, $2 million in revenue and more hospitals signing on as customers. Connect, Mr. McDowell said, not only helped him learn patience and humility, but ''its lessons have served us incredibly well with management boards, employees and investors.''
 Barbara Bry, one of Connect's first employees, managed its programs in technology and entrepreneurship from 1986 to 1997. She went on to found two companies, help start another and with her husband, Neil Senturia, a real estate developer and backer of software firms, started Blackbird Ventures, a firm that invests in start-up companies.
 Blackbird invested $1 million two years ago in Quanlight, essentially backing the invention of Vladimir Odnoblyudov, an electrical engineer from Russia who came to the University of California, San Diego, for his doctorate. 
 Mr. Odnoblyudov, working with an engineering professor at the university, Charles Tu, developed a semiconductor for light-emitting diodes that provided greater stability for red light, a major need in liquid-crystal displays. Quanlight, with Mr. Senturia as chief executive and Mr. Odnoblyudov as technology officer, raised $3 million last year to develop the invention under license from the university. The process is less expensive than current technology, Mr. Senturia said, ''but for red light, stable is more important than cheap. Quanlight's red is wonderful for backlight on L.C.D. television.'' 
 Ms. Bry and Mr. Senturia have a San Diego radio show called ''I'm There for You, Baby: the Entrepreneuer's Guide to the Galaxy.'' They said they hoped that Connect ''could develop more connections to sources of venture capital and international investors and global strategic partners,'' Ms. Bry said. But in the meantime, ''I feel blessed to live in San Diego,'' she said, ''where the environment for innovation and entrepreneurship is so rich.''

HEADLINE: A Regional Crisis

 BODY:
It is impossible to determine yet the extent of the damage that the financial hurricane battering Wall Street will have on the economies of New York City and its surrounding region. But it will be significant, and there is no time to waste. Regional governments must immediately prepare for the cascading effects of the financial sector's implosion, which would devastate tax revenues and increase demands on government to help those who are hit by the economic crisis.
 Wall Street is essential to the regional economy. It accounts for almost a fourth of the wages and salaries paid in the city and over a quarter of its tax revenue. It generates about a fifth of the taxes collected by New York State. Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey said Wall Street supported about a third of his state's economy. And it employs most of the million-dollar earners in Connecticut, who pay 30 percent of its taxes. 
 The support is buckling. Wall Street lost $20 billion in the first half of the year. In the 12 months ending in July, the finance and insurance industries eliminated about 16,000 jobs in the area. Each Wall Street job is estimated to support three others in the urban and suburban quilt that spreads to New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut. And the crisis isn't over by a long shot.
 It will be tough to tighten budgets as the region's economies reel. But regional officials can find a good example to follow in New York City's response to the combined effects of the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a recession and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It offers hope that the current crisis can be handled without undermining essential government functions.
 Federal aid helped, but the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg also raised the property tax rate by 18.5 percent in January 2003. Health and education budgets were protected. Other expenditures, especially on police and other uniformed services were sharply cut. 
 New York City, which is required by law to balance the budget, is in better shape than state governments in the region. The city ran a surplus in its last fiscal year, which ended in June, and used the money to prepay debt. It based the current fiscal year's budget on an expected 6 percent fall in tax revenues, a far more realistic figure than the 4 percent-plus increase projected in Albany for its fiscal year, which started in April. 
 While the city is likely to have to cut spending again, there are potential sources of additional revenue available. Property tax rates were cut 7 percent in 2007. A property tax rebate was introduced in 2004. Reversing these two measures could raise more than $1.5 billion.
 With $32 billion in debt, New Jersey's finances are in much worse shape, despite Governor Corzine's best efforts to restore fiscal sanity. New York State is not only in a precarious fiscal situation, it is in an election year. Gov. David Paterson has won more than $1 billion in budget cuts over the next year and a half.
 However reluctantly, legislators in Albany will need to trim much more. The City Council in New York should not stand in the way of raising the property tax. In New Jersey, the Legislature should revive the governor's ambitious plan to increase tolls to pay down the state's debt, which would save millions in interest payments. 
 And the sooner they act, the better.

HEADLINE: NEW PHASE IN FINANCE CRISIS AS INVESTORS RUN TO SAFETY

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Diana B. Henriques and Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The financial crisis entered a potentially dangerous new phase on Wednesday when many credit markets stopped working normally as investors around the world frantically moved their money into the safest investments, like Treasury bills.
As a result, the cost of borrowing soared for many companies, while the stocks of Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that only a couple of weeks ago were considered relatively strong came under assault by waves of selling. Investors were so worried that they snapped up three-month Treasury bills with virtually no yield and they pushed gold to its biggest one-day gain in nearly 10 years. Stocks fell by nearly 5 percent in New York.
The stunning flight to safety, away from other kinds of debt as well as stocks, could cause serious damage to an already weakened economy by making it more expensive for businesses to finance their daily operations.
Some economists worry that a psychology of fear has gripped investors, not only in the United States but also in Europe and Asia. While investors' decision to protect themselves may be perfectly rational, the crowd behavior could cause a downward spiral with broader ramifications. 
''It's like having a fire in a cinema,'' said Hyun Song Shin, an economics professor at Princeton. ''Everybody is rushing to the door. You are rushing to the door because everyone is rushing to the door. Clearly, as a collective action, it is a disaster.''
Faltering confidence could have an infectious effect in Asia, whose savings has essentially bankrolled America for decades. ''Asia, perhaps more than other markets, is a bit more volatile, a bit more based on sentiment,'' said Dan Parr, the head of Asia-Pacific for brandRapport, a consulting firm with an office in Hong Kong. ''It doesn't take much for the man on the street to become very, very concerned.'' In early trading in Japan, the Nikkei index fell 3 percent.
Despite government efforts to reassure investors over the last 10 days by rescuing some giant institutions -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and American International Group -- many investors remain worried that the financial system has been badly battered and that more firms may fail as Lehman Brothers did.
The Federal Reserve has greatly expanded its lending to banks and securities firms this year and is continuing to relax rules that govern financial companies in hopes of alleviating the credit squeeze. Central banks globally are also injecting more money into their economies and lowering reserve requirements for their own institutions out of concern that the problems in the American financial system will inflict further damage.
If the problems in the financial system persist, businesses will have less money to put to work, job cuts will spread and consumers, already fearful, will have less money to spend, knocking the economy down another notch. High borrowing costs will further weaken the housing market, which is still struggling. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that housing starts fell to their lowest level since early 1991.
Flashes of fear were evident Wednesday as investors clamored for government debt. When investors bid up the price, the yield falls, and it sank on three-month Treasury bills to 0.061 percent, from 1.644 percent a week ago. The yield was the lowest in more than 50 years.
In the stock market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 57.20 points, or 4.71 percent, to 1,156.39, the lowest close in more than three years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 449.36 points, to 10,609.66.
Worries over financial investments hammered even the well-regarded Wall Street firms of Goldman Sachs, whose shares fell nearly 14 percent, to $114.50, and Morgan Stanley, whose shares dropped more than 24 percent, to $21.75. Now, both firms are reconsidering what their best strategies might be in such a fearful market.
In addition to shares of financial companies like Bank of America, those of other bellwethers like General Electric have also tumbled.
Responding to this pressure, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules on short selling, or betting on falling share prices, and even suggested that hedge funds and others might have to disclose short positions, a proposal that is likely to meet stiff resistance.
One key overnight lending rate was above 5 percent on Wednesday, more than double its level a week earlier. GMAC, the auto finance company owned in part by General Motors, had to pay interest of 5.25 percent on Wednesday for a form of short-term financing known as one-week commercial paper, up from 4 percent the previous day.
Businesses, stung by high interest rates, may be forced to trim expenses, an ominous turn in a slowing economy with unemployment rates on the rise.
''This is throwing sand in the gears of the economy,'' said G. David MacEwen, chief investment officer for the bond department of American Century Investments. ''The economy depends on credit to finance homes, automobiles, student loans, and inventories.''
Local governments and other enterprises will feel pressure, too. The city of Chicago and Lincoln Center in New York postponed debt offerings because they would have to pay such high interest rates to investors, said Daniel S. Solender, director of municipal bond management at Lord Abbett & Company.
Money market funds braced for possible fallout from the disclosure that one big fund's net assets fell below $1 a share, because it had held securities issued by Lehman Brothers. It is so rare for money market funds to fall below that threshold that many investors consider them as safe as cash or a checking account.
Some mutual fund companies reported that customers were moving money from broader money market funds that have had higher yields to more conservative funds within the same company, Peter Rizzo, a senior director of Standard & Poor's, said late Wednesday afternoon. The overall effect is to reduce the appetite for securities of companies with anything other than the most stellar reputations.
Governments around the world stepped up their efforts to ease the strain on the global financial system. The Bank of England extended a special bank lending program for three more months, while central banks in Japan and Australia injected more money into their banking systems. Russia injected money into its banks and lowered reserve requirements.
In New York, the Federal Reserve on Tuesday night said it would extend an $85 billion credit line to the insurer A.I.G. and receive the rights to a nearly 80 percent stake in the company. The deal came just after the government refused financial support to Lehman, leading it to file for bankruptcy on Monday.
The Treasury and Fed also said they would auction more Treasury bills. The Fed will use the securities to manage its balance sheet and inject more money into the financial system. Because the Fed has expanded its lending to banks and securities firm this year, some analysts had grown concerned that the central bank might run out of Treasury securities to conduct its operations. Mark Gertler, an economics professor at New York University, said the Fed was trying to balance two interests: protecting against a crisis but telling the market that it will not bail out every troubled institution. Despite the stress in the markets, he said, the Fed's actions may have averted a worse outcome.
''Maybe this is being Pollyannaish, but they have been successful in signaling that the bailouts are no longer automatic, and thus far they have prevented a market meltdown,'' Mr. Gertler said.
The dramatic events of the last year have called into question much of what policy makers, economists and investors once espoused about the financial system. As recently as the spring of 2007, many in Washington and New York continued to say housing prices could not fall across the board and that most of the bets made by Wall Street traders were inherently safe.
Now, there are signs that psychology is driving a reverse line of thinking. People are assuming that things will get worse and that any move by the Fed or the Treasury is a step down, not a step closer to improvement.
''There has been a tremendous amount of denial over the past two years, three years,'' said Barry Ritholtz, chief executive of Fusion IQ, an investment firm, and author of The Big Picture blog.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32, to 104 28/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.41 percent from 3.44 percent late Tuesday. Following are the results of Wednesday's auction of 35-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: McCain, on the Economy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
This advertisement for Senator John McCain is the third this week in which he addresses the nation's financial crisis. Called ''Foundation,'' it is 30 seconds long and will be broadcast nationally. 
 PRODUCER Foxhole Productions
 THE SCRIPT Voice of Mr. McCain: ''You, the American workers, are the best in the world. But your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street. That's unacceptable. My opponent's only solutions are talk and taxes. I'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I've taken on tougher guys than this before.'' Announcer's voice: ''Change is coming. John McCain.''
 THE SCREEN Against a dark background, Mr. McCain addresses the camera. As he speaks, scenes from the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange flash across the screen, followed by a street sign that says Wall Street. Then it is back to Mr. McCain, whose image gives way to that of Senator Barack Obama, with his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the background. Mr. McCain speaks to viewers one last time before the screen dissolves to a still photograph of him, accompanied by the phrase ''The Original Maverick.''
 ACCURACY According to a 2007 study by the International Labor Organization, workers in Norway are the world's most productive (when measured on an hourly basis), followed by the United States and France. Mr. Obama has offered detailed proposals on the economy, for stemming the mortgage default crisis and channeling investment into activities that will generate new jobs. He would raise capital gains taxes as well as income and Social Security taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year, but the notion that he would also increase taxes on middle-class voters has been repeatedly debunked. Studies have found that Mr. Obama would offer most Americans a tax cut three times the size of what Mr. McCain proposes. Finally, Mr. McCain's record has favored deregulation of the financial industry, a factor that analysts say has contributed to the credit crisis, and opposed creation of a government agency to oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
 SCORECARD Mr. McCain got himself into trouble on Monday by arguing that ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong'' despite the Wall Street crisis. This advertisement is an effort to rebound from that much-criticized statement with a populist appeal that echoes Mr. Obama's mantra of ''change.'' In addition, Mr. McCain seems to be evoking his history as a prisoner of war to underline his argument that he has more experience than Mr. Obama and is therefore more qualified to be president. But he has on occasion also acknowledged that economics is not his strongest suit, so with the financial markets drifting into uncharted waters, it is hard to tell if the experience argument will convince voters.

HEADLINE: Medvedev Promises Georgia Enclaves Protection; U.S. Warns Russia of Perilous Path

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Ellen Barry reported from Moscow, and Steven Lee Myers from Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Russia deepened its relations with Georgia's two breakaway regions on Wednesday, even as the Bush administration was intensifying its warnings that Russia was ''on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance.''
 Brushing aside international protests, President Dmitri A. Medvedev signed separate treaties with the regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, guaranteeing them protection in case of attack. 
 The treaties also allow Russia to build military bases and station additional troops in the territories. Those steps, if put into effect, would violate the European-brokered cease-fire that ended Russia's war with Georgia last month.
 In Washington, the administration's criticism of Russia is reaching new intensity in remarks prepared for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In a speech she is to deliver before the German Marshall Fund on Thursday, Ms. Rice will challenge Russia in some of the most stinging language she has used in office.
 ''What has become clear is that the legitimate goal of rebuilding Russia has taken a dark turn with the rollback of personal freedoms, the arbitrary enforcement of the law, the pervasive corruption at various levels of Russian society and the paranoid, aggressive impulse, which has manifested itself before in Russian history,'' she will say, according to her prepared remarks, which were pointedly released in advance to draw added attention to them.
 Despite such criticism, Russia appears increasingly determined to defy the United States and Europe and test their willingness to punish Russia for its dismemberment of Georgia. Mr. Medvedev signed the treaties with South Ossetia and Abkhazia during elaborate ceremonies in the Kremlin.
 After routing Georgian forces in a five-day war, Russia recognized the independence of both regions, which had effectively though not formally seceded from Georgia after violent conflicts that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
 So far only Nicaragua has joined Russia in recognizing the two as sovereign nations, as has Hamas, the Palestinian faction that controls Gaza. Ms. Rice mocks Russia's diplomatic efforts in her remarks. ''A pat on the back from Daniel Ortega and Hamas is hardly a diplomatic triumph,'' she says, referring to Nicaragua's president.
 Mr. Medvedev pledged Russia's full diplomatic, economic and military support to the regions. He accused Georgia of continuing to rearm its forces and warned that further attacks ''would lead to a catastrophe on a regional scale.''
 ''We will not allow any new military adventure,'' he said in remarks reported by Interfax. ''No one should have any illusions.''
 While sharply criticizing Russia's behavior, the Bush administration has so far limited its response to rallying international diplomatic pressure to force Russia to back down. It has stopped short of significant punitive steps like sanctions.
 In her prepared remarks, Ms. Rice seeks to make the case that Russia has already paid a price for its actions by scuttling a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States and undermining its chances of joining the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a multinational group that promotes free markets and democracies.
 On Capitol Hill, the under secretary of state for political affairs, William J. Burns, attributed the turmoil in Russia's stock market and a drop in investment in Russia to international concern over the conflict with Georgia. Russian stocks lost a quarter of their value in three days this week.
 ''I think what's becoming clear in this crisis is that there are some consequences for the kind of national assertiveness and overdoing of things which we are seeing in the Georgia crisis,'' Mr. Burns told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
 As Vice President Dick Cheney and other senior officials have done recently, Ms. Rice argues that Russia faces a choice between international isolation and cooperation.
 In unusually blunt language, she criticizes ''a worsening pattern of behavior'' that has made Russia ''increasingly authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad.'' While she places some blame on Georgia for attacking South Ossetia, Ms. Rice describes Russia's response as ''what, by all appearances, was a premeditated invasion of its independent neighbor.''
 At the same time, the administration has been unwilling to risk a serious breach with Russia, despite growing frustration in Washington over its continued defiance. Its cooperation is deemed too important in dealing with Iran and other global issues.
 ''They're in a pretty defiant mood right now,'' one senior administration official said of the Russian leadership, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss diplomatic matters. ''It's going to be a long slog to get them to back off that.''

HEADLINE: Federal Aid To Detroit Seems Likely

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit and Michael Cooper from Orion, Mich.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After a series of government interventions in the private markets, one seemingly more astonishing than the next, lawmakers found themselves confronted on Wednesday with the question of when and where to draw the line on future aid. 
 But with billions of dollars in financial backing already authorized for Wall Street, and with Election Day fast approaching, Congressional leaders seemed uninterested in denying help to large employers of blue-collar Americans.
 Even as lawmakers in both parties unleashed a barrage of questions about the wisdom of a government rescue for the American International Group, support seemed to be growing quickly on Capitol Hill for $25 billion in loan guarantees to assist the ailing auto industry. 
 Both presidential candidates, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, have voiced support for the loan guarantees -- an unsurprising stance given the critical importance of the main auto-producing states, Michigan and Ohio, to the electoral map this fall.
 The chief executives of the three big American automakers -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- met on Wednesday afternoon with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
 When they emerged, they expressed optimism that the loan guarantees would be included as part of a budget resolution that is needed to finance government operations through the end of the year.
 ''The support that we got was again very encouraging,'' said Robert L. Nardelli, the chairman of Chrysler. ''The conversations I have had all day on the Hill have been very encouraging, very candid, very straightforward and so as we conclude the day, I would say it was successful.'' 
 Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive of Ford, was even more upbeat. ''It was a great day,'' he said. When a reporter asked what Mr. Mulally might say to people who viewed the loan guarantees as a bailout, he replied in a chipper voice, ''I would characterize it as an enabler.'' 
 Ms. Pelosi sharply criticized the Bush administration on Wednesday over the $85 billion bailout of A.I.G., saying it was evidence of mismanagement by President Bush. But she expressed strong support for the automakers' loan guarantees, which would be used to help the companies meet new fuel efficiency standards that Congress adopted last year.
 ''We see that as a way to rebuild and strengthen the technological base of America,'' Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference in the Capitol. ''It would certainly help people in the auto industry, but it's not only about the auto industry, it's about the auto industry, it's about our economy, it's about America's work force.''
 She added: ''We consider this a major investment in innovation.''
 Republican Congressional leaders, too, said they were in favor of helping the automakers. Representative Adam Putnam of Florida, the third-ranking House Republican, said at a news conference that it was up to auto executives to convince lawmakers of the need for government assistance.
 ''It's incumbent on them to make the case to Congress that it is a loan guarantee, that it is a wise investment of taxpayer dollars, and I think that they are on the Hill this week making that case,'' Mr. Putnam said. ''The reports that I have heard from my colleagues is that they have been fairly persuasive.'' 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, expressed his own support for aid to the automakers at a news conference on Wednesday morning. Mr. Reid said the loan guarantees, which would cost taxpayers $7.5 billion, were needed. 
 ''I think it's extremely important that we try to do something,'' he said. ''These are jobs. These are cars that we should be selling -- or manufacturing in America, not someplace else.''
 Still, some fiscal conservatives reacted angrily to the prospect of more taxpayer money being used to prop up private companies.
 ''The federal government's propensity to bail out failing companies in struggling industries ought to be troubling to all taxpayers,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. ''Aside from the fiscal impact of spending money that the federal government doesn't have, these bailouts will likely have the opposite of their intended effect.''
 Mr. Flake added: ''Federal bailouts may stave off short-term economic damage, but the long-term economic outlook will be much worse if the market is not allowed to make its own adjustments. While the Bush administration certainly shares blame for these bailouts, this Congress may designate itself as the 'Bailout Congress' if we follow through on a rumored bailout of the auto industry.''
 But such skepticism was likely to be overshadowed by the huge stakes in the presidential race. Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee, had seemed cool to the idea of loans for the auto industry last month, but at a campaign stop on Wednesday at an auto plant in Orion, Mich., he sounded like a staunch supporter.
 ''It's great to be here today with the assembly workers of this G.M. plant,'' he said. ''I'm here to send a message to Washington and Wall Street: We are not going to leave the workers here in Michigan hung out to dry while we give billions in taxpayer dollars to Wall Street. It is time to get our auto industry back on its feet. It's time for a new generation of cars and for loans to build the facilities that will make them.''

HEADLINE: The McCain Of the Week

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

DATELINE: VIENNA, Ohio 

 BODY:
 ''The people of Ohio are the most productive in the world!'' yelled John McCain at a rally outside of Youngstown on Tuesday. Present company perhaps excluded, since the crowd was made up entirely of people who were at liberty in the middle of a workday. 
 Folks were wildly enthusiastic as the event began. That was partly because Sarah Palin was also on the bill. (With Todd!) And when McCain took the center stage, they were itching to cheer the war hero and boo all references to pork-barrel spenders. 
 Nobody had warned them that he had just morphed into a new persona -- a raging populist demanding more regulation of the nation's financial system. And since McCain's willingness to make speeches that have nothing to do with his actual beliefs is not matched by an ability to give them, he wound up sounding like Bob Dole impersonating Huey Long.
 Really, if McCain is going to keep changing into new people, the campaign should send out notices. (Come to a rally for the next president of the United States. Today he's a vegetarian!) 
 ''We're going to put an end to the abuses on Wall Street -- enough is enough!'' this new incarnation yelled, complaining angrily about greed and overpaid C.E.O.'s. Slowly, people begin to peel out of the crowd and drift away. Even in these troubled times, there are apparently a number of Republicans who think highly of corporate executives and captains of high finance.
 The whole transformation was fascinating in a cheap-thrills kind of way. It's not every day, outside of ''Incredible Hulk'' movies, that you see somebody make this kind of turnaround in the scope of a few hours. 
 On Monday in Jacksonville, Fla., McCain made his now-famous reassurance that the fundamentals of the economy were still good. It's a longstanding line of his, but this was perhaps not the best week to dredge it up. So the handlers went to work, and by the time McCain arrived in Orlando a few hours later he was reprogrammed. And angry! 
 ''We're going to put an end to the abuses on Wall Street! Enough is enough! We're going to put an end to the greed!'' he told a town hall meeting crowded with Hispanic Republicans. It was a rather jumbled message, but the new story line was firm. The fundamentals were not things like employment rates or trade statistics. The fundamentals were the workers. 
 We are the fundamentals! 
 And, naturally, the humble, hard-working fundamentals are good. Who could doubt it? Was Barack Obama trying to say that he didn't think the American working man and woman was good? Was this the sort of thing they talked about at those fancy-schmancy Hollywood fund-raisers? Which, of course, John McCain hates. Give him some hard cider and a log cabin, and he's happy as a clam.
 But wait! The fundamentals are in danger! At risk because of ''greed.'' Which John McCain was shocked to discover has been running rampant in the canyons of Wall Street. 
 Now in an election like this, you expect a certain amount of tactical reimagining. McCain used to like reporters, and now he treats them as if they were carrying the Ebola virus. Fair enough, although given the fact that he's terrible at speeches, and the famous town halls have now become Republican-only lovefests, the campaign really should invent some new method of communication. (And remember, the man doesn't text.) 
 It is also disconcerting, of course, to hear the Republicans rail against Washington as if the Socialist Workers Party had been running things there for the last eight years. But really, what would you do if you were McCain? There aren't a lot of options, and he never did like George W. anyway.
 This new tactic is different. McCain has always, genuinely, believed in dismantling government regulations, and there he was, vowing to create new ''comprehensive regulations that will apply the rules and enforce them to the fullest.'' It makes you think that he's trying to impersonate something he's not. Or wasn't. Or might not be. The image is getting fuzzy.
 This week, while McCain's chief economic adviser was telling reporters that it was wrong to ''run for president by denigrating everything in sight and trying to scare people,'' McCain's ad people were unveiling a new spot announcing ''Our economy in crisis!'' and calling for ''tougher rules on Wall Street'' along, of course, with more offshore drilling. Mournful unemployment-line music swells. 
 I have absolutely no idea of how John McCain would handle a financial crisis if he were president. But on behalf of all the nation's fundamentals I would like to say that he now has me ready to stage a run on the first bank in sight.

HEADLINE: 'Other People's Money'

BYLINE: By KATE PHILLIPS

 BODY:
The economic meltdown was on the table Wednesday as Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska sat down for her latest round of campaign-selected interviews, this one with Sean Hannity on Fox News. 
 According to released excerpts of the interview, which was to run Wednesday night, Ms. Palin called unfair the criticisms of Senator John McCain, her Republican running mate, for saying Monday that the fundamentals of the economy were strong. 
 ''It was an unfair attack on the verbiage that Senator McCain chose to use,'' Ms. Palin said. ''He means our work force. He means the ingenuity of the American people, and of course that is strong and that is the foundation of our economy.'' 
 Ms. Palin also offered up her own financial lingo -- O.P.M. -- in explaining who is to blame: ''I think the corruption on Wall Street. That's to blame. And that violation of the public trust. And that contract that should be inherent in corporations who are spending, investing other people's money, the abuse of that is what has got to stop. 
 ''And it's a matter, too, of some of these C.E.O.'s and top management people, and shareholders, too, not holding that management accountable, being addicted to, we call it, O.P.M., O.P.M. -- other people's money.''
 As to what role she would have in a McCain administration, she said: ''I'm very excited about the role that I will play as his partner. And I will focus on energy independence and reform over all of Washington and tax cuts for Americans and reining in spending.''

HEADLINE: As Fears Grow, Wall St. Titans See Shares Fall

BYLINE: By BEN WHITE and ERIC DASH; Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Even Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two last titans left standing on Wall Street, are no longer immune. 
 To the surprise of executives within those firms, and their rivals, the stocks of these powerful companies were drawn into the crisis of investor confidence on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley, whose stock fell almost 25 percent, was considering a merger with Wachovia or another bank to help shore up its finances. Goldman Sachs's stock fell almost 14 percent, and it had to rebuff rumors that it was seeking a capital infusion.
 The assault on these two companies underscored how quickly a sense of fear is spreading through Wall Street. Both firms just reported respectable profits on Tuesday, and were considered in a separate class from weaker banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers that saw the value of their businesses evaporate.
 ''Stop the Insanity,'' wrote Glenn Schorr, a brokerage analyst at UBS, in an e-mail message to clients on Wednesday. 
 A tie-up with a bank would restore Morgan Stanley to its structure during the Depression, when the firm split from the Morgan banking empire. It would also leave Goldman Sachs as the last major American investment bank after a global financial crisis that has gripped markets for more than a year snowballed last week, forcing the most risk-taking industry in the world to get back to basics. 
 Only a day earlier, Morgan Stanley defended itself from growing doubts about its future, issuing a fairly positive earnings report to ward off concerns about its health. But the fear that gripped markets after Lehman Brothers failed also enveloped the firm. 
 Seeking to avoid the kind of fate that led Lehman and Bear Stearns to collapse, John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, made an unsuccessful effort on Tuesday evening to persuade Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, to enter into a combination, according to people briefed on the talks. 
 ''We need a merger partner or we're not going to make it,'' Mr. Mack told Mr. Pandit, according to two people briefed on the talks. Mr. Pandit, a former senior investment banker at Morgan Stanley, said Citigroup was not interested. It is thinking of deals it can strike with consumer banks, like buying the struggling Washington Mutual out of bankruptcy if its reported efforts to auction itself should fail, that would provide it with cheaper deposit funding. A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment. 
 Having failed at that, Mr. Mack entered into discussions on Wednesday with Wachovia and several other banks, people briefed on those discussions said. The talks with Wachovia are preliminary and a deal may not emerge. The banks declined to comment. 
 Goldman Sachs may be under less pressure given its recent history of outperforming its peers. The bank made $11.6 billion last year and has not posted a loss during the credit crisis. Morgan Stanley has also performed well, but has suffered more write-downs and had a loss of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.
 Still, many specialists say they believe that the monumental events of the last four days herald a new period of painful change for the American financial industry -- one that speculators are rushing to pounce on. While Wall Street has gone through tough times before, only to emerge bigger and stronger, some financial specialists question whether the industry can rebound quickly after using high levels of leverage, or borrowed money, to binge on risky investments. Those investments have proved to be disastrous. Worldwide, financial companies have reported more than $500 billion in charges and losses stemming from the credit crisis -- a figure some specialists say could eventually exceed $1 trillion. 
 Merrill Lynch rushed into the arms of Bank of America this week in a deal that in some ways harked back to the past. During the Depression, Congress separated commercial banks, which take deposits and make loans, from investment banks, which underwrite and trade securities. The investment banks were allowed to do business with less oversight, while commercial banks operated with tighter supervision. 
 But after Congress repealed those Depression-era laws in 1999, commercial banks began muscling in on Wall Street's turf. As the new competition whittled down profit margins, investment banks used more of their capital to trade securities and also began developing financial derivatives to fuel profits. 
 Now, executives like John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill and a former Goldman executive, say investment banks will need large bases of deposits to shore up their capital. 
 Investors appeared to be questioning whether either Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs would be able to survive alone as panic spread through the markets. The cost of protecting against defaults on the debt of both have shot up, a signal that some investors believe one or both of the banks could be next in the growing list of financial companies to either go bust, get sold or require a government bailout. Any institution without a big, stable balance sheet is seen as vulnerable to the kind of rapid collapse in confidence that led to the demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. 
 As Morgan Stanley considered its options on Wednesday, the struggling savings and loanWashington Mutual also put itself up for auction, people briefed on the matter said. Shares of Washington Mutual fell 31 cents, or 13.36 percent, to $2.01; Wachovia shares fell $2.39, or 20.76 percent, to $9.12.
 Normally, a declining share price alone should not force a stalwart like Morgan Stanley into a sale. But those declines, which executives blamed on aggressive hedge funds that profit when stocks drop, can increase the firm's cost of borrowing by forcing it to post more collateral to lenders when its credit default protection prices rise. 
 Such an event often leads credit rating agencies to downgrade a company's debt. That, in turn, can quickly deplete even a well-financed bank's capital and force into sale or bankruptcy. The real end for Lehman Brothers, for example, came when Moody's, the ratings agency, downgraded the company's debt last week, forcing it into a corner. 
 Indeed, with healthy earnings, Wednesday's relentless downward spiral in shares of both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs made little sense to some. 
 Mr. Schorr, the analyst at UBS, said the increase in the risk premiums investors are demanding on debt have become self-fulfilling prophecies that now operate almost entirely detached from underlying fact, a thought echoed by people inside both banks and by several investors. 
 ''It's all confidence, it's not reality,'' Mr. Schorr said. 
 Morgan and Goldman have some problems, including a parcel of troubled mortgage assets and trading and advisory businesses that are vulnerable to a slowing economy. 
 ''But that is not what is going on here,'' Mr. Schorr said. ''It is just a flat-out squeeze that should not be able to happen. The negative feedback loop has to be somehow suspended,'' he added, ''but I don't know exactly how you do that.'' Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
 On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission reinstated a rule curbing the ability of investors to drive the share price of firms down to make a profit. Nearly five days ago, Wall Street chieftans who were gathered for emergency meetings at the New York Federal Reserve bank pleaded for the agency to revive the rule, which expired in the summer. 
 Mr. Mack has been in contact with regulators about what he views as abusive short-selling of the company's shares. On Wednesday, he sent a memo to employees assuring them of the bank's strong capital position and blaming short-sellers for driving the stock down ''in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumors.'' He plans to hold a town hall meeting with Morgan employees Thursday morning.

HEADLINE: Echoing the Campaign of a Rival, Microsoft Aims to Redefine 'I'm a PC'

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
RELAX, computer users, after only two weeks Microsoft will stop teasing you as the company begins the next phase of an ambitious -- and risky -- $300 million campaign intended to make over its tarnished image.
 The campaign, which begins Thursday and carries the theme ''Windows. Life without walls,'' will move away from the enigmatic teaser commercials that featured Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld in offbeat conversations about shopping, shoes, suburbia and the potential of computing to improve life. The teaser ads have generated considerable discussion since they started on Sept. 4, not all of it positive.
 What follows is an audacious embrace of the disdainful label that Apple, Microsoft's rival, has gleefully -- and successfully -- affixed onto users of Microsoft products: ''I'm a PC.''
 One new Microsoft commercial even begins with a company engineer who resembles John Hodgman, the comedian portraying the loser PC character in the Apple campaign. ''Hello, I'm a PC,'' the engineer says, echoing Mr. Hodgman's recurring line, ''and I've been made into a stereotype.'' 
 The strategy to use the Apple attack as the basis for a counterstrike is typical for the agency behind the campaign, Crispin Porter & Bogusky.
 Crispin Porter, part of MDC Partners, relishes efforts to transform perceived negatives into positives. For another client, Burger King, the calorie-stuffed menu is portrayed to a target audience of young men as a rebellious personal choice to ''Have it your way.''
 Mr. Gates makes a cameo appearance in the new Microsoft spots, along with celebrities like the actress Eva Longoria, the author Deepak Chopra and the singer Pharrell Williams. (Mr. Seinfeld is gone, at least for now.)
 But the stars are everyday PC users, from scientists and fashion designers to shark hunters and teachers, all of whom affirm, in fast-paced, upbeat vignettes, their pride in using the computers that run on Microsoft operating systems and software.
 Among them are more than 60 Microsoft employees, who are accompanied in the ads by e-mail addresses -- even Mr. Gates's (bill@windows.com).
 Apple executives have been ''using a lot of their money to de-position our brand and tell people what we stand for,'' said David Webster, general manager for brand marketing at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash.
 ''They've made a caricature out of the PC,'' he added, which was unacceptable because ''you always want to own your own story.''
 The campaign illustrates ''a strong desire'' among Microsoft managers ''to take back that narrative,'' Mr. Webster said, and ''have a conversation about the real PC.''
 A giant advertiser responding to the disparagement of a smaller rival can be fraught with peril. Consumers may see it as a validation of the claims, or even bullying. On the other hand, ignoring the taunts can damage images and sales.
 In the car-rental wars, the market leader, Hertz, long kept silent about a cheeky Avis campaign that proclaimed: ''We're No. 2. We try harder.'' But after Avis revenue grew robustly, Hertz shot back: ''For years, Avis has been telling you Hertz is No. 1. Now we're going to tell you why.''
 Similarly, Coca-Cola said nothing as Pepsi-Cola challenged its hegemony in the cola category -- until it turned tradition upside-down in 1985 by bringing out New Coke, with a more Pepsi-like taste. Roger A. Enrico, who was in charge of the PepsiCo beverage business, celebrated by co-writing a book titled ''The Other Guy Blinked: How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars.''
 Riffing on the Apple ads is ''a smart way of changing the dialogue,'' Mr. Webster said, ''without taking them through the mud.''
 Charles Rosen, chief executive at Amalgamated, an agency in New York that specializes in what he calls ''cultural branding'' for clients like Ben & Jerry's ice cream, said it made sense for Microsoft to engage Apple.
 Through its campaign, which mocks the PC as it celebrates the Macintosh, ''Apple represents the ideology of Silicon Valley, taking on big business as in Microsoft,'' Mr. Rosen said.
 That gives Apple ''badge value, identity value,'' he added, among consumers who prize brands they deem populist.
 Trying to gain more firepower for ads by generating talk in the popular culture is another tactic of Crispin Porter's. For example, commercials for Volkswagen became the subject of considerable buzz because they showed something rarely depicted in auto advertising: sudden crashes.
 That was what the two-week Microsoft teaser campaign accomplished, according to companies that track discussions about brands.
 At first, ''the ads were ambiguous and confounding to some,'' said Ted Marzilli, senior vice president and general manager of the brand group at the New York office of YouGovPolimetrix, a research company, but as they continued they helped improve perceptions about Microsoft.
 On Sept. 4, when the teaser ads started, the ''buzz'' about Microsoft was 25 percent positive and 13 percent negative, Mr. Marzilli said, and by Tuesday it was 28 percent positive and 8 percent negative. Microsoft ''has been beat up pretty badly by the Apple advertisements in the last six months,'' he said. ''These are strong numbers, good numbers, for Microsoft.''
 Another research company, Zeta Interactive, using what it calls its Relevant Noise tool to mine places online like blogs and message boards for brand conversations, found what was described as overwhelmingly positive buzz surrounding Microsoft from Sept. 3 through Monday. 
 Of the posts analyzed by Relevant Noise during that stage of the teaser campaign, 63 percent were characterized as positive and 37 percent as negative.
 ''It did what it needed to do,'' said Rob Reilly, partner and co-executive creative director at Crispin Porter in Boulder, Colo., and Miami. ''People who got it, got it.''
 To segue from the teaser ads to the actual campaign, he added, the phrase ''I'm a PC'' will serve to ''set up the notion the real PC is not necessarily who we've been portrayed as'' in the Apple ads.
 ''You can ignore it,'' Mr. Reilly said of the Apple campaign, ''or you can find a clever way to embrace it, to hug it to death, to turn it to your advantage.''
 The celebration of PC users is intended to show them ''connected to this community,'' he added, ''of people who are creative, who are passionate.''
 As for the risks of responding to a smaller competitor, ''Apple has done a tremendous job marketing their products,'' Mr. Reilly said, so ''I don't know if it's David versus Goliath anymore.''
 The theme of ''Life without walls'' was the concept for the Microsoft campaign ''from the beginning,'' he added, because it declares ''that the goal of Windows is to help remove the walls in your life, now and in the future.''
 In addition to commercials on television shows like ''Grey's Anatomy'' on Thursday, ads will appear in local and national newspapers in addition to new content added to the windows.com Web site, which will be reachable from the microsite lifewithoutwalls.com.
 Coming magazine and outdoor ads focus on how Windows can be used for mobile devices, TV sets and laptops along with PCs.
 Beginning on Thursday night, visitors to windows.com will be able to upload video clips and photographs demonstrating how they, too, are PCs. Some photos will be chosen to appear on electronic signs in Times Square from Friday through Oct. 13 and others will be chosen for use in Microsoft banner ads.
 ''This is just the beginning, the first phase of the campaign,'' said Mich Mathews, senior vice president for marketing at Microsoft. ''We're on a journey to reposition the PC.''
 ''The conventional wisdom may be, 'Hey this is motivated by Apple,' '' she added, ''but there has been a re-engineering of Microsoft.'' 
 Ms. Mathews listed several steps to improve the consumer perception of Windows, which has been tarnished by problems with the Vista operating systems. Among them are the hiring by Microsoft of hundreds of trained employees, or Windows gurus, to work at retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City.
 As for Mr. Seinfeld, will he return at some point?
 ''Jerry is a friend of the agency and Microsoft,'' Mr. Reilly of Crispin Porter said, adding in a sly allusion to Brand X, ''You like to keep your friends close -- and your enemies closer.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: After a series of teaser ads, Microsoft is beginning in earnest an ad campaign to repair its image, including a spot with a diver in a shark cage, and another with Bill Gates.
 A Microsoft engineer resembling a character in Apple's ads appears: ''Hello, I'm a PC, and I've been made into a stereotype.''

HEADLINE: McCain Seen as Less Likely To Bring Change, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by Marjorie Connelly in Washington, and Marina Stefan, Dalia Sussman and Megan Thee in New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Despite an intense effort to distance himself from the way his party has done business in Washington, Senator John McCain is seen by voters as far less likely to bring change to Washington than Senator Barack Obama. He is widely viewed as a ''typical Republican'' who would continue or expand President Bush's policies, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 Polls taken after the Republican convention suggested that Mr. McCain had enjoyed a surge of support -- particularly among white women after his selection of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate -- but the latest poll indicates ''the Palin effect'' was, at least so far, a limited burst of interest. The contest appeared to be roughly where it was before the two conventions and before the vice-presidential selections: Mr. Obama had the support of 48 percent of registered voters, compared with 43 percent for Mr. McCain, a difference within the poll's margin of sampling error, and statistically unchanged from the tally in the last New York Times/CBS News poll, in mid-August. 
 The poll showed that Mr. McCain had some enduring strengths, including a substantial advantage over Mr. Obama as a potential commander in chief. It found that for the first time, 50 percent of those surveyed in the Times/CBS News poll said they considered that the troop buildup in Iraq, a policy that Mr. McCain championed from the start, had made things better there.
 The poll also underlined the extent to which Mr. McCain's convention, and his selection of Ms. Palin, had excited Republican base voters about his candidacy, which is no small thing in a contest that continues to be so tight: 47 percent of Mr. McCain's supporters described themselves as enthused about the Republican Party's presidential ticket, almost twice what it was before the conventions. As often happens at this time of year, partisans are coalescing around their party's nominees and independents are increasingly the battleground.
 But the Times/CBS News poll suggested that Ms. Palin's selection has, to date, helped Mr. McCain only among Republican base voters; there was no evidence of significantly increased support for him among women in general. White women were evenly divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama; before the conventions, Mr. McCain led Mr. Obama among white women, 44 percent to 37 percent.
 By contrast, at this point in the 2004 campaign, President Bush was leading Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic challenger, by 56 percent to 37 percent among white women.
 Among other groups, Mr. Obama had a slight edge among independents, and a 16-percentage-point lead among voters ages 18 to 44. Mr. McCain was leading by 17 points among white men and by the same margin among voters 65 and over. Before the convention, voters 65 and older were closely divided. In the latest poll, middle-age voters, 45 to 64, were almost evenly divided between the two.
 The latest Times/CBS News nationwide telephone poll was taken Friday through Tuesday with 1,133 adults, including 1,004 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all respondents and for registered voters. 
 The poll was taken during a period of extraordinary turmoil on Wall Street. By overwhelming numbers, Americans said the economy was the top issue affecting their vote decision, and they continued to express deep pessimism about the nation's economic future. They continued to express greater confidence in Mr. Obama's ability to manage the economy, even as Mr. McCain has aggressively sought to raise doubts about it.
 This poll found evidence of concern about Ms. Palin's qualifications to be president, particularly compared with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Mr. Obama's running mate. More than 6 in 10 said they would be concerned if Mr. McCain could not finish his term and Ms. Palin had to take over. In contrast, two-thirds of voters surveyed said Mr. Biden would be qualified to take over for Mr. Obama, a figure that cut across party lines.
 And 75 percent said they thought Mr. McCain had picked Ms. Palin more to help him win the election than because he thought that she was well qualified to be president; by contrast, 31 percent said they thought that Mr. Obama had picked Mr. Biden more to help him win the election, while 57 percent said it was because he thought Mr. Biden was well qualified for the job.
 This poll was taken right after Ms. Palin sat down for a series of high-profile interviews with Charles Gibson on ABC News.
 Over the last two weeks, Mr. McCain has increasingly tried to distance himself from his party and President Bush, running as an outsider against Washington. The poll suggested the urgency of Mr. McCain's task: The percentage of Americans who disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is conducting his job, 68 percent, was as high as it has been for any sitting president in the history of New York Times polling. And 81 percent said the country was heading in the wrong direction.
 The poll found that 46 percent of voters thought Mr. McCain would continue Mr. Bush's policies, while 22 percent said he would be more conservative than Mr. Bush. (About one-quarter said a McCain presidency would be less conservative than Mr. Bush's.) At a time when Mr. McCain has tried to appeal to independent voters by separating himself from his party, notably with his convention speech, 57 percent of all voters said they viewed him as a typical Republican, compared with 40 percent who said he was a different kind of Republican.
 Although nearly half of voters also described Mr. Obama as a typical Democrat, the party's brand is not as diminished as the Republicans'; the Democratic Party had a favorability rating of 50 percent in August, compared with 37 percent for the Republicans, a fairly consistent trend in the Times/CBS News Poll since 2006, and part of the general political landscape that many analysts believe favors the Democrats.
 In one of the sharpest differences highlighted in the poll, 37 percent said that Mr. McCain would bring real change to Washington, up from 28 percent before the two parties' conventions. But 65 percent of those polled said that Mr. Obama would bring real change to Washington.
 Despite weeks of fierce Republican attacks, Mr. Obama has maintained an edge on several key measures of presidential leadership, including economic stewardship. Sixty percent of voters said they were confident in his ability to make the right decisions on the economy, compared with 53 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain. Sixty percent also said he understood the needs and problems ''of people like yourself,'' compared with 48 percent who said that of Mr. McCain.
 More than twice as many said an Obama presidency would improve the image of the United States around the world, 55 percent, compared with those who believed a McCain presidency would do so. Mr. Obama also gets high marks for ''sharing the values most Americans try to live by,'' despite concerted Republican efforts to portray him as elite and out of touch with average voters. Sixty-six percent said Mr. Obama shared their values, compared with 61 percent who said that about Mr. McCain.
 Mr. McCain, however, was maintaining some core advantages, particularly on preparedness to be president and ability to serve as commander in chief. Forty-eight percent said Mr. Obama was prepared enough to be president, compared with 71 percent who rated Mr. McCain as adequately prepared. 
 Fifty-two percent said it was ''very likely'' that Mr. McCain would be an effective commander in chief, twice as many as felt that way about Mr. Obama.
 The two men received similar rankings when voters were asked about what had long been perceived as a McCain strength: the ability to make the right decisions about the war in Iraq. Fifty-two percent said they were ''very'' or ''somewhat'' confident in Mr. Obama's ability on this front; 56 percent said they felt that way about Mr. McCain.
 In general, Ms. Palin was viewed more favorably (40 percent) than unfavorably (30 percent). She was particularly popular among fellow Republicans, conservatives and white voters who describe themselves as evangelical Christians, which explains her energizing effect on the Republican base. Nearly 70 percent of Mr. McCain's supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Ms. Palin; 27 percent of Mr. Obama's supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Mr. Biden.
 When asked who they thought would win in November, 45 percent said Mr. Obama and 38 percent said Mr. McCain.

HEADLINE: In Washington, Financial Furor Is a First-Rate Chance to Assess Blame

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When the fingers of blame are pointing in all directions, as they are even while the nation's financial crisis is still unfolding, this much is inevitable: the pointers as well as the pointees are getting poked in the eyes.
 In the culture of Washington, few rituals are as predictable as the blame game, and this one was under way even before the government's quasinationalization of the American International Group late Tuesday. With just 47 days until the presidential election, the game is all the more hard-fought because the stakes are so high. 
 ''Whether it's a banking crisis, a food scare, Hurricane Katrina or Iraq, anytime something in the public policy arena doesn't go well, then fingers are pointing. This is Washington,'' said Bert Ely, a longtime consultant on financial institutions. 
 Already the Democrats who run Congress are scheduling hearings to get to the bottom of the mess that began more than a year ago with the housing credit crisis and that has spiraled lately to take down some of the nation's biggest names in finance.
 The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, has lambasted the White House for the crisis and announced hearings to begin this week, only to postpone them because the witnesses -- top government regulators including Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- are too busy trying to contain the damage.
 Speaking to reporters on Wednesday after a meeting with committee chairmen about the crisis, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, attacked the Bush administration, saying, ''Because of the inattention or a decision on their part to have crony capitalism in our country, Americans across the country are feeling the pain of this.''
 She said the committees headed by Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Henry A. Waxman of California would hold hearings to ''examine the Bush administration's mismanagement of financial market regulation and how it led us to this remarkable failure.''
 Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said his committee would examine ''what was happening with the people who were in charge in the Bush administration and in the regulatory agencies headed by people appointed by President Bush.'' 
 Yet Congress, too, is coming in for blame, both from within -- pitting Democrats against Republicans and the House versus the Senate -- and from without. 
 After Mr. Dodd previewed his coming hearings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by telling Bloomberg Television, ''I have a lot of questions about where was the administration over the last eight years,'' one former White House economic adviser, Allan Hubbard, counterattacked. He wrote a column in The Washington Post, headlined, ''Where Was Sen. Dodd?''
 Mr. Hubbard's column was unusual by Washington blame-game standards for giving Congress the heat it gives out. In addition to Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hubbard singled out Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, as well as Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee. 
 Mr. Hubbard wrote that the Bush and Clinton administrations had tried to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but that each time, Congressional Democrats beholden to the companies' lobbyists quashed the regulatory proposals.
 Mr. Hubbard did not note, however, that some well-known Republican lawmakers and lobbyists had also protected Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Both Democrats and Republicans have also taken turns in the companies' executive ranks. 
 But Democrats especially have long favored the two companies, which enjoyed implicit government backing, given their responsibility to keep mortgage funds flowing to banks and support construction of affordable housing.
 In making that point recently, the conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal skewered Mr. Frank. On Wednesday, it published his lengthy rebuttal -- Mr. Frank called the editorial against him ''one of the most dishonest pieces of journalism I have seen'' -- but alongside it the paper ran a new editorial, titled ''Barney's Rubble,'' again blaming him and other Democrats for the Fannie and Freddie mess.
 For their part, Democrats as well as nonpartisan critics have renewed longstanding complaints that Republicans, while they controlled the House and Senate for the dozen years up to 2007, permitted Congress's constitutional oversight powers to atrophy so that federal regulatory agencies and industries went largely unexamined. With Republicans in control of both Congress and the White House for the first six years of Mr. Bush's tenure, a climate favoring deregulation prevailed, which spawned the current crisis, Democrats assert.
 The back-and-forth has been most prominent in the presidential campaign this week. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Obama seized on the government's bailout of A.I.G. to yet again assail the Bush administration and his Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, for their ''failed economic philosophy of the last eight years'' that opposed government regulation and promoted big tax breaks for corporations. 
 On Mr. Obama's behalf, John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., issued a statement saying that ''the Bush administration and Republicans have built an unbalanced and fragile economy in which working people never share in Wall Street's gain but must shoulder its failures.''
 Mr. McCain, meanwhile, has struck an increasingly populist tone and tried to divert voters' attention to Wall Street, where financiers' ''greed and corruption'' are the problem, he says. Mr. McCain also faults unnamed federal regulators, though he was long a vocal fan of Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who in turn is coming in for belated blame, accused of causing the housing crisis by holding interest rates too low and neglecting the Fed's regulatory powers. (Mr. Greenspan has said he is blameless; he cites economic cycles and mortgage fraud.)
 After saying Tuesday that ''we cannot have the taxpayers bail out A.I.G. or anybody else,'' Mr. McCain issued a statement on Wednesday supporting the bailout. He attributed the cascading problems to ''failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street.''
 One thing is certain, said Mr. Ely, the longtime financial industry consultant: ''There's plenty of blame to go around.''

HEADLINE: Throwing a Lifeline To a Troubled Giant

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; Michael J. de la Merced and David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The first call from the Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. came at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, and the message was innocuous, to avoid setting off alarms. And when he finally got through to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, Mr. Paulson simply said he wanted to brief Congressional leaders ''about recent developments on the economy.''
 In fact, Mr. Paulson -- along with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- would deliver stunning news that would reverberate throughout markets worldwide and leave top lawmakers ''petrified,'' in the words of a senior aide. 
 A frenzied effort to prop up the American International Group, the ailing insurance giant, had failed. The Fed had decided it had no choice but to do the unthinkable: bail out A.I.G. with an $85 billion loan or risk a potential financial catastrophe of unknown proportions. 
 Over the preceding five days, A.I.G., the world's largest insurance company, had exhausted every other option. The company had sought a lifeline from some of the nation's largest banks, as well as from big private investment funds on Wall Street, but no one dared come to the rescue. As potential saviors pored over A.I.G.'s books, the holes they discovered kept growing -- first from $20 billion, then to $40 billion, then to $80 billion, then even more. The sharpest minds on Wall Street could not fathom where the bottom was.
 Even more than the government's decision to take control of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or its role in rescuing Bear Stearns, the decision was a watershed event. 
 Some Congressional leaders who initially seemed to accept the decision at the meeting Tuesday evening sharply questioned the move on Wednesday. They said the rescue put taxpayers' money at risk to save a private enterprise that should have been regulated more closely. 
 The debate in Washington over how and why the government bailed out A.I.G. could shape future decisions to intervene in troubled financial companies. 
 With all the attention paid to beleaguered investment banks, few seemed to realize the risks that A.I.G. posed. The company, whose businesses stretched from leasing aircraft to selling life insurance in rural India, had become dangerously entangled with the financial industry because of its web of complex insurance contracts. 
 A.I.G. began to unravel three weeks ago, when its chief executive, Robert B. Willumstad, learned that Moody's planned to lower the company's credit ratings unless it raised billions of dollars in capital. A downgrade would deal a potentially fatal blow to A.I.G.
 The news touched off a panic inside A.I.G.'s headquarters in lower Manhattan. Mr. Willumstad huddled with senior executives and bankers from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and the Blackstone Group, hoping to save his company by raising capital and selling assets. After the Bush administration took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the financial markets seemed to calm down. 
 But then the Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers began to hurtle toward bankruptcy, and Mr. Willumstad realized that A.I.G. was running out of time. His company was only days away from insolvency. 
 A.I.G. beseeched insurance regulators in New York, led by Eric R. Dinallo, to borrow $20 billion from subsidiaries. Mr. Dinallo briefed Gov. David A. Paterson of New York last Friday. The answer was clear.
 ''That's what we should do,'' the governor told Mr. Dinallo. ''Do it.'' 
 In Washington, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke watched the events unfold on Wall Street with increasing alarm. As Lehman Brothers teetered and panic threatened to engulf other Wall Street banks, Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, summoned the heads of major financial institutions to an emergency meeting at the New York Fed's headquarters on Friday evening. Mr. Paulson flew by private jet from Washington to Teeterboro, N.J., and arrived around 5 p.m. 
 At A.I.G., only blocks away, the panic was building. Mr. Willumstad called Fed officials that night to alert them that A.I.G. needed to raise $30 billion by Monday or it would face a calamitous ratings downgrade. 
 Bankers worked until dawn, poring over A.I.G.'s books. But when Mr. Paulson arrived on Saturday morning, the bankers gave him startling news: A.I.G. in fact needed $40 billion. 
 The 18th floor of A.I.G was aflutter at 9 a.m., as the company reached out to possible buyers to help it stay afloat. 
 But then Mr. Willumstad delivered grim news to Mr. Paulson and Mr. Geithner: A.I.G. no longer thought it could raise the money it needed on its own.
 Big private equity funds descended on A.I.G.'s headquarters to consider investing in the company. In one conference room, was Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, with Henry Kravis and George Roberts, the firm's founders, on speaker phone. Down the hall, J. C. Flowers, the financial services investor, was combing through the company's numbers. Other firms were also going through the books.
 But a bigger problem loomed. JPMorgan's bankers discovered the shortfall at A.I.G. was not just $40 billion, but might be closer to $65 billion, because so much of A.I.G.'s securities lending business was tied up in illiquid assets.
 Meanwhile, as concerns over Lehman and then Merrill Lynch boiled over, Mr. Paulson, from a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, worked the phones until 1 a.m. By 9 the next morning, he was back at the Fed. 
 By Sunday, K.K.R. and the Texas Pacific Group made it clear they would not come to the rescue, worried that A.I.G. might be taken over by the government, wiping out their investments. Goldman Sachs also balked. 
 Lawyers began drawing up papers for what would have seemed impossible only days before: a bankruptcy of the world's largest insurance company.
 But inside the Fed, everyone was consumed by the fates of Lehman and Merrill. When it came to A.I.G., the Fed and Treasury were in ''a listen-only mode,'' a person briefed on the talks said. Mr. Willumstad shuttled between A.I.G.'s headquarters and the Fed, pleading his case. 
 But on Monday morning, after Lehman spiraled into bankruptcy and Merrill had thrown itself the arms of Bank of America, Mr. Paulson seemed to dismiss reports that the federal government would bail out A.I.G. 
 Hours later, the Fed had taken over the discussions and asked JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to help rescue A.I.G. by arranging $75 billion in loans. But banks said they could not. Time was running out. 
 ''We began to realize that Willumstad wasn't calling the shots,'' said one banker involved in the talks. ''The banks kept calling A.I.G. to find out what was going on. The answer from top A.I.G. executives was, 'We don't know. We just don't know.' '' 
 By Monday evening, A.I.G.'s credit ratings were cut. Within 72 hours, the amount of money A.I.G. need had grown from $20 billion to $85 billion. By one internal estimate, A.I.G. might need more than $100 billion. 
 ''The threat of bankruptcy was a real threat,'' Mr. Dinallo said. The government began to fear that the collapse of A.I.G. would lead to devastating losses across the financial industry. 
 Mr. Paulson concluded only one option remained: the Fed had to step in. By 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, the Fed had taken charge. Mr. Paulson informed the president, while the Treasury began calling Congressional leaders, saying Mr. Paulson wanted to brief them on recent developments. 
 The Fed, Mr. Paulson said, would bail out A.I.G. with an $85 billion loan. 
 The meeting Tuesday on Capitol Hill, lasted for slightly less than an hour. It was organized by Mr. Reid of Nevada, and attended by leaders of both parties, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader, and Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader. 
 The meeting, which had a somber tone from beginning to end, began with a presentation by Mr. Bernanke, who laid out the plan to rescue A.I.G., including a detailed description of its business operations, including its relatively solid insurance businesses and an overarching holding company that effectively come to function as an immense and, ultimately, failing hedge fund. 
 Among the points highlighted for lawmakers was that A.I.G. was one of the 10 most widely held stocks in 401(k) retirement plans, and that its collapse could potentially cause an enormous run on mutual funds.
 Or as Mr. Schumer explained after the meeting: ''If A.I.G. went down, it would affect Main Street more than Wall Street.'' 
 Among the questions that lawmakers posed was whether there was any way of knowing whether this would be the last major government intervention. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson said there was not, but that the economic situation would certainly get worse without government action to stabilize the insurance giant.
 Top lawmakers from both the House and Senate emerged from the meeting with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke looking grim but generally expressing support for the plan to rescue A.I.G. 
 ''It's heavy, heavy, heavy,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. ''But I don't think we have much choice.''
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said in an interview that he would use forthcoming Congressional hearings to press Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson to defend their decision to rescue A.I.G., and to prod the administration to do more to address the problems in the housing market. 
 Mr. Dodd said he twice pressed for assurances that the administration and the Fed had the legal authority for the bailout of A.I.G. and Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson said that they believed the Fed could aid any company posing systemic risk to the economy. Mr. Dodd also said they offered no rosy assurances about how the entire effort would turn out. 
 ''There were no guarantees in the room that the $85 billion would be compensated for,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''Nor is there any guarantee that this is the end of it. There may be other shoes to fall.''

HEADLINE: No Attacks, Just an Economic Plan

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
This two-minute television advertisement for Senator Barack Obama, called ''Plan for Change,'' began running Wednesday nationally and in swing states.
 PRODUCER Obama media team. 
 THE SCRIPT ''In the past few weeks, Wall Street's been rocked as banks closed and markets tumbled. But for many of you -- the people I've met in town halls, backyards and diners across America -- our troubled economy isn't news. Six hundred thousand Americans have lost their jobs since January. Paychecks are flat, and home values are falling. 
It's hard to pay for gas and groceries, and if you put it on a credit card, they've probably raised your rates. You're paying more than ever for health insurance that covers less and less. This isn't just a string of bad luck. The truth is that while you've been living up to your responsibilities, Washington has not. That's why we need change -- real change. This is no ordinary time, and it shouldn't be an ordinary election. But much of this campaign has been consumed by petty attacks and distractions that have nothing to do with you or how we get America back on track. Here's what I believe we need to do. Reform our tax system to give a $1,000 tax break to the middle class instead of showering more on oil companies and corporations that outsource our jobs. End the 'anything goes' culture on Wall Street with real regulation that protects your investments and pensions. Fast-track a plan for energy made in America that will free us from our dependence on Mideast oil in 10 years and put millions of Americans to work. Crack down on lobbyists once and for all, so their back-room deal-making no longer drowns out the voices of the middle class and undermines our common interests as Americans. And yes, bring a responsible end to the war in Iraq so we stop spending billions each month rebuilding their country when we should be rebuilding ours. Doing these things won't be easy. But we're Americans. We've met tough challenges before, and we can again. I'm Barack Obama. I hope you'll read my economic plan. I approved this message because bitter, partisan fights and outworn ideas of the left and the right won't solve the problems we face today. But a new spirit of unity and shared responsibility will.''
 ON THE SCREEN For the entire spot, Mr. Obama speaks directly into the camera, while seated in what appears to be a living room or hotel suite. Halfway through, a message pops up in the corner of the screen, directing the viewer to ''Read the whole plan: BarackObama.com/plan.'' The camera zooms in slightly near the end of the spot, as Mr. Obama begins talking about ending the war in Iraq and meeting ''tough challenges'' as Americans. 
 ACCURACY Much of what Mr. Obama says in the advertisement is a pared-down version of his economic plan, which would lower taxes for many middle-class Americans while raising taxes for those making more than $250,000. One statistic he cites, that 600,000 jobs have been lost in the United States since January, is from a Labor Department study released this month. Mr. Obama also repeats several of his campaign pledges: to promote energy alternatives, to diminish lobbyist influence in Washington and to end the war in Iraq, which he opposed from the beginning. 
 SCORECARD The spot is twice as long as the standard political advertisement, a length surely meant to cut through the clutter of other advertisements and heighten the impact of Mr. Obama's words. It also counts on viewers being drawn in by the telegenic candidate and his notable oratorical skills. The advertisement is substantive, providing a simple, easy-to-follow outline of Mr. Obama's campaign promises, but its length and monotonous visuals could lose the viewer's attention. JULIE BOSMAN

HEADLINE: Biden's Record on Race Is Scuffed by 3 Episodes

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del. 

 BODY:
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. says he entered public life in the late 1960s dismayed by the riots of that era and inspired by the quest for racial justice.
 ''I wasn't at the bridge at Selma,'' he said in an interview, ''but the struggle for civil rights was the animating political element of my life.''
 Mr. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, has devoted much of his 35 years in the Senate, including eight years as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to matters of race and civil rights. He has been instrumental in expanding voting rights, supporting affirmative action, passing the Violence Against Women Act, expanding the definition of hate crimes and working toward ending employment discrimination.
 Mr. Biden now hopes to cap his career by being elected vice president to the first African-American president. 
 But three episodes from his Senate career show how treacherous issues of race remain and have left scuff marks on what most agree is an otherwise admirable record. They concerned busing, criminal sentencing and the confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
 In 1978, as Mr. Biden was seeking re-election, his hometown, Wilmington, was in turmoil over a federally mandated cross-district school busing plan.
 Although the segregation of Wilmington's schools was for the most part a result of housing and economic patterns, and not of deliberate government actions, the federal courts imposed a busing plan that many parents and politicians, including Mr. Biden, considered punitive. 
 It erased district lines between the largely black Wilmington schools and predominantly white suburban districts. Tens of thousands of city and suburban children would be bused to school, sometimes dozens of miles from their homes.
 In September, just as school was about to start, teachers went on strike over pay issues raised by the busing plan. Mr. Biden, who strongly believed in integration and equal education, was torn. White parents cursed him at public meetings. Nervous black civil rights leaders looked to him to find a way to integrate the schools without forcing inner-city students to travel miles into hostile suburban turf.
 It was, Mr. Biden wrote in his 2007 autobiography, ''Promises to Keep,'' a ''liberal train wreck.''
 Mr. Biden tried to salve both sides by introducing legislation to outlaw certain types of court-ordered busing while retaining the court's power to end segregation when it had been deliberately imposed by school districts. His position put him in league with some Southern segregationists in the Senate and left him at odds with African-American leaders.
 ''A few of my colleagues pulled me aside to ask how and when 'the racists had gotten to me,' '' Mr. Biden wrote in his book. 
 ''Joe and I had a little run-in on busing,'' said Littleton P. Mitchell, the longtime head of the Delaware N.A.A.C.P. and a friend and supporter of Mr. Biden. ''He has adequately represented our community for many years, but he quivered that one time on busing.'' 
 Mr. Biden also angered white parents by saying that he would support using federal helicopters if the city's schools could not be integrated any other way. ''I couldn't live that comment down for years,'' he said in the interview.
 The episode threatened to alienate him from his two key constituencies, working class whites and African-Americans. But the end of the teacher's strike in October eased tensions and Mr. Biden retained his seat, as he has every six years since, with overwhelming black support.
 A few years later, as drug-fueled violence ravaged cities, Mr. Biden supported get-tough-on-crime measures that included changes in federal sentencing laws to try to deal with sharp racial differences in the length of prison terms, increased spending on drug law enforcement and the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences for federal crimes. 
 One of the changes substantially increased federal penalties for possession and sale of even small quantities of crack cocaine because it was ruining lives and causing murderous urban turf wars. Penalties for possession of powder cocaine, which tended to be used by more affluent people in cities and suburbs, were only a fraction as harsh as for crack.
 Scholars say that those actions have led to significantly higher incarceration rates for blacks and other minorities.
 Mr. Biden makes no apologies for supporting the measures but is troubled by the disproportionate number of blacks in prisons. He has introduced legislation to give judges more discretion in sentencing and to end the disparity in penalties for crack and powder cocaine.
 ''I knew more people would be locked up across the board,'' he said. ''I acknowledged that, but I also said it would drive down crime.''
 Bishop Thomas Wesley Weeks Sr., pastor of the New Destiny Fellowship Church in Wilmington, said that he was unhappy at the time by Mr. Biden's advocacy of tougher sentences that disproportionately affected African-Americans. 
 ''We felt the way they enforced the drug laws was unfair,'' said Mr. Weeks, who has known Mr. Biden for 28 years. ''A lot of the issue is around cocaine, where African-Americans would normally get caught while white counterparts don't get locked up.''
 He said he was pleased, however, that Mr. Biden was trying to fix the problem.
 Mr. Biden said that one of his proudest moments as a senator was his conduct as Judiciary Committee chairman during the 1987 Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Robert H. Bork. Mr. Biden opposed the nomination, which was defeated, because of what he considered Mr. Bork's restrictive views of civil rights and women's rights and his overly restrictive reading of the Constitution. Four years later, Mr. Biden oversaw another Supreme Court confirmation, for Clarence Thomas, the second African-American to be nominated to the high court.
 Mr. Biden makes no mention of the Thomas hearings in his 365-page biography, a lapse he attributes to his publisher's lack of interest.
 But in the interview, Mr. Biden called the Thomas nomination an ''incendiary bomb'' that landed in his committee, packed with explosive questions of race, sex and affirmative action. Justice Thomas was confirmed by one of the closest Supreme Court confirmation votes in Senate history.
 Mr. Biden said that polls taken after the hearings showed that the majority of the public considered them to have been fair. But he took heat from liberal interest groups for limiting the testimony about Justice Thomas's private life and from Thomas supporters for conducting a senatorial circus. 
 Justice Thomas, in his autobiography ''My Grandfather's Son,'' essentially accuses Mr. Biden of leading the ''high-tech lynch mob'' that tried to string him up. Former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, Mr. Thomas's most ardent defender, said in an interview that while he considered the hearings a travesty, he did not completely blame Mr. Biden.
 ''I don't go as far as Clarence,'' Mr. Danforth said. ''I don't think he was the leader of the lynch mob. I think what he was was the park superintendent at the site at which the lynching took place.''
 Mr. Biden said only, ''That was a very controversial nomination.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s record on race and civil rights misstated the timing of a 1978 teachers' strike over pay issues raised by a busing plan in his hometown, Wilmington, Del. The school district announced the end of the strike on Nov. 20, two weeks after Mr. Biden was re-elected to the Senate. It was not settled in October before the election.

HEADLINE: Investors, Hungry for Hope, Send Dow Up 410

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Matthew Saltmarsh and Heather Timmons contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A seesaw day on Wall Street ended with a rush of euphoria Thursday as investors raced back into beaten-down banking shares, heartened by signs that the government is taking more drastic steps to tamp down problems plaguing the financial markets. 
 In a rally that came in the final hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrials surged to a 410-point gain, nearly erasing the 449-point loss sustained on Wednesday. 
 But it was by no means a sign that the crisis on Wall Street had turned a corner.
 Fear and stress still abounded in the credit markets, where investors flocked to the safety of Treasury bills and banks charged each other higher loan rates, a reflection of lingering anxiety about the health of the financial industry.
 As investors grapple with the once-unthinkable developments that have rocked the world of finance in the last week, lending to consumers and some businesses has tightened, drying up an important lubricant of the economy even as growth continues to contract. 
 ''We are still in a flight-to-quality mode,'' said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond investment firm in Burlington, Vt. ''When I assess the mood on my trading desk, people are still very concerned that we have not seen the end of this crisis.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 4.33 percent, to 1,206.51, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.86 percent, to 11,019.69 The Nasdaq composite jumped 4.78 percent.
 Analysts attributed the stock market rally not to a fundamental improvement in the financial environment, but rather to reports that the government might be planning to quarantine some of the worst assets held by major banks.
 Sentiment was also buoyed when regulators announced actions intended to blunt the impact of short sellers, investors who bet that a stock's price will drop. Some banks and government officials have blamed short sellers for the precipitous drops in shares of big banks over the last few months, including the decline that played a role in the downfall of Lehman Brothers this week. 
 Shares of the last two independent investment banks standing, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, seesawed a day after suffering steep losses. Investors worried that the banks could face fates similar to those of Lehman and Merrill Lynch, which sold itself Sunday to Bank of America to avert a deepening financial crisis.
 Morgan Stanley stock ended up 3.7 percent, but Goldman Sachs closed down, one of the few major financial companies to end the day in the red. Goldman shares lost 5.7 percent; earlier they were down as much as 25 percent, reflecting the uncertainty over the bank's future.
 Wachovia, the banking giant that is considering a possible merger with Morgan Stanley, jumped nearly 60 percent; Washington Mutual, the troubled savings and loan that has also been working on efforts to save itself, gained 49 percent. 
 For the first time since Lehman collapsed and the American International Group was rescued, President Bush made a brief statement in Washington, saying the government would ''act to strengthen and stabilize our financial markets and improve investor confidence.''
 Earlier, the Federal Reserve said it would extend an effort that allows central banks around the world to lend dollars in foreign economies. The Fed will provide an extra $180 billion under the program to grease the wheels of finance. 
 Despite the surge in stocks, investors remained wary about lending to businesses and to one another. The cost to insure companies' debt, a measure of investors' confidence in the firms, remained at historically high levels, analysts said, although the cost declined slightly from Wednesday.
 Investors displayed a strong preference for safer and more tradable government securities than other short-term, private debt. The cost of several types of corporate and bank borrowing remained high and, in some cases, increased further. A gauge of fear -- the Libor rate, which measures how much banks charge one another for overnight loans -- remained elevated on Thursday.
 Treasury notes and bonds sold off in the afternoon but the price of short-term government debt remained elevated. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill, which falls when the price rises, was 0.076 percent, little changed from 0.061 percent on Wednesday. A week ago, the yield was 1.644 percent.
 The sharp move in the last few days suggests that some investors are willing to receive virtually no return to hold a Treasury bill, thought to be among the safest of all investments. By contrast, interest rates on three-month commercial paper, a competing form of private borrowing used by banks and corporations, jumped to 3.32 percent, from 3.17 percent on Wednesday and 2.86 percent a week earlier, according to Bloomberg data. 
 If the tight conditions in the money market persist, economists and analysts say it could severely limit the availability of credit to businesses and consumers. Federal Reserve data released on Thursday showed that consumer and business borrowing slowed significantly, though it continued to grow, in the second quarter.
 Commercial paper outstanding fell by 2.87 percent for the seven days that ended Wednesday, according to the Federal Reserve, its biggest one-week decline since the summer of 2007. Back then, investors became concerned about certain kinds of commercial paper that was used to buy securities backed by mortgages and other consumer debts.
 ''This is a breakdown in the system of trading bonds and a breakdown of extending credit,'' said James T. Swanson, chief investment officer at MFS Investments, a mutual fund company based in Boston. 
 Mr. Swanson said that so far, the stress had not affected most nonfinancial corporations, many of which have large holdings of cash and do not have a pressing need to borrow money. But he said companies that his analysts talk to have said the credit squeeze could start to hurt if the commercial paper market remains shut down and bank lending remains as tight as it is now.
 Sectors like energy, pharmaceuticals and technology are more flush with cash and less vulnerable to troubles in the credit markets. But others, like retail stores, restaurants and airlines, could be hurt if tight conditions persist.
 Kurt von Emster, portfolio manager of the MPM BioEquities Fund, said he had advised companies to draw down on their bridge loans from banks, because of the turmoil in the credit market. ''Those will be not only hard to come by, but impossible to come by,'' he said about bridge loans.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32, at 103 25/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.54 percent, up from 3.41 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Russia Will Buy Stocks To Combat Market Slide

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The Russian government will inject up to $20 billion into domestic stocks in an effort to halt the free fall of the Russian stock markets, President Dmitri A. Medvedev said Thursday, in the most direct effort yet to use oil profits to ease a deepening stock market crisis here. 
 The two main Russian stock exchanges remained closed Thursday after authorities halted trading Wednesday afternoon. By that time, they had each lost about 57 percent since their peaks in May -- the steepest fall of any major stock market since the current financial crisis erupted from Wall Street. 
 In addition to fallout from turmoil in New York and declining oil prices, the Russian market has been weakened by poor corporate governance standards here and investor concerns about a breach in relations with the West after the war in Georgia. 
 But unlike the American financial institutions that were bought up or declared bankruptcy this week, Russia has plenty of capital. The question is whether injecting some of it into the stock market will be enough to restore investor confidence -- or whether it will be perceived as a sign of official desperation and perhaps even reason to flee Russian securities. 
 Authorities used the market holiday to unveil measures intended to restore confidence in what had been until this year one of the world's best-performing emerging markets. 
 Under the plan, the government will directly invest 250 billion rubles, or about $10 billion, in domestic stocks in an effort to raise prices, Aleksei L. Kudrin, the finance minister said, according to Interfax. If that is not enough to stave off a market collapse, the government will amend the budget to free up another 250 billion rubles for investment. 
 Eventually, he said, the government will seek to resell the shares for a profit if markets rise. Until then, Russian taxpayers will effectively hold them.
 The plan mimicked an effort by the government of Hong Kong to invest directly in the local stock exchange during the so-called Asian contagion of the late 1990s, when many Asian markets plunged more than 60 percent. In that case, the Hong Kong government later bundled its investments into a fund that made a profit as the market rebounded. 
 The Russian government also announced lower oil export tariffs than had been expected, a move that should increase investor interest in energy companies. 
 The tariff will be lowered on Oct. 1 to $50.70 a barrel, as opposed to the $66.20 a barrel that was expected. The government had set oil tariffs based on average prices in previous months. Under the adjustment, the government used only the sharply reduced oil prices of the first weeks of September to calculate the tariff, according to an investor note from Citibank. 
 Also on Thursday, three Russian banks that had been given access to $44 billion in government money said the capital would be made available to other banks and brokerage companies investing in the stock exchanges. 
 The measures underlined an assessment offered by the International Monetary Fund that the Russian economy has ''buffers'' that should prevent a repeat of the 1998 financial crisis here. 
 ''Over all, the macroeconomic situation remains strong and the country will maintain a current-account surplus even with lower oil prices,'' a fund spokesman, David Hawley, told a news conference in Washington. 
 In one positive sign, some Russian company shares that are traded as global depository receipts in London and New York rose on Thursday. Mr. Kudrin, the finance minister, said markets would reopen Friday morning.

HEADLINE: Fed Offers $180 Billion for Ailing Money Markets

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH and KEITH BRADSHER; Heather Timmons contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Reflecting concerns about the health of the global financial system, the Federal Reserve and the world's other major central banks significantly escalated their assistance to global markets on Thursday, making almost $200 billion available after bank lending came to a near halt and threatened the global economy. 
 In a statement released at 3 a.m. in Washington, just as the markets opened in Europe, the Fed said that it had authorized a $180 billion expansion of its temporary reciprocal currency arrangements, known as swap lines, to allow banks to borrow more dollars in money markets at a lower rates. 
 Paul Mortimer-Lee, head of market economics in the London office at BNP Paribas, said the move reflected concerns that the financial markets now appeared to be facing their gravest problems since the Depression. 
 ''We're high on a mountain, with a thin rope and holding on by our fingertips,'' he said. ''Are policy makers scared? They should be.'' 
 The concerted central bank action follows the rout on financial markets this week as the bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection, the brokerage firm Merrill Lynch lost its independence and Washington announced an $85 billion bailout of the American International Group, the insurance giant. 
 The move seemed to cheer equity investors, who reversed part of the earlier deep slide in Asian markets and bid stocks up in Europe. American stock indexes opened with strong gains, with the Dow Jones industrials rising more than 100 points in early trading.
 The central problem is that, lacking confidence in one another's ability to repay, banks have slowed their lending to each other via the money markets. The short-term rates at which they borrow have surged as they seek to keep cash on their books. 
 Besides the Fed, the coordinated action involved the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and central banks in Canada, Switzerland and Britain. 
 Analysts are starting to talk about the need for much more intervention from Washington, warning that Thursday's move would not provide a quick fix to unlock bank lending. 
 Writing in The Financial Times on Thursday, Kenneth S. Rogoff, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said the United States would have to spend 5 to 10 times as much as it already has on bailouts, an amount closer to $1 trillion to $2 trillion. 
 The monetary fund had estimated in April that the losses related to the crisis, which started in mortgage markets in the United States, would be $1 trillion. 
 Such a rescue would dwarf the huge bailout of the American financial system in the 1980s by the Resolution Trust Corporation, a government-owned, asset-management company charged with liquidating assets of thrifts and the Japanese government's mass purchase of bad debts from banks during the 1990s. 
 ''We are moving from a monetary solution to a fiscal solution,'' said Richard McGuire, a fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London. He said that while the central banks' moves had helped, other efforts would be needed. 
 Traders usually look at spreads in the money markets to measure the health of the money markets and judge whether banks are willing to lend to one another -- and ultimately to consumers. Spreads are the differences between interest rate charges overnight and those charged over a longer period. 
 After the fund injections by the banks, the cost of borrowing dollars overnight fell, with the benchmark Libor rate falling 1.19 percentage points, to 3.84 percent, Bloomberg News reported, citing the British Bankers' Association. 
 But the gap between three-month United States Treasury yields and the three-month London interbank, or Libor, rate -- known in the market as the TED Spread -- narrowed only slightly, to around 299 basis points at midday in London, from just over 300 basis points Thursday. A similar slight narrowing of spreads was seen in sterling and euro markets. 
 ''The dust may settle and the market may take a more sanguine view in time,'' Mr. McGuire said, ''but for now, it looks like a palliative rather than a panacea.'' 
 In its statement Thursday, the Fed said that as part of the infusion, it had also authorized increases in the existing swap lines with the European Central Bank, up to $110 billion, from $55 billion, and the Swiss National Bank, up to $27 billion, from $15 billion. Similar arrangements were announced with the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada. 
 ''The central banks continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures,'' the European Central Bank said in a statement. 
 Smaller central banks were also active on Thursday in providing extra money to their country's financial systems so as to make sure that banks and other financial institutions could find money to borrow without having to pay exorbitant interest rates. 
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, for example, injected 1.556 billion Hong Kong dollars, worth $200 million, into the territory's banking system on Thursday afternoon, John Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, said. 
 The monetary authority acted after the interest rate that Hong Kong banks pay to borrow money overnight from one another suddenly tripled shortly after lunchtime, to 4 percent, and threatened to rise further. 
 The maneuver appeared to be successful, with overnight interest rates falling through the rest of the afternoon. Central banks in Japan, Australia and India pumped tens of billions more into money markets, while China's central bank said it had lowered the rate at which it conducts bond repurchase agreements. 
 Analysts said the central banks were doing what they could. 
 ''This is clearly a very significant help and central banks are showing decisive leadership here as risk aversion is hitting the private sector,'' said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital in London. 
 Still, noting that the Fed left its benchmark short-term rate unchanged this week, analysts said that the cash infusions did not necessarily mean that central banks would lower their benchmark short-term interest rates. 
 ''If anything,'' Mr. Callow said. ''this sends the signal that they are trying to achieve stability via money markets rather than by cutting short-term rates.''

HEADLINE: A Woman Dreams of Opening a Bookstore, and Defying the Trends

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus @nytimes.com

 BODY:
After Jessica Stockton Bagnulo, 29, graduated from New York University with an English degree in 2001, she did what she was supposed to do, which was land a coveted job as an editorial assistant at a major publishing house. 
 She cried every day.
 It wasn't that Ms. Stockton Bagnulo did not love books enough. She loved them too much. Writing book-jacket copy from a cubicle, sorting files, ''I felt so far from the things we were making,'' she recalled. 
 Longing for the part-time job she had in college, at Three Lives, an independent bookstore in the West Village, Ms. Stockton Bagnulo returned to working there on weekends to cheer herself up. At some point she realized that graduate school in creative writing was not the answer (which was good, because she didn't get in anywhere). ''Gradually,'' she said, ''it dawned on me that the big, important thing I wanted to do was open a bookstore.''
 In the age of Amazon and sky-high New York rents, that's the kind of dream that works if, like Sarah McNally, who opened the McNally Jackson bookstore in SoHo almost four years ago, your family owns a successful bookstore chain in Canada. Ms. Stockton Bagnulo had no such backup. ''I have no money, no trust fund, no wealthy relatives,'' she said. ''I don't know anyone wealthy.'' 
 Even if she did, her entrepreneurial dream might not look like the best repository for an investment: since 2000, about 75 independent bookstores in and around New York have closed, according to Eileen Dengler, executive director of the New Atlantic Independent Booksellers Association, a trade group for the tristate area. 
 Ms. Stockton Bagnulo decided that none of that should stop her. She built up experience at various independent bookstores (including, currently, McNally Jackson, where she is the events coordinator). A resident of Park Slope, she took a class from the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation. Researching business plans for bookstores at the Brooklyn Public Library, she noticed fliers for a Citibank-sponsored competition for business plans, entered it -- along with 200 other dreamers -- and won the $15,000 first prize.
 Meanwhile, a couple of neighborhoods over, in Fort Greene, a business group did a survey of residents in which 75 percent of respondents named a bookstore as their first choice for an addition to their retail landscape (which is already well-stocked with places where you can buy a $4 latte or a $150 bottle of wine). ''We were hoping to find someone who owned a bookstore already,'' said John Zeitlin, a member of the Fort Greene Indie Bookstore Initiative, an offshoot of the Fort Greene Retail Association, which conducted the survey. ''But most of them weren't in expansion mode.'' 
 The group met Ms. Stockton Bagnulo after reading about her prize in The Daily News, and this week gave her a party in the lobby of the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music to introduce her to the neighbors and enlist their help, financial and otherwise.
 A tough week for everyone, it has been particularly rough in its own way for literary types, who learned on Sunday that David Foster Wallace had hanged himself, then opened up New York magazine on Monday to find a story about the book publishing industry titled, simply, ''The End.'' The Fort Greene party, given everything else going on in the world, felt like a pocket of irrational exuberance, even extravagance -- a through-the-looking-glass scene in which an independent bookstore, of all things, was the cause for great optimism and celebration. 
 Sushi donated by a local restaurant owner decked a generous buffet table, and bookish volunteers from around the city -- a librarian's 20-something son, a woman who works for the book publisher John Wiley & Sons -- offered the 300 guests wine (also donated by a local merchant). Literary stars from the neighborhood -- Colson Whitehead, Jennifer Egan and even Jhumpa Lahiri, the book world's Garbo -- all showed up to offer support.
 Halfway through the event, Ms. Stockton Bagnulo announced with glee that she had a business partner -- Rebecca Fitting, a 34-year-old sales representative for Random House who decided a few weeks earlier to devote a sizable chunk of her nest egg to the cause of making the store a reality. Now they just needed a space, and enough additional money to give them the leeway to do it right. 
 A competition, a party, overflowing community support, celebrities of a sort, an energetic young woman prone to saying plucky things like ''All I had was my ambition and my passion'' -- these are the ingredients of a story of someone realizing a remarkable dream, like crossing the Atlantic in a hot air balloon. That opening a humble local bookstore in New York has more in common with that kind of improbable adventure than, say, opening a dry cleaner is, in its own way, a depressing sign of the times. 
 ''Maybe I'm an optimist, but I see the other side of it,'' said Ms. Stockton Bagnulo. ''Which is that only a bookstore can inspire this kind of passion.''

HEADLINE: A Golden Pond: Winnipesaukee's New Mansions

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
FOR years, the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee have been dotted with quaint, unassuming cottages, modest places to hang your hiking shoes or moor a boat after a day of exploring the beauty of central New Hampshire. 
 Nowadays, the cottages are still sought after, but in many instances, it is to tear one down to make way for something much, much larger, like the 6,000-square-foot, $3.9 million home being built on the site where a 1950s island cottage once stood. 
 Despite a reputation for having fast boats, loud motorcycles, suburban families and rustic camps, Lake Winnipesaukee has become a retreat for the wealthy, who have built opulent waterfront homes and compounds. 
 ''We used to be building Buicks; now we're building Bentleys,'' said Joe Skiffington, a luxury developer and owner of Skiffington Homes, which specializes in lakefront homes with stone fireplaces, post-and-beam screened porches and elevators. ''Any waterfront has become a target for the wealthy.'' 
 The shift in the second-home market started about 10 years ago, well before the current turmoil in the real estate and financial markets, agents and economists say, as more wealthy people built houses on the lake, which is less than two hours by car from Boston and about five and a half hours from New York City. 
 With its rippling surface and breathtaking panoramas of mountains, islands and towering pine trees, it is no surprise that the 69.67-square-mile lake has become a major destination. Small summer cottages started popping up on the lake at the beginning of the 20th century, along with children's summer camps, said Ann Sprague of the Lake Winnipesaukee Historical Society. In the 1950s and 60s, the lake became extremely popular among middle-class families from Boston and New York, who spent vacations in small cabins or camps on its shores. 
 But in the 1970s, many second-home builders started buying the camp lands, Ms. Sprague said. Since then, the lake has changed. 
 Gone are many of the cabins and the camps, replaced with the 81 homes built on its shores since 2000. Twenty-two of them are on the market, and all but two have asking prices of more than $1 million. Many of them are large Adirondack-style homes, with wooden exteriors and expansive decks, while others are more in the Nantucket style, whitewashed and window-filled. 
 Many of the new homes have amenities like backyard fire pits, marble tubs and finished basements that might include a full bar, an exercise room, a regulation-size pool table and a mud room, said Mr. Skiffington, who builds four or five new lakefront homes a year. Many clients are requesting elevators, he said, but they want them discreetly to resemble a closet.
 These stand in stark contrast to the old cabins, small and brown, that are sprinkled among the large homes. 
 THERE are 205 homes on the lake listed for sale through the local master listing service and 115 of them have asking prices of $1 million or more. 
 The median price of a lake home is about $1 million, according to Russ Thibeault, president of Applied Economic Research, which studies New Hampshire's economy. That figure is about double what it was in 2000, he noted, while the median price of a year-round home in New Hampshire is $237,100, about $13,000 less than what it was in 2005. The median price of a year-round house in Belknap County, where much of the lake sits, is $206,500, about $14,000 less than in 2005. 
 ''There's been a significant shift in the market appeal of Lake Winnipesaukee,'' Mr. Thibeault said. ''When I first moved here 30 years ago, there were a number of small camps local people -- plumbers, electricians -- had on the lake. You fast forward to today and the lake is really only affordable to the very affluent.'' 
 Bob Ryan, a retired foreign exchange trader from Long Island, said he and his wife started searching for a peaceful retirement home with a waterfront view about four years ago, looking in the Hamptons, Pennsylvania and along the Connecticut River. They happened upon Lake Winnipesaukee while searching for property in New Hampshire last year and immediately realized it was where they wanted to live. 
 ''It is what we were looking for and more,'' said Mr. Ryan. ''This is the place I wish I bought 20 years ago.'' 
 He said he likes that his home is five miles from a town, secluded and quiet. There is no lack of things to do, with restaurants nearby and minor league sporting events within an hour-and-a-half drive away, in Manchester or in Portland, Me. 
 He was loath to look in eastern New Hampshire, as he thought it was too crowded, but found out that is not the case. 
 ''Winnipesaukee is tucked in the middle,'' he said. ''You have to get to it. You don't just stumble on it. It's a jewel.'' 
 Mr. Ryan and his wife bought a 5,200-square-foot home in Alton, and every room has a lake view, he said. Mr. Ryan would not say how much he paid, but public records show the home was purchased for $1.8 million last August. 
 The expansion of the nearby Laconia Airport about three years ago made the area a destination for those with private jets, dozens of which are parked there each weekend.
 The lake also counts the extremely wealthy and famous among its summer residents. Mitt Romney, the former presidential candidate and governor of Massachusetts, owns a home in Wolfeboro and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France stayed at the Wolfeboro home of a Microsoft executive last summer. The Marriott family owns a compound in Wolfeboro, and Bob Bahre, a former owner of the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, owns a 29,000-square-foot house in Alton.
 In an interview, Mr. Romney said he summered as a child at the Marriotts' compound, and brought his five sons up each summer for boating. He and his wife, Ann, purchased a home in Wolfeboro 12 years ago. Mr. Romney said the low-key atmosphere and watersports were the driving factors behind their purchase.
 ''It's not a social scene for people looking for jet setters and social events, as I'm sure places in the Hamptons or other venues are much higher on that scale,'' Mr. Romney said. ''This is very much New England, with understatement and privacy as some of the key features.''
 Property records show that Ann Romney purchased a home for $2.5 million in 1997 and another property for $84,900 in 2004.
 But mostly it is business executives who are buying on the lake, many of them in preparation for retirement, said Susan Bradley, an agent with Coldwell Banker in Laconia. 
 ''It's really been a rapid trend change,'' said Ms. Bradley, who sells homes on Governors Island, one of the lake's most sought-after addresses. ''Even 10 years ago, we didn't see numbers like this. We saw bigger homes being built, not to the magnitude that we're seeing now.'' 
 NATURALLY, the most affluent want to live right on the water. As more and more pieces of waterfront land are being bought -- especially in Wolfeboro, the wealthiest of the towns -- prices are rising. 
 ''It's liquid gold,'' said Dennis Schauer, an agent with Prudential Spencer-Hughes in Wolfeboro. ''They're not making any more waterfront.'' 
 That means that villages like Moultonborough, the most rural of the towns on the lake; Gilford, known for its campgrounds; and Laconia, home of the annual Motorcycle Week, are all seeing dramatic changes. 
 Steve Alley, who has lived in Gilford all his life, grew up among rustic summer camps, which gave way to small homes and now mansions. Mr. Alley knew it was just a matter of time before the lake attracted the wealthy.
 ''We're two hours from Boston, an hour to the Mount Washington Valley, two hours to the beach,'' Mr. Alley said. ''And what we have right here is paradise.''
 Some residents aren't so sure any more. David St. Cyr, 60, who owns a small cabin in Alton, thinks the recent influx makes the lake too crowded. He refuses to take his boat out because of all the traffic, and said he couldn't now afford to buy the cabin he and his wife bought in 1983 and live in. 
 ''Now, if you don't have money here, you ain't getting nothing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For New Pickups, Ford and Chrysler Talk About Fuel Efficiency

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: ALLEN PARK, Mich. 

 BODY:
Automakers usually introduce a new pickup model by boasting that it is bigger and beefier than the old model.
 This year, with the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler both unveiling new pickups in one of the weakest truck markets in decades, their messages are all about higher fuel economy and gas-saving features, like a more efficient engine, lighter components and more aerodynamic design. 
 Chrysler's new Dodge Ram is arriving at dealerships this month, and the Ford F-150 is scheduled to go on sale in late fall, after a two-month delay to let dealers sell more of their remaining inventory of 2008 versions.
 ''We've been sweating the details trying to make this product as fuel-efficient as possible,'' Matt O'Leary, the F-150's chief engineer, said Thursday while showing reporters the 2009 model. ''It's hundreds of little actions that get you there.''
 Ford says that the new F-150 is, on average, 8 percent more fuel efficient -- an improvement of 1 or 2 miles per gallon -- than its predecessor, and that some versions will be as much as 12 percent more efficient. Ford says one new version, the F-150 SFE, for ''superior fuel economy,'' will get 21 miles per gallon on the highway and 15 in city driving.
 Chrysler improved the fuel efficiency of the 2009 Ram by as much as 20 percent, to ratings of up to 20 miles per gallon on the highway.
 Ford hopes the higher gas mileage numbers will help it sell more trucks at a time when, according to its consumer research, fuel economy has become the third most important factor for truck shoppers, behind quality and value.
 Small improvements in fuel economy are particularly important for businesses and governments that buy fleets of pickups, said Art Spinella of CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore.
 ''Fleet administrators look at cost per mile down to a hundredth of a penny,'' Mr. Spinella said.
 Ford said it improved fuel economy by using lighter steel to remove about 100 pounds, and by making subtle changes like designing a more aerodynamic bumper and tailgate. 
 Mr. Spinella said the company must be careful not to compromise the ''built Ford tough'' reputation that it has spent decades building, even as it appeals to customers concerned with fuel costs.
 ''They can't water down that message,'' he said.
 All three Detroit automakers have been shifting their focus toward small cars as consumer demand for them grows rapidly. But profit margins are much smaller on those autos than on pickups and sport utility vehicles.
 Though it is far from an ideal time to sell trucks, the segment has rebounded somewhat since bottoming out in May, Ford's chief sales analyst, George Pipas, said. Full-size pickups were 8.6 percent of the auto market four months ago but accounted for 13.6 percent in August.
 ''Trucks are always going to be an important part of the business at Ford,'' Mr. Pipas said. ''I can't see a day when trucks are not our No. 1 product.''

HEADLINE: Privately Owned Fisheries May Help Shore Up Stocks

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
Giving people ownership rights in marine fisheries can halt or even reverse catastrophic declines in commercial stocks, researchers in California and Hawaii are reporting.
 The idea goes against the grain among people who believe that anyone with grit and skill should be able to get in a boat, put to sea and make a living fishing. But that approach, even with licensing requirements and other restrictions, has produced fishing efforts so intense that by some estimates, the world's commercial stocks will collapse in a few decades. 
 By contrast, the researchers write in Friday's issue of the journal Science, allocating ownership shares of a particular fishery to individuals, cooperatives, communities or other entities gives them a reason to nurture the stock. In this arrangement, scientists set acceptable catch levels, and other authorities allocate shares, species by species, region by region. 
 As a local stock grows, shares in it -- called catch shares or individual transferable quotas -- become more valuable, just as shares of a company's stock become more valuable as the business prospers. Those who have shares in a catch have a powerful incentive for doing everything they can to protect the stock. 
 ''You get this very positive, very striking result,'' said Christopher Costello, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the lead author of the report. 
 Benefits of the approach have been seen before. In Alaska, a catch-share system adopted in 1995 has transformed an intense race to catch the last allowable fish into a sustainable and profitable fishery. But the researchers said their study was the first global assessment of this kind of rights-based management. 
 Other researchers said the new study was likely to be influential as officials who manage fisheries around the world considered how to stave off disastrous declines. 
 Ray Hilborn, a fisheries expert at the University of Washington, praised the new work but said: ''There is nothing surprising in it. A lot of us have been arguing that various forms of catch shares or dedicated access is essential.''
 Dr. Costello and his co-authors, Steven D. Gaines, an ecologist at Santa Barbara, and John Lynham, an economist at the University of Hawaii, looked at data from more than 11,000 commercial fisheries around the world, of which 121 had established ownership share systems from 1950 to 2003. Collapse rates were so much lower in the share systems, they concluded, that they saw ''the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries.'' 
 For example, Dr. Gaines said, the Alaska halibut fishery -- that is, fishing for halibut in Alaskan waters -- is regulated by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, one of eight regional regulatory councils established by Congress. Each year the council, with the advice of scientists, sets the size of the yearly catch in the fishery.
 For the purposes of the study, Dr. Gaines said, the researchers considered 64 large marine ecosystems, like the Gulf of Mexico, and studied the management of individual fish species in each. 
 The researchers said they drew on the work of scientists at Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia, who have reported that most of the world's most important fishing stocks are in precipitous decline. In particular, they relied on data gathered by Boris Worm. He and colleagues reported in 2006 that if current fishing practices continue, all the world's major commercial stocks will have collapsed by 2048 -- that is, they will be at 10 percent or less of their historic maximums. 
 This gloomy prediction has been controversial, but there is wide agreement that many commercial fisheries are in steep decline. Using the standard Dr. Worm used, the researchers found that more than a third of commercial fisheries had collapsed by 2003. The figure for fisheries managed with some form of a catch-share system was half that. 
 The authors of the new report said it would be premature to draw a straight line between rights-based management and restored stocks. For one thing, they said, the approach is common in just a few areas, like Alaska, Iceland, New Zealand and Australia, so it is possible, they wrote, that differences in the kinds of fish caught or other regional factors might ''generate misleading results.'' Or the fisheries might have been better managed in the first place and less vulnerable to collapse. 
 ''That is definitely a weakness in the design'' of the study, Dr. Hilborn said, but the only way to know would be to randomly assign various fisheries to different management schemes, ''and you cannot do that in the real world.''

HEADLINE: VAST BAILOUT BY U.S. PROPOSED IN BID TO STEM ECONOMIC CRISIS

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Carl Hulse and David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The head of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve began discussions on Thursday with Congressional leaders on what could become the biggest bailout in United States history.
While details remain to be worked out, the plan is likely to authorize the government to buy distressed mortgages at deep discounts from banks and other institutions. The proposal could result in the most direct commitment of taxpayer funds so far in the financial crisis that Fed and Treasury officials say is the worst they have ever seen.
Senior aides and lawmakers said the goal was to complete the legislation by the end of next week, when Congress is scheduled to adjourn. The legislation would grant new authority to the administration and require what several officials said would be a substantial appropriation of federal dollars, though no figures were disclosed in the meeting.
Democrats, having their own desire for a second round of economic aid for struggling Americans, see the administration's request as a way to win White House approval of new spending to help stimulate the economy in exchange for support for the Treasury request. Democrats also say they will push for relief for homeowners faced with foreclosure in return for supporting any broad bailout of struggling financial institutions. 
''What we are working on now is an approach to deal with systemic risks and stresses in our capital markets,'' said Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary. ''And we talked about a comprehensive approach that would require legislation to deal with the illiquid assets on financial institutions' balance sheets,'' he added.
One model for the proposal could be the Resolution Trust Corporation, which bought up and eventually sold hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of real estate in the 1990s from failed savings-and-loan companies. In this case, however, the government is expected to take over only distressed assets, not entire institutions. And it is not clear that a new agency would be created to manage and dispose of the assets, or whether the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department would do so.
The bailout discussions came on a day when the Federal Reserve poured almost $300 billion into global credit markets and barely put a dent in the level of alarm.
Hoping to shore up confidence with a show of financial shock and awe, the Federal Reserve stunned investors before dawn on Thursday by announcing a plan to provide $180 billion to financial markets through lending programs operated by the European Central Bank and the central banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and Switzerland.
But after an initial sense of relief swept markets in Asia and Europe, the fear quickly returned. Tensions remained so high that the Federal Reserve had to inject an extra $100 billion, in two waves of $50 billion each, just to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at the Fed's target of 2 percent.
None of those actions, however, brought much catharsis or relief, with banks around the world remaining too frightened to lend to each other, much less to their customers. This forced Mr. Paulson and Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, to think the unthinkable: committing taxpayer money to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in distressed assets from struggling institutions.
Rumors about the Bush administration's new stance swept through the stock markets Thursday afternoon. By the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 617 points from its low point in midafternoon, the biggest surge in six years, and ended the day with a gain of 410 points or 3.9 percent.
The rally continued in early trading in Asia. The Australian market was up 3.5 percent by mid-day there and the Nikkei 225 Index was up 2.9 percent in Tokyo.
''The markets voted, and they liked the proposal,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers.
The stock surge began after Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, announced his own proposal for a government rescue on the Senate floor and declared that both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were open to all ideas.
''The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are realizing that we need a more comprehensive solution,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''I've been talking to them about it.''
Still, the evening discussions took most of Washington by surprise, especially since Congress had been trying to finish up its business and head home to campaign for re-election.
The scale and complexity of the project are almost certain to create huge philosophical differences among the parties, which could make negotiations difficult to say the least. Still, lawmakers said the goal was to work through the coming weekend and to have both the House and Senate vote on a measure by the end of next week.
As they exited the session, grim-faced lawmakers said they would await proposals from the Treasury Department. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said he expected to see a proposal within hours, not days.
''What we agreed to do is sit down together on a bipartisan basis and work together to solve the problem,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who said no specific approach was advocated by the administration officials.
President Bush and his top advisers have adamantly opposed bailouts, but the mortgage crisis has already forced the Treasury and the Fed to bail out four of the country's most prominent financial institutions -- Bear Stearns in March; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earlier this month; and American International Group, the insurance conglomerate, just this week.
Created in 1989, the Resolution Trust Corporation disposed of bad assets held by hundreds of crippled savings institutions. The agency closed or reorganized 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400 billion. It did so by seizing the assets of troubled savings and loans, then reselling them to bargain-seeking investors.
By 1995, the S.& L. crisis had abated and the agency was folded into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which Congress created during the Great Depression to regulate banks and protect the accounts of customers when they fail.
By any reckoning, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke were desperate for a way to stem the crisis once and for all by Thursday evening. Over the previous 10 days, they had allowed one Wall Street firm, Lehman Brothers, to collapse; and an even bigger Wall Street firm, Merrill Lynch, to be sold to Bank of America. Then, on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve abruptly took over the nation's biggest insurance conglomerate, the American International Group, and began bailing it out with an $85 billion loan.
The meeting in the Capitol, which began around 7 p.m., came after Congressional leaders had initially appeared unclear about what role they would play in the rapid-fire decisions being made. Leaders of both parties had complained about a lack of hard information flowing from the administration. House Republicans even canceled a closed-door party session Thursday morning after the administration refused to provide an official to brief them on the administration's emerging policies.
But as Thursday progressed, Congressional leaders sought to reassert themselves on the crisis, scheduling oversight hearings, calling for a legislative response to the market turmoil and offering to put off an adjournment scheduled to start at the end of next week if the administration and Congress could find common ground on a solution.
Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, in a letter sent Thursday evening to President Bush, reiterated that view. ''We stand ready beyond the targeted adjournment date of September 26 to permit Congress to consider legislative proposals and conduct necessary investigations,'' Ms. Pelosi said in the letter, which said ''the worsening crisis in our financial markets demands strong solutions and decisive leadership.''
But whether a legislative consensus could be found remained an open question, and members of Mr. Bush's own party were among those who were most critical of the increasing federal intervention in private markets.
At the meeting Thursday night, where officials said the atmosphere was tense, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, was notably skeptical.
A spokesman for the senator, Jonathan Graffeo, said later: ''Senator Shelby believes it's his responsibility to be skeptical on behalf of taxpayers. He believes our goal must be to minimize taxpayer exposure while maximizing the benefit to the economy. ''
Earlier in the day, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, had expressed similar wariness about the risk to taxpayers' funds. And Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who heads a coalition of House conservatives, was circulating a letter to the administration demanding that it not engage in any further bailouts.
Even before the Thursday night session with Mr. Paulson -- the second for top Congressional leaders this week -- the House had scheduled new oversight hearings. The Financial Services Committee set a session for next week, with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke as witnesses. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee set hearings for early October to examine developments that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of A.I.G., even though Congress is to be in recess.
Ms. Pelosi, suggesting the public was probably not of a mind to wait until 2009 for a Congressional fix, said lawmakers first had to explore the causes of the problems and potential solutions in hearings.
''Let's hear from the Bernankes and the Paulsons and the rest what their view of it is,'' she said. ''Let's hear from the private sector. How these captains of the financial world could make millions of dollars in salary, and yet their companies fail and then we have to step in to bail them out.''
Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke have been studying an array of new and sometimes radical approaches to fight what current and former Fed officials describe as the worst financial crisis they have ever seen.
The Fed has already stretched itself very thin by introducing new emergency lending programs for banks, Wall Street firms and, this week, a giant insurance company.
With the Fed running short of unencumbered reserves, the Treasury Department had begun raising fresh cash for the central bank by selling new Treasury bills at an unprecedented pace -- $200 billion this week alone -- and parking it at the Fed for whatever use it wanted.

HEADLINE: Cornered by War and Drought, Afghans Fear Hungry Winter

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: YAKOWLANG, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
A pitiable harvest this year has left small farmers all over central and northern Afghanistan facing hunger, and aid officials are warning of an acute food shortage this winter for nine million Afghans, more than a quarter of the population. 
 The crisis has been generated by the harshest winter in memory, followed by a drought across much of the country, which come on top of the broader problems of deteriorating security, the accumulated pressure of returning refugees and the effects of rising world food prices. 
 The failure of the Afghan government and foreign donors to develop the country's main economic sector, agriculture, has compounded the problems, the officials say. They warn that the food crisis could make an already bad security situation worse.
 The British charity Oxfam, which conducted a provisional assessment of conditions in the province of Daykondi, one of the most remote areas of central Afghanistan, has appealed for international assistance before winter sets in. ''Time is running out to avert a humanitarian crisis,'' it said. 
 That assessment is echoed by villagers across the broader region, including in Bamian Province. ''In all these 30 years of war, we have not had it as bad as this,'' said Said Muhammad, a 60-year-old farmer who lives in Yakowlang, in Bamian. ''We don't have enough food for the winter. We will have to go to the towns to look for work.'' 
 Underlying the warnings are growing fears of civil unrest. The mood in the country is darkening amid increasing economic hardship, worsening disorder and a growing disaffection with the government and its foreign backers, particularly over the issue of government corruption.
 Returning refugees are already converging on the cities because they cannot manage in the countryside, and they make easy recruits for the Taliban or other groups that want to create instability, said Ashmat Ghani, an opposition politician and tribal leader from Logar Province, south of Kabul, the nation's capital. 
 ''The lower part of society, when facing hunger, will not wait,'' he said. ''We could have riots.''
 The Afghan government, together with United Nations organizations, was quick to mount an appeal at the beginning of the year to prevent a food shortage as world food prices soared and neighboring countries stopped wheat exports.
 The World Food Program, which was assisting 4.5 million of the most vulnerable Afghans with food aid in recent years, widened its program to include an additional 1.5 million Afghans and extended it further because of the drought to reach a total of nine million people until the end of next year's harvest. 
 Several weeks ago, Oxfam warned in a letter to ministers responsible for development in some countries assisting Afghanistan that the $404 million appeal by the government and the United Nations was substantially underfinanced. 
 ''If the response is slow or insufficient, there could be serious public health implications, including higher rates of mortality and morbidity, which are already some of the highest in the world,'' the letter said. 
 It also warned of internal displacement of families who had no work or food, and even of civil disturbances. ''The impact as a whole could further undermine the security situation,'' Oxfam said.
 The United States government announced this week that it would supply nearly half the emergency food aid requested in the appeal.
 Susana Rico, the director of the World Food Program in Afghanistan, said last-minute contributions had come in to cover the immediate emergency. But there is still a rush to get supplies to the countryside before the first winter snows arrive next month, she said. 
 Development officials say that deteriorating security has made it harder to do that job in the countryside. Aid workers have become the targets of an increasing number of attacks from insurgents and criminals.
 The dangers have restricted the scale and scope of aid operations, said the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief, an umbrella group of nongovernmental organizations. 
 Those dangers, the agency says, have even spread to areas previously considered relatively secure. In the first seven months of the year, it reported, 19 workers for nongovernmental organizations were killed, more than the number in all of 2007.
 The agency appealed for governments to take a broad range of measures, beyond the military, to combat the escalating insurgency. 
 ''The conflict will not be brought to an end through military means,'' the agency said in a statement. ''A range of measures is required to achieve a sustainable peace, including strong and effective support for rural development.'' 
 Neglecting a lifeline as vital as agriculture has been dangerous for stability in Afghanistan, as people are unable to feed themselves, several provincial governors said in interviews. 
 The governor of Bamian, Habiba Sarabi, has repeatedly complained that because her province has been one of the most law-abiding and trouble-free, it has been forgotten in the big distribution of resources from international donors. 
 Donors, and in particular the United States government, have spent far larger amounts in the provinces in the south and southeast to help combat the dual problems of the insurgency and narcotics, she said.
 Hasan Samadi, 23, the deputy administrator of Yakowlang District in Bamian Province, said, ''The economic situation of the people here is very bad and the government is not focused to help.
 ''They focus on other provinces and unfortunately not on Bamian, and not on remote districts of Bamian,'' he said. 
 Daykondi, adjacent to Bamian, is one of the most underfinanced provinces in the country. It receives half the budget of its neighbor to the south, Oruzgan, which has two-thirds the population and a poor record on combating insurgency and the cultivation of the opium poppy, said Matt Waldman, a spokesman for Oxfam in Kabul. 
 In Daykondi, 90 percent of the population relies on subsistence farming, yet the provincial Department of Agriculture has a budget of only $2,400 for the whole year, he added. 
 The imbalance in aid to the provinces is being corrected now, Governor Sarabi said, but in the meantime it has put great strain on the people in her province. 
 She estimated that a quarter of Bamian's population would need food aid this winter because of the drought. There have already been local conflicts over water supplies in two regions, she said. 
 Development officials warn that neglecting the poorest provinces can add to instability by pushing people to commit crimes or even to join the insurgency, which often pays its recruits. 
 While the severe drought contributed to the decline of poppy cultivation in the central and northern provinces, it also pushed farmers into debt. If they do not get help now, they could turn back to poppy-growing and lose their faith in the government, said Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 
 Mr. Costa called for urgent assistance for farmers and regions that have abandoned poppy cultivation. He and others have also criticized the inefficiency of international aid. 
 Of $15 billion of reconstruction assistance given to Afghanistan since 2001, ''a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries,'' the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief said in a March report. 
 ''Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,'' Mr. Costa said during a recent visit to Kabul. ''I insist on the importance of increasing development assistance, making it more effective. Too much of it is eaten up by various bureaucracies and contractors.''

HEADLINE: Pain Spreads As Credit Vise Grows Tighter

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The latest outgrowth of the housing crisis, the breakdown on Wall Street, threatens to gradually corrode economic activity on Main Street, mainly by disabling the credit on which so many everyday transactions depend -- but also by frightening people.
 Lenders of all types had already been raising the bar for borrowers, turning away all but the best customers. This week, they became even less willing to part with their money, further crimping budgets and family spending. 
 An economy propelled by easy credit for more than a decade is fraying as credit disappears. American Express, to take one striking example, is reducing the maximum credit limit for half of its tens of millions of cardholders. 
 The credit shock is in some ways reminiscent of the 1973 oil embargo, which ''came into people's lives right away,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, the public opinion pollster. Then, Americans were forced to line up for gasoline and turn down their thermostats in winter. Though less visible, the credit squeeze, if it persists, will force businesses and consumers to cut spending more than they already have. 
 ''We have moved into a decline in consumer spending, which normally happens only in a major recession,'' said Ethan Harris, chief domestic economist at Lehman Brothers. He calls the experience ''a slow-motion recession in which economic growth will be near zero for an extended period of time.'' 
 Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of American economic activity and has been slowing as the value of homes falls. Although the economy is not yet in a formal recession, consumer spending in June and July grew only because consumers paid more for the same goods. After factoring in higher prices, they actually bought less.
 Borrowers are finding that the nation's lenders are tightening up in numerous ways. American Express is hardly alone. After several banks said they would not lend the asking price, a tractor-trailer dealer in North Carolina had to cut the $20,000 he was seeking for a second-hand tractor to $14,000. And a commercial real estate agent, trying to raise $4 million by refinancing an apartment building, got only half that amount from the Bank of Smithtown on Long Island, even though the building was appraised for $10 million.
 ''With marginal lenders in trouble, we have more people than ever coming to us for loans,'' said Brad Rock, chairman of the Smithtown bank. ''So all of a sudden, we can be much pickier in deciding what loans to make and how much to lend.''
 Being pickier means that an American Express cardholder whose maximum has been reduced to $1,000 from $1,200 has that much less to spend on clothing or meals out, purchases that lift the economy. 
 At $14,000 for a used tractor, a trucker, caught in the same squeeze as the dealer, would lack a sufficient down payment for a new tractor, which costs more than $100,000. Indeed, many truckers in this situation find themselves looking for other work, even as job seekers across the nation outnumber job openings by more than 2 to 1, the biggest mismatch since 2004, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. 
 And the commercial real estate agent is shy $2 million that would have been invested in a new venture to generate economic growth.
 Mr. Rock, also chairman of the American Bankers Association, with 8,400 affiliates, does not see a problem in this turn of events. 
 ''Now people are going to actually have to have a job to get a loan and they are going to have to make installment payments that are already higher per dollar borrowed than they used to be,'' he said, arguing that the debt-fueled prosperity of the bubble years was unsustainable.
 But there is not, for the moment, an adequate replacement. 
 Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist, ticks off the alternatives and discounts them. Exports could carry some of the load, but the surge in the first half of the year is fading as European and Asian economies weaken. Here at home, capital spending by business on new buildings and equipment could provide a lift, but that, too, is beginning to fade as corporate profits -- and demand -- weaken. Just Wednesday, FedEx announced that profits had shrunk in the latest quarter as freight traffic declined. 
 Home construction is off the table, of course, as a means of lifting the economy. That leaves government, which could inject money into the economy through aid to the states or infrastructure spending or another round of tax rebates. There is even talk of a bigger bailout for the housing market, akin to Resolution Trust Corporation's role in the savings and loan crisis. But Congress seems unlikely to authorize any of these measures in its current, brief pre-election session. 
 ''Sometime in 2009, after the new president takes office, we will address these issues,'' Mr. Kaufman said, lamenting the delay.
 Meanwhile, the barriers to borrowing go up. By late summer, a majority of the nation's lenders had tightened standards for every type of credit, the Federal Reserve's bank surveys show. Home equity lines of credit have been canceled or reduced as home prices have fallen. Credit card companies are imposing higher delinquency fees, stepping up collection efforts and checking on repayment histories.
 ''More and more, they don't give the card if you don't have a good credit record,'' Mr. Harris, of Lehman Brothers, said. 
 Michael O'Neill, an American Express vice president, agrees. He adds that the company is offering fewer new cards than in the past in Florida, California and parts of the Southwest, all areas where home prices have fallen the most. And quietly, American Express is skinning back credit limits. The company is always reviewing its millions of accounts, normally increasing the limit on three out of four, and decreasing the fourth. Since July, ''the tilt is 50-50,'' Mr. O'Neill said.
 The North Carolina truck dealer originally listed a 2001 Freightliner for $20,000 on truckertotrucker.com, an online marketplace for tractors and trailers, and this week, he dropped the price to $14,000 because of the growing resistance from bankers, said James McCormack, who operates the site.
 ''The banks were giving loans for the full value of these trucks and the value was falling, and the truckers found themselves owing more than the trucks were worth,'' Mr. McCormack said. ''They found themselves forced to keep driving or let the banks repossess, and many have elected repossession.''
 Debt traps and loan famines, in one form or another, can prove costly to companies. Harley-Davidson, for example, which finances purchases of its motorcycles, is issuing bonds and notes at slightly higher rates to support its financing arm. 
 Restaurants in the casual-dining sector are in a severe slump, according to industry analysts, and will most likely come under further pressure. The pancake house IHOP bought Applebee's last year with a strategy of selling off company-owned stores to franchisees. Now known as DineEquity, the company may have problems finding prospective franchisees who can obtain financing, industry analysts said. 
 The winners so far are the Brad Rocks of America, the bankers who have emerged unscathed, their capital intact and with enough retained earnings to support lending, on their terms. A residential mortgage from Bank of Smithtown requires 20 percent down and clear evidence of adequate income to repay the loan, as well as a good record of paying down debt. 
 Bank of Smithtown specializes in small businesses -- the stationery stores, pizza parlors and pharmacies of eastern Long Island with annual revenue of $2 million or less,regularly in need of bridge loans, for example. During the credit boom, Mr. Rock said, many of these business owners went to lenders who required, as he put it, nothing more than a tax ID number to qualify for a loan.
 ''Now many of these lenders are gone,'' Mr. Rock said, ''and the small-business borrowers are coming to us, and we are doing good old-fashioned underwriting, and the result is that fewer people are getting loans.''

HEADLINE: Panel Proposes Broad Changes in Federal Financial Aid for College

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
A panel of education experts and researchers on Thursday proposed a broad reconfiguration of federal policies on financial aid for college, including a simpler application process, Pell grant maximums linked to the consumer price index and, most radically, federally financed college savings accounts for children in low-income families. 
 The panel recommended scrapping the current federal financial aid application, a dauntingly complicated form known as the Fafsa, and having the government get all needed financial information from the Internal Revenue Service. 
 ''More tinkering with a system built piecemeal in the last century is no longer an option,'' said Sandy Baum, a Skidmore College economics professor who served as co-chairwoman of the panel, the Rethinking Student Aid study group, which was organized by the College Board. 
 Students' eligibility for Pell Grants, the most important federal aid to needy students, would be based on their family size and adjusted gross income. 
 ''It is just imperative for our economic future and our civic future that we invest effectively in more students achieving success in college,'' said Michael McPherson, president of the Spencer Foundation and co-chairman of the panel. ''One of the challenges is the growing gap between the price of college and families' ability to pay.
 Although the report is certain to get intense scrutiny from Congress and education groups, it is unclear whether the recommendations will win enough support to have much chance of being adopted.
 The group called for linking the maximum a student can borrow through the Stafford Loan program to the federal poverty level, allowing that maximum to rise with inflation; it also recommended that the standard 10-year mortgage-style repayment plan be replaced with a graduated repayment plan, so payments would rise along with borrowers' income. 
 It also called for making the interest rates of federal loan programs to parents low enough to discourage families from turning to private student loans. With tuition rising faster than inflation, college affordability has become a growing concern for both voters and Congressional leaders. 
 ''We will take a look at these and other recommendations that explore innovative ways to deliver student aid and help make college more affordable,'' said Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House education committee. 
 ''It is a welcome report,'' said Molly Corbett Broad, president of the American Council on Education. ''The big question is what we have the political will and the financial commitment to do. So the notion of beginning to save for college at a much younger age is a great idea, and we know that would make a huge difference, but there are significant cost implications.'' 
 Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the plan involves the federal government opening -- and financing -- college savings accounts for low-income children.
 Unlike children in affluent families, many low-income children do not grow up with parents who expect them to get a college education, or have any plan for paying the tuition.
 So the panel proposed that the government create accounts for children in low-income families, long before they reached college age. The government would add money each year until they turned 18, but the accounts could only be drawn against for college expenses. 
 ''Imagine the impact on the single mother of a 7-year-old who receives a letter informing her that the federal government has just put aside $250 toward the college education of that child and that this money will earn interest until the child is ready to enroll,'' the report said. 
 If the program began at age 12, and the yearly deposit was 10 percent of the Pell Grant that the child would be eligible for, it would cost ''less than $3 billion'' a year, Ms. Baum said Thursday. She said 12 was probably the latest it would make sense to begin such a program, and added that the group had also estimated costs of starting it at age 5. 
 The panel, which worked for two years to produce the report, ''Fulfilling the Commitment,'' proposed new financial incentives for colleges and universities that do a good job of retaining, and graduating, low-income students.

PERSON: Stephen A. Kliment 

HEADLINE: S. A. Kliment, 78, Architect and Editor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Stephen A. Kliment, an architect who steered Architectural Record through the economic straits of the 1990s, died Sept. 10 in Ebersberg, Germany. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan. 
 The cause was cancer, said his brother, the architect Robert M. Kliment.
 Since 2002 he had been the editorial director of Oculus, the journal of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, and eOculus, the chapter's electronic newsletter.
 Mr. Kliment was more interested in questions of social justice and practicality in architecture than in cutting-edge design. He was an honorary member of the National Organization of Minority Architects and advocated a greater role for black architects.
 Born in Prague on May 24, 1930, he was raised in England and Czechoslovakia and studied architecture in Paris and Havana before coming to the United States in 1950. He received a bachelor's in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953 and a master's from Princeton in 1957.
 His career alternated between practicing architecture and covering it. He was the editor of Architectural and Engineering News from 1961 to 1969, then a partner in the firm of Caudill Rowlett Scott from 1969 to 1972.
 At John Wiley & Sons, where he worked from 1987 to 1990, he was the founding editor of the ''Building Type Basics'' series. 
 In 1990, in the midst of a building slump set off by the stock market collapse three years earlier, Mr. Kliment became editor in chief of the Architectural Record, where he remained until 1996.
 ''Steve led the magazine through some pretty dark hours,'' said Charles Linn, the current deputy editor of the Record.
 Given the dearth of big projects by well-known firms, Mr. Kliment and his colleagues had the chance to publish the work of up-and-coming architects like Herzog & de Meuron, Mr. Linn recalled. Mr. Kliment also inaugurated a column on the use of computers in architecture.
 ''He was considered to be an architect's journalist,'' Mr. Linn said.
 That sleeves-up approach characterized his articles for The New York Times, in which he discussed how churches, schools and people of modest means pursued their architectural goals.
 Besides his brother, Mr. Kliment is survived by his wife, Felicia Drury Kliment; two daughters, Pamela Kliment and Jennifer Kliment Wellander, both of Seattle; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Bond Insurers Are Facing Downgrades

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
MBIA and the Ambac Financial Group may have their debt rankings cut several grades by the credit ratings company Moody's Investors Service after Moody's raised its forecast for losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages. 
 Syncora Guarantee, the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and CIFG Assurance North America will also be evaluated for the effect of the higher loss projections, Moody's said.
 ''Because both Ambac and MBIA are meaningfully exposed to the risk of U.S. subprime mortgages and other residential mortgage products, the revised assumptions are expected to have a significant impact on the firms' capital positions, and multi-notch downgrades are possible,'' Moody's said.
 MBIA, based in Armonk, N.Y., and Ambac are the two largest bond insurers. Five of seven formerly AAA-rated bond insurers have been stripped of their top rankings this year after straying into securities backed by subprime mortgages from backing the debts of cities and states.
 ''Ambac believes that Moody's rating actions continue to cause confusion, uncertainty and the risk of material economic damage if their assumptions ultimately prove to be too onerous,'' its chief executive, Michael A. Callen, said in a statement.
 ''We are aggressively managing our mortgage-related exposures and have made demonstrable progress in reducing the risk in our insured portfolio,'' Mr. Callen said.
 Ambac is based in New York.
 A spokesman for MBIA could not be reached. 
 Earlier on Thursday, Moody's raised its forecasts for losses on subprime and prime jumbo mortgages. Losses will reach an average of 22 percent on subprime loans underlying bonds created in 2006. That is up from an estimate of 14 to 18 percent made in January.
 In June, Moody's cut the insurance financial-strength rating of MBIA five grades to A2, while Ambac was reduced three levels to Aa3.

HEADLINE: Downturn Drives Up Local Jobless Rates, With Big Losses Still to Be Felt

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The unemployment rates for New York City and State shot up in August as the rapidly spiraling economic downturn left more people without jobs, the state's Department of Labor said on Thursday.
 The city's unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent from 5 percent in July -- the largest monthly increase in more than 30 years -- as about 5,200 private-sector jobs were eliminated, the department reported. Many of the layoffs came in the tumbling financial sector, which is one of the city's biggest employers and the provider of nearly one-fourth of its annual wages and salaries.
 In the last 12 months, employment in the financial realm has declined by 5,300 jobs, according to James Brown, an analyst with the Labor Department. Some of those losses resulted from the collapse of the Bear Stearns investment bank in March. But many of the cutbacks at that firm and others on Wall Street still have not shown up in the official statistics. 
 For example, the August totals do not include the 1,500 layoffs that Lehman Brothers had planned to make before it was forced into a bankruptcy filing on Monday. Lehman, which employed more than 25,000 people, has sold its main trading operations to Barclays Capital, a London-based firm, but it is not known how many of the 10,000 employees of those operations will keep their jobs. American International Group, the Manhattan-based insurance giant, was on the brink of failure before receiving an $85 billion lifeline from the federal government this week.
 ''Although the crises at Lehman Brothers and A.I.G. appear to be working out so as to avoid immediate large-scale layoffs, the continued financial-sector turmoil guarantees that job losses on Wall Street will climb rapidly over the next few months,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 Despite the current deterioration in the job market, the city still had about 31,000 more jobs last month than it had in August 2007, when the unemployment rate was 5.3 percent, according to the report. Most of that job growth has come in the fields of education, health care, trade and transportation, and leisure and hospitality.
 ''Most of the professional business industries such as law firms lost a small number of jobs in August, but all in all, New York City has still yet to see any significant impact from the turmoil on Wall Street,'' said Barbara Denham, chief economist for Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment firm.
 ''This will undoubtedly change in the next few months, but the job losses from Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch may not hit the job numbers until November or later,'' Ms. Denham said. ''While New York City's economy remains well diversified in health care and private education, the problems on Wall Street will likely spill over into the business travel industry, which would affect hotels, restaurants and entertainment.''
 The jobless rates for the city and the state were lower than the national unemployment rate, which jumped to 6.1 percent last month, according to the Labor Department.
 Statewide, the jobless rate also rose to 5.8 percent, from 5.2 percent in July. That was the largest monthly increase in the state's rate since January 1991, said Peter A. Neenan, director of the department's division of research. Still, the department reported that the state added 3,000 private-sector jobs in August. 
 ''New York State's labor market indicators reported mixed signals in August,'' Mr. Neenan said.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Prices Rise Amid Dwindling Inventories

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Caught in a wild and gyrating market, crude oil prices briefly returned to triple-digit territory on Thursday, but gave up most of their gains to fall below $100 a barrel by the end of the day.
 Crude oil futures settled at $97.88 a barrel, up 72 cents for the day, after jumping above $102 when trading opened on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The rise followed a 6.6 percent jump on Wednesday when panicky investors fled the stock market to seek shelter in the perceived safety of commodities. 
 After spending six months above $100, oil prices slumped earlier in the week because of concerns that the financial turmoil on Wall Street would slow economic growth and hurt oil demand. Prices fell to $91.51 a barrel on Tuesday, but since then they have made up some of their losses. 
 The worry in the markets now centers on efforts to restart production and refining operations on the Gulf Coast, the nation's largest energy hub, which was battered by two powerful hurricanes in recent weeks. The disruptions forced oil companies to draw on their inventories, pushing stockpiles to their lowest levels in years.
 Oil inventories are now below their five-year average and gasoline stockpiles are at their lowest since 1969. Retail gasoline prices spiked in recent days but fell slightly Thursday, to about $3.84 a gallon on average, according to the automobile club AAA.
 To make up for short-term disruptions in fuel supplies, the government is considering appeals to the International Energy Agency to release emergency fuel stocks. The agency, whose role is to coordinate energy policies for 27 industrialized nations, last released emergency supplies after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Even without government action, refiners are already exporting extra gasoline from Europe. 
 ''There is currently more flexibility in the system, notably higher gasoline stocks in Europe and spare refining capacity,'' the energy agency said in a statement. ''Looking at prices and shipments, the market appears to be reallocating oil and products.'' 
 Five days after Hurricane Ike came ashore, the extent of the damage to the industry remained unclear. The Gulf of Mexico's oil and natural gas production remains shut down while a dozen refineries across Texas and Louisiana are trying to resume production. In contrast to 2005, relatively few of the 3,800 offshore platforms have been permanently damaged, but because it is taking time to restore power, it could take weeks for the situation to return to normal. 
 Industry experts say that more than half a dozen natural gas processing plants on the Gulf Coast have been flooded or lack power. Many compressors that move gas from platforms to processing plants are in zones that remain blacked out. Natural gas fell 3.7 percent to settle at $7.621 per thousand cubic feet at the mercantile exchange on Thursday. 
 ''The effects of the storm are the big determinants of price here,'' said Michael Zenker, a natural gas expert at Barclays Capital. ''The biggest reason why gas in getting whipsawed around is the market is having a difficult time figuring out when all the production is going to go back on line.''
 Pressure on energy markets has been increasing in the last two days after Nigerian militants stepped up attacks on oil companies in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Nigeria's idled production stands at a million barrels a day, according to a spokesman for the Nigerian national oil company.
 The price of oil also rose as the dollar weakened to a two-week low after the Federal Reserve increased the amount of dollars available to central banks worldwide. In the last year, investors have used commodities, including oil, as a hedge against a falling dollar. The dollar slid as much as 2.6 percent to $1.4541 against the euro. 
 ''Despite the recent declines, we believe that the commodity bull cycle is far from over as severe supply constraints that have led to high and rising prices in recent years remain intact,'' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note.

HEADLINE: A Gloomy Forecast Drives Palm Down 12%

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Palm, the maker of smart phones, said on Thursday that its earnings for the second quarter ending in November would decline, and its shares fell as much as 12.8 percent in after-hours trading. 
 The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., which was once known for hand-held organizers but now focuses on selling telephones, provided no specific figures for the forecast. Analysts said the projection weighed down its shares.
 ''We're not going to get into specific numbers,'' said Ed Colligan, Palm's chief executive and president, during a conference call with analysts. ''We have decided to not give specific numerical guidance.'' 
 Revenue rose 1.6 percent, to $366.9 million.
 One of the analysts said that he and others had been looking for increased growth, fueled by demand for Palm's new entry-level Centro phone, which sells for less than $100.
 Palm said it had yet to see any impact from wider economic turmoil but expected no bump in sales for the year-end holiday season, as the company has evolved from a retail-based seller of hand-held devices to a distribution model that depends on carriers to sell its phones.
 The company's net loss applicable to holders of common shares for the fiscal first quarter ended in August grew to $41.9 million, or 39 cents a diluted share, from $841,000, or 1 cent a diluted share, in the year-ago period.
 The latest quarter's loss included a charge of $15 million for the impairment of noncurrent auction rate securities. 
 It also included other one-time items like stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges.
 Excluding one-time items, the company reported a loss of $12.8 million, or 12 cents a diluted share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $9.7 million, or 9 cents a diluted share.
 On that basis, Wall Street was looking for an adjusted loss, on average, of 18 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts were looking for a net loss, on average, of 23 cents a share.
 Before the report, shares of Palm rose $1.28, or 17.75 percent, in regular session trading on the Nasdaq. 
 After the results, Palm shares fell $1.09, or 12.8 percent, to $7.40 in after-hours trading.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
While the art world is still trying to assess the impact of Sotheby's $200.7 million sale of 223 works by Damien Hirst here this week, auction house experts in New York are working furiously to put together their important fine art sales in November. Given the current state of the economy it is too early to predict how flush buyers will feel or how willing sellers will be to part with their art. 
 Death is always a good thing for auction houses, and this season Christie's was able to secure two major estates: that of Rita K. Hillman, a New York philanthropist who died in November 2007 and was president of the Alex Hillman Family Foundation, named for her husband, a prominent publisher who died in 1968; and that of Alice Lawrence, a New York philanthropist who died in February and was the widow of Sylvan Lawrence, a Manhattan real estate developer who died in 1981. 
 Since both collections center on late-19th- and 20th-century art, Christie's has decided to hold a special sale of the two estates on Nov. 5 that it is calling ''The Modern Age.'' 
 ''It's a glimpse into the taste of two collections that tell the story of the birth of 20th-century art,'' said Guy Bennett, international co-head of Christie's Impressionist and modern art department. 
 Both women, together with their husbands, were innovative collectors. The Hillmans began buying works by Manet, Cezanne, Leger and Picasso, while the Lawrences focused on more classic modern works starting with Leger and Magritte to Gorky, Rothko and Lucian Freud. 
 The evening's offerings, which are expected to bring about $130 million, will include decorative objects along with paintings and sculptures. 
 The star of the sale is ''No. 43 (Mauve),'' a 1960 painting by Rothko, which is estimated to sell for $20 million to $30 million. It is a monumental canvas, measuring more than seven feet by five feet, with a brooding, nocturnal palette of blacks and purple. The Lawrences bought it for $1.5 million 20 years ago at a Sotheby's auction in New York. 
 Examples of work from the Hillman collection include Manet's ''Young Girl on a Bench,'' from 1880, which is expected to sell for $12 million to $18 million, and ''Metaphysical Composition,'' a rare De Chirico painting from 1914, which is estimated to bring $6 million to $8 million and is the first of its kind to come to auction in about 15 years. Also for sale is a Cezanne watercolor, ''The Cathedral at Aix with a View of the Studio in Lauves'' (1904-6). Christie's expects it to bring $4 million to $6 million. 
 A MORE MODERN LOOK
 ''Picasso: Challenging the Past,'' an exhibition opening in February at the National Gallery of Art in London, will show that Picasso's still lifes, female nudes and self-portraits may have been considered revolutionary for their time, but their roots lie in many of the old masters. On view will be some 60 Picassos that will underscore how he was influenced by figures like Rembrandt, Delacroix, Ingres, Manet and Cezanne, examples of which can be found in the gallery's permanent collection. The show will also highlight Picasso's variations on familiar paintings like Manet's ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe.'' 
 The exhibition, which runs through June 7, includes loans from public and private collections in the United States and Europe. It has been organized in collaboration with the national museums of France, including the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay and the Picasso Museum, and will be a smaller version of a show opening at the Grand Palais, the Louvre and Musee d'Orsay on Oct. 6.
 This will be the first time the National Gallery has organized a Picasso exhibition. Shows by such modern masters are more likely to be held at the Tate in London, but Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, said the exhibition was not meant to encroach on the Tate's turf. 
 ''We are not trying to be a museum of modern art,'' he said. ''Over the years there has been a tradition at the gallery of having shows of modern and contemporary art.'' 
 Twelve years ago the two institutions agreed to use 1900 as a dividing line for works in their permanent collections, with older paintings, drawings and sculptures going on view in the National Gallery and more modern ones at the Tate. ''That agreement has come to an end,'' Dr. Penny said. ''I don't like 1900 as a cutoff date. It's too arbitrary. And it never applied to special exhibitions, only to the permanent collection.'' 
 ART IN A HEARTBEAT
 Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's light installations have been seen in places like Mexico City and Lyon, France; Dublin and Venice, where he represented his native Mexico at the 2007 biennale. 
 Starting next month Mr. Lozano-Hemmer's work will be seen by thousands of people in New York and then London. 
 Every evening at dusk till about 10 p.m. from Oct. 24 through Nov. 17 the oval lawn at Madison Square Park -- that swath of green space between Madison and Fifth Avenues from 23rd to 26th Street -- will show ''Pulse Park,'' an interactive electronic installation that consists of 200 theatrical spotlights and two heart-rate sensor sculptures that will create a pulsating dance of light across the park. 
 Visitors can have their heart rates monitored by touching the sensor sculptures, and 200 different pulses will be transmitted by computer program, beating simultaneously in a variety of light patterns. 
 ''This project is three years in the making,'' said Debbie Landau, executive director of the Madison Square Park Conservancy, which oversees the square's art program with the city's parks department. ''It's Rafael's first U.S. debut of public art.'' 
 ''Pulse Park'' is also the first interactive work that has been staged in the park. On a normal day, Ms. Landau said, about 35,000 people stroll through the space, but she predicts that ''Pulse Park'' could attract some 500,000 visitors. 
 ''The effect will be similar to minimalist composers like Steve Reich,'' said Mr. Lozano-Hemmer, 40. ''It's not like a disco, but a more calming atmosphere that will envelop the park.''
 In Trafalgar Square in London, from Nov. 14 to 23, he will be presenting another interactive work, ''Under Scan.'' It will consist of two large-scale projectors that will flood a 20,000-square-foot area with 110,000 lumens of lights that cast a shadow over anyone who walks by. As visitors pass through the space, ''video portraits'' of other people whom the artists have previously filmed will be projected into the shadows of the passers-by. 
 Interaction is central to Mr. Lozano-Hemmer's work. ''If nobody participates, the projects don't exist,'' he said. ''That's the poetry of them.''

HEADLINE: From a 'Joke,' A School Is Born In the Village

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Aimee Bell's daughter, Lily, had just started fifth grade at Grace Church School in Greenwich Village two years ago when another parent asked Ms. Bell what she planned to do for high school.
 ''As a joke, I said, 'I'm starting one,' '' recalled Ms. Bell, 42, a deputy editor of Vanity Fair who lives in an apartment in a brownstone on West 11th Street.
 But in the frenzied world of private schools, where multiple children typically compete for every seat, word spread quickly from one playground to another that Ms. Bell was creating a new high school in the Village. Sara Goodman, a neighbor who had once owned a popular coffeehouse, Limbo, in the East Village, called to say that she had made a similar suggestion to parents in the pickup line at Village Community School. But hers was no joke. 
 Over breakfast at Balthazar, the two women dreamed up Greenwich Village High School and brainstormed how to make it reflect the artistic spirit and innovation of the neighborhood it is named for. Their efforts soon drew the backing of prominent educators and downtown residents: Bob Kerrey, the president of the New School, and his wife, Sara Paley, a television and film writer; the actor and writer John Leguizamo; Richard Robinson, the president and chief executive of Scholastic; Jonathan Mintz, the city's consumer affairs commissioner; and Ms. Bell's boss, Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair and an owner of the celebrity hangout the Waverly Inn.
 The school will start accepting applications in October for 45 ninth graders next fall, and it is negotiating to lease a commercial building (its founders declined to say where, because they are still negotiating the lease). A board of 18 has donated $3 million for startup costs and plans to raise $12 million to $17 million to operate the school over the next five years. Enrollment will expand each year, to 360 by 2013, with tuition on a sliding scale from $1,000 to $34,729.
 Greenwich Village High is one of two new high schools opening in Lower Manhattan next year as demand for seats in private schools has continued to increase across the city despite the faltering economy and layoffs on Wall Street.
 In the financial district, Claremont Preparatory School, which has 500 students in preschool through eighth grade, will expand with a $25 million high school equipped with science labs, a theater and a full-size basketball court that will eventually have 500 students as well. 
 ''It's really always been slim pickings downtown,'' said Victoria Goldman, co-author of ''The Manhattan Guide to Private Schools and Selective Public Schools.'' ''Originally, it was a commercial area with tradesmen and lofts not meant for living, but now it's a mecca for young families.''
 Ms. Goldman cited a handful of popular choices downtown including Friends Seminary, Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, and farther south, Saint Ann's and Packer Collegiate Institute -- all of which have become harder for families to gain admission. She said that citywide, the number of private high schools has remained steady at about 40 even as more families have stayed in the city rather than move to the suburbs. 
 Though its doors will not open for a year, Greenwich Village High has already hired a head of school, a dean and a director of development. More than 20 teachers have sent in resumes. The head of the school, David Liebmann, 39, the director of programs and an English teacher from Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh, was selected after a six-month national search that drew 30 applicants. The academic dean is David Clarke, who had a similar job at Buckingham Browne & Nichols in Cambridge, Mass. 
 ''For a startup school, it was a lot,'' said Chris Arnold, a founding partner of the Educational Directions, the firm that conducted the search, adding that the applicants included top administrators from established New York private schools.
 Mr. Liebmann said he was drawn to the new school's motto, ''Work hard, be kind, take risks,'' and was mapping out an interdisciplinary academic program that would emphasize hands-on learning and community involvement. For instance, he said, the class schedule will allow time for field work every week so that, say, students can hone their Chinese-language skills in Chinatown and study physics in motion on a subway car.
 ''They've got to love school, because this is not a place where they can coast,'' he said. ''They'll be challenged every day.''
 Greenwich Village High is also working with the New School, whose main campus is in the Village, to share classroom space and allow juniors and seniors to take college-level classes, ranging from fashion to classical music. Sports and extracurricular activities will include basketball, soccer, dance and tai chi (to go along with the Chinese-language classes).
 Scholastic's Mr. Robinson, 71, whose son is in seventh grade at Village Community School, described the new school as ''a bold venture.''
 ''High school really needs to be reinvented in many ways,'' he said. ''For the most part, it is not effective enough. There needs to be more inquiry and discovery learning and fewer lectures.'' 
 The school plans to hold information meetings through the fall, with applications due in January, around the same time as many other high-profile private schools. Ms. Bell said they had already received inquiries from dozens of families across the city, as well as some in Hoboken and Jersey City. 
 Mr. Liebmann said the school was still determining the family income levels that would make students eligible for tuition breaks, and he could not yet say how many students would have to pay full freight to make the budget work. But Ms. Goodman, whose great-grandfather founded Bergdorf Goodman, said the sliding scale was intended to ensure a diverse student body without singling out ''scholarship students'' from their wealthier classmates. 
 ''In this way, everyone is an equal member of the community,'' Ms. Goodman said. ''No one has more right to call the school their own than anyone else.''
 While several of the school's board members and advisers have children they hope to enroll, Ms. Bell said they would not receive special treatment.
 Ms. Goodman, 42, attended Dalton, a venerable Upper East Side school serving kindergartners through 12th graders, but said she did not apply there for her daughters, Georgia, 9, and Lily, 6, because she wanted them to be part of the downtown community where they live. She said her work toward Greenwich Village High would not be wasted even if they did not end up going there.
 ''As we developed the idea for this school, it became larger than any of the individual families,'' she said. ''We hope to create a community where ethical responsibility and intellectual curiosity and passion are at the center of the experience.''

HEADLINE: Coming Up Short

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Many Americans are discovering an unfortunate twist to the housing crisis: even after selling a home and moving away, they might have to keep paying on it for years, even decades.
 With home prices tumbling, millions of people owe more on their mortgages than the houses are worth. If a new job or other life change compels them to sell, their choices include bringing a pile of cash to the closing to make the bank whole, going into foreclosure or cutting a deal with the lender to pay off the balance of the loan over time.
 How sellers will react when confronted with these unappealing options is one of the biggest questions hanging over Wall Street as it tries to move beyond the carnage overwhelming such venerable firms as Lehman Brothers, American International Group and Merrill Lynch.
 A sale for less than the value of the mortgage on a property is known as a ''short sale,'' because the transaction leaves a homeowner short of the funds needed to settle the debt. Agents and lenders say the number of short sales is rising markedly. 
 Reluctantly, banks are agreeing to let some short sales go through. But instead of writing off the unpaid portion of the debt, they want homeowners to sign a note promising to pay some or all of the balance due.
 This was the situation confronting Mike and Linda Kelly, who needed to sell their house in the foreclosure-plagued Central Valley of California when Mr. Kelly got a new job 75 miles away. 
 The Kellys owe $300,000 on their house, which has a pool in the back, crepe myrtle bushes in front and, because Mr. Kelly is a ham radio buff, a 40-foot antenna above it. But the best offer they could get gave the bank $220,000. 
 CitiMortgage said it would approve a sale at that price, but at the last minute told the Kellys they needed to pay $166 a month for the next 20 years, a total of $40,000.
 ''When you are ready to participate in the loss, feel free to call me,'' a Citi loss mitigation specialist, April Easter, wrote to them in an e-mail message. 
 Moody'sEconomy.com estimates that about 10 million homeowners have negative equity, a condition known colloquially as being upside down or underwater. By next June, the forecasting company expects the total to rise to 12.7 million -- a quarter of all homeowners who have mortgages.
 Owners in this predicament who must sell, like the Kellys, have few alternatives if they are not flush.
 ''The first wave of foreclosures involved a lot of investors who just disappeared,'' said Lance Churchill of Frontline Seminars, which teaches real estate agents how to negotiate with lenders on short sales. ''Now, homeowners with jobs and assets are underwater and want to sell. The banks want as much as they can get, today or in the future, and the owners want to get away clean.''
 This clash is a central aspect of the financial crisis engulfing Wall Street. During the boom, millions of mortgages were bundled into bonds that were sold to investors and banking houses. But with real estate prices falling and mortgage defaults rising, it has become nearly impossible to calculate the worth of those bonds, and investors are fleeing them.
 Lenders like Citi -- which has already lost more than $50 billion in ill-advised real estate-related ventures -- are walking a tightrope. 
 If they do short sales without trying to extract anything from the sellers, everyone in the country who is upside down could try to wriggle out. The banks and bondholders will take a fresh wave of hits; some might not survive. But if a lender drives too hard a bargain, the owner can default, leaving the bank worse off than if it had taken the short sale.
 ''It's a game of chicken, with huge consequences for the banks, the borrowers and the economy,'' Mr. Churchill said.
 Lenders' demands take many forms. Mary Gonzalez, an agent in San Jose, had to stave off a request from a mortgage company that her client take cash advances on her credit cards to settle a mortgage debt. That lender eventually agreed to settle for a few thousand dollars.
 At the other extreme, JPMorgan Chase says it wants short sellers to sign a note for the full balance due, with interest, over 30 years if necessary.
 While there are no authoritative national numbers on short sales, a related statistic -- the number of people selling their homes for less than they paid -- is rising rapidly, at least in California.
 In August, 54.2 percent of Californians who sold their homes suffered a loss, a sharp rise from 16.8 percent in August 2007. Today's number exceeds the peak of 53.2 percent reached at the end of the last downturn in January 1996, according to the research firm DataQuick. (In some of those cases, the sellers may have lost their down payment without necessarily incurring a cash shortfall at closing.)
 The foreclosure option is, in theory, bad for everyone. Short sales offer all parties the ability to cut their losses earlier. But they also bring homeowner and lender into direct conflict on the contentious issue of who was responsible for those losses in the first place.
 Many borrowers went wild during the boom, buying multiple properties at high prices, signing outlandish loans, taking out large sums to live in high style. But none of that would have been possible, of course, if banks chasing quick profits had not abandoned their lending standards.
 The Kellys, both 64, did not join the free-for-all. He works in financial services; she is a doting grandmother and a volunteer at the local blood bank. ''We're not loaded,'' Mrs. Kelly said.
 They bought their home in December 2001 for $225,000. They refinanced once, four years later, taking out $75,000 to do improvements. At the time, the house was appraised at $450,000, seeming to offer a sufficient cushion.
 But then the market tanked. Last winter, when the Kellys first began looking into selling, they knew any offer would be far below what they owed, and they could not afford to make up the deficit. So they began talking to Citi about their options. They did not want to surrender the house to foreclosure, ruining their credit, hurting their neighbors and betraying their image of themselves. 
 ''We've never defaulted on any obligation through our whole lives,'' said Mr. Kelly, a former marine who had served in Vietnam.
 Citi sent the Kellys a letter saying, ''We look at mortgages as partnerships.'' The lender said it would be willing to let the home be sold for its fair market value, ''even if the proceeds are less than the total amount owed.'' Additional payments over the decades were not mentioned. 
 The Kellys had to jump through many hoops, surrendering their financial documents and explaining why they merited approval for a short sale. Only when a buyer was in hand and a price had been negotiated did Citi demand the $40,000 promissory note from the Kellys.
 A spokesman for Citi, while declining to comment specifically on the Kelly case, said the amount each seller is asked to provide is determined by ''affordability criteria,'' and the sum is negotiable. But the e-mail exchanged between the Kellys and their Citi case worker do not show much evidence of negotiation. 
 ''Lenders always say, 'Don't stick your head in the sand, come work with us,' '' Mr. Kelly said. ''I have found the truth to be absolutely the opposite. They have fought us every step of the way.''
 Mr. Kelly did not want to pay the $40,000, but Mrs. Kelly had qualms about the couple's thumbing their noses at the bank. ''I wonder about suddenly someone knocking at the door with some awful bill to be paid,'' she said.
 Foreclosure laws vary among states but in some circumstances, a bank can go after borrowers for the balance due on a mortgage even after it has taken possession of the house. That has not begun to happen in large numbers, but many people believe it will.
 ''If you have substantial losses from borrowers with a substantial ability to pay, it makes sense to take them to court,'' said William Markham, a foreclosure expert at the law firm Maldonado & Markham in San Diego. He thinks the threshold for suits is a six-figure loss on the house and a borrower with a six-figure income. 
 People in the industry say banks sometimes tell borrowers that their credit will take less of a hit if they agree to sign a promissory note than if they default. It is not true. In both cases, credit agencies consider the homeowner to have failed to live up to a solemn obligation.
 ''Your credit report is going to be equally bad with a short sale as a foreclosure,'' said Maxine Sweet, a vice president of the credit bureau Experian. 
 It is true, however, that people who sign a promissory note may have an easier time buying a new house than people who have gone into foreclosure; guidelines imposed by Fannie Mae, the mortgage giant, treat foreclosure as a particular black mark in getting a fresh mortgage.
 As the summer began, Mr. Kelly was getting tired of commuting for several hours every day to his new job. He asked Citi if it would accept half of what it was demanding, or $20,000. Before the lender could answer, their buyer backed out. 
 Feeling trapped, the Kellys are increasingly angry at Citi and other financial firms. ''They damaged our economy and don't take any of the responsibility, not really,'' Mrs. Kelly said. Nevertheless, on Aug. 26, she mailed in the September mortgage payment.
 A few days later, Mr. Kelly was abruptly laid off, along with 20 of his colleagues. He landed a new job on Monday but the offer was withdrawn on Wednesday. Too much economic turmoil for us to be adding staff, the company said.
 Only one thing gives Mrs. Kelly any satisfaction. ''Citi should have taken care of this when they could have,'' she said. ''Now there's going to be nothing for them to get.''

HEADLINE: Rough-Hewn Images for Rough-Hewn Times

BYLINE: By KAREN ROSENBERG

 BODY:
In photography's family tree the daguerreotype is the genteel aunt and the tintype the itinerant cousin. Both 19th-century techniques involved the exposure of a metal plate to light and produced a unique, reversed image, but their applications differed widely. A daguerreotype portrait was a formal (and expensive) affair; tintype tents and studios, meanwhile, functioned almost like the photo booths of today. A subject would pose for a few seconds, often in front of a painted backdrop, and wait just minutes for a one-of-a-kind (albeit muddy-looking) portrait.
 ''America and the Tintype'' at the International Center of Photography, organized by the center's chief curator, Brian Wallis, and the photography dealer Steven Kasher, includes some 200 examples of this democratic form of image making from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working and middle class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. 
 The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity.
 The tintype required only a small investment in equipment and training time. Whereas the daguerreotype was composed of copper, silver, mercury or gold, the tintype was merely a thin sheet of iron (known colloquially as ''tinplate,'' hence the misnomer) coated with a light-sensitive black varnish.
 Tintypes were not only cheaper but also sturdier than the delicate daguerreotype or albumen print, rendering them highly portable keepsakes. They were carried on one's person in gilded frames or envelopes, or even worn as jewelry.
 In a fascinating catalog essay Mr. Kasher dissects the tintype's abject, slightly seedy associations. He quotes the photography historian John Wood, who sees in the tintype the sullied image of post-Civil War America: ''The daguerreotype was simply no longer our fitting image. Our faces had found their way to the tintypes.''
 The tintype was a populist medium from the very beginning; it first took hold during the presidential election of 1860. (One of the images here, from 1868, shows a pile of campaign buttons for the Democratic nominee, Horatio Seymour, who lost to Ulysses S. Grant.) Soon after, Civil War soldiers were sending home tintypes from the front. In several tintypes in the show, uniformed men pose with their rifles in front of painted backdrops of military camps.
 In family albums back home the soldiers' tintypes would be displayed together with pictures of other family members, living and dead. The first section of the show includes some startling postmortem portraits of children, among them a set of unidentified triplets laid out in a row and photographed from above.
 The tintype documented injury and disfigurement as well as death. The image on the cover of the exhibition catalog is a picture of a man whose face is almost entirely obscured by bandages. Less noticeable, but just as affecting, is the full-length portrait of a man who is missing two fingers on his right hand. Whether taken as medical documents or as demands for visibility, these images are frank and assertive.
 Another category was the ''Occupational,'' or worker's portrait. These pictures make up nearly an entire wall of the exhibition. Blacksmiths, butchers, newsboys and maids are posed in uniform and with the tools of their trade. Entertainers -- acrobats, clowns, musicians -- also ply their skills.
 As the wall text notes, the rise of the tintype corresponded with a period of financial crisis. The Panic of 1873 and ensuing depression, and the replacement of skilled artisans with industrialized labor, encouraged workers to preserve their jobs in photographic form.
 Even so, tintypes were hardly all work and no play. About half of the show is devoted to giddy, attention-seeking forms of leisure. Men act out robberies, flaunt their biceps and even cross-dress; women pose in pageant costumes and feed each other bananas with a smile and a wink. People let their hair down in defiance of Victorian morals, sometimes literally; one riveting image shows eight girls with lush, wavy locks cascading down their backs.
 A related group of tintypes, more problematic from a contemporary standpoint, attests to the popularity of minstrel shows. Mixed in with pictures of performers in blackface, however, are portraits that reveal various aspects of black American life before, during and after the Civil War. A portrait of a black nanny with her white ward, from 1860, hangs next to one of a freedwoman taken five years later.
 Tintypes were superseded around 1890 by George Eastman's celluloid roll film, an innovation that made tricky wet-plate negatives obsolete, further democratizing photography. So why should we care about the tintype?
 Mr. Kasher, for one, sees it as the ancestor of the disposable digital portraits uploaded daily to photo-sharing Web sites like Flickr and Facebook. The tintype has also been revitalized, or at least recognized, by a small number of contemporary photographers. (Those women with flowing hair, for instance, appeared in a 2006 group exhibition organized by Justine Kurland and Dan Torop.)
 A more persuasive reason, evident throughout the exhibition, is that no other form of photography does as much to convey the social and economic upheavals of the late 19th century. So what if subject matter triumphs over technique -- in the tintype, the American subject as we know it comes into being.
 ''America and the Tintype'' continues through Jan. 4 at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

HEADLINE: Ex-Dog Biscuit Factory Is Among New Landmarks

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
In an 8-to-0 vote, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted on Tuesday morning to grant landmark status to the former Wheatsworth Bakery, a 1928 factory on the Lower East Side that was famous for making Milk-Bone dog treats. 
 The factory at 444 East 10th Street, between Avenues C and D, was one of five sites that were given landmark protection, including a former bank branch on the Lower East Side, a Harlem firehouse, and recreation centers in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and Tompkinsville on Staten Island. 
 The Wheatsworth building, designed by J. Edwin Hopkins, has ''a granite base, terra cotta pilasters etched with bundles of wheat stalks and several bands of multi-colored terra cotta friezes'' typical of the Art Deco style, and the facade's abstract sculptural forms are characteristic of the Viennese Secessionist styles, the commission said. The bakery, which closed in 1957, is now used as a public storage warehouse.
 The other structures that were granted landmark status:
 -- The Public National Bank of New York building at 106 Avenue C and Seventh Street (1923), designed by Eugene Schoen, a New York City-born architect whose work was influenced by artists and architects of the Vienna Secession. 
 Mr. Schoen designed the Avenue C branch, as well as several others for Public National, which had 30 branches in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx and $135 million in deposits by 1928. The branch closed in 1954, and the Bankers Trust Company of New York bought Public National a year later.
 The building was converted into a nursing home in 1954 and into apartments in the 1980s. 
 -- The exterior of the Tompkinsville recreation center and swimming pool on Staten Island, which were financed by the Works Progress Administration. The interior of the Tompkinsville center was also given landmark status in a separate vote.
 The Tompkinsville pool and recreation center were designed by Joseph L. Hautman, the former chief of architecture for the parks department. The complex opened on July 7, 1936, and was renamed in 1938 for Joseph H. Lyons, who created the Staten Island chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and helped found the Slosson Post of the American Legion. (Mr. Lyons died in 1934.)
 The long, low recreation center has features of the Art Moderne style, with a one-and-a-half-story domed entry rotunda, curved end walls, arched windows and door openings, clerestory windows and rounded brick columns. The pool, measuring 165 feet by 100 feet, can accommodate up to 2,800 swimmers. 
 -- The Betsy Head Play Center in Brownsville, Brooklyn, which opened on Aug. 7, 1936, was also financed by the Works Progress Administration. (The play center and the park it is in were named for a Long Island widow who left half of her estate to the city to improve or build parks, playgrounds and bathhouses.)
 John Matthews Hatton designed the center, using recessed glass-block walls and a rooftop observation gallery with parabolic arches that support a cantilevered canopy on the roof. The pool is 330 feet by 165 feet and can hold as many as 5,500 swimmers.
 The Tompkinsville and Betsy Head centers were among 11 recreation centers that opened across New York City in the summer of 1936 under Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. 
 Of those 11 centers, nine have received landmark status in the last two years. 
 Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said, ''They were constructed during a period of extreme economic difficulty, and speak volumes about New York City's ongoing commitment to providing the best public amenities possible to New Yorkers.'' 
 -- Fire Engine Company No. 53, at 175 East 104th Street in East Harlem, is a four-story Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival-style building that was one of 42 firehouses and related structures designed for the Fire Department by the prominent architectural firm of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons from 1879 to 1895. 
 The firehouse, built in 1883 and 1884, has a cast-iron base with a wide entrance. It features motifs like torches, terra cotta sunflowers and sunbursts, and two small pediments that are supported by corbelled brick brackets. 
 Engine Company 53 was used as a fire station until 1974, and is now owned by Manhattan Community Access Corporation, a cable television station.

HEADLINE: Economic Forecast Finds Few Signs of Improvement

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The economy's health worsened for the second consecutive month in August as building permits dropped and unemployment claims rose, a private business group said Thursday.
 The New York-based Conference Board said its monthly forecast of future economic activity declined 0.5 percent in August. That is more than the 0.2 percent decline expected by Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson/IFR. The index fell 0.7 percent in July. 
 Supplier deliveries, manufacturing hours worked and consumer manufacturers' new orders for capital goods all fell.
 ''The indicators show little reason to expect better economic conditions over the next few months,'' Ken Goldstein, a labor economist at the Conference Board, said. ''We may not see any signs of improvement until well into the second half of 2009. Until then, a very slow economy is the most positive expectation.''
 Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 455,000, up 10,000 from the previous week. Analysts had expected claims to fall slightly to 440,000.
 A Labor Department analyst said last week's number was the first to include claims stemming from job losses caused by Hurricane Gustav, which slammed into the Louisiana coast over the Labor Day weekend. Louisiana was unable to report actual claims until last week, the analyst said.
 The department would not give a precise estimate of the impact of the hurricane, but said claims would have fallen without it.
 The four-week average of new claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, rose by 5,000, to 445,000.
 The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits dropped 55,000, to 3.48 million. The four-week average increased to 3.46 million, the highest in almost five years.
 The figures reflect a weakness in the job market. Economists consider initial claims above 400,000 a sign of a struggling economy. A year ago, the figure stood at about 320,000.
 Employers cut payrolls by 84,000 in August, the eighth consecutive month of cuts, the department said. So far, 605,000 jobs have been eliminated this year, and some economists estimate that figure could grow to one million by the end of the year.
 In other economic news, the Philadelphia Fed said its regional manufacturing index improved to a 3.8 in September, from a negative 12.7 in August. It was the first positive reading since November.

HEADLINE: THE LISTINGS

 BODY:
MOVIES
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'BABYLON A.D.' (PG-13, 1:30) Mathieu Kassovitz, the director of this futuristic action movie, has described it as ''pure violence and stupidity,'' but that makes it sound better than it is. (A. O. Scott)
 'BANGKOK DANGEROUS' (R, 1:40) Knotting his brow and collecting a paycheck, Nicolas Cage stars as Joe, an ambivalent assassin moping around Thailand, in this boring, shoddy, racist thriller. Directed in dull, murky spasms by Danny and Oxide Pang, the movie is a remake of their own 1999 picture of the same title. (Nathan Lee)
 'BURN AFTER READING' (R, 1:36) A predictably self-amused comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen with a tricky plot, visual style, er, to burn, but so little heart as to warrant a Jarvik 8. With George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. 
 (Manohla Dargis) 
 'COLLEGE' (R, 1:37) Another tiresome fraternities-are-wild offering in which three high school seniors take a weekend trip to a promising college campus and have, like, a totally insane time. With its rapid-fire bombardment of one gross-out moment after the next, the film strains to sell itself as one crazy ride, though chances are it won't disappoint those looking solely for unadulterated raunch. (Laura Kern) 
 'FLOW' (No rating, 1:24) Irena Salina's astonishingly wide-ranging documentary dives into our planet's most essential resource to find pollution, scarcity, human suffering and corporate profit. From the dubious quality of America's drinking water to worldwide battles against privatization, the movie is a galvanizing examination of the tug of war between public health and private interests. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'FORGIVENESS' (No rating, 1:37, in English, Hebrew and Arabic) A mystifying mishmash of ghost story and group therapy, ''Forgiveness'' centers on a young Israeli-American (Itay Tiran) committed to a mental hospital on the site of a Jewish massacre of a Palestinian village. Flashing backward, forward, up and down, Udi Aloni's film is an endless loop of repressed memories, spiritual aphorisms and bizarre musical numbers. (Catsoulis) 
 'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. 
 (Stephen Holden)
 'A GIRL CUT IN TWO' (No rating, 1:50, in French) A rich, textured divertissement from Claude Chabrol, a sinister master of the art, who here returns to elegant, tight form with a beautifully directed story of a woman (Ludivine Sagnier) preyed upon by different men (Francois Berleand, Benoit Magimel) and her own warring desires. (Dargis)
 'GREETINGS FROM THE SHORE' (R, 1:56) Some of the actors, notably Paul Sorvino, are better than others in this delicate summer-at-the-beach tale set in New Jersey. A teenager named Jenny (Kim Shaw) gets a job teaching English to some mysterious foreigners who work at a yacht club. Love is in the air, and a high-stakes poker game is in the offing. Mr. Sorvino is admirable as a fisherman who befriends Jenny, but some other supporting roles are rendered as thudding cliches. (Neil Genzlinger)
 'I SERVED THE KING OF ENGLAND' (R, 1:58, in Czech) There is hardly a moment in this picaresque slapstick epic, directed by Jiri Menzel (''Closely Watched Trains'') and set mainly in 1930s and '40s Czechoslovakia that you are not aware that its absurdist view of the human condition was shaped by traumatic 20th-century events. (Holden)
 'LOINS OF PUNJAB PRESENTS' (No rating, 1:28) This winning, witty musical-comedy about an ''American Idol''-style competition with Bollywood songs and South Asian immigrant contestants joins showtime antics to sociocultural commentary without reducing its characters to cartoons. (Lee) 
 'THE LONGSHOTS' (PG, 1:26) Bookish girl teams up with loser uncle to transform a useless high school football team into champions. Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit fame directs what may be the most formulaic movie ever made. (Lee)
 'MAN ON WIRE' (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh's beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)
 'MOVING MIDWAY' (No rating, 1:38) Godfrey Cheshire's documentary about his family's plantation in North Carolina fuses personal history and astute analysis into an absorbing and informative meditation on race, kin and memory. (Scott)
 'PING PONG PLAYA' (PG-13, 1:36) A race-based comedy with a mischievous, post-race sensibility, ''Ping Pong Playa'' mines hip-hop comedy gold from the least gangsta context imaginable: the assimilated Chinese-Americans of California. (Lee)
 'THE POOL' (No rating, 1:35, in English and Hindi) This calm, neo-realist film, directed and photographed by the documentarian Chris Smith, blurs the line between fiction and reality as it observes the struggles of an 18-year-old waif in contemporary Goa whose dreams of a better life are symbolized by a rich man's swimming pool. (Holden)
 'RIGHTEOUS KILL' (R, 1:40) Robert De Niro and Al Pacino go macho-a-macho in a thrill-free B-movie thriller (more like C-minus) that probably sounded like a grand idea when their handlers whispered it in their ears. Jon Avnet directed. (Dargis) 
 'A SECRET' (No rating, 1:45, in French) Claude Miller's adaptation of Philippe Grimbert's autobiographical novel is a subtle and moving exploration of intimacy and desire in a French Jewish family before and after World War II. (Scott)
 'TOWELHEAD' (R, 1:56) This provocative satire of a culture that is paradoxically hypersexual and puritanical is set during the first Gulf war in a spanking-new upscale housing development on the outskirts of Houston. In its preoccupations, this crude but scathing portrait of suburban life might be described as ''Son of 'American Beauty.' '' (Holden)
 'TRAITOR' (PG-13, 1:50) Don Cheadle plays Samir Horn, a half-Sudanese, half-American soldier in the war on terror. Which side is he on? The answer turns out to be both obvious and a little preposterous, but Mr. Cheadle's performance is a fine study in ambiguity and doubt, and the director, Jeffrey Nachmanoff, sustains a mood of anxiety that makes the picture absorbing even when it's not quite believable. (Scott) 
 'TROPIC THUNDER' (R, 1:47) A flashy, nasty, on-and-off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry, directed by Ben Stiller, who stars alongside Robert Downey Jr. (in blackface) and Jack Black (in itty- bitty bikini underwear). (Dargis)
 'TROUBLE THE WATER' (No rating, 1:33) While making this superb documentary about Hurricane Katrina, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin hit the jackpot when they meet two New Orleans survivors, Kimberly and Scott Roberts, who rode out the storm with a video camera. (Dargis) 
 'TYLER PERRY'S THE FAMILY THAT PREYS' (PG-13, 1:51) The suds that cascade through Tyler Perry melodrama more than equal the cubic footage from nighttime soaps like ''Dallas,'' ''Dynasty'' and their offspring. (Holden)
 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. (Dargis)
 'THE WOMEN' (PG-13, 1:54) ''What is this, some '30s movie?'' a character asks in this misbegotten remake of George Cukor's feline look at female friendship and rivalry. If only. (Scott)
 Film Series
 HOLLYWOOD ON THE HUDSON (Friday through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) Before the rise of filmmaking in Hollywood, New York and New Jersey together formed a major center of production -- and did again in the late 1920s, when the studios returned to New York to tap Broadway talent for the early talkies. This absorbing series, based on the book ''Hollywood on the Hudson'' by Richard Koszarski, contains rarely screened examples of films from both periods. Friday night, for example, brings Charles Brabin's 1920 ''While New York Sleeps,'' a collection of three tales of the city all featuring the same cast, followed by Jean De Limur's 1929 ''The Letter,'' featuring the Broadway star Jeanne Eagels in an adaptation of the W. Somerset Maugham play that later served Bette Davis and William Wyler so well. Sunday brings two rarities by D. W.

HEADLINE: Folgers Markets a New Coffee To Cost-Cutting Home Brewers

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
 IN the 24 years since coffee drinkers were first told that ''the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup,'' the statement has become harder to defend. 
 The competition -- shops like Starbucks, Cosi or Caribou -- can now be found on every corner, all brewing coffee made from pricey Arabica beans. Mainstays like Folgers -- which relies on less expensive Robusta beans -- have competed by focusing on cost-conscious home brewers, often by introducing flavored coffees or specialty brews. 
 Now Folgers, which is still the top-selling packaged coffee in the United States, is trying to lure customers with an approach to roasting that it calls ''the biggest innovation since the launch of decaf.'' 
 The company will unveil the roasting method with an ad campaign that it says is the most expensive in the history of the brand.
 ''Over the last 8 to 10 years, we have been working on ways to drive technology to improve the cup-to-cup consistency and flavor quality of our coffee,'' said Jamie Egasti, president of coffee for Procter & Gamble. This year, Procter & Gamble sold the Folgers brand to the J. M. Smucker Company for $2.95 billion in stock. The deal is expected to close before the end of the year.
 P.& G. has overhauled its main roasting plant in east New Orleans -- which employs more than 400 people -- to include a step it calls ''predry'' or ''preroast.'' Each bean is fully dried before roasting, ensuring a more evenly cooked bean, which makes it less bitter.
 ''This is the largest technical investment in our roasting facility we have done,'' Mr. Egasti said.
 Jim Trout, innovation leader for research and development, at P.& G., said: ''It's like thawing a turkey before you cook it. If you don't, the outside will be burnt and the inside will still be raw. This way it cooks evenly all the way through.''
 While the company is realistic about its chances of swaying those in the habit of drinking Starbucks coffee, Folgers believes there is room to win customers among those who brew at home. 
 ''Given the economy, there is an opportunity to underscore what Folgers offers with people who may have been going out more frequently than they do today,'' said Marnie Kain-Cacossa, executive vice president, global equity director at Saatchi & SaatchiNew York, Folger's ad agency of more than 50 years.
 The ad campaign includes a TV commercial, print ads, in-store signage, coupons and Web banner ads. The packaging of Folgers' coffee has also been overhauled to include information about the roasting process. 
 The 30-second TV spot features a man in pajamas preparing coffee as the sounds of a typical morning -- kitchen drawers opening, slippers squeaking, a spoon clinking inside a mug -- are heard at high volume. The sound effects are intended to deliver a ''heightened sense of reality that mirrors the enhanced coffee,'' Ms. Kain-Cacossa said. 
 Saatchi & Saatchi created the campaign, as well as the ''Best part of waking up'' jingle, which first aired in 1984. The jingle appears in the new TV spot, though without lyrics. Ms. Kain-Cacossa said research showed that the jingle was recognizable to consumers without the slogan.
 The spot will first appear Sept. 29, and run largely on women-oriented networks like Lifetime, HGTV, Food Network and the Soap Network. Neither P.& G. nor Saatchi would disclose a specific budget for the campaign, but it is expected to be in the low six figures. Ms. Kain-Cacossa called it ''the largest marketing investment in the history of Folgers.''
 Print and Web ads will focus on images of the red Folgers canister transformed into a roaster, with copy reading, ''Every mountain-grown bean of Folgers is roasted with care, using just the right amount of heat. So every morning, you can wake up to rich, pure taste.''
 This is not the first time that Folgers has tried to keep pace with the changing tastes of coffee drinkers. The company introduced flavored coffees in 2002, and in 2006 released gourmet roasts with names like caramel drizzle and espresso roast. It has even introduced a variety called Simply Smooth, intended to lessen the chance for an upset stomach. 
 A coffee industry analyst and consultant, Judy Ganes, said that despite the change in consumer coffee habits in the last decade, Folger's and Maxwell House were still by far the dominant coffee brands on the market and could capture an even greater share as consumers on a budget return to home brewing. 
 ''People may be willing to forgo the high end but don't want to have a bad cup of coffee either,'' she said. ''When people are trying to watch their wallets, they may be willing to give this a try.''
 That shift has yet to show itself in the marketplace. According to the National Coffee Association, 17 percent of adults in the United States drank a gourmet coffee beverage every day in 2007, a record high. Over all, coffee consumption dipped to 80 percent of the population in 2007, down from 82 percent the year before. 
 The sale of Folgers was part of an effort by P.& G. to refocus on core businesses, namely global health and beauty brands, and those that show growth of at least 4 percent annually. Folgers grew by about that much in 2007, but is sold only in North America. 
 ''The margins that you can earn in the health and beauty space are significantly above those in food and beverage,'' Mr. Egasti said.

 CORRECTION:
 The Advertising column on Friday, about a marketing campaign by Folgers coffee, misstated the type of coffee beans used by a rival, Maxwell House. It primarily uses Arabica beans, not the less expensive Robusta.

HEADLINE: The Tyranny of Diagnosis

BYLINE: By PAULINE W. CHEN, M.D.

 BODY:
Not long ago, while surfing online for one disease, I got sidetracked by another: cryptogenic cirrhosis.
 I have cared for patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. It is a common cause of liver-related illness and death in the United States, and symptoms can range from jaundice, bleeding and confusion to life-threatening hemorrhage, coma and death. 
 The cause of the disease, as the name implies (from the Greek ''krypt,'' or hidden, and ''genesis,'' or origin), has long been unknown. Every one of my patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis has heard the same thing from their doctors, including myself: ''We have no idea why you are so sick.'' 
 For these patients, cryptogenic cirrhosis is not a diagnosis but a non-diagnosis.
 Non-diagnoses like cryptogenic cirrhosis pose particular challenges for doctors. While I feel comfortable predicting the post-transplant course and clinical reactions of patients with, for example, hepatitis or liver cancer, I can never be sure with patients who have cryptogenic cirrhosis. 
 And patients with non-diagnoses face even greater challenges, challenges that go beyond knowing what exactly is wrong or getting treatments.
 For several years of my childhood, my mother suffered from an illness that could not be diagnosed. I have memories of her weakness, of days spent whispering so that she could sleep, and of living with the constant darkness of her bedroom and of her suffering. 
 Debilitated, my mother went from doctor to doctor, clinician to clinician. Despite their rapt attention to the details of her symptoms, she eventually heard from them what her surgeon-daughter would someday tell others: ''We have no idea why you are so sick.''
 As I read up on cyptogenic cirrhosis, I was reminded of those words again. Over the last few years, medical researchers have made tremendous advances in our understanding of this illness; it is not quite so cryptogenic anymore, and those suffering from the disease may soon have specific drugs for treatment. 
 That's good news for patients, I thought as I scanned the Web sites. But also not-so-good news.
 As comforting as it may be to have a real diagnosis, those diagnoses also carry powerful assumptions about our bodies and our place in the world, which can in turn influence our health care. 
 Charles Rosenberg, a Harvard historian, writes about the power of diagnoses in his book ''Our Present Complaint: American Medicine, Then and Now'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007). He refers to it as the ''tyranny of diagnosis.'' 
 The concept of disease, Professor Rosenberg writes, has historically focused on the individual -- a single person's experience, story and sense of meaning. 
 Over the last century and a half, however, medicine has increasingly decoupled disease from the individual. This decoupling has given rise to the concept of precise, objective and quantifiable diagnoses, diagnoses so separate from patients that they seem in many ways to take on a life of their own. 
 Diagnoses cluster together by specific physiologic mechanisms, signs and symptoms, pathologic findings. They have insinuated themselves into health care economics as DRG's, or Diagnosis-Related Groups, which drive physician compensation. They have inspired whole subspecialty training programs and huge advances in how we understand and treat them. Think of heart failure, cancer and my own specialty, liver transplantation.
 This greater understanding and improved treatment are important and good news for all, no doubt.
 Yet along with these great clinical strides, diagnoses have also fomented their own cultural revolution. Diagnoses have changed the way we approach individuals. 
 Diagnosing a patient requires placing that single person's narrative against the larger predetermined trajectory of a diagnosis. When the individual's story fits into the diagnosis's trajectory, there is some relief for all of us. We know what is wrong. 
 But when we know what is wrong, we sometimes stop paying such close attention to those patient experiences that seem to have little relevance to the diagnosis at hand. We focus less on the individual and more on the diagnosis.
 When the diagnosis trajectory and patient picture don't match, we are left with an ''atypical,'' ''complicated,'' ''idiopathic'' or ''undiagnosable'' case. One of the risks for these patients, in addition to prolonged physical discomfort or suffering, is that without a diagnosis, their experience may lose meaning and relevance in the eyes of others. 
 My mother has been well for a few decades now, though her doctors still are not entirely sure of what made her so sick years ago. But the diagnoses they have considered, and her own search for one, have influenced how others -- both doctors and non-doctors -- have treated and listened to her. 
 When my mother had no diagnosis, her family and friends, clinicians, and others at first listened intently, sifting her narratives for every possible clue. But then most of us eventually lost interest, as if her experience could not really exist if it had no name. 
 But each time my mother got close to the relief of having a diagnosis, many of us stopped listening, too, choosing to hear only what seemed important to the diagnosis.
 That, I now fear, is the not-so-good news for people with diseases like cryptogenic cirrhosis. We seem unable to harness the power of diagnoses and give full weight to the meaning of an individual's illness experience.
 I recently asked Professor Rosenberg about the power that diagnoses have over how all of us view illness and health care. ''Some people would call it progress, some people would call it reductionism, some people would call it bureaucracy,'' he told me. ''But it's all of those things.''
 Are doctors treating the diagnosis or the patient? Join the discussion on the Well blog.

HEADLINE: McCain Seen as Less Likely to Bring Change, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by Marjorie Connelly in Washington, and Marina Stefan, Dalia Sussman and Megan Thee in New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the days after the Republican convention in St. Paul -- as Senator John McCain was greeted with huge crowds as he traveled the country with his new running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska -- party leaders and McCain aides were buoyed by the reception, and said it hinted at good things for Mr. McCain as he headed into the general election contest with Senator Barack Obama.
 By every indication, Ms. Palin seemed on the brink of producing a whole series of benefits for Mr. McCain. She could rally Republican base voters who have long been wary of Mr. McCain because of his positions on some issues. She could permit Mr. McCain to reach out to independent and perhaps even Democratic women voters upset at the nature of the Democratic contest that resulted in Mr. Obama defeating Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 And the break-the-mold nature of the choice, they argued, could help Mr. McCain in what was one of his chief political goals of that convention: To assert that he and Ms. Palin -- and not Mr. Obama -- would bring change and reform to Washington, taking from Mr. Obama what had been his signature theme from the start of his candidacy. 
 But two weeks after the Republican convention, with public sentiment starting to settle into place, there are indications that Ms. Palin might not be accomplishing what Mr. McCain had hoped in choosing her.
 A New York Times/CBS News poll this week found that Ms. Palin had accomplished one crucial goal for Mr. McCain: She helped raise the enthusiasm level markedly among Republicans: 47 percent of his Republican supporters said they were enthusiastic about the ticket, twice as much as before.
 But so far, the poll suggests, the boost has not gone far beyond that. The poll found that even now, voters are much more likely to identify Mr. Obama -- and not Mr. McCain -- as someone who would bring change to Washington. He is widely viewed as someone who would continue or expand President Bush's policies in office.
 And the New York Times/CBS News poll found no evidence, at least to date, that Ms. Palin has allowed Mr. McCain to expand his appeal to women voters or independent voters. Polls taken immediately after the convention had found evidence of a sharp increase in support for Mr. McCain among white women, but this poll suggests that that effect was, so far at least, limited. White women were evenly divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama; before the conventions, Mr. McCain led Mr. Obama among white women, 44 percent to 37 percent.
 Indeed, in many ways it was as if the past action-packed month -- with two conventions and two vice presidential selections -- almost did not happen at all. The Times/CBS News poll found the contest is be about where it was before the two conventions and before the vice-presidential selections: Mr. Obama had the support of 48 percent of registered voters, compared with 43 percent for Mr. McCain, a difference within the poll's margin of sampling error, and statistically unchanged from the tally in the last New York Times/CBS News poll, in mid-August. 
 The latest Times/CBS News nationwide telephone poll was taken Friday through Tuesday with 1,133 adults, including 1,004 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all respondents and for registered voters. 
 The poll showed that Mr. McCain had some enduring strengths, including a substantial advantage over Mr. Obama as a potential commander in chief. It found that for the first time, 50 percent of those surveyed in the Times/CBS News poll said they considered that the troop buildup in Iraq, a policy that Mr. McCain championed from the start, had made things better there.
 The poll was taken during a period of extraordinary turmoil on Wall Street. By overwhelming numbers, Americans said the economy was the top issue affecting their vote decision, and they continued to express deep pessimism about the nation's economic future. They continued to express greater confidence in Mr. Obama's ability to manage the economy, even as Mr. McCain has aggressively sought to raise doubts about it.
 This poll found evidence of concern about Ms. Palin's qualifications to be president, particularly compared with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Mr. Obama's running mate. More than 6 in 10 said they would be concerned if Mr. McCain could not finish his term and Ms. Palin had to take over. In contrast, two-thirds of voters surveyed said Mr. Biden would be qualified to take over for Mr. Obama, a figure that cut across party lines.
 And 75 percent said they thought Mr. McCain had picked Ms. Palin more to help him win the election than because he thought that she was well qualified to be president; by contrast, 31 percent said they thought that Mr. Obama had picked Mr. Biden more to help him win the election, while 57 percent said it was because he thought Mr. Biden was well qualified for the job.
 This poll was taken right after Ms. Palin sat down for a series of high-profile interviews with Charles Gibson on ABC News.
 Over the last two weeks, Mr. McCain has increasingly tried to distance himself from his party and President Bush, running as an outsider against Washington. The poll suggested the urgency of Mr. McCain's task: The percentage of Americans who disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is conducting his job, 68 percent, was as high as it has been for any sitting president in the history of New York Times polling. And 81 percent said the country was heading in the wrong direction.
 The poll found that 46 percent of voters thought Mr. McCain would continue Mr. Bush's policies, while 22 percent said he would be more conservative than Mr. Bush. (About one-quarter said a McCain presidency would be less conservative than Mr. Bush's.) At a time when Mr. McCain has tried to appeal to independent voters by separating himself from his party, notably with his convention speech, 57 percent of all voters said they viewed him as a typical Republican, compared with 40 percent who said he was a different kind of Republican.
 Although nearly half of voters also described Mr. Obama as a typical Democrat, the party's brand is not as diminished as the Republicans'; the Democratic Party had a favorability rating of 50 percent in August, compared with 37 percent for the Republicans, a fairly consistent trend in the Times/CBS News Poll since 2006, and part of the general political landscape that many analysts believe favors the Democrats.
 In one of the sharpest differences highlighted in the poll, 37 percent said that Mr. McCain would bring real change to Washington, up from 28 percent before the two parties' conventions. But 65 percent of those polled said that Mr. Obama would bring real change to Washington.
 Despite weeks of fierce Republican attacks, Mr. Obama has maintained an edge on several key measures of presidential leadership, including economic stewardship. Sixty percent of voters said they were confident in his ability to make the right decisions on the economy, compared with 53 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain. Sixty percent also said he understood the needs and problems ''of people like yourself,'' compared with 48 percent who said that of Mr. McCain.
 More than twice as many said an Obama presidency would improve the image of the United States around the world, 55 percent, compared with those who believed a McCain presidency would do so. Mr. Obama also gets high marks for ''sharing the values most Americans try to live by,'' despite concerted Republican efforts to portray him as elite and out of touch with average voters. Sixty-six percent said Mr. Obama shared their values, compared with 61 percent who said that about Mr. McCain.
 Mr. McCain, however, was maintaining some core advantages, particularly on preparedness to be president and ability to serve as commander in chief. Forty-eight percent said Mr. Obama was prepared enough to be president, compared with 71 percent who rated Mr. McCain as adequately prepared. 
 Fifty-two percent said it was ''very likely'' that Mr. McCain would be an effective commander in chief, twice as many as felt that way about Mr. Obama.
 The two men received similar rankings when voters were asked about what had long been perceived as a McCain strength: the ability to make the right decisions about the war in Iraq. Fifty-two percent said they were ''very'' or ''somewhat'' confident in Mr. Obama's ability on this front; 56 percent said they felt that way about Mr. McCain.
 In general, Ms. Palin was viewed more favorably (40 percent) than unfavorably (30 percent). She was particularly popular among fellow Republicans, conservatives and white voters who describe themselves as evangelical Christians, which explains her energizing effect on the Republican base. Nearly 70 percent of Mr. McCain's supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Ms. Palin; 27 percent of Mr. Obama's supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Mr. Biden.
 When asked who they thought would win in November, 45 percent said Mr. Obama and 38 percent said Mr. McCain.

HEADLINE: Officials Meet to Chart Course Through Credit Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, met with Congressional leaders on Thursday night to discuss a range of possible solutions to deal with the worst financial crisis in decades, a Treasury spokeswoman said. 
 The group, which included Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is ''exploring all options, legislative and administrative'' and expects to work through the weekend to devise a plan to ease the crisis and help restore confidence in the financial markets, the spokeswoman, Brookly McLaughlin, said.
 In comments after the meeting, Mr. Paulson said that rescue package would require the passage of legislation. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he expected to get a proposal from the Fed and the administration in a matter of hours.
 Shares on Wall Street surged late Thursday on reports that the administration was considering an entity similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s. Ms. McLaughlin's statement made it clear that such a solution was only one possibility.
 The session Thursday night coincided with a pledge to President Bush by the House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, to keep Congress in session beyond its scheduled Sept. 26 adjournment if necessary ''to consider legislative proposals and conduct necessary investigations'' linked to the crisis, according to Ms. Pelosi's letter to the president.
 Item One at the Thursday meeting was ''the illiquid assets on bank balance sheets that are at the underlying sources of the current stresses in our financial institutions and financial markets,'' Ms. McLaughlin said.
 The wording of the Treasury statement, coupled with Ms. Pelosi's offer for the legislators to stay in Washington even as many are eager to go home to campaign, reflected the gravity of the rapidly changing situation, both from a fiscal and political perspective.
 ''We stand ready to work with you and your administration to consider constructive solutions that stabilize our financial markets and balance accountability to the U.S. taxpayer with protection American families from the crisis fallout,'' Ms. Pelosi said in her letter to the president.
 Wall Street has gone through tough times before, but some financial specialists now question how quickly the industry can rebound after using high levels of leverage, or borrowed money, to buy on risky investments. Those investments have been disastrous. Worldwide, financial companies have reported more than $500 billion in charges and losses stemming from the credit crisis -- a figure that some specialists say could eventually exceed $1 trillion. 
 Congressional participants, other than Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid, were Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader; Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Banking Committee; Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking panel; Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader; and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.

HEADLINE: Governor Palin and the Prudence Factor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Why Experience Matters'' (column, Sept. 16):
 David Brooks is right on the money. How did we get to a place where we want someone for president who is average or just like me? It is too big a job for the merely competent. Over the last seven years we have seen the results of such thinking. 
 I want a leader with a profound intellectual curiosity, comfortable with the nuances of economics, politics and governance. 
 I want someone 10, 20 or 100 times smarter than what we have. We cannot afford to dumb down the presidency.
 Ron Freeland Woodstock, Md., Sept.
 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks notes of Gov. Sarah Palin, ''The feminists declare that she's not a real woman because she doesn't hew to their rigid categories.'' 
 Feminists are not saying that she is not a ''real woman'' (whatever that means). And what ''rigid categories''? 
 We are saying simply that Ms. Palin represents positions that are the polar opposite of everything feminists have worked so hard to achieve over the last 40 years. 
 This and her lack of experience make her an unpalatable candidate for high office.
 Julie Malnig New York, Sept.
 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks makes a good case for the need for prudence in national leaders, and the lack thereof in Gov. Sarah Palin. 
 What kind of prudence did John McCain display in selecting her as a running mate?

To the Editor:
 Re ''New Phase in Finance Crisis as Investors Run to Safety'' (front page, Sept. 18):
 As we watch in awe, dismay and fear at the slow-motion unraveling of our financial system, we need to move from anger and blame to a reconsideration of some presumed truths.
 First, as the federal government engages in acts to rescue one faltering financial institution after another not seen since the Great Depression, we must recognize that free -- that is, unregulated -- markets do not always self-correct and that the financial wizards of corporate America do not have all the answers.
 Second, those same people, usually Republicans, must finally admit that if this exercise in socialized capitalism is acceptable, then having a government-run universal health care system is also acceptable and should not be denigrated as socialized medicine because it is not controlled by profit-making corporations. 
 Third, we are all in this together, and blaming one group or another will not solve the problem. Of course, it is in human nature to be greedy, but it is also in human nature to be altruistic. 
 It is time to learn from this catastrophe by putting aside petty partisan defenses, repairing the damage and improving the quality of life for all Americans.

 Re ''Fed in an $85 Billion Rescue of an Insurer Near Failure'' (front page, Sept. 17): 
 Why is it that when the wizards of Wall Street are making billions, they get to keep the money, making some of them fabulously wealthy? But when they are utterly incompetent and their enterprises collapse, the taxpayers pick up the tab? Where is the justice?

 Re ''McCain Laboring to Hit Right Note on the Economy'' (front page, Sept. 17):
 John McCain claims to understand American workers' distress and denounces ''greed'' on Wall Street. His understanding must be tissue-thin, however, given his historic association with the Republican economic agenda. 
 Consider, for example, what might have happened in the current financial crisis if Mr. McCain and his party had won the battle to privatize Social Security. 
 Those distressed workers, having invested part of their wages in private pension plans, would now face retirement with precious little return on their investments. They'd also be dipping into pension savings just to pay the mortgage or the heating bill. 
 Not for them the luxury of the golden parachute or the government bailout. Just hard times.
 Judy Salzman Watertown, Mass., Sept. 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The media and the Obama campaign have jumped all over Senator John McCain for saying that the fundamentals of the economy are ''strong.'' This proves, they say, that he is out of touch.
 Maybe his instincts are not so wrong. Everyone knows that the economy has been hit hard, but psychology plays a huge part in bringing about a recovery. The drumbeat of woe and doom makes things only worse, as people stop spending and investing. 
 Having politically correct politicians and the media scream that we are headed for a depression makes their predictions self-fulfilling. 
 John McCain's natural instinct was to be optimistic, not to panic. 
 Things will get better if we act now with speed and compassion, but we need to believe that the fundamentals are strong. 
 As a Democratic president once said, ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.''
 John McCain's first instinct was to address that fear. He should not be criticized for doing so.

 ''Wall Street Is Down, and So Are They'' (news article, Sept. 18):
 Every day we read more stories about the woes of Wall Street, which inevitably will affect us all. While it is undeniably necessary to determine how we got to this place so as to avoid winding up here again in the future, I am struck by the runaway train of blame that seems to be running amok. 
 Everyone from the top down seems to need to find someone else to point the finger at. We each need to look ourselves squarely in the eye, in the mirror and honestly ask ourselves a question: Did I in any way contribute to this mess?
 Until we remember that we are all an ''I,'' before a ''they,'' we will never solve any of our problems, and continue to depend on others to save us from ourselves.

 Re ''Need a Job? $17,000 an Hour. No Success Required'' (column, Sept. 18):
 Cheers to Nicholas D. Kristof for hitting the C.E.O. salary nail on the head. But there's yet another nail to be driven home: the practice of passing rising costs on to the consumer to maintain sufficient corporate profitability. 
 The effects of this abuse resonate all the way down the line, from shareholders to those shopping at Wal-Mart, the gas station and the local supermarket. People are hurting, and they are finally shouting ''Enough!'' Martha D. Trowbridge New York, Sept. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof doesn't go far enough when he suggests that overpaid American C.E.O.'s ''should learn from Britain and Australia.'' I would like to see some masters of the universe line up, bow deeply and apologize to their employees and shareholders -- in the fashion of Japanese managers.
 And then give back the money they didn't earn.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''For Wall Street, Greed Wasn't Good Enough'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 18):
 Paul Wilmott correctly contends that the cause of the current fiscal crisis emanates from the free-rider mentality that spurred Wall Street: bankers will continue ''taking risks with other people's money'' so long as they ''do not suffer equally on the downside.''
 Unfortunately, this free-rider mentality has infected not only Wall Street bankers, but also our collective American psyche. Witness the huge government debt that we have incurred, undoubtedly a form of risk-taking that we, for the most part, will not pay for, but our children will.

 To the Editor:
 Many blame predatory lending practices for the recent bank failures. I blame the inability of lenders to calculate the effect of a variable interest rate on their monthly mortgage payments. 
 In a culture in which people chuckle at how bad they were in math during their school years, the cost of mathematical illiteracy to this nation is now measured in the tens of billions.

 Dear Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson:
 My student loans are too big and it is hurting the economy. Can I have a bailout, please? I need $92,000.
 Thanks.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Unit in Deal for Troubled Power Supplier

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Diana B. Henriques contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett proved on Thursday that he still has an appetite for deal-making, just not in the financial and insurance sectors that have been decimated by the credit crisis.
 MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a division of Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, tentatively agreed to pay $4.7 billion for Constellation Energy, a wholesale supplier of power whose stock has plummeted amid concerns about its bad energy trading bets.
 The Constellation deal is the latest in a string of transactions that Mr. Buffett, often called the Oracle of Omaha, has participated in over the last year. It is also yet another purchase that steers clear of the financial services industry, a sector that he so far has actively avoided. 
 ''The banking crisis is in my view going to linger until there can be some more real transparency and we know what dangers are lurking into these portfolios,'' said Frank Betz, a partner at Carret Zane Capital Management, an investment firm that holds Berkshire shares. ''I think Buffett will go out and buy lots of companies where that's not a factor.''
 To Mr. Betz and many other followers of Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy, the latest deal was ''a crystal-clear layup.'' MidAmerican will pay $26.50 a share in cash, a 7 percent premium to Constellation's closing share price on Wednesday.
 Constellation's shares have fallen nearly 50 percent since Monday, after research analysts raised concerns about trading ties between the company's commodities brokerage unit and Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection that day. Shares of Constellation closed down 57 cents on Thursday, to $24.20.
 While the choppiness of the credit markets has sidelined deal-making machines like private equity firms, corporate buyers with sterling credit ratings and bulging war chests of cash -- like Berkshire -- have begun acquisition sprees. 
 In December, the company agreed to pay $4.5 billion for Marmon Holdings, the huge holding company of the Pritzker family. And Berkshire stepped into new territory by providing nearly $10 billion in financing for the Mars acquisition of the Wrigley Company and Dow Chemical's merger with Rohm & Haas.
 Mr. Buffett has shown that he will not hesitate to buy companies that fit naturally with his existing holdings. 
 ''MidAmerican has been a wonderful steward of its energy assets, and the acquisition of Constellation Energy, when completed, will prove beneficial to all constituents,'' he said in a statement on Thursday.
 But despite Berkshire's core insurance business, Mr. Buffett has shown little to no interest in other financial firms. His views on the hard-to-value assets that have plagued investment banks and insurance companies are well known. He has derided derivatives as ''financial weapons of mass destruction.'' And for the most part, he has hewed closely to that view. 
 When the American International Group sought to sell assets quickly last weekend to raise sorely needed cash, senior executives from the ailing insurance giant reached out to Mr. Buffett, people briefed on the matter said. Yet he declined to buy any of the assets, saying he was more interested in what A.I.G. was not offering.
 Only hours away from a likely bankruptcy filing, A.I.G. received a reprieve late Tuesday when the government extended an $85 billion loan to the company. To repay the loan, A.I.G. plans to sell businesses, and Mr. Betz said Mr. Buffett was likely to bid then.
 ''There are a lot of attractive pieces in A.I.G.,'' he said, adding that he thought Mr. Buffett was probably more interested in its core insurance businesses than units like aircraft leasing.
 And late last year, as bond insurers like MBIA and Ambac suffered big losses amid rising mortgage defaults, Berkshire did not ride to their rescue. Instead, Mr. Buffett established Berkshire's own bond insurance business, drawing on his firm's sterling reputation to create a formidable new competitor.
 Mr. Buffett does not necessarily shy away from investments in financial companies. At Berkshire's annual meeting this summer, he gleefully reported on the killing he had made during the winter by stepping into the paralyzed market for auction-rate securities and snapping up $4 billion in solid high-yielding notes, according to Jeff Matthews, a hedge fund manager and the author of a coming book, ''Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett's Omaha.''

HEADLINE: Bush Emerges After Days of Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On Thursday, the president spoke.
 It was brief, two minutes. His brow was furrowed, and his words were careful: ''The American people can be sure we will continue to act to strengthen and stabilize our financial markets and improve investor confidence.'' Then, having imparted no specifics, he once again slipped out of sight.
 In the increasingly surreal world of the White House, the appearance was a sign that all pretense of normalcy is gone. All week long, with Wall Street engulfed by what analysts are calling the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, President Bush had mostly stayed out of sight, except when trying to maintain the facade of business as usual. 
 To be sure, other presidents, most recently Mr. Bush's predecessor, Bill Clinton, have been careful about what they say in public when Wall Street is in turmoil. But by all outward appearances, Mr. Bush has been reduced this week to almost a bit player in his own government, as Washington has reoriented itself away from the White House and toward Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
 On Monday, as Americans absorbed the news that the venerable investment bank Lehman Brothers had been forced into bankruptcy, Mr. Bush received John Kufuor, the president of Ghana, at the White House. The sun-dappled South Lawn was awash in color that morning, as a full military honor guard and a fife and drum band marched across the grass, entertaining the leaders before they exchanged the customary pleasantries.
 ''Your tenure has been full of events and challenges, some very mind-boggling and hair-raising,'' Mr. Kufuor told Mr. Bush, raising more than a few eyebrows. ''You are a survivor,'' the Ghanaian leader told the American president. ''And my hope is that history would prove kinder to you.''
 That evening, after the stock market had nose-dived, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 500 points, Mr. Bush, his wife Laura and more than 100 of their guests dined on Maine lobster and ginger-scented lamb during a state dinner in the African leader's honor. Then, in their tuxedoes and ball gowns they repaired to the Rose Garden to watch actors from Disney's musical ''The Lion King'' perform a medley of songs under the cool, dark Washington sky.
 On Tuesday, when the insurance giant American International Group appeared headed toward bankruptcy, Mr. Bush flew to Texas to inspect hurricane damage. As he flew over the devastation in his helicopter, Marine One, a press helicopter following him adjusted its flight path allow photographers on board to capture the image of Mr. Bush's chopper in perfect alignment with the wreckage below. 
 On the ground in the Gulf Coast island of Galveston, Tex., Mr. Bush met behind closed doors with state and local leaders and emerged surrounded by a crowd of them, holding the hand of Galveston's mayor, Lyda Ann Thomas, as he walked past television cameras that his aides kept a safe distance away.
 ''Mr. President!'' a reporter shouted. ''What are you going to do about A.I.G.?''
 Mr. Bush looked straight at the cameras and kept walking as he shouted back. ''We're here talking about the people of Galveston, Texas,'' he said. ''They've got a great mayor, and they're working hard.''
 And so it went, until Thursday, when it became clear that Mr. Bush would have to show himself to the public, after the White House press corps had begun agitating to know just what, precisely, the president was doing. 
 The day earlier, Mr. Bush had kept up another seemingly ordinary schedule: separate meetings with Gen. David Petraeus and the president of Panama, hosting the annual White House Iftaar dinner, in honor of American Muslims. ''There are times, believe it or not, when policy makers actually need to, like, work on making policy,'' his press secretary, Dana Perino, explained.
 But by Thursday, the White House put out the news that Mr. Bush would no longer spend the day traveling to Alabama and Florida, where he had planned to attend two Republican fund-raisers and, in Alabama, to tour a facility that converts sewage and other waste to energy. Instead, he huddled inside the White House and emerged just after 10 a.m. to explain himself:
 ''I've canceled my travel today to stay in Washington, where I will continue to closely monitor the situation in our financial markets and consult with my economic advisers.''

HEADLINE: A Bid to Curb Profit Gambit As Banks Fall

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and JONATHAN D. GLATER; Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Traders who have sought to profit from the financial crisis by betting against bank stocks were attacked on two continents on Thursday. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a temporary ban on short sales of some or all shares and an announcement could be made as early as Friday morning. Earlier Thursday, the S.E.C. scrambled to put together an emergency rule to force major investors to disclose their short sales daily.
 In Britain, regulators announced new rules to bar short selling.
 Short selling -- a bet that a stock price will decline -- is the practice of selling stock without owning it, hoping to buy it later at a lower price, and thus make a profit. It has often been blamed for forcing prices down in times of market stress, but the level of anger has intensified as the American government has been forced to bail out major financial institutions and the leaders of some investment banks have asked for action to protect their shares. 
 Both the S.E.C. and the New York State attorney general promised to intensify investigations into short selling abuses. ''They are like looters after a hurricane,'' said Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general. ''If you pass a rumor in a normal marketplace, people are calm, they check it out, they do their due diligence. When you get the market in this frenzied state and they are on pins and needles, any false information is much more impactful.''
 Short sellers say that the criticism directed at them, and any restrictions on their activity, are wrong-headed, because they were among the first to raise the alarm about the risky mortgage lending practices that led to the current financial crisis.
 Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, said the S.E.C. had ''kept in place trading rules that let speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino'' and said that the S.E.C.'s chairman, Christopher Cox, had ''betrayed the public's trust.'' 
 Speaking at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr. McCain said, ''If I were president today, I would fire him.''
 The White House immediately said it supported Mr. Cox, who has said he will resign at the end of the Bush administration. Mr. Cox said he had moved against short sellers and was doing all he could to stem the financial crisis. 
 ''Now is not the time for those of us in the trenches to be distracted by the ebb and flow of the current election campaign,'' Mr. Cox said in a statement released by the commission. ''It is precisely the wrong moment for a change in leadership that inevitably would disrupt the work of the S.E.C. at just the wrong time.''
 Mr. Cox is a former White House aide to President Ronald Reagan and a former Republican congressman from California. Some conservative columnists and commentators, including Robert Novak, supported him as a running mate for Mr. McCain. Writing in the American Spectator earlier this year, Quin Hillyer said that conservatives would rally to a Cox selection and called him ''the best choice, bar none.''
 In recent weeks, Mr. Cox has also stepped up his criticism of short sellers, particularly those who engage in ''naked'' short selling. While short sellers are supposed to borrow shares before selling them, naked shorts do not borrow. That saves the cost of borrowing, though the trader is still vulnerable to losses if the share price rises.
 Opponents of short selling believe that it can force share prices down and destroy confidence in a company that might otherwise survive. Regulators have long thought that the practice was crucial for efficient markets to function, but earlier this year the S.E.C. imposed temporary limits on short selling of some financial stocks. Financial share prices rallied when those limits were announced but fell during the period in which the rule was in effect.
 Share prices for many financial companies shot up Thursday afternoon after plunging the day before in the wake of the government decision to take control of the American International Group, a large insurance company, to prevent it from collapsing. Financial shares were especially hard hit Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley plunging 24 percent, to $21.75, and its chief executive, John J. Mack, blaming false rumors spread by short sellers. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley regained part of that loss, rising 3.7 percent to close at $22.55.
 The latest moves against short sellers began Wednesday. In the morning, Mr. Cox announced new rules to prevent brokerage firms from selling a stock short if they previously had sold the stock short without having borrowed it. That night, he said that he would propose more rules, to force large short sellers to disclose their positions.
 The rules were needed, he said, ''to ensure that hidden manipulation, illegal naked short selling or illegitimate trading tactics do not drive market behavior and undermine confidence.''
 Details of the possible new disclosure rule were not released, and it is not clear how much authority the S.E.C. has over hedge funds, which have successfully sued to prevent the commission from forcing them to even register with it. Institutional investors, including some hedge funds, provide details of stocks they own every three months but do not disclose short positions. Mr. Cox said he wanted daily disclosure of short positions, which he said would be made public, though he did not say how quickly.
 By late Thursday, the S.E.C. was considering a temporary ban of some or all short selling. Mr. Cox told reporters in Washington late Thursday that he had discussed the ban with other senior administration officials but no decision had been made yet.
 Richard Baker, the president of the Managed Funds Association, a hedge fund trade group, said the funds would comply with any rules but said that disclosure of their trading positions should not be made so quickly that it would harm them in the market.
 Mr. Cox also said the S.E.C. would intensify its investigations of short selling by hedge funds and would demand their records on trading in certain securities.
 In Britain, the Financial Services Authority said that beginning Friday it would bar traders from taking new short positions in listed stocks of financial companies, and that starting next week, investors would have to disclose their short positions if they were at least 0.25 percent of a company's outstanding shares.
 This week, the British bank Lloyds TSB took over HBOS, a mortgage lender, after HBOS's stock tumbled. That fall was widely blamed on short sellers, and Prime Minister Gordon Brown vowed to clean up the financial system.
 To obtain shares to sell short, traders often borrow them from institutional investors, who receive small fees for the loans. But public pension funds in New York and California said Thursday that they would stop lending shares of some financial companies. 
 New York State's comptroller said the state's Common Retirement Fund would temporarily stop lending the shares of 19 banks and brokerage firms to short sellers. ''This speculative selling has put downward pressure on the entire stock market and threatens to drive our national economy deeper into decline,'' Thomas P. DiNapoli, the comptroller, said in a statement. 
 The suspension removes 105 million shares from the fund's securities lending program. It will last until market conditions stabilize, a spokesman said. 
 New York City's comptroller announced the same move, as did officials in California. 
 ''We're pulling them back because of the unfortunate predators that are out there right now, trying to be greedy,'' said Patricia K. Macht, an official of the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

HEADLINE: Crisis Endgame

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On Sunday, Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, tried to draw a line in the sand against further bailouts of failing financial institutions; four days later, faced with a crisis spinning out of control, much of Washington appears to have decided that government isn't the problem, it's the solution. The unthinkable -- a government buyout of much of the private sector's bad debt -- has become the inevitable. 
 The story so far: the real shock after the feds failed to bail out Lehman Brothers wasn't the plunge in the Dow, it was the reaction of the credit markets. Basically, lenders went on strike: U.S. government debt, which is still perceived as the safest of all investments -- if the government goes bust, what is anything else worth? -- was snapped up even though it paid essentially nothing, while would-be private borrowers were frozen out. 
 Thus, banks are normally able to borrow from each other at rates just slightly above the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bills. But Thursday morning, the average interest rate on three-month interbank borrowing was 3.2 percent, while the interest rate on the corresponding Treasuries was 0.05 percent. No, that's not a misprint. 
 This flight to safety has cut off credit to many businesses, including major players in the financial industry -- and that, in turn, is setting us up for more big failures and further panic. It's also depressing business spending, a bad thing as signs gather that the economic slump is deepening. 
 And the Federal Reserve, which normally takes the lead in fighting recessions, can't do much this time because the standard tools of monetary policy have lost their grip. Usually the Fed responds to economic weakness by buying up Treasury bills, in order to drive interest rates down. But the interest rate on Treasuries is already zero, for all practical purposes; what more can the Fed do? 
 Well, it can lend money to the private sector -- and it's been doing that on an awesome scale. But this lending hasn't kept the situation from deteriorating.
 There's only one bright spot in the picture: interest rates on mortgages have come down sharply since the federal government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and guaranteed their debt. And there's a lesson there for those ready to hear it: government takeovers may be the only way to get the financial system working again.
 Some people have been making that argument for some time. Most recently, Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman, and two other veterans of past financial crises published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal declaring that the only way to avoid ''the mother of all credit contractions'' is to create a new government agency to ''buy up the troubled paper'' -- that is, to have taxpayers take over the bad assets created by the bursting of the housing and credit bubbles. Coming from Mr. Volcker, that proposal has serious credibility.
 Influential members of Congress, including Hillary Clinton and Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, have been making similar arguments. And on Thursday, Charles Schumer, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee (and an advocate of creating a new agency to resolve the financial crisis) told reporters that ''the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are realizing that we need a more comprehensive solution.'' Sure enough, Thursday night Ben Bernanke and Mr. Paulson met with Congressional leaders to discuss a ''comprehensive approach'' to the problem. 
 We don't know yet what that ''comprehensive approach'' will look like. There have been hopeful comparisons to the financial rescue the Swedish government carried out in the early 1990s, a rescue that involved a temporary public takeover of a large part of the country's financial system. It's not clear, however, whether policy makers in Washington are prepared to exert a comparable degree of control. And if they aren't, this could turn into the wrong kind of rescue -- a bailout of stockholders as well as the market, in effect rescuing the financial industry from the consequences of its own greed. 
 Furthermore, even a well-designed rescue would cost a lot of money. The Swedish government laid out 4 percent of G.D.P., which in our case would be a cool $600 billion -- although the final burden to Swedish taxpayers was much less, because the government was eventually able to sell off the assets it had acquired, in some cases at a handsome profit.
 But it's no use whining (sorry, Senator Gramm) about the prospect of a financial rescue plan. Today's U.S. political system isn't going to follow Andrew Mellon's infamous advice to Herbert Hoover: ''Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate.'' The big buyout is coming; the only question is whether it will be done right.

 CORRECTION:
A column by Paul Krugman in Friday's paper incorrectly identified Senator Charles Schumer as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Schumer is the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. Senator Max Baucus is the chairman of the Finance Committee.

HEADLINE: For Rivals, Finance Crisis Is Posing on-the-Fly Tests

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JEFF ZELENY; Michael Cooper contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The financial crisis has turned the race between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama into an audition for who could best handle a national economic emergency.
 Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee for president, called on President Bush on Thursday to dismiss the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Christopher Cox, a former Republican congressman and a Bush appointee. 
 Mr. McCain, who early in the week seemed to struggle to find a consistent message on the economy, also proposed a government body to relieve struggling financial institutions of some bad debt in hopes of keeping them solvent. A similar approach was being considered Thursday night by the Bush administration and Congressional leaders. 
 Mr. McCain is expected to lay out a broader view of his approach to the crisis on Friday morning in Wisconsin.
 His Democratic rival for president, Mr. Obama, campaigning in New Mexico, issued the outlines of his own plan later Thursday. His campaign said he would fill in the details after he met Friday with his economic advisers in Miami, his next campaign stop. 
 The actions of both men captured how they were being forced to make policy proposals and pronouncements on the fly, from one campaign rally to another, as each day's developments in the financial markets and in Washington were overtaken by new ones the following day. 
 With Election Day less than seven weeks away, the financial crisis has transformed the race, wiping away almost all other issues. In a purely political sense, the developments are highlighting economic anxiety and putting the spotlight on a topic that Democrats believe will benefit them. 
 As the chances increase that Congress will get involved with a plan to help take distressed assets off the books of troubled firms -- and potentially put taxpayers on the hook -- the politics could become even more intense and complicated, creating further challenges for Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama as they seek to be seen as in command. 
 ''I cannot remember a modern election in which the presidential candidates were faced with commenting on a problem of this magnitude this close to Election Day,'' said Michael Berman, a Democratic Party strategist.
 The candidates' challenge parallels that of the Bush administration and federal regulatory officials who are managing the crisis. From Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. on down, there have been contradictory statements, false starts and emergency actions as the crisis spread from one financial institution to another. 
 But what is worse for Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain is that they are on the sidelines and yet expected to act as if they have the best information available. They are getting updates from economic advisers and supporters on Wall Street and also near-daily briefings from Mr. Paulson and sometimes Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Another complication is that the candidates have to balance the political need to look boldly presidential against the danger of further agitating the markets or stoking Americans' anxiety.
 By most accounts, Mr. Obama has the advantage, because anything that keeps voters focused on the economy is good for Democrats, since a Republican holds the White House. In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, Mr. McCain sought to turn that advantage against his rival, charging that Mr. Obama's ''own advisers are saying that the crisis will benefit him politically.''
 The McCain campaign could not cite an example of an Obama adviser's claiming that.
 Mr. McCain has adopted an increasingly populist tone and blamed Wall Street greed. By Wednesday, on a trip through Michigan, Mr. McCain even suggested that he would favor loans to the auto industry, an idea he had once faulted. At a General Motors plant in Orion, he said, ''We are not going to leave the workers here in Michigan hung out to dry while we give billions in taxpayer dollars to Wall Street.''
 On Tuesday, Mr. McCain said he would oppose a federal bailout of the insurance giant American International Group, only to endorse it as unavoidable the next day when the Federal Reserve took over A.I.G. to prevent its losses from infecting other financial institutions. Also on Tuesday, Mr. McCain proposed a ''9/11-style commission'' to study the problem and recommend solutions for the long term, then switched Thursday to propose the creation of a government agency as soon as possible. 
 Mr. McCain's call for a new trust to relieve troubled financial companies of their bad loans -- much like the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created after the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s -- dramatizes how far he has backtracked from a career as a deregulator who opposed bigger government. He made his proposal hours before the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve disclosed that they were considering a similar approach.
 Among those who have supported the creation of such an entity is Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman. He is among a core group of Obama advisers on the financial crisis that includes Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, the former treasury secretaries, and Laura Tyson, an economic adviser in the administration of President Bill Clinton, all of whom are expected to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday in Miami. Aides to Mr. Obama said that he was open to the concept but that the protection of taxpayers was a critical detail yet to be worked out.
 Mr. Obama calls at each campaign stop for tighter regulation of Wall Street and help for those on Main Street. Although he usually speaks without notes, in recent days he has consistently used a teleprompter, to avoid errors that would undercut his attempts to sound presidential.
 Between campaign appearances this week, he has received updates and briefings several times each day from Mr. Paulson, his economic advisers and Wall Street donors. Mr. Paulson also has briefed Mr. McCain and his chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. 
 In an example of the frenetic efforts by the Obama side to keep up, the candidate late Tuesday asked for a conference call with core advisers. Mr. Volcker answered his cellphone on a Manhattan street corner, Mr. Rubin called in minutes after landing in New York from London, and they joined others to discuss how Mr. Obama should react.

 In Growing Milk Scandal
 Chinese authorities arrested a dozen people, fired a senior government official and acknowledged that a wider range of milk products showed traces of a chemical used to disguise poor quality. Officials said a fourth infant had died from tainted baby formula, while health regulators in neighboring Hong Kong announced a broader recall of mainland Chinese-made milk, yogurt and ice cream contaminated with the chemical melamine.

 ZIMBABWE TALKS STALLED
 Power-sharing talks between President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai deadlocked over Mr. Mugabe's insistence that he retain control of the state's vast security forces, as well as virtually every other crucial ministry, a senior opposition official said. On Monday, Mr. Mugabe agreed to a deal that requires him to give up some of his powers for the first time in 28 years in office. But he has since proved unwilling to let go of any of the levers of state-sponsored authority he has regularly wielded to repress his rivals. PAGE A10

 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that he would urge NATO ministers meeting in London to adopt a cautious and deliberate approach toward Russia that reassures newer members along the Russian border without provoking hostilities.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Is Said to Press for Merger With Wachovia

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley stepped up its merger negotiations with Wachovia on Thursday as it considered ways to shore up its finances amid the market's current turmoil, people involved in the talks said. 
 The advanced talks come as some hedge funds have pulled their business and other clients have reduced their trading with the Morgan, these people said.
 John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, spent the day going from meeting to meeting, working to find a solution, these people said. The discussions came after an early-morning town hall meeting for employees at the Morgan's headquarters in Times Square, where he spoke and took questions. He spent time on the telephone with regulators in Washington, pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury Department to suspend short-selling of stocks in the financial industry. 
 Among the options that Morgan Stanley is considering is a complicated plan to split Wachovia into a ''good bank'' and a ''bad bank'' and then merge with the ''good bank,'' people involved in the talks said. The goal of such a complex transaction would be prevent Wachovia's exposure to subprime loans and other toxic investments from infecting the combined company after a merger, these people said.
 Officers of Morgan Stanley and Wachovia declined to comment on the reports.
 As part of Mr. Mack's talks with Wachovia's chief executive, Robert K. Steel, both of whom are trustees of Duke University, the two companies are also considering bringing in a third-party investor, most likely a sovereign wealth fund, to infuse new capital into the combined firm. Morgan Stanley has been holding talks about such a possibility with the China Investment Corporation, which is run by Xi-Qing Gao, another Duke trustee, these people said.
 Morgan Stanley would still prefer to remain independent, these people said, and is seeking to raise enough capital to calm the anxiety of its investors and clients. Mr. Mack has discussed whether Mr. Gao would be prepared to invest more in Morgan Stanley. It is unclear whether the Chinese fund, which bought a 9.9 percent stake last year and has lost billions of dollars on its investment, will have the appetite to increase its stake. 
 Shares of Morgan Stanley increased 3.7 percent, closing at $22.55, after falling as low as $11.70 before the market reversed course in the afternoon. In after-hours trading, they rose to $24.21. 
 Questions still remain in the marketplace about whether a link between Morgan Stanley and Wachovia would be a good combination. Wachovia has been ravaged by the trouble in the housing market. Its 2006 acquisition of Golden West Financial, a large California mortgage lender that specialized in so-called pay-option mortgages, proved disastrous. The bank also faces mounting losses on loans to builders and commercial real estate developers. And its investment bank was a big player in complex mortgage-related investments and buyout financing to middle-market companies, two areas hit hard by the crisis. 
 Since taking over in July, Mr. Steel has moved quickly to make changes. He embarked on a major cost-cutting plan, ousted the bank's finance and risk chiefs and announced 10,000 layoffs. He has repeatedly vowed to keep Wachovia independent. 
 Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., has long excelled at retail banking but has struggled to build a presence on Wall Street. As First Union, the bank went on a buying spree in the late 1990s just as the economy slumped. When G. Kennedy Thompson took over as chief executive in 2000, he tried to put the company back on track with a more patient and financially disciplined approach. 
 Mr. Thompson orchestrated the big acquisitions -- Wachovia in 2001 and SouthTrust three years later -- that vastly expanded its retail branch operations. But he balked at making big acquisitions like FleetBoston Financial and the stand-alone credit card giant MBNA, allowing them to wind up in the hands of a crosstown rival, Bank of America. Then he doubled down with a big bet on Golden West near the top of the housing market, and then another giant deal with its purchase of the retail brokerage firm, A. G. Edwards, a year later. 
 The company was run more like an oversize regional bank than a global financial powerhouse, and it lacked the risk management systems to keep up with its enlarging empire. Mr. Thompson was ousted in early June as the problems gripping the firm appeared to worsen. 
 A merger bretween Morgan Stanley and Wachovia has been under duscussion before. Amid a power struggle in Morgan's ranks in mid-2005, Wachovia was considered a possible suitor.

 Mr. McCain lied first, in a Spanish-language ad that accused Mr. Obama of helping to kill immigration reform last year, by voting for amendments that supposedly doomed a bipartisan bill. The ad lamented the result: ''No guest worker program. No path to citizenship. No secure borders. No reform. Is that being on our side?''
 That is a jaw-dropping distortion. The bill wasn't killed by any amendments. It was killed by a firestorm of talk-radio rage and a Republican-led filibuster. The very bill that Mr. McCain now mourns is the one he sidled away from as his own party weakened and killed it. It's the one he says he would now vote against.
 For Mr. McCain to suggest that Mr. Obama opposes the ''path to citizenship'' and ''guest worker program'' compounds his dishonesty. Mr. Obama supports the three pillars of comprehensive reform -- tougher enforcement, expanded legal immigration and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already here.
 Mr. McCain was an architect of just such a comprehensive bill. But he is also leading a party whose members rabidly oppose the path to citizenship. So, in deference to them, Mr. McCain now emphasizes border security as the utmost priority. Except when he's pandering in Spanish. 
 Mr. Obama's retaliatory ad, also in Spanish, was just as fraudulent. It slimed Mr. McCain as a friend and full-bore ally of restrictionists like Rush Limbaugh, even though Mr. Limbaugh has long attacked Mr. McCain's immigration moderation. It quotes Mr. Limbaugh as calling all Mexicans stupid and ordering them to ''shut your mouth or get out,'' which he never did. 
 Immigration was broken before the candidates started this repugnant ad war, and looks as if it will stay that way for at least the duration of this campaign. 
 Meanwhile, the Bush administration keeps raiding factories and farms, terrorizing immigrant families while exposing horrific accounts of workplace abuses. Children toil in slaughterhouses; detainees languish in federal lockups, dying without decent medical care. Day laborers are harassed and robbed of wages. An ineffective border fence is behind schedule and millions over budget. Local enforcers drag citizens and legal residents into their nets, to the cheers of the Minutemen. 
 Both candidates once espoused smart, thoughtful positions for fixing the problem. But Mr. McCain is shuffling in step with his restrictionist party. Mr. Obama gave immigration one brief mention at the Democratic convention, in a litany of big-trouble issues, like abortion, guns and same-sex marriage, on which he seemed to say that the best Americans could hope for are small compromises and to agree to disagree.
 They're both wrong. The country needs to hear better answers, stated clearly and forthrightly over the shouting. The answer to immigration is what it was last year: comprehensive reform that extends order and the rule of law to a system that is broken in a million complex ways. Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama both know this. They should get back to telling the truth about it, in English and in Spanish.

HEADLINE: The New McCain: More Aggressive and Scripted on the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: VIENNA, Ohio 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain's campaign events were once free-wheeling journeys marked by flashes of humor, candor and arch observations from the candidate about presidential politics -- and John McCain. Oh, and moments that left no doubt that Mr. McCain was not working from any script. 
 ''Thanks for the question, you little jerk,'' Mr. McCain said last year to a New Hampshire high school student who inquired about his age, raising his eyebrows as he chortled at his own joke. ''You're drafted.''
 Not these days. As Mr. McCain worked his way through Florida and Ohio this week as the Republican presidential nominee, he was a candidate transformed. He unsmilingly raced through a series of relatively brief speeches, reading often from a teleprompter, and served up a diet of the kind of sound-bite attacks that he used to dismiss with an eye roll.
 ''Just a little while ago, he flew off to Hollywood for a fund-raiser for Barbra Streisand and his celebrity friends,'' Mr. McCain said of his Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama, his voice sounding strained at the end of the day but still dripping with scorn. ''Let me tell you, my friends: There's no place I would rather be than here with the working men and women of Ohio.'' 
 Mr. McCain's once easygoing if irreverent campaign presence -- endearing to crowds, though often the kind of undisciplined excursions that landed him in the gaffe doghouse -- has been put out to pasture. He takes far fewer chances, meaning there are fewer risque jokes, zingers at a familiar face in the crowd, provocative observations on policy or politics, or exercises in self-derogatory humor. By every appearance, this Mr. McCain is, or at least is struggling to be, disciplined and on message in a way befitting of American politics today, if not quite befitting of the McCain of yesterday.
 There may be a price for all this. After his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, riveted the overflow crowd for 16 minutes on Tuesday at an airplane hangar here, it was Mr. McCain's turn, and people in his audience began murmuring and drifting away midway through a 14-minute speech that was flat and cheerless. When Mr. McCain made his first appearance without Ms. Palin, on Monday morning in Jacksonville, Fla., he faced an arena that was one-quarter full.
 Still, it is the course Mr. McCain has chosen and one his aides say he will stay on.
 To a certain extent, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, is grappling with the fact that he is now a general election candidate in an environment where, more than ever, the other side (or reporters who are following him) is ready to seize on any slip-up, real or imagined. This is no time for the idle remark, bout of frankness or edgy humor that once stood Mr. McCain apart on the candidate field. 
 And what voters are seeing in these final weeks of the campaign is a deliberately retooled version of Mr. McCain -- what he says, how he says it and how he goes about the day-to-day steps of campaigning. It came about as part of a fundamental reordering of his campaign that resulted from the ascension of the hard-driving, disciplined Steve Schmidt, a senior campaign adviser and veteran of President Bush's 2004 campaign, who popped up on Mr. McCain's plane one day this week.
 Mr. McCain is by all appearances struggling to stick to his script and avoiding, whenever possible, events that his campaign cannot control. 
 There are now not one but two drawn curtains on Mr. McCain's plane separating his spacious quarters from the press corps. Left idle is the couch that was built in the front of the plane -- called ''Straight Talk Air'' -- to reproduce at 30,000 feet the freewheeling chats with reporters that were the stock-in-trade on his bus; the other morning it was covered with newspapers. Mr. McCain, who promised to hold weekly news conferences if elected president, has not held one in more than a month.
 He recently began doing town-hall-style meetings with voters, including one with Ms. Palin on Wednesday night in Grand Rapids, Mich. But these are mostly by invitation only -- reminiscent of Mr. Bush's town-hall-style meetings of 2004 -- as was made obvious by the succession of softball and adulatory questions floated across his plate. 
 For anyone who has covered Mr. McCain over the last decade, this new version of the candidate can be a striking sight. There the senator was the other day leading a crowd in a chant of ''drill, baby, drill,'' the words that now invariably arise from his crowds when he talks about his support for offshore drilling, a position he once rejected. 
 There are the attacks against Wall Street -- the denunciation of cheats and greed and self-dealing -- which recall the decidedly populist cant of Al Gore when he was the Democratic nominee for president in 2000. Mr. McCain attacked Mr. Obama, of Illinois, for holding a celebrity-strewn, big-dollar fund-raiser in Hollywood despite the fact that he had just held his own celebrity-strewn, big-dollar fund-raiser in Hollywood.
 There are the indignant attacks on corruption and self-dealing in Congress, the institution in which he has served for 25 years. ''The word is going out, my friends -- to the old-boy network, the pork-barrelers, the earmarkers -- that change is coming,'' Mr. McCain said at stop after stop. ''Change is coming! Two mavericks are coming to Washington, and we're going to shake things up!'' 
 And most notable are the dizzying cascade of attacks on Mr. Obama, who seems to have come to consume Mr. McCain as the weather turns cool, a reminder that this long election cycle is approaching its end. 
 ''Let's have some straight talk,'' he said. ''Senator Obama is not interested in the politics of hope. He's interested in his political future. That's why he is hurtling insults and making up facts.''
 For years, Mr. McCain has struck a different kind of cloth as a presidential candidate: as a politician capable of defying his party or embracing it; holding a world view that defied any easy ideological setting; having an ironic detachment as he observed himself on the campaign trail, combined with a sly sense of humor that leavened his occasional bursts of temper. 
 These days, Mr. McCain sounds less like his old self than Bob Dole, another Republican senator who ran for president in 1996, sounded in the closing days of his campaign -- speaking louder or repeating statements that he thinks might be overlooked. ''The American economy is in a crisis!'' Mr. McCain said. ''It's in a crisis!''
 Mr. McCain's aides suggested that their candidate would spend as much time as possible campaigning with Ms. Palin in the final weeks of the race, pointing to her proven ability not only to draw a crowd but also to animate the ticket in a way that Mr. McCain cannot. And she has shown no hesitancy about carrying a traditional burden of vice-presidential candidates by attacking Mr. Obama. 
 But these days, this Mr. McCain seems content carrying that burden himself.

HEADLINE: For City's Burritovilles, Adios or Hasta la Vista?

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY; Karen Drake and Rebecca White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Burritoville, a restaurant chain beloved by hungry folks on a budget and disdained by people preferring more authentic Mexican food, seems to have gone the way of free-market capitalism, with all of its Manhattan restaurants suddenly closed.
 It is a dark time indeed for some fans of Holy Mole Burritos and Bob Marley's Last Burritos. Kenny Wharton, 36, who works in drafting, was walking by the shuttered Burritoville on Second Avenue and Ninth Street on Thursday. He used to eat there, and at another outlet on Third Avenue, when he lived in the East Village. 
 ''Where am I going to get my lunch now?'' Mr. Wharton said. 
 Eli Penchasov, 25, the owner of Exquisite Creation Diamond and Jewelry, next door to the Burritoville at 36 Water Street, was surprised that it had closed after renovations three weeks ago. 
 ''No signs, no nothing,'' he said. ''A couple of days ago the workers, the chefs and delivery boys showed up around 10 in the morning and were waiting on the stoop out front. Eventually they went home because no one showed up to open the store.''
 Burritoville's Web site has closed, its various phones are either constantly busy or unanswered, and the company president, Jonathan Bernstein, could not be reached for comment. A woman who returned a message on the company's behalf, identifying herself only as a member of Burritoville's ''executive management,'' said the chain would reopen several stores in the next two weeks.
 Burritoville was founded in 1992 by David LaPointe and Steve Lynn, with the first store opening at 78th Street and First Avenue. 
 ''People from New York said, 'What's a burrito?' '' Mr. LaPointe recalled in a 1999 interview, ''but people who knew about fresh Mexican food from California simply said, 'Thank you for being here.' ''
 In 2003, TruFoods Corp. bought a dozen of the New York stores, with plans to franchise the business. An executive for TruFoods, who declined to give his name because the company is no longer associated with Burritoville, said that Mr. Bernstein left in June and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. But an online search of court records in New York did not turn up any filings under Mr. Bernstein's name or that of Burritoville or Burritoville Services, an associated company. 
 (The executive management spokeswoman would not answer any questions about bankruptcy.)
 Jennifer Parkhurst, 38, who sells books online, said on Thursday that she had no idea the Water Street location she frequented was closing. 
 ''I was even thinking about going there tonight, because we're having guests,'' she said. ''The people were really nice. How sad. They were always good and had absolutely to-die-for soup.'' 
 Online Zagat commenters hailed Burritoville's ''fantastic late night food'' and called it ''a perennial favorite for burritos and beer, before a night of video games on your best friend's couch.'' A citysearch.com reviewer wrote, ''Burritoville is not authentic Mexican food, but when you're poor and too lazy to walk to the place -- who cares? The delivery is super fast and the food portions are big enough to stock up on for the next wave of the Depression!''
 Other critics were not as kind. In a 1999 article about the ''burrito boom'' in New York, The New York Times observed, ''The ingredients were fresh but had no soul.'' A commenter on the Gothamist blog recently called the food a ''Moosewood hippie atrocity,'' adding, ''It is to Mexican food what Velveeta and ketchup on Wonder Bread is to Italian.'' 
 Without further insights from the company, it is hard to know what did the chain in.
 Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic Inc., a food research and consulting firm based in Chicago, said that only the fittest restaurants survived nowadays. 
 ''Restaurant chains are suffering from what's going on in the economy, with the stock market, the real estate market and increased competition, especially in the Mexican sector,'' he said. ''Firms like Chipotle are succeeding.'' He recalled that New York Burrito Gourmet Wraps in the city folded two years ago.
 But Robert Angelone, chairman and chief economist at the Epicurus Group, consultants based in Wall Township, N.J., said a credit shortage was causing many restaurant closings. 
 ''Usually small businesses, and medium-size businesses as well, have to borrow to get through the tough times,'' he said. ''If there's no liquidity in the market, banks don't have the cash to lend.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Saturday about the sudden and mysterious shuttering of all Manhattan branches of Burritoville, a Mexican fast-food restaurant, misstated the given name of the company's president. He is Jeffrey Bernstein, not Jonathan. And a reporting credit with the article misstated the surname of a contributor. She is Karen Zraick, not Drake.

HEADLINE: Shaky Economy Dims Russian Prospects

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Michael Schwirtz and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
This week, Moscow looked every inch the glittering financial capital it aspires to be. 
 Luxury cars were jammed up for blocks outside a lavish art opening at the Red October chocolate factory, where long-legged models congregated around works by Andy Warhol and Picasso. President Dmitri A. Medvedev, flanked by the country's commercial titans, talked of his longtime dream of building a trade and commerce hub that would challenge New York and London.
 But that prospect has begun to look less certain. The stock market plunged so precipitously earlier this week that the government halted trading for two days. Stocks roared back with a 28 percent gain on Friday. But the market is still down by nearly half since May. 
 The price of oil, the mainstay of Russia's commodity-driven economy, has dropped sharply. And as Washington and Moscow exchanged icy words over Russia's military action in neighboring Georgia, the Russian Parliament was reviewing a bill that would increase defense spending by a hefty 25 percent. 
 The Russia that has regained such confidence under Vladimir V. Putin -- a success anchored in stable politics, predictable economic growth and firm state control over natural resources industries -- now looks distinctly volatile. The crisis was worrying enough to the billionaire developer Sergei Polonsky that on Wednesday he announced a freeze on all new projects. 
 ''Probably a period of struggle for existence and survival is coming,'' said Dmitri Lutsenko, a member of the board of directors for Mr. Polonsky's Mirax Group, which is building Europe's tallest skyscraper beside the Moscow River. ''The strong businesses will become stronger, and the weak ones will be wiped out of the market,'' he said. 
 In the Friday edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda, a cheeky city tabloid, there was only one headline on the front page: ''How to Make It Through the Financial Crisis Without Losses.'' It was illustrated with the face of a yuppie, his hands clasped over his mouth in horror.
 Many countries were jolted by the markets this week. And the recovery on Friday of the Moscow stock markets -- so swift that the government was forced to close the markets twice during the day because the growth ''exceeded technical limits'' -- suggests that government emergency measures had helped to restore investor confidence.
 Mr. Medvedev came into power this spring in a country with enormous cash reserves. His agenda was a modernizing one: institutional reform would allow small businesses, and the middle class, to grow; the economy would be weaned from excessive dependence on oil profits; government initiatives would build domestic industry and the high-tech sector. 
 Now, more urgent tasks stand before him. Russia's military, which was left to deteriorate in the 1990s, must be updated. The government said it would devote $44 billion to shoring up banks and markets in the near future to prevent the kind of meltdown that paralyzed the country in 1998. On Friday the president made the defiant statement about Russia's sticking to its modernizing course, but acknowledged that recent events made that more difficult.
 ''We are in fact being pushed onto the development track which is not based on sound, normal and civilized cooperation with other countries, but rests on autonomous development behind thick walls and an 'iron curtain,' '' Mr. Medvedev said, referring to the recent tensions with the West over the war in Georgia.
 ''I would like to stress once again: This is not our track,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency. ''There is no use in returning back to the past. We have made our choice.'' 
 Russia must pursue ''economic development, the expansion of business, creative and personal freedom,'' he added, without ''any reference to whether the country is in a particular situation surrounded by enemies.''
 Meanwhile, a city brimming with new wealth went about its daily rhythms. On Friday, bankers and traders filtered into their offices. Lexuses and BMWs lined up in front of Romanov Dvor, an elegant pre-Revolutionary building whose interior is sleekly modern, fitted with smoky glass walls and a cascade of purple orchids suspended in midair. 
 As the finance workers slipped outside for smoking break, they traded gossip from a nervous financial sector. Most said they felt confident that the government would manage the crisis, but there were hints of fallout: investment bankers mourning their lost bonuses, a client canceling a trip abroad to stay home and monitor his stock price. 
 Many bankers have spent recent days on the phone trying to soothe rattled investors, said Pavel Prosyankin, who works in the financial sector.
 ''They were worried, because our clients were worried,'' Mr. Prosyankin said. At 36, he is old enough to remember the crisis of 1998, when a drop in the price of oil devastated every corner of the Russian economy. 
 The fundamentals of the economy, he said, are much stronger than they were in 1998. But ''in terms of investor behavior, it's very much the same,'' he said. ''The way people become irrational is very much the same.''

HEADLINE: City Issues Controversial New Rules Regulating Cranes at Construction Sites

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
The Buildings Department notified concrete contractors at high-rise buildings this week of what its top crane regulator called ''new requirements'' for erecting, dismantling and raising tower cranes -- rules that construction industry officials called onerous ones that would hamper building activity in New York.
 The industry officials said that the requirements, the latest in a series designed to improve crane safety after a rash of accidents, would put as many as 2,400 union laborers at least temporarily out of work and complained that the agency designed them without any consultation with builders. 
 In fact, there was little about the proposals that the city and the industry appeared to agree about. Construction- and concrete-industry officials said that they viewed the regulations as a sudden shift in policy. A Buildings Department spokesman, Tony Sclafani, said the regulations were not new, though that was what the city's chief crane regulator called them in an e-mail message to industry engineers this week.
 And Robert LiMandri, the commissioner-designate of the Buildings Department, called the rules ''critical safety requirements'' and said in a statement that industry officials had been consulted before the rules' formulation, although he did not provide any names.
 The regulations, which went into effect immediately, are one of several steps that the Bloomberg administration has undertaken to address issues about crane safety that have arisen since nine people were killed in two accidents earlier this year involving the giant machines.
 The accidents and their aftermath have also brought heightened scrutiny of the Department of Buildings' oversight of crane operations, which, an investigation revealed, was torn by corruption and hobbled by a lack of experienced inspectors.
 The dispute between the industry officials and the Buildings Department represents the first open rift since the accidents. Several leading construction industry groups have worked closely with the Buildings Department and the mayor's office since then, playing an active role in reviewing proposed policy changes and legislation.
 Indeed, the heads of several industry groups have appeared frequently with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and department officials to announce new measures.
 ''No one knew this was coming -- this came like a shot in the dark,'' said Louis J. Coletti, the head of the Building Trades Employers Association, who has been involved in the process. ''What this means is people are going to be laid off and jobs are going to be delayed.'' 
 Construction officials say that one of the most significant changes is a requirement that engineers or crane manufacturers provide detailed rigging plans for raising a crane, and certify the actual work, which is now done by licensed master riggers under a plan approved by a professional engineer.
 The rigging plan would include a detailed outline of how sections of a crane are raised at a construction site as work proceeds higher and higher.
 Since tower cranes are set up in different ways at different construction sites, said Joseph S. Kaming, an engineer and the counsel for the Cement League, which represents unionized concrete workers and contractors, a crane manufacturer's rigging plan would not be specific to each situation. 
 Engineers would be reluctant to certify the rigging work, Mr. Kaming said, because they would then be liable for any problems that arose, although they would have no control over how the rigging crew at the scene operated. 
 The changes in the requirements were contained in an e-mail message sent on Wednesday from the head of the Department of Buildings' Cranes and Derricks Division, Jason Ocharsky, to principals of the area's two largest engineering firms that specialize in crane-related work.
 After explaining the requirements, Mr. Ocharsky acknowledged that the changes were instituted on short notice, but offered no explanation for the sudden action.
 Mr. LiMandri, in a statement released in response to questions about the provisions, said: ''Other sectors of the industry have had no difficulty submitting rigging and jumping plans, which are designed to increase safety for construction workers and all New Yorkers. Safety must be everyone's top priority.''
 Alfred G. Gerosa, the Cement League's executive director, said in a letter he sent to Mr. Ocharsky on Wednesday: ''The effect of your new provisions, not discussed with the industry and whatever their legality, is to shut down the entire tower-crane industry in the city, throwing thousands of construction workers out of work. The compliance with these provisions is impossible.''
 He said in an interview that his group had not been consulted. And Mr. Kaming maintained, as did Mr. Coletti, that the ''new'' requirements went beyond crane legislation that the mayor is expected to sign on Monday. It makes into law the new protocols regarding cranes that the Building Department had issued after the accidents.
 Both men acknowledged that the new law provided a framework that could be made to include the requirements, but said the specific provisions being outlined now had not been included or discussed.
 Mr. Coletti said that his group recognized that there was a need for change in crane operations and has ''been working in partnership to make changes, at the same time trying to ensure both worker safety is met and our jobs proceed in an economic and timely fashion.''
 He said that the construction industry is the second-largest contributor to the city's tax base and that, given financial conditions on Wall Street, this was an inopportune time to put construction projects at risk.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Financial Crisis in America and Europe Is Causing Just a Ripple

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Wall Street may be suffering the worst financial storm since the Great Depression, but Japan has felt like an island of Zen-like calm.
 The world's second-largest economy has often seemed to be marching to its own drummer, sometimes to Japan's own disadvantage. But rarely has the disconnect been as stark as during the current financial crisis. 
 While European and American financial titans have teetered and collapsed, Japan's giant banking groups have stood relatively unscathed. The growing global credit crisis, which threatens companies and consumers elsewhere, has yet to appear here, where the problem for years has been that the nation's banks have too much cash, not too little. And while the United States Federal Reserve seems to be shoring up the entire American financial sector, the last time this central bank intervened in markets, it did so in dollars instead of yen -- to help international markets. 
 Indeed, television news gives the current upheaval, known here as ''Lehman Shock,'' less coverage than more domestic issues like an approaching typhoon and a scandal over tainted rice. Even in the race for prime minister, the financial crisis has emerged as just one of a dozen issues and usually not the top one. 
 To be sure, Japan has been affected by the global economic downturn, with its economy threatened by recession. And its stock market gyrated and declined this week. But in an era dominated by globalization, where seemingly unrelated events can affect the lives of people half a world away, Tokyo has so far floated above the anguish gripping New York and London.
 ''The financial crisis looks like fire on a distant shore,'' said Atsushi Nakajima, chief economist at the research arm of Mizuho Financial Group. ''Japan has remained very calm and peaceful.''
 Part of the reason is that Japan has already suffered its agonizing crisis. The 1980s bubble economy collapsed in the 1990s because banks were burdened with real estate-related bad loans, not unlike those that Washington is moving to have the American government take over from banks. 
 In Japan, it took a ''lost decade'' to work through those debts. The Japanese became very cautious after the bitter experience of the cleanup. One result was that they seem to have largely avoided the risky subprime loans that set off the current crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund, subprime-related losses at Japanese financial companies have totaled just $8 billion, out of global subprime-related losses that some say could total $1 trillion.
 ''Japan learned its lesson in the 1990s,'' said Akio Makabe, an economics professor at Shinshu University. ''It was wise when Wall Street was foolish.''
 Of course, Wall Street's pains have been felt here. The stock market fell this week in volatile trading, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index losing 2.4 percent -- largely as panicked foreign investors dumped shares. There are also bigger fears that slowdowns in the United States and China will end up hammering Japan's export-driven manufacturing sector.
 There have also been small but telltale signs of rising risk aversion in credit markets. Japanese banks raised short-term interbank lending rates to foreign banks to 0.7 percent, from 0.5 percent, though they still use the lower rate among themselves. That contrasts with New York, where a benchmark interbank lending rate has tripled in recent days to about 3 percent.
 Still, its relative detachment makes Japan an oddity in a world where globalization has seemed inevitable. Countries in Europe have also tried to find ways to be part of the global economy while staying apart from it, but to no avail. Other nations, like China, have bet their future on becoming enmeshed in it.
 Japan's aloofness has its downside. For example, with its healthy banking system and abundance of capital, Japan would seem in an ideal position to help bail out the shell-shocked global economy, stepping in for the weakened United States and Europe. Instead, Tokyo has kept a low profile throughout the crisis, other than joining a multinational effort by central banks to pump dollars into the global economy to keep it moving. 
 When asked during a prime minister candidate debate on Friday whether Japan could assert more leadership during the crisis, the leading candidate, Taro Aso, a former foreign minister, said he was ''proud that Japan was not involved in that money game,'' referring to mortgage debt.
 Economists and bankers say Japan is able to keep itself apart for a very simple reason: it has enough cash to finance its own needs. 
 The country sits on a $14 trillion pile of household savings, the product of decades of trade surpluses and frugal lifestyles. This has allowed Japan to finance its immense $8.1 trillion fiscal deficit and still have enough money left over to be the world's largest creditor nation for the last 17 years. 
 Last year, the nation's net overseas assets -- the sum of all Japanese investments abroad, minus what foreigners hold in Japan -- reached a record 250 trillion yen, or $2.4 trillion. 
 That means that Japan's domestic economy has been largely insulated from global credit market turmoil because it does not borrow from those markets. At the same time, with so much money flowing out -- usually into safer investments like Treasuries -- stability in the United States clearly matters. 
 Still, Japan's corporate coffers are filled with cash from the nation's long economic recovery in the 2000s after the stagnant 1990s.
 ''Japan is clearly in a different place'' from the rest of the world, said John Richards, head of Asia research at the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''It doesn't need money.''
 This blessing has also been a curse to investors, say economists. Its wealth shields Japan from pressures to meet global standards of growth or corporate profitability. This is what allowed the nation to accept near zero growth rates in the 1990s and what permits the survival of Japanese corporate practices like valuing employees and clients over shareholders.

HEADLINE: Hard Truths About the Bailout

DATELINE: The fifth major federal bailout this year 

 BODY:
-- after Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the American International Group -- is now in the works. Taxpayers have every right to be alarmed and angry. The latest plan is not necessarily a bad one, and officials had to move quickly to prevent credit markets from seizing up.
 But make no mistake, this crisis could have been avoided if regulators had enforced rules and officials had dared to question risky lending and other dubious practices. 
 If done right, this bailout could succeed where the others have failed and remove the threat of a systemwide financial collapse. But the upfront cost will be enormous. So will the risk of losses in the long run -- on top of the risks already incurred. 
 The new plan would commit taxpayer money to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of troubled loans and other mortgage-related securities from banks and Wall Street firms. It is based on the reasonable premise that as long as institutions are stuck with those assets, the flow of credit, the economy's lifeblood, will be constrained, or as in the past week, all but frozen. 
 Congress, with one eye on this week's volatile Dow and the other on November's election, could authorize the plan as early as next week. 
 It is painfully clear that the financial system will not rebound on its own from the excessive lending and borrowing of the Bush years and the credit collapse in their wake. The one-bailout-at-a-time approach hasn't worked. And modest steps are no longer an option. 
 Lawmakers and administration officials must be prepared to tell Americans the full, hard truths about this plan: 
 What is this going to cost the taxpayers and who decides? It's generally believed that many of the troubled assets that the government would buy will, in time, be worth more than they can fetch in today's chaotic markets. That's far from a sure thing. The assets are tied to housing, so their value will depend on how far prices fall, how many people end up defaulting and how long it takes before housing rebounds -- all big unknowns. 
 For those reasons, it's important for Americans to know who is going to decide what is the right purchase price for these assets. Wall Street will have a role, of course, but outside experts should be allowed to analyze the results. Americans also need to know how the process will be monitored to ensure that taxpayers' interests are protected. If the government gets the price right, the upfront outlay could be recouped when it later sells. If it overpays, the taxpayer is stuck with the loss. 
 How will Congress balance the bailout of Wall Street and the needs on Main Street? If financial markets stabilize, all Americans will benefit. But Congress must do more to provide direct help to struggling American families. Lawmakers should use the bailout legislation to also extend unemployment benefits, bolster food stamps and provide aid to state and local governments to provide health care and other services that are especially important during tough times. 
 The administration and lawmakers also need to tell Americans that the era of cheap and easy money is over and that there are more tough times to come. Whose taxes will have to go up? How will the government help to create the jobs of the future? How will the most vulnerable Americans be protected? And they need to explain that the cost of the bailouts will compete with other spending.
 Finally, Americans need to be told a more fundamental truth: This crisis is the result of a willful and systematic failure by the government to regulate and monitor the activities of bankers, lenders, hedge funds, insurers and other market players. All were playing high-stakes poker with the financial system, but without adequate transparency, oversight or supervision. 
 The regulatory failure, in turn, was grounded in the Bush administration's magical belief that the market, with its invisible hand, works best when it is left alone to self regulate and self correct. The country is now paying the price for that delusion. 
 If lawmakers and administration officials really want to restore confidence, the bailout must be only a first step. The hard work of establishing and enforcing the regulations that are needed for a truly trustworthy financial system, still lies ahead.

HEADLINE: American Stocks Not So Bad, After All

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF you put all your money into American stocks this year, congratulations. You may have lost money, but you have also done better than investors in almost any other stock market around the world. 
 This was the year of the bear, at least until Friday's worldwide recovery. But the bear was tamer in the United States than in almost any other country.
 The accompanying chart shows the performance this year of the Standard & Poor's Global Broad Stock Market indexes. Those indexes, which include nearly every stock traded in 52 markets around the world, showed losses in 51 of the countries through Thursday. Complete Friday results were not available at press time.
 The best performer was Jordan, which was up less than 1 percent. Morocco was second, with a loss of just 2.8 percent.
 In third place, outperforming every major stock market in the world, was the United States. The decline of 16.4 percent from the end of 2007 was improved greatly by the rally on Thursday, which came after prices had plunged the previous day. But the United States was near the top even before that recovery in prices.
 The big losers include some of the developing markets that until late last year had seemed invincible, and had drawn in buyers from around the world. Share prices in Russia, which had soared along with oil prices, came crashing down, though they shot up on Friday. 
 Russia and the United States came to similar conclusions on what to do about the problem of falling prices. Russia announced plans for its government to support the stock market. The United States indicated it would find a way for the government to take over the bad loans that were causing banks to fail and driving down share prices.
 China and India were also among the big losers, after rising rapidly for years. Those two countries have been vying for leadership as the most attractive large emerging market. But this year each has lost nearly half of its stock market value. India fell earlier, but China has declined more in recent months.
 In the current quarter, the worries expressed on Wall Street and in Washington have been so great that it is hard to believe the United States, with a decline of just over 5 percent, had done better than every other market, even before Friday.
 The worldwide declines may show that financial markets are interconnected in ways that had never been thought likely before. As the financial crisis grew, firms with illiquid mortgage securities have raised cash where they could, and that included selling stocks around the world.
 In addition, it is not clear that the world's economies have ''decoupled'' from the United States and will continue to grow even if there is a American recession. It appears that recessions may be under way in Europe and Japan, and markets there have suffered. The emerging markets that prospered from exports may face problems if demand falls in most of the major countries that are their customers.

HEADLINE: Looking for Lessons From Agency That Mopped Up 1980s Thrift Mess

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Does the Resolution Trust Corporation -- the government entity formed in 1989 to dispose of hundreds of failed savings banks and hundreds of billions of dollars in their bad loans and other assets -- offer a model for dealing with today's financial crisis?
 Although some lawmakers and former officials are tempted by the idea, other experts say the analogy is faulty and the current situation is vastly larger and more complex than the comparatively contained savings and loan mess of two decades ago. 
 For the moment, creation of an R.T.C.-style agency is not on the table. The Bush administration's proposed fix does not envision the creation of a quasi-governmental body like the R.T.C. to put a value on and try to market hundreds of billions of dollars in securities held by banks, trading houses and insurance companies that are at the core of today's financial freeze-up.
 The biggest difference between the mid-1980s crisis and now, and where the R.T.C. model falls notably short, is that the government, which insured the deposits of the failing savings institutions, ultimately became the owner by default of the savings and loans, with all of their bad paper, foreclosed real estate and other assets, some above-par and readily marketable. 
 In the current crisis, the government is trying to keep private institutions like the American International Group and many commercial banks and investment houses operating while relieving them only of tens of billions of dollars in paper nobody else wants.
 The White House, Treasury Department and Federal Reserve are asking Congress to permit existing government entities to become a securities buyer of last resort. It is a more open-ended commitment, in part because the problem crosses international borders and its scope is as yet unknown.
 It is also likely to be vastly more expensive. In its six-year existence, the R.T.C. handled 747 failed savings banks and disposed of more than $450 billion in assets. The cost to taxpayers, originally estimated at as much as $500 billion, ultimately totaled $120 billion to $140 billion.
 Keith Hennessey, director of the National Economic Council, spelled out why the parallel falls apart in a White House briefing on Friday.
 ''The R.T.C. term has been used quite frequently in the discussion around this question,'' Mr. Hennessey said. ''Remember that R.T.C. was an organization that was buying assets or taking assets and disposing of them from institutions after they had failed.''
 ''What we're talking about here,'' he continued, ''is institutions which are still operating and going in and providing liquidity to their bad assets on their balance sheet. So it's a different model, which is you're trying to ensure that the firms that make up our financial sector right now can continue to move forward.''
 Still, there are voices calling for creation of a mechanism like the R.T.C. to clear the financial sludge off Wall Street and dispose of it in a safe and orderly way. Among them are Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman; Nicholas F. Brady, the former Treasury secretary; and Eugene A. Ludwig, the former comptroller of the currency, who argued for such a step this week in an essay in The Wall Street Journal.
 Mr. Ludwig, who served on the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, where he oversaw the operation of the R.T.C., said government needed to step in quickly to restore confidence in the markets.
 ''There has to be something big and bold and government-directed to enter this marketplace as a buyer in order to get it lubricated and liquefied so it can operate on its own,'' Mr. Ludwig said. He said the Resolution Trust dispensed ''rough justice'' but was a useful model for the actions government needed to take today.
 ''These kinds of government efforts are not perfect, but the tradeoff is clear: efforts such as the R.T.C. have benefited the nation to a greater degree than the direct costs involved,'' he said.
 Mr. Ludwig cited the example of an earlier government agency, the Depression-era Home Owners Loan Corporation, which provided liquidity to mortgage markets when the banks had no money to lend and which was a predecessor of Fannie Mae, the mortgage guarantor, which was seized by the government two weeks ago.
 Another New Deal agency, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, provided $50 billion in federal financing to ailing sectors of the economy when commercial lending was unavailable. It was disbanded in the mid-1950s.
 Allan H. Meltzer, a historian of the Federal Reserve, said the only historical parallel close to the government's rescue plan was the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. That institution worked, he said, because its leader, Jesse Jones, ran it with autonomy and ''brooked no nonsense.'' Mr. Meltzer said he doubted Congress would accept that in this case. ''With today's Congress, that is an open invitation to corruption,'' he said.
 The Treasury Department announced Friday that it was using another Depression-era agency, the Exchange Stabilization Fund, to provide guarantees for money market funds.
 Congress created the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1989, years after the damage from the savings and loan debacle became apparent and after several false starts. The government created the Federal Asset Disposition Agency in 1985, but it collapsed because of underfunding and poor management. The federal savings and loan insurance fund then entered into a number of transactions to dispose of failing thrifts, but those efforts, too, fell far short.
 The passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recover and Enforcement Act at the beginning of the administration of President George H. W. Bush created the R.T.C. as an agency with a limited mandate and a deadline to finish its work. It was given $50 billion, but that amount more than doubled by the time the office went out of business in 1995, a year ahead of schedule.
 As the receiver of hundreds of failed savings banks, the R.T.C. acquired good assets along with bad, and in some cases got better returns on its holdings than anticipated. The agency auctioned off hotels, waterfront property and luxury cars, tangible assets that were relatively easy to price, unlike the complex securities and derivatives now at issue.
 The seeds of the current crisis were born in the R.T.C.'s asset sales. One of its innovations was securitization of nonperforming loans, the forebears of the mortgage-backed securities that are causing such pain today. The agency also was criticized because it contracted out much of its sales work, employing people from the savings and loans who walked away with rich profits.
 Although it may not prove a usable model for today's financial crisis, the R.T.C. is considered largely a success at the limited mission it was assigned.
 ''It was quite a remarkable agency,'' said Mark K. Cassell, a political scientist at Kent State University who has written a book about the R.T.C. ''It is one of the few federal agencies that worked its way out of a job, finished its work and closed up shop.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Temporarily Blocks Short Sales of Financial Stocks

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Jonathan D. Glater and Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a temporary ban on short sales of 799 financial stocks on Friday, a move against traders who have sought to profit from the financial crisis by betting against bank shares.
 The temporary ban, intended to bring calm to the markets, follows similar action by Britain on Thursday. 
 The S.E.C. said the ''temporary emergency action'' would ''protect the integrity and quality of the securities market and strengthen investor confidence.'' 
 The commission said it was also considering measures to address short selling in other publicly traded companies. 
 ''The commission is committed to using every weapon in its arsenal to combat market manipulation that threatens investors and capital markets,'' the S.E.C.'s chairman, Christopher Cox, said in a statement announcing the measures on the commission's Web site. 
 ''The emergency order temporarily banning short selling of financial stocks will restore equilibrium to markets.''
 Analysts raised questions about whether financial institutions would be able to put the new requirements in place quickly. Emily Steed of the consulting group Daylight Forensic and Advisory, and a former senior enforcement counsel at the S.E.C., said institutions would have to develop sophisticated internal controls and that this would be costly and take time.
 ''It's one thing to present the rule,'' she said.''It's another thing whether it's practical for firms to implement it.''
 Short selling -- a bet that a stock price will decline -- is the practice of selling stock without owning it, hoping to buy it later at a lower price and thus make a profit. 
 It has often been blamed for forcing prices down in times of market stress, but the level of anger has intensified as the American government has been forced to bail out major financial institutions and the leaders of some investment banks have asked for action to protect their shares.
 Both the S.E.C. and the New York State attorney general promised to intensify investigations into short selling abuses. ''They are like looters after a hurricane,'' said Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general. ''If you pass a rumor in a normal marketplace, people are calm, they check it out, they do their due diligence. When you get the market in this frenzied state and they are on pins and needles, any false information is much more impactful.''
 Short sellers say that the criticism directed at them, and any restrictions on their activity, are wrong-headed, because they were among the first to raise the alarm about the risky mortgage lending practices that led to the current financial crisis.
 ''Investors are best served when they can hear both the reasons to buy and the reasons to sell any given security,'' said Jim Chanos, a hedge fund manager and chairman of the Coalition of Private Investment Companies. ''These emergency orders limit the free flow of information and ultimately will not work to help the United States maintain the freest, strongest and most liquid capital markets in the world.''
 Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, said Thursday that the S.E.C. had ''kept in place trading rules that let speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino'' and said that the S.E.C.'s chairman, Mr. Cox, had ''betrayed the public's trust.'' 
 Speaking at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr. McCain said, ''If I were president today, I would fire him.''
 The White House immediately said it supported Mr. Cox, who has said he would resign at the end of the Bush administration. Mr. Cox said he had moved against short sellers and was doing all he could to stem the financial crisis. 
 ''Now is not the time for those of us in the trenches to be distracted by the ebb and flow of the current election campaign,'' Mr. Cox said in a statement released by the commission. ''It is precisely the wrong moment for a change in leadership that inevitably would disrupt the work of the S.E.C. at just the wrong time.''
 Mr. Cox is a former White House aide to President Ronald Reagan and a former Republican congressman from California. Some conservative columnists and commentators, including Robert Novak, supported him as a running mate for Mr. McCain. Writing in The American Spectator earlier this year, Quin Hillyer said that conservatives would rally to a Cox selection and called him ''the best choice, bar none.''
 In recent weeks, Mr. Cox has also stepped up his criticism of short-sellers, particularly those who engage in ''naked'' short selling. While short sellers are supposed to borrow shares before selling them, naked shorts do not borrow. That saves the cost of borrowing, though the trader is still vulnerable to losses if the share price rises.
 Opponents of short selling believe that it can force share prices down and destroy confidence in a company that might otherwise survive. Regulators have long thought that the practice was crucial for efficient markets to function, but earlier this year the S.E.C. imposed temporary limits on short selling of some financial stocks. Financial share prices rallied when those limits were announced but fell during the period in which the rule was in effect.
 Share prices for many financial companies shot up Thursday afternoon after plunging the day before in the wake of the government decision to take control of the American International Group, a large insurance company, to prevent it from collapsing. Financial shares were especially hard hit Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley plunging 24 percent, to $21.75, and its chief executive, John J. Mack, blaming false rumors spread by short sellers. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley regained part of that loss, rising 3.7 percent, to close at $22.55.
 The latest moves against short sellers began Wednesday. In the morning, Mr. Cox announced new rules to prevent brokerage firms from selling a stock short if they previously had sold the stock short without having borrowed it. That night, he said that he would propose more rules, to force large short sellers to disclose their positions.
 The rules were needed, he said, ''to ensure that hidden manipulation, illegal naked short selling or illegitimate trading tactics do not drive market behavior and undermine confidence.''
 It is not clear how much authority the S.E.C. has to force disclosure of short positions by hedge funds, which have successfully sued to prevent the commission from forcing them to even register with it. Institutional investors, including some hedge funds, provide details of stocks they own every three months but do not disclose short positions. Mr. Cox said he wanted daily disclosure of short positions, which he said would be made public, though he did not say how quickly.
 Richard Baker, the president of the Managed Funds Association, a hedge fund trade group, said the funds would comply with any rules but said that disclosure of their trading positions should not be made so quickly that it would harm them in the market.
 Mr. Cox also said the S.E.C. would intensify its investigations of short selling by hedge funds and would demand their records on trading in certain securities.
 In Britain, the Financial Services Authority said that beginning Friday it would bar traders from taking new short positions in listed stocks of financial companies, and that starting next week, investors would have to disclose their short positions if they were at least 0.25 percent of a company's outstanding shares.
 This week, the British bank, Lloyds TSB, took over HBOS, a mortgage lender, after HBOS's stock tumbled. That fall was widely blamed on short sellers, and Prime Minister Gordon Brown vowed to clean up the financial system.
 To obtain shares to sell short, traders often borrow them from institutional investors, who receive small fees for the loans. But public pension funds in New York and California said Thursday that they would stop lending shares of some financial companies. 
 New York State's comptroller said the state's Common Retirement Fund would temporarily stop lending the shares of 19 banks and brokerage firms to short sellers. ''This speculative selling has put downward pressure on the entire stock market and threatens to drive our national economy deeper into decline,'' Thomas P. DiNapoli, the comptroller, said in a statement. 
 The suspension removes 105 million shares from the fund's securities lending program. It will last until market conditions stabilize, a spokesman said. 
 New York City's comptroller announced the same move, as did officials in California. 
 ''We're pulling them back because of the unfortunate predators that are out there right now, trying to be greedy,'' said Patricia K. Macht, an official of the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

HEADLINE: Costly Plan for Financial Sector Could Narrow Options Later

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The rescue plan being created by the Bush administration is like the financial crisis it is meant to end -- complex, far-reaching and potentially rife with unpredictable consequences.
 Among the dangers cited by economists on Friday, as word of the plan began circulating: an explosion in federal debt, higher financing costs, an escalating reliance on foreign capital, higher inflation and a further erosion of American economic sovereignty.
 All of these dangers, these experts stress, are hypothetical -- except for the cost, which by many estimates could exceed $1 trillion. 
 Taking on that much additional debt could narrow the economic options available to the next administration. 
 ''The implications are that, at some point, you're going to have to see higher taxes, lower expenditures or a combination of both,'' said Carmen Reinhart, an economist at the University of Maryland.
 Debt can also act as a drag on economic growth, she said, pointing to heavily indebted countries like Italy and Japan. And although public debt does not by itself fuel inflation, it can tempt governments to pursue an inflationary policy, as has happened regularly in Italy in recent years.
 Not all of the potential consequences of the plan are negative. Nouriel Roubini, an economist known for his pessimistic views, said the rescue, if properly executed, could lift the economy by reducing the burden on households, particularly those afflicted by troubled mortgages.
 ''If you reduce their debt payments, they will start spending again,'' said Mr. Roubini, a professor at New York University. ''It's not going to help us avoid a recession, but it could make it shorter.''
 To finance the rescue effort, the United States will have to borrow even more from foreign investors. That has not been a problem in recent days, given the intense demand for Treasury bills, which are perceived as a safe haven by investors around the world.
 But if the bailout does not quickly restore confidence in the American financial system, foreign investment could slow, which would drive up the cost of financing that debt, said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. 
 So far, the dollar has shown remarkable resilience in foreign markets, suggesting, he said, that foreigners still have faith in the ability of the United States to get out of this crisis.
 The concerns of foreign central banks over the fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, played a role in the Treasury department's rescue of the mortgage finance giants. That influence is likely to grow, along with the debt they hold.
 ''The people with leverage are the Japanese, the Chinese and the oil-producing countries, who will want assurances that the debt they hold is worth something,'' said Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who worked in the Treasury department during the Reagan administration.
 Mr. Steuerle said he hoped that the additional burden would force policy makers to confront the country's long-term budget imbalances. The last time this happened, he said, was in the early 1990s, after a much more modest government rescue effort in the aftermath of the 1987 market crash.
 But first the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve must successfully carry out this plan. And the sheer scale and complexity of it left economists and other experts slack-jawed.
 ''It's like doing a quintuple jump in figure skating,'' said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a Treasury department official during the Clinton administration. ''It's impressive if they can do it. It's impressive even to try.''
 Among the potential sources of tension is the Treasury's ultimate decision on whether it will buy troubled mortgage-backed securities from non-American banks. European banks, like UBS, invested heavily in such securities.
 ''If Paribas has bought a mortgage-backed security, why can't they present it to Treasury?'' Mr. Truman said. ''If the government is going to do it for the American banks, they should do it for everyone.''
 But that could provoke a strongly negative reaction from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who already protested that other countries should chip in for the $85 billion rescue of the insurance giant American International Group, because it has operations in those countries or has insured their banks.
 ''Are the taxpayers in the United States going to bail out all the banks in the world?'' said Allan H. Meltzer, a historian of the Federal Reserve. ''I just don't know how this works out.''
 Mr. Meltzer said he believed the plan would be politically viable only if participation was voluntary, and if the banks that received government aid were required to pay it back later. ''We're protecting private industry, not the public interest,'' Mr. Meltzer said.
 Beyond issues of fairness, he said the government could be overwhelmed by the task of identifying troubled securities, which are bundled together in complex packages, with varying degrees of risk. The challenge, he said, dwarfed that of the Resolution Trust Corporation during the savings and loan crisis.
 Perhaps the longest-term consequence of the plan is a wholesale reordering of the financial landscape. Economists said the government would almost certainly impose a raft of new regulations on banks. 
 ''It's hyperbole to say we're abandoning the free-market system,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''But we certainly seem to be entering a new uncharted territory of regulation.''

HEADLINE: Minimizing Your Own Exposure To Risks

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
How are you reducing risk in your financial life? Post your comment at nytimes.com/yourmoney or write to rlieber@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Every piece of your financial life involves at least a bit of risk. What made this week extraordinarily rare, and so terribly frightening, was that all of the threats were on display at once. 
 Sure, investing for retirement involves some ups and downs. But this week, the stock market took the biggest one-day fall in seven years (though it bounced right back as the week ended), and money market funds, long considered rock solid, needed a rescue package. 
 And yes, plenty of people worry about job security from time to time. But with thousands of financial services jobs gone or in jeopardy and the economy threatening to slow further, you had to wonder whether your job might be next. Then there was insurance. Maybe once a decade, a big insurance company is on the brink. 
 This week, the global giant American International Group had a near-bankruptcy experience, leading scores of people to worry themselves sick over their annuities and life insurance policies from that company and others. And as Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. reminded everyone in his remarks on Friday morning, all of these developments have the mortgage mess at their root, leaving anyone who owns a house (or wants to) wondering whether real estate prices will ever find a bottom. 
 The stunning confluence of these events was bad enough. But the fact that the federal government may be on the hook for untold billions of dollars just made the pain worse. 
 I don't know how or where this will end, and neither do any of the experts. 
 It's a humbling time for everyone, and it makes it extremely hard to assess all of these personal risks and come up with a decisive plan of action. 
 The temptation is to either make drastic changes in your financial life or do nothing and hope that the impact is not too severe. 
 So here's another idea, a middle path of sorts. Consider a few modest but concrete things you can do that could reduce your exposure to four of the big areas of risk -- investments, job security, your mortgage and insurance -- that have been front and center this week. 
 Some of these suggestions may have more impact for you than others, but they all can help you feel as if you've taken back some measure of control. 
 Investments
 Before you do anything with your portfolio, ask yourself this: Do you still believe in capitalism? 
 Several financial planners I spoke with felt the need to stop and reaffirm the fact that companies will still need to raise money from investors -- any quasi-Socialist, short-term federal government intervention aside. 
 Andrew Orr, a financial planner in Orlando, Fla., says clients with money in index funds are investing in 17,000 companies that seek to generate earnings and pay dividends. That, he says, is a sustained bet on capitalism itself. ''Capitalism is not always pretty. But it's evolved and gotten better, and there are clearly going to be more protections to come.''
 If you're under 50 or so, you can start by protecting yourself against the biggest investment risk of all, outliving your savings. Thomas Fisher, a financial planner in Cambridge, Mass., said that this risk was one that people generally underestimate. ''Our parents haven't usually run out of money,'' he said. ''There has been a whole generation of people with pensions.''
 Those days are gone, though. And as he took calls this week from clients considering bailing out of the stock market, he said he realized how few people actually understood the big picture. The most acute long-term risk is, in fact, too little risk. Unless you're saving a huge chunk of your income in cash, you'll need consistent exposure to more risky investments like stocks to produce a suitable retirement balance. Keep your stock allocation lower if you must for a few months to sleep at night, but don't get rid of it altogether.
 Most people get back into stocks once you explain this. A bigger challenge now is the one facing those who are in or close to retirement and whose portfolios have declined in the last year. Rebecca Rolfes, a 59-year-old marketing executive in Chicago, has ridden out down markets before, but now her time horizon is shrinking at the same time as her assets. ''I keep going on my mutual fund sites but not actually doing anything,'' she said. 
 Even if you can't bring yourself to make big changes to your portfolio, spending just a bit less money in retirement may make a huge difference. ''Small changes in retirees' burn rate will affect them far greater than what the market will do today,'' said Bill Schultheis, of Sagemark Wealth Management in Kirkland, Wash., and the author of ''The Coffeehouse Investor.'' That's because overspending is a risk you can actually control, even if you can't predict how the markets perform. ''I've found that many clients really like that, because they like to be in charge.''
 He noted that spending on grandchildren was often a huge item for retirees. If you can't bring yourself to cut back there, consider the cost of eating out. He says he is often surprised by the amount people spend on that. 
 Job Security
 Aside from the job losses at financial services companies in the news, there was also concern the economy could slow significantly and ultimately affect employment levels everywhere. 
 This week, people who work for themselves seemed to feel better about their prospects than those who work for large companies. ''It feels safer than having a job with a single employer,'' said Mike Sanislo, who helps companies with new product development through his firm High Energy Consulting in Woodbury, Minn. He says he expects to lose clients every so often, but his business doesn't fall apart when one goes away.
 Though you may not be ready to chuck it all and hang out a shingle, it's worth considering the approach that Kathy Santos has taken. Ms. Santos, a webmaster in Pepperell, Mass., has a job by day at the environmental nonprofit group Earthwatch Institute, but is developing a Web design and photography business on the side, Rhino Hill Studios, to spread out her income risk. She also picks up a bit of extra money as an emergency medical technician for the town.
 Mortgages
 All the problems that funny mortgages have caused have hopefully taught important lessons about interest rate risk. This is something you can control. If you're applying for a new mortgage, a fixed-rate mortgage means no risk that the rate will rise. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and have enough equity in your house to refinance, get a fixed-rate loan. 
 Here's another certainty for those skittish about investing: If you put extra money beyond the minimum toward the monthly payment on a 6 percent mortgage, you're effectively earning 6 percent by ridding yourself of that extra debt (though the number may be a bit less if you're taking advantage of the mortgage interest tax deduction). 
 That's what Nell Eakle of Sterling, Ill., has been doing, even though she had to ratchet down the overpayment because of a bout with breast cancer. ''We just want to be a little bit ahead,'' she said. An added bonus is that the extra payments mean the mortgage will hit zero about two years ahead of schedule. 
 A few caveats here. Given the tightened policies among home equity loan providers, you may not be able to easily get this money back out of your house anytime soon. Also, it makes more sense to first pay down 18 percent credit card debt, or max out any 401(k) match that your employer provides, even if you're parking the money in cash. 
 Insurance
 A.I.G.'s crisis suggests one simple tactic to reduce your exposure to troubled institutions: Split your life insurance policies and annuities among more than one provider. 
 Meanwhile, many of the things that insurance protects against are precisely the sorts of risks over which people have the most control. In uncertain times, there's some small comfort in taking measures to avoid having to use the insurance at all. ''Stay in during the first snowfall,'' said Kevin Albaugh, an engineering consultant in Williamsville, N.Y. ''That will shake out all of the people who don't know how to drive on it. That's usually when you see a bunch of S.U.V.'s off the side of the road.''
 Michael Fripp of Carrollton, Tex., says the only risk he can control is the health risks from the stress. ''The financial risks are beyond my control (and a little beyond my understanding),'' he wrote in an e-mail message this week. ''I am bicycling to work, walking with the kids and ignoring the 401(k) balance.''

HEADLINE: Markets Soar, But New Rules Upset Traders

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ, ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Eric Dash and Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This article was reported by Vikas Bajaj, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael J. de la Merced and written by Mr. Bajaj.
 After a week of escalating panic in the markets, stocks soared for the second consecutive day on Friday, and many investors rejoiced. But below the surface, a new sense of turmoil set in. When Washington changed the rules of Wall Street, winners were turned into losers and losers were turned into winners, and both camps were left fearful about what would come next. 
 In a day of chaotic trading, the currents in the financial world changed course on Friday morning after the Bush administration moved to prop up faltering financial institutions.
 Stocks that had been beaten down soared. Treasuries and gold, where investors had sought safety in recent days, plunged. Junk bonds shot up. 
 ''Clients and advisers are almost giddy,'' said Sallie L. Krawcheck, the head of Citigroup's Global Wealth Management division. ''It's a sense of massive relief. Everyone feels like they looked over the edge and saw the abyss, and have been pulled back.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 4 percent to 1,255.08, while financial shares rose 11 percent, in the busiest day of trading in the New York Stock Exchange's history. The American International Group, which the government essentially took over, jumped 43 percent. Big banks like Bank of America and the Wachovia Corporation rose more than 20 percent. 
 But across Wall Street, many of the basic mechanisms of the marketplace broke down after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Friday morning that it would ban short selling in nearly 800 financial stocks, making it harder for people to bet against those securities, and that it also would force investors to disclose those trades. When investors sell short, they borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and profit from the difference. Short sellers had come under fire for contributing to the sharp decline in financial shares this year.
 Computers that automatically buy and sell for big investors hit snags because they were not programmed for such a restriction. Securities firms and money managers that routinely sell short to hedge against possible losses wondered how they would cope. In certain stocks and funds traded on New York Stock Exchange, some prices and trades were ''erroneous,'' a spokesman said.
 The surge in financial shares was driven at least in part by traders who were forced to buy those stocks to cover earlier short sales, raising doubts about whether the rally will last. 
 Hedge fund managers who made vast profits betting against the nation's financial titans called the ban unfair, and said the move would only prolong the financial crisis. Some traders said they were no longer betting on the intrinsic health of companies, but rather on what the government might do next. Others simply withdrew from the market. 
 ''Some of my clients are literally closing their books and going on their vacation for two weeks -- they can't operate in this environment,'' said Meredith A. Whitney, a financial services analyst. ''You pack up and come back and play the game when you know what the rules are.''
 One hedge fund manager, who declined to be named, likened the changes to ''turning a football game into badminton.''
 Many players warned that the government's sweeping actions might have unintended consequences. The ban on short selling raised questions about how certain parts of the capital markets would function. Companies may have a harder time raising money by selling instruments like convertible bonds, which can be exchanged for shares, because many investors short stocks to hedge against the risks of owning these instruments. 
 Byron Wien, chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital Management, the big hedge fund, said that forcing big investors to disclose short positions could create a run on stocks. It might not be immediately apparent whether investors with short positions were using it to hedge another position or bet against stocks. 
 In the market for options -- instruments that give holders the right to buy or sell shares at certain prices -- traders reported frantic trading in Chicago and New York. Many big options traders, or market makers, must frequently sell shares short to hedge other trades.
 ''It was the most difficult day we have ever seen in the market,'' said Peter Bottini, an executive vice president at optionsXpress, a brokerage. ''We have had a very volatile day.''
 William J. Brodsky, the chief executive of the nation's largest options exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, lashed out at the S.E.C. ''The need for the policy intervention notwithstanding, it is difficult to comprehend the merits of a draconian measure that will result in the sudden and severe removal of liquidity from the marketplace at the same time that the government is taking unprecedented steps to preserve it,'' he said in a statement.
 Later in the day, the S.E.C. said its staff had recommended that the commission exempt options market makers from the short-sale trading restrictions.
 ''People have definitely been saying that this is no longer an investor's market, nor even really a trader's market -- it's all entirely speculation on what the government is going to be doing next,'' said a broker at a Wall Street firm, who was not authorized to talk to the press. ''Anyone who thinks they have a handle on where things are going is deluding themselves.''
 The immediate targets of the S.E.C.'s actions were short sellers, who have been blamed for the plunges in the stock prices of large investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. To many observers, shorts were to blame for the collapse of Bear Stearns and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers; the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants; and the $85 billion bailout of A.I.G. 
 The world of deal-making was turned upside-down by the stock market rally, as mergers like Merrill Lynch's $50 billion sale to Bank of America, struck as Lehman Brothers slid toward bankruptcy last weekend, could unwind. Arbitrageurs, investors who bet on the outcome of deals by buying shares in the target company while shorting those in the seller, were unable to play one side of that trade.
 Some hedge fund managers complained bitterly that they had been singled out, even as they were among the few to properly manage risk. Those whom the government had propped up were the investment banks, whose hundreds of billions of dollars in losses arose from reckless risks undertaken to raise profits to hedge-fund-like levels.
 ''Bailing out the banks should not be done,'' said Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor. He suggested that the government should have extended those firms a loan, instead of buying their toxic mortgage-backed securities. 
 In the end, the market closed on Friday at nearly the same price it did last week before all the mayhem. An e-mail message circulating around Wall Street on Friday carried the subject line: ''If you took the week off ... you didn't miss anything.''

HEADLINE: Gambling on the Lottery

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Sweet Dreams in Hard Times Help Lottery Sales Set Records'' (front page, Sept. 13): 
 The fact that economically strapped Americans are increasingly turning to state lotteries is another reason to question the integrity and legitimacy of these state-sponsored rip-offs. 
 As every real gambler knows, lotteries are for losers. Studies show that you are significantly more likely to get rich by pumping your dollars into Las Vegas slot machines than by purchasing lottery tickets.
 The reasons for the popularity of lotteries are not hard to fathom.
 Politicians love them because they constitute a tax that never gets called a tax. 
 The gaming industry loves them because the state makes them co-owners of high-profit gambling enterprises. 
 And Americans play along in growing numbers partly out of a pitiable willingness to substitute phony hopes for real ones, and partly because they apparently believe the false advertisements their tax dollars paid for.
 Let's see. Cynical politicians from both parties hooking up with big business to take money out of the pockets of struggling Americans -- and getting away with it! Does anyone smell anything?

HEADLINE: A Long, Uncertain Road to Business as Usual in Galveston

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER; Thayer Evans contributed reporting.

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex. 

 BODY:
Galveston Island, which hangs like a saloon door at the mouth of Galveston Bay, has lived off the bounty of the Gulf of Mexico for two centuries. Shrimp boats ply its waters, freighters line up at its port and promises of easy evenings underneath a palm tree have long attracted tourists from as far as California.
 But if the Gulf has always been an economic engine for the island, it has also loomed as a meteorological threat. In 1900, the island (known by the Spanish as Malhado, the isle of doom) was leveled by a hurricane that killed 6,000 and remains the nation's deadliest natural disaster.
 In the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, businesses and business leaders here are again facing a familiar question: when, or perhaps even whether, Galveston will return to a semblance of itself. 
 ''It created a heck of a mess, with high water and some destruction, but 80 percent of our structures are still standing,'' said Jeff Sjostrom, the president of the Galveston Economic Development Partnership. 
 Mr. Sjostrom predicted that ''with a little patience and a lot of Galveston spirit,'' the city would come back better than ever.
 There was one positive sign on Friday -- city officials said they expected to begin allowing residents to return next week in a ''phased re-entry.''
 While it is too early to place a dollar figure on the damage, the effect on the tourist trade alone -- a $700-million-a-year industry -- has been extensive. 
 The famous Balinese Room, a 1940s-era nightclub where Sinatra used to play, is now no more than a heap of shattered timbers. Cruise ships have been rerouted to the Port of Houston for at least the next four weeks.
 At the same time, the island's prime natural attraction, its sprawling white-sand beaches, survived the storm relatively unscathed, said Peter Davis, chief of the Galveston Beach Patrol. 
 Still, Steve LeBlanc, the city manager, said it was legitimate to ask whether Galveston would indeed return to normal.
 ''I think that it's an opportunity for change and a challenge at the same time,'' Mr. LeBlanc said. ''I think Galveston is going to be a different Galveston. We may downsize a little bit, but it may be higher quality. Higher building standards cost more money, but no matter what, people still want to live on the coast and enjoy the coast, so I don't think that's ever going to go away.''
 He added that the storm would have a significant effect on tourism.
 Even though the convention center near the San Luis Hotel is shuttered for the moment, Mr. LeBlanc said he felt confident the city could still play host to the Lone Star Motorcycle Rally at the end of next month.
 In some sense, Galveston is lucky, having been through this before. 
 After Hurricane Rita, for example, which caused $11 billion in damage on the Gulf Coast in September 2005, the city arranged for an immediate $20 million line of credit and made sure its municipal coffers were filled with cash reserves. 
 Beyond the pleasures to be offered by a deck chair or a frozen margarita, Galveston's economy is fueled by heavyweights like the century-old American National Insurance Company and the University of Texas Medical Branch, which has styled itself as a cutting-edge biotechnology center and is the island's biggest employer with nearly 15,000 workers. Both were shut down in the wake of the storm and have yet to be reopened. 
 Officials at American National said Thursday that emergency crews had only just begun restoring the home office. David Callender, the president of the medical center, has acknowledged that it might take a month or two before the hospital resumes its normal operations.
 Then there are the fishery and cargo shipping trades, which have largely stalled because of the storm. 
 The Commerce Department announced this week that members of the fishing fleet can now apply for federal assistance. Steve Cernak, the director of the port, said that it was inundated with a layer of oil-laced mud. But a city spokeswoman, Alicia Cahill, said Friday that the port was expected to reopen next week.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has delivered to Galveston a large supply of emergency items, including bottled water, packaged meals and rolls of plastic sheeting. 
 The agency has also taken charge of the efforts to remove debris, although much of the work is still being done by private contractors and local officials, and the questions remain: how much money Galveston will receive to defray the cost of the cleanup and when it will receive it, local officials said.
 Complicating matters is the issue of insurance. While businesses and private homeowners in Galveston are required by law to carry flood insurance, many of the hardest-hit residents were renters who carried no policies on their homes. If the uninsured are unable to recover sufficiently from their loss of property, it could delay efforts to get the city back on its feet. 
 Greg Harrington, chairman of the Galveston Chamber of Commerce, said he was far more concerned about the little guys, the local ''mom-and-pops,'' than he was about the larger industries in town, or the ''big boys,'' as he called them. 
 ''It's the barber shops and the little souvenir places on the Strand,'' said Mr. Harrington, referring to the downtown historic district, ''that are going to have the problems. No matter what kinds of preparation they made for this thing, it was probably not enough.''
 On Thursday, the Strand smelled vaguely of dirty socks, its Victorian buildings covered in a coat of brownish muck. Luigi Ferre, owner of Luigi's Seafood Restaurant, stood outside his ruined business with a claims adjuster, staring at the sky.
 ''I don't know,'' Mr. Ferre said. ''I just don't know what's going to happen now -- with me, with Galveston, with anything. I mean, I have insurance, but I really don't know.''
 Across the street, at the DeVine Winery, Heath Lollar, the general manager, was standing in the dining room -- or, perhaps more accurately, the soaked place where the dining room used to be. 
 ''Next week, we'll bring down a U-Haul and pack up what we can,'' Mr. Lollar said. ''We'll start again -- but not in Galveston this time.''
 Galveston has always had its enthusiasts, and George P. Mitchell, a native son and former wildcat oilman, is among them. Mr. Mitchell, who for years took breakfast every morning at the Kroger's supermarket near the seawall, has invested heavily in the town, building two resort hotels and supporting operations at the medical center.
 Well into his 80s now, he is contrarian and slightly hard-of-hearing but remains rather bullish on the island's future prospects. Nonetheless, when asked what he might do to help his city recover, Mr. Mitchell, while clearly optimistic, spoke in generalities. 
 ''There's a tremendous potential from a resort hotel point of view -- even now,'' he said. ''You've got the Gulf right there and Houston, the fourth-biggest city in the country, is just nearby. So it's got attributes that are valuable and that will let it come back.''

HEADLINE: Embattled Rangel Uses History as a Guide

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Two men from New York, each with political skills vital to his work, sat backstage in the ballroom of a hotel in Washington. One was the Democratic congressman from Upper Manhattan, Charles B. Rangel. The other was Dave Hunt, the owner of a bar and restaurant in Washington Heights. 
 It was September 2002, and the National Restaurant Association was meeting in Washington to push its views on the taxation of tips, and to resist a move to increase the minimum wage. 
 In a few minutes, Mr. Rangel would be taking his turn on the stage, and Mr. Hunt remembered that they chatted about what he would say in his speech.
 ''I'm going to talk about the Iraq buildup,'' Mr. Rangel said.
 Mr. Hunt wasn't sure that was a good idea.
 ''It's a very Republican crowd,'' Mr. Hunt warned. ''You're talking to guys who own 16 units of Domino's in Indiana.''
 He recalled that Mr. Rangel replied: ''At this point in my career, I don't care.''
 Onstage, Mr. Rangel praised restaurants as a barometer of the nation's economy, and then turned to what was then only the threat of an invasion in Iraq. Officials were claiming that Saddam Hussein could be quickly toppled and replaced, and the Americans would depart in short order, leaving a democratic government where a tyrant had ruled.
 His own experience made him skeptical, Mr. Rangel said. During the Korean War, he served with the 503rd Field Artillery Battalion of the Second Infantry Division, and was among the first American soldiers to reach Korea in 1950. 
 In 2000, Mr. Rangel went back to Korea for the 50th anniversary of the start of the war. 
 ''Do you know,'' Mr. Rangel said to his audience in 2002, ''that 50 years later, the Second Infantry Division has its headquarters in Korea?'' 
 So much, he said, for the notion of quick wars and brief occupations.
 Over the past three months, news reports have revealed that Mr. Rangel kept four rent-stabilized apartments, didn't declare income from a residence at a resort -- though over two decades, it totaled $75,000 -- and on Congressional stationery sought donations for an institute at the City University of New York that would be named for him. One exclusive scoop this week revealed that he left a broken-down car in a government garage for several years, and suggested he would owe taxes for the parking space. 
 For this peculiar grab bag of real but fairly minor sins, Mr. Rangel is now being promoted by the Republicans as a symbol of lapsed ethics in a Congress controlled by Democrats. 
 John A. Boehner, a Republican representative from Ohio and the minority leader of the House, sponsored a resolution this week calling for Mr. Rangel to be stripped of his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. 
 The resolution was voted down, no doubt to the relief of both Democrats and Republicans. Two Republicans held senior positions on other committees while they were under active criminal investigations, a predicament far more serious than Mr. Rangel's lapses. And Mr. Boehner himself once passed out checks from the tobacco industry on the floor of the House; he also was reported to be a tenant of a lobbyist in Washington.
 Mr. Rangel has asked for a formal investigation by the House ethics committee, hired a forensic accountant and owned up to being irresponsible with various filings, including his taxes. In effect, he has challenged critics to make a distinction between sloppiness and ethical failures.
 Even so, the fevers of strategic indignation are certain to be part of the 2008 elections. While Mr. Rangel faces no serious threats in his home district, he is likely to be featured as a villain in campaigns across the country. He shrugs. Having rescued 40 men trapped for three days behind enemy lines in Korea, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star with valor, Mr. Rangel says he has never had a bad day since. 
 On Friday afternoon, he spent two hours on the phone with Henry M. Paulson Jr., the secretary of the treasury, hearing the administration's plan to prevent a collapse of the global economic system. It will require legislation to be passed next week. 
 Mr. Rangel said he was annoyed, ''because Hank Paulson is leaving at the end of this year. What are we supposed to do in January? He's telling us what to do, which may cost us trillions of dollars. What do we say next year? Where's Paulson? He's back on Wall Street. There's no one in the administration that we'd trust except Paulson.
 ''It ends up, 'Trust me, it's the right thing to do,' '' Mr. Rangel said. ''And if you don't do it, the economy will melt down. Not only do we have to do this, you have to do it next week.''
 The economic crisis, he said, is swamping even the faint lingering concerns about the American engagement in Iraq. 
 ''Soldiers in Iraq are not even an afterthought,'' he said. ''Here we are in the middle of an historic election, and they don't even make the list. I wish I was wrong in 2002. It's worse than ever. At least we were talking about the thing in 2002.''

HEADLINE: Oil Up Sharply, Again Breaking $100 Barrier

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Oil rose more than $6.50 on Friday to post its biggest three-day rally in a decade on expectations a sweeping United States government bailout plan would boost liquidity across the battered financial markets. 
 Crude oil prices jumped $6.67 to settle at $104.55 a barrel, bringing gains since Wednesday to 14.7 percent -- biggest three-day surge since December 2008 when the United States ramped up tensions on Iraq to allow arms inspections.
 ''This is tracking the recovery we've seen in the capital markets across the board on the government bailout plan. The liquidity has come back in and it is pushing us higher,'' said John Kilduff, senior vice president at MF Global. 
 The United States government launched several multibillion-dollar programs to guarantee holdings in money-market mutual funds and curb short-selling while developing a broader plan to mop up toxic mortgage debt. 
 The moves came at the end of an agonizing week for Wall Street, in which the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, the insurer A.I.G. was bailed out by the government and Merrill Lynch was forced to sell itself to Bank of America.
 Investors had worried the confluence of crises severely threatened the stability of the American economy -- a factor that helped push oil to a seven month low of $90.51 a barrel earlier in the week.
 Oil prices remain sharply down from their peaks over $147 a barrel hit in mid-July, pressured by mounting evidence that high energy costs and economic troubles are undercutting global fuel consumption.
 Oil prices also got a boost Friday from weakness in the dollar -- which strengthens overseas buying power in commodities -- and supply disruptions from the hurricane-hit United States and from Nigeria.
 ''Traders will continue to alternate focus between the financial markets, which could result in further demand destruction, dollar movements as well as production out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,'' said Gerard Burg, a resource analyst at the National Australian Bank in Melbourne.
 Some 89.2 percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico -- the source of one-quarter of the United States' crude output -- remained idled on Thursday in the wake of Hurricane Ike, along with about 14 percent of the country's refined fuel capacity.
 ''The market had hoped we'd see a fairly quick rebound in production from Ike, but that hasn't materialized,'' Mr. Killduff said.
 Meanwhile, militants in Nigeria, an OPEC member, said they had attacked another oil pipeline in the Niger Delta. 
 The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, which has declared an ''oil war'' against the oil sector and the military, said it used explosives to sabotage a Royal Dutch Shell-operated pipeline at the Cawthorne Channel in Rivers state.

HEADLINE: Gates Says West Should Avoid Extremes of Force and Restraint in Dealing With Threats

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER; Clifford J. Levy contributed reporting from Moscow.

DATELINE: WOODSTOCK, England 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates challenged Western powers on Friday to avoid past mistakes of lurching between excessive military resolve and excessive restraint, as the world faces threats from a resurgent Russia, violent Islamic extremism and rogue leaders seeking nuclear arms.
 In an address to a British strategic studies group, Oxford Analytica, Mr. Gates warned that matters of war and peace had too often been debated at polar extremes, ''between a too eager embrace of the use of military force and an extreme aversion to it.'' 
 He said policy was still overly influenced by the long shadows of two historic events: that of August 1914, where ''miscalculation, hubris, bellicosity, fear of looking weak'' led to World War I; and the journey 70 years ago this month by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of Britain to Munich, where he appeased Hitler by acknowledging the Nazi leader's rights to a portion of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans.
 The proper course for world leaders today, Mr. Gates argued, was ''to balance restraint in international affairs with the resolve and will to back up our commitments and defend our interests when called upon.''
 ''The goal must be to come together and take the steadfast and prudent steps now -- political, economic and, when appropriate, military -- to shape the international environment and choices of other powers,'' Mr. Gates said. ''We must try to prevent situations where we have only two bleak choices: confrontation or capitulation, 1914 or 1938.''
 The defense secretary's address was delivered at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace and family home of Winston Churchill, a few miles from Oxford University.
 It was another in a series of speeches Mr. Gates has given since being called back to government in 2006 that have ranged far beyond his portfolio as defense secretary, including talks on reconciling the pragmatic and ideological roots of American foreign policy, and on the necessity of marshaling diplomatic and economic power along with military force.
 Mr. Gates cautioned the allies against rushing to take punitive actions against Russia for its military incursion into sovereign territory of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Moscow seems to be returning to ''czarist habits and aspirations,'' yet these are far less of a threat than the Communist-era Kremlin's ''ideology-based effort to dominate the globe,'' he said.
 He suggested that Europe and the United States help rebuild Georgia and, at the same time, put the Kremlin's desired membership in global economic organizations on hold until Russian leaders return to acceptable behavior.
 Mr. Gates said Russia faced a choice of whether ''to be a fully integrated and responsible partner in the international community'' or to be an isolated nation viewed mostly as a source of fuel supplies for Europe.
 Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, addressed that subject on Friday, suggesting that the West was unfairly portraying Russia as well along the path toward authoritarianism.
 He said that Russia was being pressed in ways that were intended to isolate it. 
 In a self-deprecating aside, Mr. Gates noted an unusual fact, that the United States had career Kremlinologists serving as secretaries of state and defense during a period in which aspirations for closer ties with Russia were evaporating.
 ''At this point I should note that for the first time, both the United States secretary of state and secretary of defense have doctorates in Russian studies,'' Mr. Gates said. ''A fat lot of good that's done us.''
 Mr. Gates delivered a strong caution to those who argue for quickly making Georgia a NATO member to protect its sovereignty from another Russian attack.
 He noted that Article V of the NATO charter required all allies to defend the territory of any member that came under attack. And he implied that a full reckoning must be made before the United States and other allies obligated themselves to military action by allowing Georgia into NATO.
 ''We need to be careful about the commitments we make, but we must be willing to keep the commitments once made,'' Mr. Gates said, without specifically mentioning the debate over NATO membership for Georgia.
 ''In the case of NATO, Article V must mean what it says,'' he added. ''As the allied troops fighting in Afghanistan can attest, NATO is not a talk shop nor a Renaissance Weekend on steroids.''
 During a meeting in London of NATO defense ministers on Thursday and Friday, the question of membership for Georgia was not discussed, according to a senior American official. The talks focused mostly on how to enhance NATO's capabilities.
 Mr. Gates spoke here after a separate meeting in London on Friday with the Czech defense minister. The two signed a declaration of strategic defense cooperation and a status of forces agreement for stationing American personnel in the Czech Republic as part of a missile defense radar site, a plan that has outraged Russia. The forces agreement now goes to the Czech Parliament for approval.

HEADLINE: Fund-Raising and the Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FALCONE

 BODY:
Republicans denounced an e-mail message that Senator Barack Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, sent to supporters on Friday that used the fiscal crisis as fodder for a fund-raising appeal and accused Senator John McCain of lying. 
 ''With Wall Street in crisis and families struggling, Barack offered a solid plan to strengthen the middle class, including tax cuts for nearly all Americans,'' Mr. Plouffe wrote in the message. ''John McCain continued the same old politics -- lying about Barack's plan and offering more of the same George Bush policies, including more tax breaks for Big Oil and no solutions for working families.''
 A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Alex Conant, called the fund-raising plea ''the definition of political opportunism.''
 ''It raises serious questions about Obama's judgment when millions of Americans are losing their jobs and savings, and his response is to ask for a campaign contribution,'' Mr. Conant said in a statement, adding, ''The crisis on Wall Street should be a bipartisan call for government reform, not a selfish call for political contributions.''
 The Obama campaign responded by saying that the McCain campaign had sent out e-mail messages in several states that also mentioned the economy in conjunction with a fund-raising pitch, though those messages did not include quotations from McCain campaign officials.
 The zest with which the Obama campaign is tapping its base of supporters reflects Mr. Obama's decision to forgo public financing for the general election. Mr. McCain elected to take the $84 million in federal financing that is available to presidential candidates who agree to certain spending restrictions.
 By rejecting public money, Mr. Obama lifted the ceiling on how much he could raise for the general election, but he is spending more of his time courting donors. He held five fund-raisers this week and collected as much as $20 million. MICHAEL FALCONE

HEADLINE: Behind Closed Doors, Warnings of Calamity

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Gathered in the conference room just off House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's personal suite on the second floor of the Capitol, the Congressional leadership had just received the sobering news Thursday night that America's economy remained in peril despite a series of sudden interventions by the Federal Reserve.
 Then the other shoe dropped. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. told top members of both parties -- about to leave Washington to assail one another in a bitter election season -- that they had no choice but to pull together and quickly pass legislation providing billions of public dollars to take bad assets off the hands of the nation's financial institutions. 
 ''Do you know what you are asking me to do?'' said Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader who has struggled all year against concerted Republican opposition, according to multiple participants at the Thursday night session. ''It takes me 48 hours to get the Republicans to agree to flush the toilets around here.''
 At that point, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader who duels constantly with Mr. Reid, reached over to assure his colleague they could work it out. ''Harry,'' Mr. McConnell said, ''I think we need to do this, we should try to do this and we can do this.''
 As Congress waited Friday for details of the plan, Congressional officials said members of both parties remained willing to move ahead despite reservations from the rank-and-file about exposing taxpayers to staggering costs that have yet to be disclosed.
 In telephone briefings with lawmakers, Mr. Paulson and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, sought to make it clear that the price of doing nothing could be calamitous.
 ''If we don't get this, it will be nothing short of a disaster for our markets,'' Mr. Bernanke told House Republicans in a conference call Friday, according to a detailed account of the call.
 At the same time, Democrats sought to make it clear the final proposal had to take care of the general public as well as Wall Street. 
 Referring to a phone conversation with President Bush early Friday, Ms. Pelosi said: ''As I told the president this morning, we are committed to quick, bipartisan action while ensuring that we uphold key principles -- insulating Main Street from Wall Street and keeping people in their homes by reducing mortgage foreclosures, restoring market confidence and protecting American taxpayers from incurring hundreds of billions of dollars of debt.''
 Yet it is evident that sentiments disclosed by the financial officials in the meeting Thursday night and in other briefings have made a strong impression on Congress. And the seriousness with which the administration is approaching the issue was evident in the fact that Mr. Bush for the first time in weeks also telephoned Mr. Reid, with whom he has had a strained relationship, to ask for his help in pushing through legislation. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, said that the Thursday-night session contained not a bit of levity and that the description of the financial predicament made him gulp. ''When you get 20 politicians together and no one makes a joke, you know something is going on,'' he said. 
 Although Mr. Schumer and others have declined to repeat precisely what they were told by Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke, they said the two men described the financial system as effectively bound in a knot that was being pulled tighter and tighter by the day.
 ''There was a long pause in the room,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said.
 In the Republican conference call Friday, Mr. Bernanke sought to remind lawmakers that voters have money at risk, not just Wall Street executives.
 ''Many of your constituents hold money in money markets -- those funds are losing money,'' he said, according to the account of the call provided by a listener. He blamed the deep problems in the housing market and said that the ''critical issue is what do we do about these bad assets clogging up our credit system.''
 The financial crisis comes at a delicate time for Congress. Lawmakers had been preparing to dispose of a few legislative issues and then adjourn at the end of next week for the elections. But the push for financial legislation has upended the schedule and given the two parties some incentive to work together.
 Republicans warned Friday that Democrats should not try to take advantage of the situation, with Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, saying the plan has to be kept ''as simple and straightforward as possible.''
 ''Loading it up to score political points or fit a partisan agenda will only delay the economic stability that families, seniors and small businesses deserve,'' he said.
 Some conservatives who had already raised the alarm over federal intervention in the markets remained deeply skeptical of the plan. 
 ''We are being asked to go 'all in' with taxpayer dollars, and once our government and the taxpayer is on the hook, there is no fallback option,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. ''My fear is that taxpayers will be left with the mother of all debts, the federal government becomes the lender and guarantor of last resort and our nation finds itself on the slippery slope to socialism.''
 Yet Republican leaders appeared determined to go along with the administration plan. ''This is a very serious, very unpleasant problem to deal with,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, No. 3 in the Senate Republican leadership. ''But we must act next week to solve this situation.'' 
 In their Friday conference call with Treasury and Fed officials, House Democrats, according to participants, accepted that the bailout was necessary but also faulted the administration for a reckless economic approach that combined deregulation, deficit spending and bad management.
 In the closed-door Thursday night meeting, Democrats sought to make it clear to Republicans that the underlying initiative for the financial rescue was coming from the administration and that it was the White House that owned the proposal.
 Participants said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, was particularly emphatic, noting that the administration was requesting unprecedented action on short notice, effectively telling Congress, ''Trust us.''

HEADLINE: France, Its Economy Limping, Worries About Financial Shock Wave From Across Atlantic

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has openly admired America's freer markets and less restrictive regulation, now finds that the financial collapse on Wall Street threatens to make things worse for the faltering French economy. 
 Mr. Sarkozy already faces severe difficulties from inflation as higher prices for oil and food spread across Europe. Estimates for France's economic growth have already fallen to half the president's original goal of 2 percent this year. He has failed to deliver on promises of more purchasing power for French workers. The global financial upheaval only makes his economic lot more complicated. 
 Though Mr. Sarkozy has announced a major economic address for Thursday, his aides do not yet know what he plans to say, beyond seeking to reassure the nation, to defend his policies and to ''put into perspective the political economy of France,'' as one aide said. 
 First, Mr. Sarkozy intends to go to New York this weekend, where he hopes to meet with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is from France. 
 Prime Minister Francois Fillon has called on Washington to act. ''We're not going to accept to pay for the broken dishes of a failed regulation'' and a ''corruption of capitalism,'' he said Thursday.
 An initial confidence that the global crisis would spare France is eroding. A poll taken Wednesday and Thursday of about 1,000 adults and published Friday in Le Figaro found that 80 percent of the French expected ''a grave economic crisis'' at home. Some 94 percent expected the United States to undergo such a trauma. Sixty-six percent said that Mr. Sarkozy's government could not protect France from the aftershocks, and only 14 percent that it could. 
 Eric Le Boucher, an economist and editor, said Thursday that ''it's frustrating for Europeans to think they are paying for the excesses of the American financial system,'' according to Jacques Mistral, head of economic studies at the French Institute of International Relations. 
 Elie Cohen, director of research at the Center for Political Research at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, known as Sciences Po, and a member of the government's Council of Economic Advisers, was blunter. ''There's certainly an idea that the American financial system has gone crazy,'' he said in an interview. ''This has dealt a mortal blow to the timid admiration we had of the American system. But not even the most conservative French person is capable of defending it anymore.''
 Mr. Sarkozy, who is often described as a ''fisher for ideas,'' is pressing his government and the European system for political responses to the economic anxieties. As president of the European Union, he is expected to make better regulation of global markets a prime topic when the European leaders meet in mid-October.
 One of his chief ministers, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, said Friday that the measures taken by the United States government showed the need for state intervention.
 ''The Americans have the courage of doing a healthy purge, nationalizing when necessary,'' he said in a column in Le Monde on Friday. But he added, ''This shows the limits of the ideology of financial liberalism and the need for pragmatic intervention.''
 Growth has already slowed all over Europe. The European Commission on Sept. 10 forecast a recession in Germany, Spain and Britain, with France and Italy barely doing better. The commission had cut earlier growth estimates even before the latest financial collapses. It estimated that the economy of the 27-country European Union would expand by just 1.4 percent this year, below the 2 percent forecast in April.
 In July inflation hit a record 4 percent in the countries that use the euro, and in August declined only slightly, to 3.8 percent. The French economy is expected to grow by only 1 percent this year, with inflation of 3.5 percent.
 Last month Mr. Fillon, the prime minister, called the government together for what Yves de Kerdrel, an editorialist in Le Figaro, described at the time as ''the war against recession. The war against the fall of national wealth. The war against purchasing power at half-mast.'' 
 That ''war'' continues, but Mr. Sarkozy's weapons are further reduced. His policy of reducing some taxes on the middle class but raising others on companies, while doing little to reduce the budget deficit, has created confusion. 
 ''His economic policy is not easy to define, but it is incompatible with what is developing outside,'' said Mr. Mistral, the economist. The high deficit, already close to breaching European Union rules, has left the government with relatively little room to maneuver in a crisis.
 Mr. Sarkozy's regular attacks on the independence of the European Central Bank are not widely shared across Europe, even if some countries would also like an easing of interest rates. And France faces problems in keeping industrial jobs. The strong euro is driving companies like Renault and Airbus to outsource jobs to Asia and Eastern Europe.
 Mr. Cohen of the Council of Economic Advisers said that the press had exaggerated the risks of this crisis to French institutions, which are more highly regulated. 
 ''It's not the direct effect I fear, but the indirect effect, the progressive paralysis of the system of credit that touches the whole world,'' he said. ''Concretely, it will be harder to find credit to finance industrial projects or housing.'' And growth in 2009 could be even lower than 1 percent, he said.

HEADLINE: The Alpha Dogs Bark

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
These times are so perilous that George W. Bush emerged from his burrow on Friday to reassure the American people about the financial crisis.
 Looking either grim or overmedicated, Bush spoke for several minutes -- 1,260 words worth of reassurance. That was a far more ambitious effort than the day before, when, as Politico's Roger Simon noted, our president devoted 100 fewer words to his public utterances on the collapsing economy than he did to toasting the president of Ghana at dinner.
 Behind the-first-president-with-an-M.B.A.-and-a-lot-of-good-it-did-us stood the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, who appears to be actually running the government. On Thursday night, Bernanke had called Congressional leaders together and terrified them into supporting a quadrillion-dollar rescue plan. Legend has it that there was a time when these sorts of gatherings took place at the White House, but it would probably have really cast a pall on the president of Ghana's big night. 
 Anyway, by the time Bush got around to making his speech, or at least a speechlet, Bernanke had already made the plan public. The stock market had rallied, and if the president had just stayed inside practicing his pending welcome for the Boston Celtics, the world would have little noted nor long remembered.
 ''This is no time for partisanship,'' Bush concluded.
 Bipartisanship! That's the ticket. There have been more vicious political eras in the nation's history, but probably never one in which so much vitriol has been mixed with so many demands for reaching across the aisle in fellowship.
 Down in Florida, Barack Obama was also endorsing a bipartisan approach to the rescue. For good measure, he also tacked on a call on both parties to join together in backing ''an emergency economic plan'' crafted out of a whole bunch of things that the Republicans are never going to support in a million years.
 Obama declined to provide many specifics. The most notable thing about his performance this week -- besides his really extraordinary skill in packing large numbers of economic advisers onto a stage -- has been his calm. Even this late in the campaign, it's hard to tell whether it's the product of wise serenity or a low metabolism. But, under present circumstances, it was definitely soothing.
 John McCain, on the other hand, was angry. Still. He had been angry Monday, when he blamed the financial crisis on greedy speculators, and on Tuesday, when he blamed it on people who didn't respect the American worker. He was furious on Wednesday, when he blamed the crisis on C.E.O.'s with golden parachutes until it was pointed out that one of his highest-profile advisers, Carly Fiorina, had sailed out of Hewlitt-Packard with a 24-karat whopper. On Thursday, he was mad at the head of the Securities Exchange Commission.
 On Friday, McCain looked steamed when he gave a new policy speech in Wisconsin with Sarah Palin at his side. The Republicans have discovered that McCain can't draw a crowd without Palin, and the dangers of letting her float off by herself are apparent. So the two are manacled together these days like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in that old escape-from-a-chain-gang movie.
 McCain's proposals were pretty much in line with the emerging Washington consensus. The real theme of the speech was assignment of blame. Normally at times of great national trauma top politicians say they want to avoid finger-pointing. But the McCainian digit was ready for action, and its owner assured the audience that he had found ''plenty of places to point.''
 The main culprit, the finger's final resting place, turned out to be -- Obama! His opponent, McCain claimed, took campaign contributions from officials at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and had a couple of former C.E.O.'s of Fannie Mae as advisers. ''In a McCain-Palin administration, there will be no seat for these people at the policy-making table,'' he vowed.
 Given the amount of time the campaigns have spent arguing about the misdeeds of advisers, I think we might all be better off if the term was eliminated completely. From now on, everybody who is invited to consult with a candidate should be referred to as ''complete-stranger-who-dropped-by-to-talk'' or perhaps ''the person I thought was a FedEx deliverer.'' 
 Actually McCain's remarks were a bit more muted than on Thursday, when he helped restore the financial markets' shattered confidence by accusing Obama of responding to the crisis with ''the kind of me-first, country-second politics'' that ''sees an economic crisis as a political opportunity instead of a time to lead.''
 Still, he managed to get himself pretty riled up, culminating in a claim that people like Obama were ''too busy gaming the system'' to fix things, and that the junior senator from Illinois, despite his brief career in Washington, was smack dab in the middle of a ''culture of lobbying and influence-peddling'' that created the whole financial crisis.
 He ended with a call for bipartisanship.

HEADLINE: Dazed Capital Feels Its Way, Eyes on Nov. 4

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Michael Cooper contributed reporting from Green Bay, Wis., and Blaine, Minn., and Jeff Zeleny from Coral Gables, Fla.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The huge bailout of the financial system that the Bush administration and Congress are rushing to draft will leave taxpayers with at least part of the bill at a time when high gasoline prices, job losses and stagnant incomes have already helped produce an overwhelming sense that the nation is on the wrong track.
 Policy makers cannot say where it all ends. News reports are unrelentingly talking of ''crisis.'' After decades of deregulation and free-market fealty, antiregulation, small-government Republicans are putting the government in control of a big chunk of the financial sector. 
 All of which has left Washington in the midst of a political convulsion that both parties are struggling to understand and turn to their advantage -- or at least keep from turning against them. 
 The capital almost had the feel of wartime. President Bush appeared in the Rose Garden and gravely appealed for bipartisanship. Democrats, starting with their presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, responded in kind. Congressional assistants spent their days glued to cable television, while across the city, people who a few days ago had few contacts with Wall Street outside of their 401(k) statements were speaking knowingly about credit-default swaps and debating the latest moves by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 But even as the realization settled in that American capitalism was going through something historic -- and not in a good way -- Washington could not escape the reality that another kind of judgment day was coming and that policy and political choices the two parties make now could weigh heavily on voters when they go to the polls in little more than six weeks.
 And voters might well wonder why perhaps a half-trillion dollars -- about the same amount spent so far in Iraq -- is suddenly available to help Wall Street when promises to address issues like health care insurance have gone largely unkept for years. 
 On the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain are now hurtling toward Election Day making up new strategies and policies on the run. On Friday, their divergent approaches were in sharp relief. Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee, ratcheted up his populist tone further and pushed ahead with his own plan to create a government trust to relieve ailing financial firms of bad mortgages. He clearly hoped to look like a leader and steal the mantle of change claimed by Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Obama struck a more cautious and bipartisan chord. Mr. Obama delayed release of his own plan's details until the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve release their blueprint. 
 ''I'm much less interested -- at this point -- in scoring political points than I am in making sure that we have a structure in place that is sound and actually going to work,'' he said at a campaign stop in Miami.
 After the cascade of financial failures and rescues in the last two weeks, what is easy to forget is how just recently the presidential election seemed to be turning on Mr. McCain's choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his vice presidential running mate, shaking up the election dynamic to elevate cultural issues and personalities alongside the economy as the focal points for the campaign. Mr. McCain's campaign manager had even said that ''this election is not about issues'' and that voters' views about the candidates would be crucial to the outcome. 
 But with Mr. McCain aggressively competing as an agent of change, he remains in a dead heat with Mr. Obama in what should be a Democratic year, given Mr. Bush's unpopularity. Ms. Palin's popularity in some Western and Southern states has lifted Congressional Republicans' hopes in some competitive but socially conservative districts and states. 
 And now, with the promised bipartisanship between the administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress to negotiate the emergency legislation to help financial institutions and many homeowners, both parties are invested in the outcome of their talks over coming weeks -- for better or worse.
 The necessity of averting a further breakdown in the markets has forced Mr. Bush to put aside ideological principles in the last few weeks, and with just four months to go until he leaves office, he has his legacy to think about. Just as in the September of his first year in office, Mr. Bush made a televised statement from the White House on Friday calling the financial crisis one of those moments ''that requires us to come together across party lines to address major challenges.'' 
 But there was no presidential election around the corner in 2001. And now, many in the United States may well be less willing to pull together if they believe Wall Street is being bailed out while average Americans are losing homes and piling up debt.
 And Democrats in Congress may also be less willing to do so. Congressional leaders have served notice that any compromise must include not only help for corporate America, but also billions of dollars more to help homeowners facing foreclosures, victims of Hurricane Ike, flooded farmers and struggling automakers and to provide states and cities with job-creating money for building roads and public works.
 Along with Mr. Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, and Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada and the Senate majority leader, will push such demands on behalf of their voters. Then Mr. McCain will have to decide whether to stand in the way of any plan that includes the ''pork'' he boasts of stopping. But the risk for all sides is to be seen as obstructing needed legislation at a time of national emergency.
 Mr. McCain on Friday was claiming to have middle-class interests at heart more than Mr. Obama. He stepped up criticism of Mr. Obama for the Democrats' ties to the former chief executives at the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government seized last week. 
 Alleging fraud and corruption at Fannie under James Johnson and Franklin Raines, both Obama supporters, Mr. McCain said, ''Senator Obama did nothing and actually profited from this system of abuse and scandal'' by accepting contributions from company employees.
 Mr. McCain even seemed to poke at Mr. Obama's image as aloof and intellectual -- like the college lecturer Mr. Obama used to be -- at a time when the Democrat is trying to connect with working-class voters. ''Maybe, just this once, he could spare us the lectures and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems,'' Mr. McCain said. 
 But Democrats and the media were quick to cite Mr. McCain's own numerous ties to former lobbyists, executives and board members of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In crisis, Mr. Obama seems to have found the more passionate voice that Democrats nervous about his working-class appeal have listened for. His challenge is to balance the need to be seen as representing average taxpayers' interests, and at the same time to rebut Mr. McCain's frequent charge that Mr. Obama has no record of working effectively across party lines. That, too, holds risks of devaluing his pledge for change. 
 In Miami, Mr. Obama pledged bipartisan cooperation with a Republican administration that he and other Democrats have blamed for the mess, standing at a lectern with the campaign sign ''Change We Need.'' He was flanked by his economic advisers -- veterans of President Bill Clinton's administration, including the former Treasury secretaries Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers.

HEADLINE: Paulson Argues for Need to Buy Mortgages

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
An enormous, taxpayer-financed program to buy up bad mortgages and other distressed debt is necessary to protect the savings and aspirations of millions of Americans, President Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said on Friday.
 ''We're talking hundreds of billions'' of dollars, Mr. Paulson said at a briefing in which he underscored the depth of the problem, pledged to work with Congress to address it quickly and voiced optimism that, in the end, the country would emerge from the financial chaos.
 Seeking to dispel any impression that the bailout would amount to a rescue of greedy Wall Street executives by Main Street Americans, Mr. Paulson said the program would ''cost Americans far less than the alternative.'' 
 Resolving the financial problems is of paramount importance, not just for major corporations and investment banks but for people who have never set foot in the corridors of corporate and political power, Mr. Paulson said. ''Their retirement savings, their home values, their ability to borrow for college'' and their chance to find and keep good jobs depend on it, he said.
 Mr. Paulson said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were recently taken under the federal government's wing, would expand their purchases of mortgage-backed securities to help ease the problems. 
 He declined to lay out specifics of the unfolding recovery program, which he said he would work on through the weekend with lawmakers so that it could be acted upon next week. But he said that the program must be well designed and ''sufficiently large'' to protect taxpayers ''to the maximum extent possible.''
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said panel members had begun addressing details of the rescue program. Until now, Mr. Shelby said in an interview on Bloomberg television, Mr. Paulson and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, ''have been jumping from crisis to crisis like putting out a brush fire.''
 Mr. Paulson described a meeting that he and other financial officials held with Congressional leaders on Thursday evening as a ''lengthy and productive working session'' on how to deal with the crisis. Although he did not elaborate on what he told the lawmakers, some members of Congress who were at the session said the secretary's remarks about the implications of the crisis left them in a stunned silence.
 Mr. Paulson said on Friday that the problems were spawned by shaky and sometimes opaque real estate investments, driven by irresponsible lenders and borrowers. Now, he said, vital streams of credit have been clogged, not just for big investors but also for families wanting to buy houses and cars and pay for tuition. 
 But if what Mr. Paulson told the lawmakers was similar to what he told the American public on Friday, he surely conveyed to them a sense of urgency, telling the legislators that the situation was too important for them to adjourn and go home to campaign, which many of them hoped to be doing by now.
 President Bush and Mr. Paulson appealed for a bipartisan approach. The president described this as ''a pivotal moment for America's economy'' and appealed to the collective resilience of the American people, which he said had sustained them over the last seven years through terrorist attacks, economic downturns and natural disasters.
 ''We will weather this challenge too, and we must do so together,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This is no time for partisanship.''
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, pledged on Friday that the House would act quickly, once it received the administration's proposal. ''As I told the president this morning, we are committed to quick, bipartisan action while ensuring that we uphold key principles -- insulating Main Street from Wall Street and keeping people in their homes by reducing mortgage foreclosures, restoring market confidence and protecting American taxpayers from incurring hundreds of billions of dollars of debt,'' Ms. Pelosi said in a statement.
 Many members of Congress were looking forward to going home next week to campaign, but Ms. Pelosi said the legislators were prepared to stay in Washington if necessary to address ''this historic crisis.'' 
 What Mr. Paulson called the ''tactical steps'' taken by the government caused the markets to shoot up on Friday morning. But deeper, long-range moves are necessary to address the causes of the crisis, he said.
 Mr. Paulson said that when the country had put the crisis behind it -- ''which we will'' -- there must be a comprehensive drive to shore up a federal regulatory structure that he called ''suboptimal, duplicative and outdated.''
 ''This is a critical debate for another day,'' Mr. Paulson said.
 President Bush acknowledged that the crisis has already stoked a debate over who was responsible for whatever regulatory lapses were at the heart of the matter.
 ''There will be ample opportunity to debate the origins of this problem,'' he said. ''Now is the time to solve it.'' 
 ''Our system of free enterprise rests on the conviction that the federal government should interfere in the marketplace only when necessary,'' the president said. ''Given the precarious state of today's financial markets -- and their vital importance to the daily lives of the American people -- government intervention is not only warranted, it is essential.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Ignites Russian Markets

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Russia's stock markets, which had been among the hardest hit by recent financial turmoil, bounced back on Friday with the help of a stimulus package from the Russian government and some rare investor-friendly comments from the country's leaders. 
 The Micex stock exchange closed up 28.69 percent and another major exchange, the RTS, closed up 22.39 percent. 
 ''We are banking on private initiative, entrepreneurial freedom, openness and rational integration with the global economy,'' the prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, told an economic forum in Sochi on Friday. Calling Russia's economy sound, Mr. Putin blamed the global financial turmoil for the country's troubles. 
 ''There are only a few countries in the world that are prepared to offer business such a wide range of opportunities,'' he said of Russia.
 It was unclear whether the response signaled any longer-term commitment to matters that have concerned investors, like weak property rights. 
 Despite the rebound on Friday, the RTS index was still down about 48 percent from its peak in May.
 On Thursday, Russian officials announced that government oil revenue would be used to bolster the stock market. They allotted $44 billion in loans to banks, lowered reserve requirements for banks to increase liquidity, lowered oil export tariffs and pledged to invest up to $20 billion in the market. 
 The two main stock markets rebounded so quickly Friday that trading was halted twice when jumps exceeded the limits. 
 Brokers said that the government was not buying actively, but that the increased liquidity in the banks and reassuring official statements had played a role. Also, a government ban on short selling aided the rebound. ''The whole package has been enough, at least in the short term, to attract money back into the Russian market,'' Roland Nash, chief analyst at Renaissance Capital, said. 
 But in a sign that the short-term fix may have a long-term price, the rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia's debt outlook to stable from positive on Friday. 
 The plan for the government to buy shares will expand the state's already sprawling involvement in the economy. In a nod to this concern, the share buyback was announced in a way intended to ''dispel fears of wider state control,'' by focusing on companies already under the government's management, like the gas monopoly Gazprom and the oil company Rosneft, Rory MacFarquhar, a Goldman Sachs economist in Moscow, said. 
 The stock market collapse began in May and accelerated in August after Russia went to war with Georgia and oil prices fell from their peak. The market fell again this week in response to the bankruptcy filing by the investment bank Lehman Brothers. 
 The Russian economy benefited from the same easy credit that inflated the housing market in the United States. The country's total foreign debt for the state, state companies and private companies is about $500 billion, and billions more are needed to rebuild crumbling Soviet-era infrastructure. 
 Russian companies will be seeking to roll over debt in a tight credit market, while also trying to convince banks that their enterprises will not fall prey to the government attacks that have toppled some big companies during Mr. Putin's administration. Political risk adds a few percentage points to borrowing costs here. 
 Oil price volatility remains the largest concern, economists said. Viewed through the lens of high commodity prices, the Russian economy appears a muscle-bound giant. But turn the telescope around, and Russia is a very diminutive and vulnerable economy. 
 The nonpetroleum sector contributes 30 percent of the federal budget and about that amount in exports. 
 Russia exports about 150 million cubic meters of natural gas and 7 million barrels of crude oil and refined products daily. At the peak price of $139.97 a barrel on July 11 this year for Ural blend crude, Russia's main export commodity, the country was taking in $1.25 billion a day in energy export revenue. Today, with Ural blend trading at $88, Russia is making $825 million a day, according to UralSib bank. That is a difference of $425 million. 
 In another sign of vulnerability, the minister of economy, Aleksei L. Kudrin, has said the federal budget will go into deficit if Ural oil prices fall below $70 a barrel next year, or $18 dollars lower than the current price. 
 ''That's what investors are worried about,'' Chris Weafer, the chief strategist at UralSib bank, said in an interview.

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, the Other No. 2 Keeps On Punching

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: FLAT ROCK, Mich. 

 BODY:
As the economy reels, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- the Other Running Mate -- has been absolutely butchering Senator John McCain across the Rust Belt this week. It is not clear who has noticed. 
 ''John is so out of touch, he just has no idea,'' charged Mr. Biden, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who called his ''old, dear friend'' someone who ''just doesn't think,'' who is behaving in a repugnant manner and who is peddling ''Republican garbage,'' and malarkey. 
 The older woman who introduced him at a rally here called Mr. Biden's Republican counterpart, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, a ''bucket of fluff,'' and he rewarded the woman as he took the microphone with an ''I love you'' and a gentle kiss on the head.
 ''If I sound angry, it's because I am angry,'' Mr. Biden told a few hundred people gathered at a high school football field. Yes, he sounds angry, yelling through his stump speeches, flailing his arms and telling a (supportive) member of the audience to ''Shush up, will you?'' (''I'm kidding,'' he added, but did not sound it.) 
 But the reality for Mr. Biden is that while running mates are second-fiddlers by definition, the phenomenon of Ms. Palin has rendered him something of a fourth or fifth fiddle. It is not like last month, when reporters swarmed Mr. Biden's Delaware home and delegates swooned at the Democratic convention. He is now trailed by just a few national reporters, and struggling to break through in a race marked by historic firsts, political celebrities and charismatic newcomers -- none named Joe Biden. 
 The Obama campaign was hoping to reintroduce Mr. Biden this week as running mate attack dog. But his penchant for verbal rambling ensured that much of the attention he drew was unwanted: he said wealthy Americans had a ''patriotic'' duty to pay more taxes, a remark the McCain campaign mocked relentlessly.
 Yet Joltin' Joe has also become a fascinating Off Broadway spectacle in his own right. He is a distinctive blend of pit bull and odd duck whose weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything -- ''gaffes,'' out-of-nowhere comments (pivoting midspeech to say ''Excuse my back!'' to people seated behind him), goofy asides (tapping a reporter's chest and telling him, ''You need to work on your pecs.'') 
 Mr. Biden's role is red-meat serious: to pulverize Mr. McCain, lend foreign policy heft to Senator Barack Obama and be his campaign's main ambassador to two at-risk constituencies: former supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and blue-collar Democrats. He speaks to working-class voters in the harsh language of their economic trials, and summons easy rage at ear-splitting volumes. 
 ''John said that the economy can have a 'psychological effect,' '' Mr. Biden said at a twilight rally in Media, Pa., on Tuesday. ''Let me tell you about the psychological effect,'' he said, describing his family's economic struggles when he was young. Mr. Biden might seem like an afterthought on the national airwaves, but he can clearly resonate close up.
 ''People got to wake up, because these guys in Washington are raping this country,'' said Dave McLimans, a steelworker from Coatesville, Pa., who attended the rally in Media. ''Joe Biden talks in a way that can wake people up.'' 
 Mr. Biden's venues are, in many cases, economically challenged areas of swing states. His crowds are up-and-down in number and enthusiasm -- some loud and in the thousands, others sleepier and small. But his reviews are generally good from voters, some who came in unconvinced about Mr. Obama. 
 ''Biden is a guy who I really believe, who really seems like he is going to help us out,'' said Sheryl Kline, a loader for the United Parcel Service who attended a rally in Maumee, Ohio. ''He sounds like someone who knows how we're struggling.''
 Despite his hard words, there is also a joy to Mr. Biden's pursuit. On Monday, he walked into a Ford plant in Macomb County, Mich., jumped behind the wheel of a red Mustang convertible and let loose with a few satisfying vroom-vrooms of the engine. 
 ''I know I'm not supposed to like muscle cars, but I like muscle cars,'' Mr. Biden said as clusters of autoworkers whooped around him. ''I tell you man, this is nice,'' he said, giving a few extra revs of the engine for good measure, and his Senate cuff links clicked on the side of the car as he jumped out to more applause.
 In an interview, he rejected any notion that his message was not being heard. ''I just don't get that, I don't see any evidence of that,'' he said in the back office of the Maumee Elks Lodge.
 He barely mentions the Alaska governor in speeches; in the interview, he described her as ''a very attractive political personality'' who can ''really deliver a political message.''
 Mr. Biden, 65, has been part of the national political furniture for decades. Like most senators, he thought he could be president, and he made runs for the job twice. Then Mr. Obama picked him for a job he said he never wanted. 
 Mr. Biden retains his regal senatorial bearing even in gritty settings of the campaign trail. On Wednesday, he wore a pressed blue blazer with a hanky folded smartly into the breast pocket. His skin is perma-tanned, and his smile is shiny white. He has his own big entourage now -- own bus, own plane. He conveys the giddy sense of a man who has won a political lottery, or been plucked from an elite purgatory.
 In Mansfield, Ohio, on Thursday, Mr. Biden made an improvisational stop at a diner, shook a bunch of hands and walked out into the sun holding a vanilla ice cream cone. ''I'm dripping here, man,'' Mr. Biden said to a well-wisher as he headed across the street to a carousel. 
 ''Am I too old to get on it?'' he asked no one in particular, then headed back to his campaign bus. 
 ''Anyone need a ride?'' he asked some people standing nearby. ''I've got a nice bus.''
 Mr. Biden's tone turns somber when he discusses Mr. McCain, a colleague of over two decades. The tenor of this campaign has tested a friendship that has been close even by Senate standards, where everyone claims to be ''my good friend.'' 
 ''That guy I used to know, he's gone,'' Mr. Biden said of Mr. McCain at the campaign event in Maumee, shaking his head. ''It literally saddens me,'' added Mr. Biden, who tends to used the word ''literally'' about a dozen times per speech (literally).
 Mr. Biden recalls that after Mr. McCain came under heavy attack from George W. Bush in the 2000 race for the Republican presidential nomination, he called Mr. McCain and offered to ''go anywhere in the country and testify to his character.'' Now, Mr. Biden asserts, Mr. McCain has embraced the same tactics he once criticized. 
 ''I tried to talk to John,'' Mr. Biden said in the interview. When both men were at Columbia University last week on the Sept. 11 anniversary, Mr. Biden had a staff member try to arrange a dressing-room visit with Mr. McCain. But Mr. Biden was told not to come, he said. 
 ''I walked down anyway,'' Mr. Biden said. ''And who the hell is going to stop me?'' Mr. McCain looked up and was ''like, what is this about?'' Mr. Biden said. Mr. McCain hugged Mr. Biden's wife, Jill, and the two senators shared a quick handshake, but there was no time for any discussion. 
 Leaving the Elks Lodge in Maumee this week, Mr. Biden threw his arms around volunteers, posed for photos, and said hewas flattered about the attention.
 ''Remember, no one decides who they're going to vote for based on the vice president,'' he said. ''I mean that literally.''

HEADLINE: After Ike, Sizing Up Another Kind of Storm

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
AS the financial storm on Wall Street intensified last weekend into Category 5 territory, James J. Schiro, 62, chief executive of Zurich Financial Services, a global insurance-based financial services provider, had his eye on another catastrophic event: Hurricane Ike. 
 In a phone interview from corporate headquarters in Zurich on Friday, Mr. Schiro spoke about the aftermath of both storms as well as a new branding campaign the company is to introduce on Monday, ''Delivering When It Really Matters.'' Following are excerpts: 
 Q. The financial world as we know it changed drastically the last few weeks. Can you, a Brooklyn native and graduate of St. John's University, share how you viewed the unfolding crisis from Zurich?
 A. I think these are interesting and challenging times, not just for somebody from Brooklyn but the entire global arena. You see how many of these business models have changed so dramatically in a relatively short period of time.
 Q. In two weeks, the United States government has bailed out Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and A.I.G. Now it hopes to once and for all clean up the financial system. Do you believe the United States government has gone too far or not far enough?
 A. My focus right now is on the position of Zurich. Zurich went through a very troubled time in 2002 where we addressed many of the issues in preparing ourselves to be able to operate throughout the business cycles in markets like this. Having been in business over 30 years, one can look at different crises that the government and the economy have faced and the different tools that were used. I think the question is, How do you manage in these environments and what tools do you use from central banks and other tools to stabilize the market? But obviously we're in period of unprecedented times.
 Q. How fast did the ripples of this global crisis reach Zurich? Will this change how Zurich does business? If so, how?
 A. First, you have to realize that when you say ''how fast?'' with events like this, it's instantaneous. The markets are open 24 hours a day, data and information are speeding around the world. How does it affect how we do business? We have got ourselves focused on serving customers as part of the brand launch, making sure we have strong balance sheets, we have liquidity. We have to make sure we're there for our customers and also for our industry to provide the protection that they need. In many ways, today, this is business as usual for us.
 Q. But it must have been a nerve-racking week.
 A. Sure, it was a nerve-racking week. It is always nerve-racking. A couple of years ago, we had Katrina. This past week, we had Ike. One also has to think of the devastation that it has brought to Texas. Our claims people on the ground, they're making sure we are helping our customers get their lives back together as well.
 Q. In the United States, people might be more familiar with your subsidiary Farmers.
 A. We have a management company that runs the Farmers Insurance Company, which sells personal insurance. We also have the second-largest commercial business, Zurich North America, which provides large global corporate and commercial insurance. We're No. 2 to A.I.G.
 Obviously, we share a lot of clients. Many of our clients are concerned about what's happening. We have to make sure we're there for them with the strength of our balance sheet and helping them with their needs in this difficult time. We went from a profit in 2002 of $1.1 billion to profit of $6.6 billion in 2007. 
 Q. To what extent was Zurich Financial part of the conversation for possible solutions this week?
 A. We were not part of discussions around it. I think people have to look at A.I.G. It is a great company, a great insurance franchise. You have to look at the impact that this has on the employees. I am very sympathetic. One should not celebrate or try to capitalize on the sorrows of others. But we have an obligation during this time to make sure that we're there to support our companies and to make sure we're there to support our customers or potential customers.
 Q. What did you do as the Lehman and A.I.G. crises were unfolding?
 A. My focus over the weekend was watching Ike. I was on the phone a lot with our people at Farmers and North America to make sure our claims people were in place to be responsive to the needs of the customers and to be on the ground there.
 Q. You have confirmed that Zurich has exposure to Lehman and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. How much, and how worrisome is it?
 A. We have a $200 billion investment portfolio. We have to look at the way we manage our investments. It was an immaterial exposure relative to the size of that investment to both Lehman and Freddie and Fannie and A.I.G.
 Q. You recently completed an ambitious customer research project. Could you talk about that?
 A. It's based on the research. It will be seen in 140 countries. Really, the focus is on HelpPoint, providing tangible examples of how we deliver what really matters to the customers.
 We interviewed 39,000 customers across all businesses. We find that customers generally are negative about this industry. Less than roughly 15 percent of the customers believe the business does well. I think customers are looking for us to be more transparent, reliable and, obviously, they've considered their individual circumstances. As an industry, we have to do a better job. We've been striving to do a better job.

HEADLINE: Issues Women Care About

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Gov. Palin's Worldview'' (editorial, Sept. 13): 
 Gov. Sarah Palin was presumably brought onto the Republican ticket to attract women's votes. But we have heard little from her about some of the issues that matter most to women in the United States and reflect the reality of their lives. 
 For example, one out of eight women in the United States lives in poverty. Women disproportionately receive subprime mortgages. Women also hold more minimum wage jobs (68 percent) than men. Half of the work force, of which women make up 48 percent, does not have not one single paid sick day.
 We need to hear how Ms. Palin plans to develop policies that will enable women to lead successful, productive lives and how she will foster an economy that works for everyone. 
 Although some claim that her nomination is a breakthrough, at this point we need to ask whether it is more of a setback for women in the United States.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 370 Points as U.S. Plans Financial Rescue Package

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and GRAHAM BOWLEY; David Stout, John M. Broder, Michael Cooper, Jeff Zeleny and Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Bush administration began discussions with Congress on Friday to hammer out an extraordinary plan to rescue banks and financial institutions by having the government buy up a big share of the nation's vast mortgage market.
 In response to the news, markets around the world shot up, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up about 370 points.
 The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., offered few details about the proposal on Friday, but he made it clear that the price tag could easily be $500 billion. Outside experts predicted that the bill could exceed $1 trillion. 
 And while Democratic leaders pledged to try to pass a plan in Congress next week, they also demanded that the plan provide relief to deeply indebted homeowners as well as to the banks and Wall Street firms that lent them the money.
 At the White House, President Bush tried to explain to Main Street America why it was being called on to bail out Wall Street. The problem has led to an erosion of confidence that has frozen many financial transactions, ''including loans to consumers and to businesses seeking to expand and create jobs,'' he said. ''As a result, we must act now to protect our nation's economic health from serious risk.''
 The Federal Reserve and the Treasury continued efforts on Friday to intervene in the frozen credit markets. They deployed additional tens of billions of dollars to prevent an investor panic and flight from the nation's money-market mutual funds. Money-market funds, totaling some $3 trillion that are held by tens of millions of individuals and traditionally considered as safe as bank deposits, had come under pressure in recent days as investors began to pull money out faster than the funds could sell of assets.
 The Fed announced that it would lend money to money-market funds in order to make certain they could meet all the demands of investors without having to sell assets -- including mortgage-backed securities -- at fire sale prices.
 The Treasury Department, in a coordinated announcement, said it would use $50 billion in the government's Exchange Stabilization Fund, a fund normally reserved to deal with currency imbalances, to insure money-market fund customers from losses. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for its part, temporarily banned short selling, a bet that a company's shares will decline.
 But even amid pledges of bipartisan cooperation, the political obstacles remained high. One is simply the matter of time: Congress is set to adjourn at the end of next week, and it is being asked to approve a plan involving more money than any single program in history.
 Eventually, the bailout proposal could result in the most direct commitment of taxpayer funds so far in the financial crisis that Fed and Treasury officials say is the worst they have ever seen.
 Senior aides and lawmakers said the goal was to complete the legislation that would grant new authority to the administration and require what several officials said would be a substantial appropriation of federal dollars. 
 Democrats, having a desire for a second round of stimulus aid to help struggling Americans, see the administration's request as a way to win White House approval of the new spending in exchange for support for the Treasury request. Democrats also say they will push for relief for homeowners faced with foreclosure. 
 The proposed fix does not envision creation of a quasi-government body like the Resolution Trust Corporation, which bought up and eventually sold hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of real estate in the 1990s from failed savings and loan companies. 
 Instead, officials at the White House, Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve want existing government entities to become a securities buyer of last resort. It is a more open-ended commitment, in part because the problem crosses international borders and its scope is as yet unknown.
 The bailout discussions began on a day when the Federal Reserve poured almost $300 billion into global credit markets and barely put a dent in the level of alarm. 
 Hoping to shore up confidence with a show of financial shock and awe, the Federal Reserve stunned investors before dawn on Thursday by announcing a plan to provide $180 billion to financial markets through lending programs operated by the European Central Bank and the central banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and Switzerland.
 But after an initial sense of relief swept markets in Asia and Europe, the fear quickly returned. Tensions remained so high that the Federal Reserve had to inject an extra $100 billion, in two waves of $50 billion each, just to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at the Fed's goal of 2 percent. 
 None of those actions, however, brought much catharsis or relief, with banks around the world remaining too frightened to lend to each other, much less to their customers. This forced Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke to think the unthinkable: committing taxpayer money to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in distressed assets from struggling institutions. 
 The reaction from the presidential candidates came quickly Friday. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, in a speech in Florida offered his support of a plan to give the Treasury Department the ''broad authority as necessary to stabilize markets and maintain credit,'' but he said any rescue plan also should include help for working families. 
 Mr. Obama, after meeting with economic advisers, stopped short of outlining proposals to resolve the crisis. He said that any government rescue needed to protect taxpayers.
 In Green Bay, Wis., the Republican candidate, Senator John McCain gave a few new details of his proposals in a speech that seemed as much a political shot at Mr. Obama as a policy prescription. Mr. McCain has criticized the S.E.C., saying that it had allowed ''speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino.''
 On Thursday, he said the new institution he proposed -- the Mortgage and Financial Institutions Trust -- would differ from similar agencies because it would not wait for financial institutions to become insolvent before offering help.
 Mr. McCain painted Mr. Obama as being beholden to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the loan giants that were taken over by the federal government, by virtue of the campaign contributions he took from them and his ties to their former leaders.

HEADLINE: Mayor Backs Democrat In S.I. Congressional Race

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Adding his weight to a hotly partisan race, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Friday endorsed City Councilman Michael E. McMahon for the Congressional seat on Staten Island now held by Representative Vito J. Fossella.
 In endorsing Mr. McMahon, the mayor dealt a blow to the campaign of former Assemblyman Robert A. Straniere, the Republican candidate. Mr. Straniere, who has had strained relationships with Republican elected officials on the island, had been hoping that the mayor, an independent, would endorse him -- or at least stay out of the race.
 ''Staten Island and southern Brooklyn need a strong voice in Congress to get results in transportation, health care and the economy,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement released on Friday afternoon. 
 ''He's delivered during his seven years on the City Council, and I know he'll work just as hard in Washington,'' Mr. Bloomberg said of Mr. McMahon. ''I am proud to endorse Mike McMahon for Congress, and urge all of the voters of Staten Island and southern Brooklyn to send him to Washington this November.''
 The mayor and Mr. McMahon have had a close relationship, and Mr. Bloomberg was a contributor to Mr. McMahon's 2001 campaign for the City Council. Indeed, Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, is married to the councilman's brother, Thomas L. McMahon, a former legal counsel to the City Council. Mr. McMahon also supported the mayor's congestion pricing plan.
 The race in the 13th Congressional District, which includes all of Staten Island and portions of Brooklyn, is one of the hardest-fought in the city in this election season. The Democrats are eager to win a seat that has been in Republican hands for decades.
 Even before Mr. McMahon won last week's Democratic primary, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pledged to work on his behalf, as have a number of prominent Democratic officials.
 Mr. Fossella is the only Republican to represent New York City in Congress, and Republican leaders have been eager to hold the seat. However, they have faced a number of problems since Mr. Fossella decided in May not to seek a sixth term. Mr. Fossella was arrested that month on drunken-driving charges in a Virginia suburb of Washington. Soon after, he acknowledged that he had fathered a daughter in an extramarital affair. 
 Reacting to the endorsement, Mr. Straniere said he considered it an act of loyalty that Mr. Bloomberg, a Democrat turned Republican turned independent, would support Mr. McMahon.
 ''I understand that Mike McMahon voted for every increase in taxes that the mayor requested,'' Mr. Straniere said. ''So it's not particularly surprising to me. And I also understand the family relationship between the mayor and the McMahons.''
 When asked if he was disappointed, Mr. Straniere said: ''Well, you'd like to be endorsed by as many people as you can. But the mayor would have had to overlook my dislike of tax increases in order to have endorsed me.''
 Mr. McMahon's reaction, not surprisingly, was far more upbeat.
 ''Mayor Bloomberg has set a new standard for what New Yorkers should expect from their leaders,'' Mr. McMahon said in a statement. ''Together, we've worked to bring home real results for New Yorkers, and I'm honored to have his endorsement to continue that work in Washington.''
 Mr. Bloomberg has immersed himself in a number of local races this year, particularly in the Democratic primary. He endorsed Daniel L. Squadron in his successful challenge to longtime State Senator Martin Connor and City Councilman Simcha Felder, who lost a bid to unseat State Senator Kevin S. Parker. The mayor also endorsed Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat, who won his primary.
 It was the second major endorsement by a non-Democrat for Mr. McMahon. Shortly after the primary, the councilman was endorsed by the Staten Island borough president, James P. Molinaro, a longtime official of the state Conservative Party who also ran for his own office on the Republican line.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
9 P.M. (BBC America) PRIMEVAL The Season 2 premiere finds Cutter (Douglas Henshall, above) returned to a world almost the same as the one he left, but not quite. Claudia (Lucy Brown) has been wiped from everyone's memory and replaced by the slimy Oliver Leek (Karl Theobald), and the team is now based in a futuristic-looking headquarters called the ARC.

HEADLINE: As Fingers Point in the Financial Crisis, Many of Them Are Aimed at Bush

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For his entire presidency, George W. Bush has tried to avoid the fate of his father, brought low by a feeble economy. Now, as the financial crisis radiates far beyond Wall Street, Mr. Bush faces an even grimmer prospect: being blamed, at least in part, for an economic breakdown.
 ''There will be ample opportunity to debate the origins of this problem,'' Mr. Bush said in the Rose Garden on Friday. ''Now is the time to solve it.''
 But in Washington, on Wall Street and on the presidential campaign trail, the debate has already begun. 
 Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, denounces what he calls the Bush administration's ''failed philosophy.''
 Senator John McCain, the Republican, claimed Friday that ''the administration did nothing'' to rein in the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, even though the White House did push some reforms on Capitol Hill. 
 And while economists and other experts say there are plenty of culprits -- Democrats and Republicans in Congress, the Federal Reserve, an overzealous home-lending industry, banks and also Mr. Bush's predecessor, Bill Clinton -- they do agree that the Bush administration bears part of the blame.
 These experts, from both political parties, say Mr. Bush's early personnel choices and overarching antipathy toward regulation created a climate, that, if it did not set off the turmoil, almost certainly aggravated it.
 The president's first two Treasury secretaries, for instance, lacked the kind of Wall Street expertise that might have helped them raise red flags about the use of complex financial instruments that are at the heart of the crisis.
 To his credit, Mr. Bush accurately foresaw the danger posed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and began calling as early as 2002 for greater regulation. But experts say the administration could have done even more to curb excesses in the housing market, and much more to police Wall Street, which transmitted those problems around the world.
 Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute here, said that, in retrospect, ''it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the F.D.I.C.'' -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- ''to look at these issues more closely.''
 He said it would also have helped ''for Congress to have held hearings.''
 Instead, voices inside the administration for tougher policing of Wall Street found themselves with few supporters. William H. Donaldson, a former Wall Street executive with respected Republican credentials who became chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Mr. Bush, quit after facing resistance from the White House and Republican members of the agency, who criticized his support for stiffer regulations on mutual funds and hedge funds.
 Today, even some sympathetic to Mr. Bush say he cannot disentangle himself from a home-lending industry that ran amok or a banking industry that mortgaged its future on toxic loans.
 ''The crisis definitely happened on their watch,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard who advises Mr. McCain. ''This is eight years into the Bush administration. There was a lot of time to deal with it.''
 To some extent, Mr. Bush was simply following a deregulatory pattern set by his predecessor, President Clinton. Perhaps the most significant recent deregulation of the banking industry -- the landmark act that allowed commercial banks to expand into other financial activities, like investment banking and insurance -- was signed into law by Mr. Clinton in 1999.
 Mr. Bush also inherited a culture of borrowing and a frothy housing market that has become ''deeply embedded in the American psyche,'' Mr. Rogoff said.
 And Mr. Reinhart said the markets seemed to be doing so well that few analysts, either in government or the private sector, had a critical eye. ''When everybody is doing better,'' he said, ''it is difficult to see the underlying weaknesses.''
 Still, the White House, in the view of critics, fostered a free-market hothouse in which these excesses were able to flower. It avoided regulation of banks and mortgage brokers, leaving much of that work to the Federal Reserve, which, under Alan Greenspan, showed little appetite for regulation.
 By the time Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed an overhaul of regulations governing the financial sector in April, the storm was already brewing.
 The administration's push to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was stymied by Congress. But the administration's intense focus on fending off what it foresaw as a looming housing crisis did not include an effort to curb the proliferation of fiendishly complex mortgage-backed securities, said Harvey S. Rosen, an economist who served on Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, briefly as chairman.
 ''Maybe there should have been'' such an effort, Mr. Rosen said. ''But we were focused more on the fact that if these entities just held plain-vanilla mortgage-backed securities, it was still a disaster in the making.''
 Beyond the administration's deregulatory bent, some economists argue that its fiscal and tax policies made the United States more dependent on foreign capital, which inflated the bubble in housing prices.
 ''A different Treasury would have taken a different approach,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. ''I don't think the economy has been well managed, and that has certainly been crucial for the problems we're facing.''
 The White House and Congress wanted to make housing affordable to more Americans, and freeing up the lending markets was a way to do that. As Mr. Rogoff said: ''It was a market-based way to help poor people. There was an incredible belief in free markets.''
 For all that faith, Mr. Bush's first two Treasury secretaries, Paul H. O'Neill and John W. Snow, came from top jobs in industry, not Wall Street. They were viewed in Washington as advocating the interests of business, and being less comfortable with the mysteries of markets.
 Neither was seen as having much influence with the White House, and the Treasury Department lost some of the primacy in economic policy it had enjoyed under Mr. Summers and his predecessor, Robert E. Rubin.
 Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Snow declined to be interviewed for this article.
 ''The primary agency responsible for keeping an eye on these things is, and should be, the Treasury Department, and I think the president erred in the first place by appointing two secretaries who had no background in finance,'' said Bruce R. Bartlett, a Republican economist who worked for President Ronald Reagan and President George H. W. Bush.
 The White House did name people well versed in the markets to other posts, not least the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But Mr. Bush's first S.E.C. chairman -- Harvey L. Pitt, a prominent securities lawyer -- was brought down by political missteps. Mr. Pitt was succeeded by Mr. Donaldson, who quit in 2005.
 Critics say the S.E.C. has been less active under its current chairman, Christopher Cox, a former Republican congressman from California. It has spent less on enforcement and imposed less in fines on wrongdoers, according to the Government Accountability Office. This week, Mr. McCain called for Mr. Cox's resignation.
 In other areas, the Bush administration'sfailures seem more a case of inaction. The administration, economists said, did little to curb the practices of mortgage brokers, who are regulated by the states. But Democrats in Congress were equally to blame for this, these people said.
 ''The Democrats pushed affordable housing goals, even in the face of evidence that people who got the loans shouldn't have gotten them,'' said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 He added: ''I blame the Democrats for demanding that Fannie Mae keep buying these loans. I blame the administration for going along with it.''
 White House officials note that the administration did propose reforms of real estate settlement procedures and the Federal Housing Administration, two areas it had identified as posing the greatest systemic risk to markets. Democrats in Congress, they said, blocked these efforts.

HEADLINE: Uncharted Territory Led To a New Kind of Crisis

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Just over 100 years ago, J. P. Morgan gathered his fellow financiers at his Manhattan mansion amid growing financial panic and declared, ''This is where the trouble stops.''
 Last weekend, as one of the gravest crises since then accelerated, a similar conclave gathered farther downtown, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 This time, the Fed chairman and the Treasury secretary summoned the bosses of Wall Street giants including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and, yes, JPMorgan. The officials had a similar ultimatum: find an industry solution to halt the undoing of Wall Street's financial order. 
 But, different from the action that brought the successful denouement to the Panic of 1907, banks did not want to gamble their own position to prevent, in this case, the demise of Lehman Brothers. 
 The troubles did not stop: in the last five days alone, the crisis has changed in unimaginable ways, with one financial titan filing for bankruptcy protection, another agreeing to a shotgun wedding with a major bank and a third essentially being nationalized by Washington.
 And, for the moment, it looks as if only the full faith and credit of the United States government can stem the fear.
 Why did the magic wrought by J. P. Morgan (the banker, not the bank) not work this time? 
 Unlike the crisis 100 years ago, today's troubles are far more complicated and widespread. Many of the creative new instruments that financial players used to rake in money were also among the most complex ever invented -- so much so that the top managers of the institutions that profited most may not have fully understood what they owned and traded. 
 They also may not have fully grasped the speed at which their world had changed since the last financial flash point a decade ago, when the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a giant hedge fund, seemingly brought Wall Street to the brink.
 ''I consider myself a serious student of Wall Street history, but history is not going to be a lot of help here,'' said Byron Wien, a 40-year market veteran who is now chief investment strategist for Pequot Capital.
 ''The degree of complexity is so great, the products are new and untested, and the operations are now global,'' he added. ''This is Long-Term Capital on steroids.''
 In some ways, Wall Street suffers from a generation gap. At 62, Richard S. Fuld Jr., the head of Lehman Brothers, had ridden out events from the oil shocks of the 1970s to the Russian debt default and Asian economic crisis in 1998. 
 But in recent years, his firm and other Wall Street giants derived an ever-increasing share of profit from products that barely existed a decade ago, like credit-default swaps. Essentially insurance on debt, the market for credit-default swaps has ballooned to a nearly unimaginable $45.5 trillion, from $900 billion in 2001. 
 In fact, the insurance giant American International Group, which was effectively taken over by the government on Tuesday, was one of the largest players in this gargantuan market -- far bigger than Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy protection early Monday. That was a top reason why A.I.G. got an $85 billion government lifeline, while Lehman was left to fend for itself.
 James Cawley, a veteran player in the credit default swap market, doubts the full understanding of the older chiefs of the firms who profited from these products and the young traders who specialized in them. 
 ''Had they understood the implications, we wouldn't be where we are today,'' said Mr. Cawley, founder and chief executive of IDX Capital. The overriding feeling on Wall Street, he said, was, ''Let's make money while the sun shines and worry about the details later.''
 While Mr. Fuld and other chief executives bear the ultimate responsibility for their firms' fates, it would take a doctorate in mathematics to untangle the most complex of the derivatives that helped bring down Lehman or Bear Stearns this year.
 And in the boom years, the compensation of Mr. Fuld and other chief executives on Wall Street followed a similar trajectory -- higher.
 ''If you're approving things you don't understand, that's not doing your job,'' said Jonathan GS Koppell, director of the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at the Yale School of Management. ''What are these guys compensated for, if they're checking off things they don't understand?''
 To make matters worse, the financial models underpinning many of the most sophisticated new products were largely based on trading patterns from a more tranquil time, at least by historical standards.
 Because central banks largely conquered the inflation spike of the 1970s, interest rates have steadily declined, and emerging markets became more integrated in a world economy that enjoyed relatively low inflation, said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist for Deutsche Bank. 
 Despite occasional periods of volatility -- the Wall Street crash of 1987, the failure of Long-Term Capital, the bursting of the technology bubble in this decade and the economic fallout from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- the markets managed to bounce back each time.
 ''People were lulled into complacency,'' said Mr. Wien of Pequot Capital.
 Yet it was not only the veterans who were caught off guard by the risks lying in wait, but also the young lions.
 This year, a 31-year-old derivatives trader named Jerome Kerviel nearly brought down Societe Generale, the 150-year-old French financial giant, by making unauthorized bets on the stock market that cost his bank almost 5 billion euros, or $7.7 billion at that time.
 His supervisors had no idea what he had been up to, they said later.
 As Wall Street was transforming itself into a more complex place, so was the world economy, spawning new financial players in corners of the globe whose emergence generated vast new wealth. 
 This new landscape looks vastly different than only a decade ago -- not to mention when men like Mr. Fuld and his contemporaries came of age. Maurice R. Greenberg was 80 when he stepped down from A.I.G. in 2005. James E. Cayne, the former boss of Bear Stearns, is 74. 
 In earlier eras, Mr. Wien said, a stricken firm like Lehman or A.I.G. would have turned to deep-pocketed investors in the United States, or failing that, Europe.
 This time, banks are turning to the Middle East and especially Asia for capital. Lehman, the 158-year-old investment bank, entered a death spiral when the state-controlled Korea Development Bank walked away from talks to buy a stake in it.
 ''The balance of economic power has shifted out of the U.S. and Europe to the Middle East and Asia,'' Mr. Wien said.
 At the same time, significant gains in computing power allowed the creation of financial products with many more variables -- and gave individual traders like Mr. Kerviel much more power to move them at lightning speed.
 ''Twenty years ago, it was hard to accurately price a corporate bond, let alone calculate credit spreads,'' said David Munves, a managing director in the capital markets research group of Moody's, who spent 10 years at Lehman. Even in the mid-1990s, he said, bond traders would use oversize calculators at their desks to figure out yields down to one-sixteenth and one thirty-second.
 Now, he said, traders can call up databases that feature 400 fields for a single bond. Once-straightforward features like duration and yield are sliced a multitude of ways. ''As you build more complex products, you get further away from real-world events, like actually having to sell these bonds,'' he said.
 One result, said Mr. Mayer of Deutsche Bank, is that products were developed for markets that everyone assumed would be as they were then, with capital freely flowing, rational minds prevailing and fear largely in check.
 ''A generation grew up that has been very well trained in this new finance theory, very well educated to apply it on a broad scale with the necessary computing power, and off we went,'' Mr. Mayer said.
 Recent events, he said, have shown that the basic assumptions that have held sway for a generation or two no longer hold. ''This will leave us with a different paradigm,'' he added. ''If I could give it to you, I'd win the Nobel Prize.''

HEADLINE: Bush Officials Urge Swift Congressional Action on Broad Rescue Powers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Mark Landler, Carl Hulse and David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, moving to prevent an economic cataclysm, urged Congress on Friday to grant it far-reaching emergency powers to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in distressed mortgages despite many unknowns about how the plan would work.
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, made it clear that the upfront cost of the rescue proposal could easily be $500 billion, and outside experts predicted that it could reach $1 trillion.
 The outlines of the plan, described in conference calls to lawmakers on Friday, include buying assets only from United States financial institutions -- but not hedge funds -- and hiring outside advisers who would work for the Treasury, rather than creating a separate agency. Democratic leaders immediately pledged to work closely with Mr. Paulson to pass a plan in the next week, but they also demanded that the measure include relief for deeply indebted homeowners, not just for banks and Wall Street firms. 
 At the end of a week that will be long remembered for the wrenching changes it brought to Wall Street and Washington, Mr. Paulson and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told lawmakers that the financial system had come perilously close to collapse. According to notes taken by one participant in a call to House members, Mr. Paulson said that the failure to pass a broad rescue plan would lead to nothing short of disaster. Mr. Bernanke said that Wall Street had plunged into a full-scale panic, and warned lawmakers that their own constituents were in danger of losing money on holdings in ultra-conservative money market funds. 
 People involved in the discussions on Friday said that Mr. Paulson said he did not want to create a new government agency to handle the rescue plan. Rather, he said, the Treasury Department would hire professional investment managers to oversee what could be a huge portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.
 He indicated that he wanted to buy securities only from United States financial institutions, a decision that could anger legions of foreign institutions that poured hundreds of billions of dollars into the American mortgage market in the housing boom, and have customers located here.
 Basic questions remained unanswered as of Friday evening, including how much of the mortgage market the administration hoped to buy up. The broader economic questions were even more daunting. What were the dangers in letting the government borrow another $500 billion -- which ultimately might have to come from foreign investors -- at the same time the deficit was already skyrocketing?
 Would this epic bailout lead to the same kind of runaway inflation that plagued the United States throughout the 1970s?
 But as the stock market zoomed for the second day in a row, mainly in response to hopes of a sweeping bailout plan from Washington, President Bush and lawmakers alike focused on how fast they could deliver as much government help as necessary.
 ''Given the precarious state of today's financial markets -- and their vital importance to the daily lives of the American people -- government intervention is not only warranted, it is essential,'' President Bush said in a speech in the Rose Garden at the White House.
 News of the giant rescue plan sent stock markets soaring around the world. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 368 points, or 3.35 percent, on Friday, after having jumped 410 points on Thursday on early rumors of the plan. The rally erased the losses from earlier in the week and allowed stock prices to end higher for the week. Perhaps more important to Fed and Treasury officials, the credit markets showed signs of thawing as well. Yields on three-month Treasury bills had sunk to almost zero on Wednesday and Thursday as investors fled from most debt securities and poured their money into the safest and shortest-term Treasuries. But on Friday, the yield on three-month Treasuries had edged up to 0.99 percent -- still well below normal, but much closer to normal than before.
 Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and Treasury deployed additional tens of billions of dollars to prevent an investor panic and flight from the nation's money market mutual funds. Such funds, totaling $3.4 trillion in assets, are held by tens of millions of individuals and are traditionally considered as safe as bank deposits. But they had come under pressure in recent days as investors began to pull money out faster than the funds could sell assets.
 The Fed announced that it would lend money to money market funds to make certain they could meet all the demands of investors without having to sell off assets -- including mortgage-backed securities -- at fire-sale prices.
 The Treasury Department, in a coordinated announcement, said it would use $50 billion in the government's Exchange Stabilization Fund, a fund normally reserved to deal with currency imbalances, to insure money market fund customers against losses.
 While the stock market showed its euphoria, the political obstacles to resolving the financial crisis remained high. The first is simply a matter of time: Congress is set to adjourn at the end of next week, and it is being asked to approve a plan involving more money than any single program in history.
 As of Friday evening, Mr. Paulson had yet to deliver a formal plan to Congress. House and Senate leaders pledged to work through the weekend, but they insisted that Mr. Paulson bring them a detailed plan rather than just an outline. 
 An even bigger obstacle was the goal of the plan. President Bush and Mr. Paulson made it clear that their primary, and perhaps only, goal was to stabilize the financial markets by removing hundreds of billions of dollars in ''illiquid assets'' from the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions.
 ''Confidence in our financial system and its institutions is essential to the smooth operation of our economy, and recently that confidence has been shaken,'' the president said. ''We must address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets -- the mortgage assets that have lost value during the housing decline and are now restricting the flow of credit.''
 But Democratic lawmakers insisted that any plan would also have to provide relief to millions of families that were poised to lose their homes to foreclosure.
 The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said she would insist that the plan ''uphold key principles -- insulating Main Street from Wall Street and keeping people in their homes by reducing mortgage foreclosures.''
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the plan would have to include requirements that the government reduce the loan amounts or improve the terms for many distressed borrowers.
 ''We should be more willing to write down the mortgages,'' Mr. Frank said in a telephone interview on Friday. ''We'll become the lender. The government will wind up in a controlling position so that we can reduce the number of foreclosures.''
 Democrats also plan to push to include another economic stimulus measure that could provide extra money for Medicaid, highways and public work projects. Republican leaders quickly warned Democrats against trying to use the emergency to extract other gains.
 ''Loading it up to score political points or fit a partisan agenda will only delay the economic stability that families, seniors and small businesses deserve,'' said Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader.
 In the conference calls with lawmakers, Mr. Bernanke said that the critical need was to have the government unclog the financial system by taking over unsellable assets -- primarily securities tied to bad mortgages -- so that financial institutions could resume normal business. Without action, Mr. Bernanke warned, the panic would quickly lead to a deep and extended recession.
 In a briefing to reporters on Friday morning, Mr. Paulson said administration officials would try to lift the overall mortgage market by having the Treasury Department immediately start buying mortgage-backed securities on the open market. 
 The Treasury Department had already announced plans to buy $5 billion worth of securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as part of its bailout of those two government-sponsored mortgage companies earlier this month. But Mr. Paulson plans to step up the Treasury's buying, a move reminiscent of the Japanese government's attempt to prop up Japan's stock market by buying shares.
 In addition, Mr. Paulson said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be pushed to buy more mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Because the government has seized both companies and put them into a conservatorship, policy makers have direct control over their activities.
 Congressional officials said that they expected to get copies of a written proposal from the Treasury Department either late Friday or Saturday morning at a meeting on Capitol Hill between Treasury and Congressional staff members.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said that he was eagerly awaiting the administration's plan. ''I am anxious to see what they are going to offer and what tolerance level there is for things we feel a need to include if they don't include it themselves,'' Mr. Dodd said in an interview.

 IRAN'S CHIEF CLERIC SAYS
 Country Is Not a Friend to Israelis
 Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme religious leader, rejected the notion that his country was a friend to the Israeli people, and called on critics of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to stop using the issue to undermine him. His comments appeared to be a fresh sign of support for Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has come under increasing pressure for remarks by his vice president for tourism who said last month that Iran was a friend of the Israeli people. PAGE A7
 NORTH KOREA HARDENS ITS STANCE
 In a move that bodes ill for Washington's efforts to keep a North Korean nuclear complex disabled, North Korea said that it no longer wished to be removed from the United States' terrorism blacklist. The move signals a hardening of the country's stance amid reports that its leader may be seriously ill. PAGE A9 
 CRISIS HITS A SLUMPING FRANCE
 France's economy was in a slump even before it was hit by the fallout from the crisis on Wall Street. But now things could become worse for the country, which is battling high rates of inflation. President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has openly admired America's freer markets and less restrictive regulation, is to give a major economic address to reassure the nation. PAGE A9
 GATES CALLS FOR PRAGMATISM
 In a speech to a British strategic studies group, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates challenged Western powers to avoid the past mistakes of lurching between excessive military resolve and excessive restraint, as the world faced threats from a resurgent Russia, violent Islamic extremism and rogue leaders seeking nuclear arms. ''We must try to prevent situations where we have only two bleak choices: confrontation or capitulation, 1914 or 1938,'' he said. PAGE A8
 IRAQIS PROTEST CIVILIAN DEATHS
 At least seven people were killed during an American raid and airstrike on a northern Iraqi town that was aimed at a senior operative of Al Qaeda in Iraq. Americans say the raid succeeded in killing its target, but Iraqi officials said the strike had used excessive force in killing eight members of one family, who the officials said were innocent. They accused the Americans of shooting civililians from the air as they fled. PAGE A7
 SOUTH AFRICA'S LEADER ON THE BRINK
 The presidency of Thabo Mbeki of South Africa could reach its premature end, as members of his party's national executive committee met to decide whether to ask the leader to resign before his term expires next year. The South African news media discussed what would happen if a request for him to resign was refused: would he face a vote of no confidence in Parliament or an effort to impeach him? PAGE A8

 IN GALVESTON, UNCERTAIN ROAD
 To Business as Usual
 Galveston Island has lived off the bounty of the Gulf of Mexico for two centuries. But if the Gulf has always been an economic engine for the island, it has also loomed as a meteorological threat. In 1900, the island was leveled by a hurricane that killed 6,000 people remains the nation's deadliest natural disaster. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, business leaders in Galveston are again facing a familiar question: when -- or perhaps whether -- Galveston will return to a semblance of itself. PAGE A10
 TRAIN AND BUS COLLIDE 
 Fifteen passengers suffered minor injuries when the light-rail train they were riding in Los Angeles collided with a passenger bus, one week after a deadly crash between a commuter train and freight train in a northern district of the city. A preliminary report by the sheriff's deputies suggested that the bus operator ran a traffic signal as the light-rail train, carrying about 250 people, was leaving the station. PAGE A11
 DETROIT SWEARS IN NEW MAYOR
 As workers finished restoring the Spirit of Detroit, the statue outside City Hall whose uplifting silhouette graces official business cards and letterhead, a new era began 12 floors above with the swearing in of an interim mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., a former City Council president, who promised to remove the tarnish of his predecessor's scandal. PAGE A16
 FINDINGS ON DOCTORS AND DRUGS
 A new study has found that doctors are rarely criminally prosecuted or punished in connection with the prescribing of narcotic painkillers. In recent years, the issue has become amplified because of several highly publicized prosecutions of doctors accused of selling narcotics like OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin or recklessly prescribing them.

 CITY BUILDERS UNHAPPY
 With New Regulations for Cranes
 The city's Buildings Department gave new requirements to high-rise concrete contractors for the erection, dismantling and raising of tower cranes. But industry officials said the measures, the latest in a series designed to improve crane safety after a rash of accidents, would hamper building in the city by putting as many as 2,400 union laborers out of work and complained that the agency designed them without any consultation with builders.

 IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC CRISIS,
 A Series of Bold, Unsure Moves
 Joe Nocera writes that the solutions that have been offered by the government to stop the bleeding on Wall Street are scattershot, which suggests that when it comes to the economic crisis, Washington is just as confused as everyone else. ''So rather than help solve the crisis,'' he writes, ''the Treasury Department has actually contributed to the biggest problem in the market right now: an utter lack of confidence.'' PAGE B1 STIMULUS BOLSTERS RUSSIAN MARKETS
 Russia's stock market had been especially hard hit over the last week, but a stimulus package from the Russian government helped stocks bounce back. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin also issued some investor-friendly comments to help assuage fears. ''There are only a few countries in the world that are prepared to offer business such a wide range of opportunities,'' he said of Russia. PAGE B4
 FOR JAPANESE, TURMOIL IS HO-HUM
 If you only looked at Japanese markets or news reports, you would never know the rest of the world was trying to weather the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Tokyo has been relatively unscathed by the uncertainty gripping New York and London. It is the kind of idiosyncrasy and insularity that has long defined the world's second-largest economy, where the problem for years has been that the nation's banks have too much cash, not too little.

 UPSTART ACTORS GROUP WINS VOTE
 A dissident group of actors won a victory in a closely watched election by the Screen Actors Guild, but it did not have much effect on the long-stalled contract negotiations with the major Hollywood studios. The dissidents have the backing of several big-name stars including Tom Hanks, and won 6 of the 11 open seats on the guild's Hollywood division. The group is calling for a merger between the 120,000-member guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a smaller union with 70,000 members. PAGE B2

 CHOOSING IVY-COVERED HALLS
 Over Roaring Crowds
 Josh Meyers, a blue-chip linebacker recruit, was offered scholarships from 30 schools, including a slew of top-flight football programs. But Meyers, who also boasted a 4.4 weighted grade point average, a penchant for composing electronic music, and his standing as a top-flight lacrosse recruit, opted for Princeton. As such, his college football debut this weekend against the Citadel will be decidedly more low-key than many around him would have imagined. PAGE B12
 LOTS OF MEMORIES, LOTS OF SECURITY
 The Yankees have arranged to have 2,000 security workers on hand at the team's final two games at Yankee Stadium this weekend to prevent anyone from stealing parts of the stadium, which is set to be razed in November, as mementos. ''Our promotion for this weekend is that if you have a ticket to get in, we will have a police officer with you,'' said Lonn A. Trost, the team's chief operating officer for the Yankees. PAGE B11
 HE'S ABSENT, BUT HIS VOICE CARRIES
 Bob Sheppard, who has been the Yankees public address announcer since opening day in 1951, will miss the closing of Yankee Stadium, as he has the entire season fighting an illness.

 HIRST'S POCKETS JUST GOT HEAVIER
 And He's Got the Critics to Prove It
 So, on the road to earning lots of money and fame, did Damien Hirst shift the dynamic of the art world? Opinions swarmed like flies over a carcass this week, when Mr. Hirst's work on auction at Sotheby's pulled down $200 million to the sound of anguished critics and the ka-ching of cash registers. His success elicited the familiar cries about ethics and selling out, writes Roberta Smith. Page A21 
 NEW YORK CITY BALLET IN PARIS
 The New York City Ballet reached the end of its two-week season in Paris at the Bastille Opera House, where they were hosted by the Paris Opera troupe. The troupe has played to nothing but full houses. At a special gala event a splendidly attired audience was there to mingle, and help pay for the season. A staid audience to be sure, and while the dancers might have deserved better, the partnership of the two troupes was a treat alone. Page A26 
 WHEN STARS SHINE ON PUBLIC TV
 What do you get when you mix food writer Mark Bittman, the chef Mario Batali and Gwyneth Paltrow? If you screamed ''roadtrip,'' you're right. The three will embark on the public television show:''Spain...On the Road,'' in which they tour sights both food-related and not. Ms. Paltrow's addition to the show gives it a celebrity boost, possibly reaching a wider audience, or so the publicity push would suggest. Page A23

 BOOK REVIEW
 Is it surprising that Philip Roth, now 75, has just published his third novel in three years? Perhaps not: Roth has been burning up the track for well over a decade now, writing eight novels, including two general-consensus masterworks, since 1995. And with ''Indignation,'' set during the Korean War in a small, conservative Ohio college, Roth's power and intensity seem undiminished, David Gates writes. PAGE 1 
 THE MAGAZINE
 One measure of an idea's greatness is how obvious it seems in retrospect. So it is with Unigo.com, a free, gigantic, student-generated guide to North American colleges for prospective applicants and their families. The Web site, created by Jordan Goldman, who graduated from Wesleyan in 2004, went live this month for the benefit of tens of thousands of trepidatious high school students as they try to figure out where and how to go to college.

 Some said China would be the death of Hong Kong. But more than a decade on, the island metropolis is, as Pankaj Mishra discovers, more brazen and relevant than ever. In the last two years, the city has surpassed New York and rivals London as the world's biggest market for initial public stock offerings. How will the city, freshly and profoundly dependent on China, define itself? PAGE 112

 The most recent generation of strivers on Wall Street arrived in a New York boomtown: money was seemingly being minted in the hedge-fund and private-equity sectors; investment banks were paying gigantic bonuses. But now, thousands of layoffs loom as the industry shrinks and consolidates. ''The party's over,'' said Delilah Rothenberg, 25, who now works at a private equity firm in Manhattan. PAGE 1

 The Old Wang Beef Noodle Soup King is hidden in plain sight, popular but light-years from trendy, surprisingly accessible and instantly enjoyable. In other words, it is the perfect metaphor for Taipei, the Chinese city in which it is located. And food is one arena where Taipei blows Beijing away, Matt Gross writes. PAGE 1 
 WEEK IN REVIEW
 The past week, by any standard, has been an extraordinary one for the American economy and the financial system. Yet for all the superlatives, there is still something historically typical about what is happening. For as long as markets have existed, speculative bubbles have formed. And whenever one of those bubbles has grown especially large, it has ended up causing enormous damage, David Leonhardt writes. PAGE 1

HEADLINE: Marshall Sahlins on Leslie A. White

 BODY:
In the pre-'60s at the University of Michigan, rebellion consisted of listening gleefully to the anthropologist Leslie White going mano a mano with God. White was one of those maverick intellectuals and politicians, like Thorstein Veblen, Charles Beard and Robert La Follette, who came out of the rural American heartland to off the pieties-and powers-that-be. Some of these intellectuals were village atheists from the beginning. Others, like White, only shook off the idiocies of rural life when they went to the city and the university. 
 We never knew White was a member of the Socialist Labor Party in the '30s and early '40s, contributing articles to The Weekly People under the name John Steel. Nor could you have guessed from his so-Americanized version of Marxism: a theory of cultural evolution based singularly on technological progress. Progress in the Neolithic, he claimed, came from the increase in the amount of energy harnessed per capita because of plant and animal domestication. He was not amused when I objected that energy ''per capita'' was the same as in the Old Stone Age, since the primary mechanical source remained the human body.
 On the other hand, I have never repudiated White's concept of culture as a thoroughly symbolic phenomenon. I never tired of repeating his dictum that no ape can appreciate the difference between holy water and distilled water -- because there is none, chemically speaking. That, for me, resolved the contradiction in his own teaching and that of the many human scientists who separate culture from practical activity, as if the symbolic dimension of economic behavior were an afterthought of the material. The ''economic basis'' of society is culturally constructed. Even our supposedly ''rational choices'' are based on another, meaningful logic that, for example, makes steak a more prestigious food than hamburger, or women's clothes different in significant ways from men's. It turns out that materialism is a form of idealism, because it's wrong, too.

HEADLINE: Cast in 'Survivor,' the Wall Street Edition

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
BEFORE Nicole Wong took a job as an analyst at JPMorgan Chase after graduating from Brown University in 2001, she wasn't exactly sure what one did every day as a junior financier -- or, in New York mythology, apprentice master of the universe. 
 ''I really entered the industry not knowing what the heck people did,'' she recalled. But that hardly seemed to matter.
 To her, Wall Street, not law or medicine, was where the action was, she said. Inspired by images of power and prestige from books like ''Liar's Poker'' and movies like ''Wall Street,'' a life scrambling up the rungs of the financial services ladder seemed like an adventure as much as a vocation.
 And for a time, that's just what it was. Days spent surrounded by multimillion-dollar trades were followed by lavish nights spent entertaining clients at hot restaurants like Nobu. 
 It was a challenging but exhilarating life, ''and somebody else was picking up the tab,'' said Ms. Wong, 28. ''I guess if I came from a wealthier background it wouldn't have been so dazzling. But to me, this was so glamorous. This is why I moved to New York.''
 And, yes, the money was good.
 But after the seismic disruptions in the financial sector last week, she is not sure the Wall Street life will be quite the same any time soon, if ever.
 ''The business is going to change,'' said Ms. Wong, whose position selling mortgage-backed securities for UBS was eliminated in the spring. ''There are just going to be far fewer people doing this, and far fewer clients to take out. Even if you do have clients to take out, you're not going to be spending as much out. This is definitely going to suck the fun out of the industry.'' 
 And perhaps not only the fun. 
 The most recent generation of strivers on Wall Street -- those in their 20s -- are too young to remember the last recession and too new to the business world to have experienced the dot-com bust or the post-9/11 gloom. They arrived in a New York boomtown: money was seemingly being minted in the hedge-fund and private-equity sectors; investment banks were paying gigantic bonuses.
 For them, Wall Street was mythic terrain. For people with the conqueror gene, its outsized risks and rewards seemed like a personal challenge, a peak to be scaled. 
 Now, Wall Street is more like ''Survivor.'' Thousands of layoffs loom as the industry shrinks and consolidates. And even when recovery comes -- presuming it does -- traders and bankers said profits would most likely be lower, deals fewer, bonuses minuscule and regulation greater. 
 A result may be a more subdued Wall Street, one where professionals make a comfortable living but where the enormous payouts and outrageous bravado have faded. If so, this cultural shift could change not only the industry, but New York, which has adapted to a quarter-century-long (if occasionally interrupted) financial boom.
 ''There was so much optimism, so much froth,'' said Delilah Rothenberg, 25, who now works at a private equity firm in Manhattan; she was an associate at Bear Stearns until that firm imploded in March. Even recently, she added, investment professionals in their 20s ''were buying all kinds of luxuries on credit because they expected the money to keep coming in: watches, cars, apartments, boats.''
 In recent years, compensation packages soared ''by double-digit rates, which of course created an impression of impregnability,'' said Adam Zoia, a managing partner of Glocap Search, a New York-based recruiter.
 As recently as last year, a first-year investment banking analyst on Wall Street made $125,000 to $150,000, including bonuses, according to Options Group, a recruiting and consulting firm based in New York. An investment banking associate, which is one rung above that, made $250,000 to $300,000. 
 ''Bonuses will be substantially lower in investment banking as well as many other areas,'' said Michael Karp, the company's chief executive. The people who once browsed Porsche showrooms may simply be happy to have a job, any job. 
 ''The party's over,'' Ms. Rothenberg said. 
 And so is the compact that young bankers make with themselves: punishing workweeks for huge pay down the road. 
 ''The whole glamour of investment banking is that you're going to earn so much money that in the end it's going to be worth it,'' said a 22-year-old former JPMorgan Chase analyst who was laid off in May and later found work at a private equity firm, but only after going to nearly 40 interviews. ''If you get rid of the bonus, then there's basically no point.''
 Young traders and bankers were willing to endure brutal hours and high stress to taste a rarefied New York life, said Dr. Rosalind S. Dorlen, a clinical psychologist in Summit, N.J., who said she sees a large number of Wall Street workers in her practice. 
 ''There is something nice about being king,'' Dr. Dorlen said, describing the mind-set of young Wall Street players. ''The sense of power, the sense of omnipotence, the sense of testosterone. What other reason are people attracted to being an investment banker than to flex muscles? It's 'Whose wallet is larger?' '' 
 Such swagger meant that Wall Street hotshots were never beloved figures on New York's cultural landscape. It's no coincidence that the protagonists of books and movies like ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ''American Psycho'' tended to be narcissistic jerks, or worse.
 But New York's Gordon Gekkos played a crucial role in reinventing New York in the 1970s, when even the city's champions wondered if the nearly bankrupt city was going to go the way of Detroit, said Kurt Andersen, the writer and a co-founder Spy magazine at the height of the 1980s Wall Street boom. 
 ''If you look at two things, other than the ineffable spirit of New Yorkers, that made the city better again, you look at police and crime, and prosperity,'' Mr. Andersen said. ''And in speaking about prosperity, we're talking about the tremendous sums of money that, despite 1987 and 2000, kept gushing into the city thanks to the people wearing yellow ties.''
 Wall Street's highfliers helped rebrand the city in the eyes of the world, Mr. Andersen said, from a tired postindustrial necropolis to a sleek 21st-century financial dynamo.
 And that is the city today. Or it was. 
 Even before the recent carnage, the city's financial services sector had shed about 9,200 jobs from September 2007 to June, according to the state comptroller's office. Industry analysts predict that thousands more may disappear after the meltdowns at Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. And even the leading Wall Street minds seem to have no idea when the industry might rebound; at the depths of the crisis last week 2010 sounded like an optimistic estimate.
 And that makes business students very wary. ''There's a certain scary factor that's come into this,'' said Roy C. Smith, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business and a former general partner of Goldman Sachs. ''My students have a stunned look in their eyes.''
 Steven Song, 29, who started as an analyst at a Manhattan investment bank in 2001 and recently left a job at a hedge fund, runs a volunteer organization that provides mentoring and guidance to college undergraduates who aspire to work in finance. He said that several students he works with expressed reservations last week about pursuing jobs on Wall Street because of a perceived lack of opportunities. 
 ''There are fewer banks that are out there now, and each one that's out there remaining is hiring fewer people,'' he said. 
 One top student recently asked him for a ''list of smaller, boutique investment banks and brokerage firms instead of going for big-name shops,'' he said. ''In previous years that would never be the case unless you were a quote-unquote marginal candidate.'' 
 Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers could once be counted on to hire 20 to 30 graduates from the M.B.A. program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, a spokeswoman for the university said. Those graduates will now have to look elsewhere, said Gautam Tambay, 26, a first-year student in the program, ''so there just aren't as many opportunities anymore.''
 Another M.B.A. student said that students were starting to wonder where they would find jobs to pay off their student loans. So, imagine legions of M.B.A.'s pinching pennies to pay off student loans. That will change New York as we know it. 
 ''New York's going to take a big hit,'' said Bryan Gunderson, 28, a former investment banker for Lehman Brothers. ''This city is priced for people who work on Wall Street. It's ridiculous that cocktails cost $15 in New York.'' 
 The 23-year-old Wall Street phenoms who are used to spending $300 or more for a bottle of vodka at a West Chelsea nightclub, he said, are ''going to have to tone it back.''
 Tom Wolfe, the author of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' said that ''if Wall Street really does take a hard shot, it will diminish the image of New York as capital of the Western world.''
 But then, Wall Street -- and the fantasyland it helped create in New York -- was likely to shrink even without a credit crisis. 
 ''I hate to use the phrase 'masters of the universe,' but they're not in investment banking anymore, they're in hedge funds,'' Mr. Wolfe said. And ''hedge funds don't need glass office towers. They can run $15 billion with 25 people'' in the leafy suburban sanctuaries where their directors live.
 ''The new Wall Street,'' he said, ''is Greenwich, Conn.'' 
 In a possible indication of night life to come, Mr. Gunderson and his girlfriend invited friends to their West Village apartment last week to ''party like it's 1929.'' 
 ''If all the radio stations were playing big band music and this message were headed your way through the main switchboard, I would swear this was the Great Depression,'' the invitation read. 
 ''Unless you just lost your job,'' the invitation continued, ''or your fund is down more than 20 percent, please bring beer or booze.''

HEADLINE: The Teaching Cure

BYLINE: By NEGAR AZIMI. 
Negar Azimi is a senior editor at Bidoun, a cultural journal. She last wrote for the magazine about Teach for America.

 BODY:
Sitting in on a lecture by Daniel Shapiro is not unlike watching a televangelist work. He shuffles quickly about the room, one of his arms swaying erratically up and down, as if it had a life and mind of its own, while the other hangs limp at his side. When emphasizing a point, he hops forward, about two inches off the ground, then lands with precision. For those in the audience, this creates the delightful sensation of listening to someone on a pogo stick. 
 I first encountered the famously errant arm as it shot up to greet me in the lobby of Dubai's Emirates Towers hotel earlier this summer. Shapiro, a clinical psychologist by training and a faculty member of both the medical school and the law school at Harvard, where he directs the International Negotiation Initiative, was in town to run a two-day course titled Capturing the Power of Negotiation at the new Dubai School of Government -- the Arab twin of Harvard's Kennedy School. Shapiro is a tall, smiling man with, at 36, the air of an overgrown teenager. Dressed that day in a polo shirt, with a stuffed backpack hanging off one shoulder, he looked like Waldo on vacation. He was impeccably cordial, insisting that he would be happy to chat anywhere about the next day's program. (I would be sitting in on it as an observer.) I led him to what may have been the darkest bar in the hotel, where he sat sipping glass after glass of water. I was left to thumb through a very thick cocktail menu.
 At Harvard, Shapiro is part of a program that was introduced in 1979 by a negotiation scholar named Roger Fisher. That program, the Harvard Negotiation Project, largely made its name thanks to the Getting to Yes methodology popularized by Fisher and others, which became a best-selling book of the same name. Elements of Getting to Yes were used during the Iran hostage crisis, at Camp David and in apartheid-era South Africa, among other places. Shapiro adds his own spin to Getting to Yes, drawing on psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioral studies to emphasize the role of emotions in negotiations. To some, his approach may seem like mere verbiage. But to many in the political and corporate worlds, it's the gospel truth. ''We're all human,'' Shapiro likes to tell his audiences. ''We all have emotions all the time. And we all negotiate, from the day we're born and cry out for milk.''
 I asked Shapiro a series of what I hoped were pointed questions. Each was met with relentless enthusiasm, leaving me to suspect that his brain holds a surplus of pleasure chemicals. ''Interesting question . . . that is a great question!'' Pause and reflection. ''I am so pleased you asked me such an important question. But first, I want to hear more about you.'' (This, incidentally, was a game we played for the next few weeks, with me straining to redirect our conversation back to him.) 
 I began: ''Is negotiation teachable?''
 ''Absolutely. Not everyone is born with the charisma of Bill Clinton or the moral courage of Mandela, but everyone can improve their negotiating ability.''
 About Dubai: ''I love Dubai,'' he gushed. ''Absolutely love it. The world has so much to learn from this place. It's a microcosm of our world.'' He leaned in and smiled, hovering only inches from my face. ''Dubai is wrestling with identity issues in a way that mirrors the conflicts of the world.'' What kind, I wondered aloud. ''For example: to be traditional or modern?'' he said. ''To be religious or secular?'' In the midst of these questions, he leaned in again and said, ''Emotions are everywhere.'' 
 To understand how Shapiro ended up becoming a champion of emotions, it may help to know that ever since he was a child, he has shown a mesmeric talent for making people happy. At age 7, in suburban Harrisburg, Pa., he began taking magic lessons after happening upon ''The Amateur Magician's Handbook'' at a local bookstore. He went on to hold one-man shows, using the stage name Magic Dan, for birthday parties, senior citizens and Boy Scouts. He had his own distinctive cape and hat, and for a charge of $3 to $5, he would pluck coins from behind unsuspecting ears, link and unlink rings and magically color a blank coloring book. In sixth grade, he developed a personalized assessment tool to figure out which students in his class were left-brained and which were right-brained. As a teenager, he was the rare kid who was everyone's friend -- from the jocks to the Goths. 
 His sunny view of the world happily coincided with the fall of Communism. Indeed, his generation, which came of age with the fall of the Berlin Wall, is one that (for a long and pleasant while) had optimism as a dominant note. In 1984, Shapiro's parents took a trip to then-Communist Hungary. While visiting one of the country's synagogues, they discovered that their guide, a man by the name of Gabor, was in fact Jewish but had not told anyone for at least 20 years. Shapiro's mother spent a year figuring out how to get Gabor's son, Andy, to their home. Eventually, Andy traveled to America to stay with the Shapiros (there were always people coming and going in their house -- they were that kind of family); he and Shapiro bonded over the Beastie Boys. In a way, Andy was free that year in America, and soon everyone else in the old Eastern bloc was, too.
 By age 21, Shapiro had zigzagged all around Eastern and Central Europe with his backpack. In college at Johns Hopkins, he worked as a peer counselor and grew more and more committed to helping young people deal with their problems. Eventually, he designed workshops for children between the ages of 7 and 17 in several countries, including Hungary and Poland. They talked about their parents and sang an American folk song, ''Goin' Down That Road Feeling Bad.'' (''We changed 'bad' to 'happy,' '' Shapiro told me.) The curriculum he wrote was divided into five chapters, whose headings were, in this order: ''Me,'' ''You,'' ''Me and You,'' ''Me With You'' and ''Us.'' The response to it, Shapiro says, was ''electric.'' Since then, the curriculum he designed has spread to 30 countries. Shapiro, in the meantime, would go on to get a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and shortly thereafter make his way to his current perch at Harvard. In addition to teaching, he runs short courses for everyone from corporate executives at Microsoft to heads of state. Last winter, he held a seminar at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and later, another at the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el Sheikh with Tony Blair. They discussed taboo issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (They roped off a part of the room and designated it a ''taboo'' area devoted to various aspects of the conflict.) He also met with Queen Rania of Jordan to discuss ''the need for communication and understanding across cultures.'' 
 ''Am I telling you too much?'' Shapiro asked at one point. ''Tell me if I am telling you too much. Tell me, 'Dan, stop!' ''
 We had been talking for nearly two hours. A man in a dishdasha walked by our table, and Shapiro changed the subject back to Dubai, telling me he was a great admirer of Dubai's ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, waxing on about how he had gone about building a city out of practically nothing. His favorite Sheik Mohammed quote, which he mentioned no less than four times over the 48 hours we were together: ''The word impossible is not in leaders' dictionaries.'' 
 By now, the bar music had crept up three decibels, providing an incongruously dramatic background to our chat. Shapiro was getting carried away: ''The world has globalized. The nation-state has been flattened. More and more conflict in our world is based on identity. It's not a cold war anymore; it's a hot war! A messy, emotional war!'' Here we were in the Middle East, a famously emotional, famously messy place, and I could not help hoping that Daniel Shapiro would save us all. Every revolution needs a guru.
 ''We talk about globalization in places like Dubai,'' he said. ''And it's true, we're more and more connected. But we're not connecting. That's why I'm here.''
 Act II
 The lobby of the Dubai School of Government resembles that of any Ivy League hall. With its abundance of dark wood paneling, overstuffed leather couches and portraits of stern-faced white men, it looks as if it might have been fashioned after a handbook conception of an important university library. At 8:40 I was ushered into a central meeting hall where lecture participants drank tea, mingled and flipped through the course materials. Some looked as if they were still asleep. Others had their heads deep in their BlackBerrys. I asked one woman, a tightly head-scarfed, thickly lipsticked employee of the Dubai government, why she had chosen to attend the course. 
 ''It is Harfard,'' she told me. (There is no v-sound in Arabic.) ''He is a ferry important professor.'' She could have been talking about the pope. 
 I moved on, approaching another participant, a young Nigerian man dressed in a luxurious suit of pale blue who, I learned, runs a mining company in Lagos. He had read about the course in the back pages of The Economist and figured he could use some negotiating skills. He had a melodious speaking voice: ''We could all use some skills, right? Right?'' He had brought his new wife along for the trip, and I couldn't help suspecting that their primary interest might lie in sampling Dubai's abundance of honeymooning spots. There was a 23-year-old Oxford student of Iranian provenance who spoke six languages with ease and was working on a Middle Eastern human rights charter. And then there was the bulk of this very cosmopolitan Dubai crowd: advertising and public-relations executives, Dubai government functionaries, a group of dishdasha-clad men from the Emirati phone company. ''We had to come,'' one of them grumbled when I asked him why he was there. ''It was required of us.'' 
 By 9 a.m., we were in a wincingly bright conference room shaped like a boomerang. Each participant was provided with a leather binder with colorful dividers, freshly sharpened pencils, bottled water and copies of Shapiro's latest book, ''Beyond Reason'' (written with Fisher), along with ''Getting to Yes.'' Following an introduction to the Dubai School by an associate dean, Shapiro leapt forward. ''When I get excited,'' he warned, ''I talk quickly. Please tell me if I am talking too fast. Tell me: 'Dan, please slow down. You're talking too fast!' '' It was just about then that the first cellphone of the day went off.
 Shapiro asked participants to introduce themselves by choosing three words to best describe them and their negotiating styles. There was a buzz as participants scrambled to jot down the words that would perfectly capture their essence. We went around the room. ''I talk a lot,'' said a man who works in the oil and gas sector. ''I talk too much,'' he went on.
 ''I am impatient,'' said a Lebanese P.R. executive. ''My friendly face works to my advantage,'' said a small man from the phone-company group. He looked like Peter Sellers. ''I am emotionless,'' said an American-born executive named Kofi who, I later learned, was a convert to Islam.
 ''Is it O.K. if someone else used my idea?'' asked the woman next to him, looking worried. It was the woman in the head scarf. Yes, we all nodded. ''No problem,'' Shapiro said, smiling.
 Act III
 The first exercise of the day involved, of course, oil pricing. Two oil-producing countries, named Albia and Batia, compete for a third country's business. The two pass through eight rounds of pricing, each time selecting a barrel price -- $10, $20 or $30 -- not knowing what price the other country will set. An explanatory chart revealed that identical bids of $30 would ensure reasonable profits for each country, while bidding low could lead to economic difficulties for the other country. I joined the Batia group, already deep in discussion as to what their strategy would be. 
 ''Do we go for trust or no trust?'' asked the young Iranian human rights activist. 
 ''Is our goal to beat Albia or just to maximize profits?'' wondered the Lebanese P.R. executive.
 ''I want to win -- let's bring them down!'' screeched Peter Sellers, revealing his Peter Sellers smile. 
 ''But what if they want to work with us?'' asked the activist. She was very beautiful.
 ''This is a good point!'' said an Egyptian businessman who works in Abu Dhabi, nodding aggressively.
 Shapiro passed through, warning us that we had one minute to post our first price.
 ''Guys, guys, guys -- what do we do?'' asked the pretty activist. After some equivocation, they opted not to trust the other country -- ''This is business,'' said the Egyptian -- pricing low at $10 a barrel. 
 One minute later, Shapiro returned with the other country's bid in hand. They bid $30 and had opted for trust. Silence fell.
 ''Now they hate us!''
 ''We betrayed them.''
 ''It's just a game.''
 ''No, it's not,'' Peter Sellers said.
 Act IV
 In a rapid-fire debriefing of the oil-pricing exercise, we talked about how shafting another country had made us feel. Then after lunch, we ran through an introduction to the mystical language of negotiation studies. 
 ''Who knows what a batna is?'' Shapiro inquired. Remarkably, most every hand in the room went up as two men scrambled for the distinction of being the first to answer: ''Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement!'' 
 ''Let's say you want to buy a car, but you think that it's too expensive,'' Shapiro began. The dealer doesn't seem to budge. What do you do? Do you get angry? Could you go to other dealers to see what your options are? Could you find out what your batna is? Could knowing this help you strengthen your negotiating position?''
 A voice from the crowd. ''We do not have that luxury here. There are strict monopolies on who gets to deal what brand of car.''
 Shapiro, foiled: ''O.K. Let's use another example.''
 A man from the phone company piped up. I was surprised he was paying attention at all, as he had been playing with the camera on his phone most of the morning. ''Let's say I want to buy a piece of land, but someone else is going to get it before me?''
 Shapiro said: ''A great example. What would happen? Could you look for other land somewhere else that also suits your needs?''
 Phone man: ''But I want that land. I don't want any other land.''
 Shapiro: ''Did you search around for your batna?''
 Phone man: ''No. I want that land. I don't want anything else.'' 
 This example was not so great after all. 
 Act V
 The man responsible for bringing Shapiro to Dubai is Nabil Ali al-Yousuf, the American-educated executive president of the Dubai School and an adviser to Sheik Mohammed. Yousuf sat in on Shapiro's session at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
 ''Dan was by far one of the better sessions,'' he told me in his Emirates Towers office. ''He showed us how emotions and pride can take over our rational decision making.''
 Inviting Shapiro to Dubai seemed to fit with other, more ambitious state-building efforts in the United Arab Emirates -- whether in the form of building new government institutions where they did not exist, opening a Guggenheim or, in this case, opening a Harvard for the region. ''Part of our mission in Dubai is to bring in the best practices from outside,'' Yousuf said. He echoed Shapiro, or Shapiro echoed him, as he underlined the delicate balance that lay before his young country: negotiating rapid modernization combined with an ardent desire to remain committed to one's culture and heritage.
 ''We want to show the world that we Arabs can be successful without giving up our values or religion,'' he ruminated as he massaged his prayer beads. ''Innovating doesn't have to represent a trade-off.''
 It was the sort of narrative to be found all over the gulf. Shapiro, with his talk about conflicts over identity and notions about how to shape the future, about debates over tradition and modernity, seemed more relevant than ever. 
 Later that evening, I met Shapiro in the underground mall of the Emirates Towers, at Scarlett's restaurant. Like most everything in Dubai, there was little sense of place; we could have been anywhere in the world. He looked extremely happy, eating from a mountain of nachos with salsa piled on top. He had the same overfull backpack at his side. The same smile too. We talked about the day's activities. ''Did you see all that backstabbing in the oil-pricing game?'' he asked me excitedly. ''There are two basic approaches to negotiation: the rational approach and the emotional approach. Maybe they're flipped in the Middle East. Maybe there's a greater emotional dimension here. I felt that today.'' He wondered aloud, ''It's fascinating, you have 18 different cultures in that room, so who gets to set the norm?'' 
 Act VI
 Shapiro's ''tribes'' exercise is inevitably the climax of his sessions. It is also where he shines. The exercise's premise is that with globalization our world is changing faster and faster. One of the markers of this change is the concurrent rise of what might be called tribal allegiances around the world. Tribes are not only ethnic and religious in makeup; they are also rooted in emotional affiliation. And so, you have the Bahais or the Tutsis or the Sunnis, but also the Google tribe, the hipster tribe and so on. 
 Shapiro gave us the following instructions:
 ''You and the other members of your group have a unique opportunity to form a tribe. Each of you already belongs to multiple tribes based on such factors as your religious or ethnic affiliations. The challenge now is to form a new tribe that is consistent with your own values and beliefs -- and realistic: you could live with this tribe and its values.'' We were then told that each group had to decide its position on the following issues: whether Arabs should allow for U.S. military bases to be set up on their land; whether to allow capital punishment; whether Islamic figures could be criticized in the media; and take a stand on tradition versus modernity. 
 The larger group split up into six smaller groups to articulate their values and beliefs in one hour.
 In one room were a Nigerian, an Indian, a Dutchman, the Emirati with the tight scarf and thick lipstick who works for the government, Kofi the American convert, the Egyptian from Abu Dhabi and another Emirati. One of them proclaimed, ''We need a slogan!''
 Kofi: ''Why not the three musketeers, all for one and one for all?''
 The Egyptian: ''What about 'sharing and caring'?''
 The thick-lipsticked woman: ''Doesn't anyone here work in marketing?''
 They proceeded to the first issue: should U.S. military bases be allowed in Arab lands?
 The thick-lipsticked woman: ''No.''
 The Dutch man: ''Only if it is approved by the U.N.''
 The Nigerian: ''In 1991, Saudi Arabia invited the U.S. to help get rid of Saddam.''
 Kofi: ''Only if they are invited.''
 The woman, again, a bit stridently: ''But were they invited to stay? Because they did.''
 The Nigerian: ''I will go with the majority.''
 The Egyptian: ''This is very kind of you, very kind of you.'' 
 I moved to another tribe. This one seemed to be debating corporal punishment.
 An older Emirati among them: ''I believe in it because of the Shariah law. You have justice built into the system of Shariah.''
 The human rights activist: ''But there is a tradition of interpretation in Shariah, we may need to adapt parts of it to the modern world.''
 The Emirati: ''Let's vote.''
 The activist: ''If there is voting, I am not a part of this tribe. I want to challenge you guys. I just don't believe in it.''
 I walked back to the first tribe. They were ruminating on the question of criticizing Islamic figures. The thick-lipsticked woman walked out, looking flustered. 
 The Dutch man: ''You have the West where you can criticize your leaders, but then here, you cannot at all. It's almost like a clash of cultures. One has too much freedom, and the other has none.''
 Kofi: ''I'm an American Muslim coming from a culture where you can criticize everyone. Except Muhammad.''
 Shapiro went around to announce the end of the smaller group negotiations. Each tribe would have exactly three minutes to present its attributes. Members were allowed to wear a ''tribal costume'' of their own design and to select a group noise. There was a lot of snapping fingers and tinkling of cups as the scene assumed its own curious choreography. The groups seemed to share the same positions: resistance to U.S. bases on Arab lands, freedom to criticize public figures, mild acceptance of capital punishment (only for murder). Just as the last group was wrapping up its presentation, an eerie ''X-Files'' soundtrack began to play. All heads turned as a towering blue-caped monster stormed into the room. He boomed: 
 ''You measly earthlings have nearly destroyed the earth with all your fighting, and I am so fed up with it that I am going to destroy you! But I will give you one opportunity to save your world from total destruction. You must choose one of your six tribes to be the tribe of everyone. You cannot change any characteristics of your tribe. If you can't come to agreement by the end of three rounds of negotiation between representatives of each of your tribes, I will be back . . . to destroy you all!'' 
 Formerly convivial, the mood now turned ugly. Each group retreated to choose a leader.
 Round 1 began, marked by an inscrutable cacophony and occasional impassioned declarations that we must get along, and even more ''But we're better!'' There was no resolution.
 The tension mounted through Round 2; in Round 3, two women faced off, screaming into each other's faces until one of them, the sweet Iranian activist, sat down in the middle of the negotiation as a gesture of protest. One of the participants began to count down; there were 10 seconds left. The Lebanese P.R. executive, who had seemed so cool, screamed, ''We're all going to die!'' 
 Suddenly, Shapiro held up his hands. Hushed silence: the world had exploded. 
 We proceeded to discuss how we felt: about the fact that the negotiations turned ugly; about the fact that we could not settle on one group to represent all of our concerns; about the fact that it was the most trivial differences that were the fuel for the world's end; about the fact that we were all dead courtesy of a blue-caped monster. 
 Shapiro had soothing words. He had supervised this game close to 100 times -- in his courses at Harvard, at Davos, on the Dead Sea -- and every time save one, the world disintegrated. There was some relief in knowing that others were equally hopeless. That others were willing to die for their tribal identities, even if cobbled together in just under one hour. 
 After a brief graduation ceremony, the participants began to disperse, each to private lives and private dramas. Peter Sellers walked by me. He seemed sad the course was ending, his face contorted into a funny frown. He reflected on what happened minutes before in the agonizing final moments of the tribes exercise: ''It was a personal thing between the two women. That's the reason we all died.'' He shook his head, and everyone around him nodded in agreement.

HEADLINE: Martin Jay on Joseph Finkelstein

BYLINE: By MARTIN JAY. 
Martin Jay is a historian at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author most recently of ''Songs of Experience.''

 BODY:
I arrived at Union College in the fall of l961, a 17-year-old graduate of the Bronx High School of Science with little experience of the world outside the five boroughs. Among the many uncertainties I brought with me was my choice of a major, with English and history the leading candidates. Within a few weeks the decision was made, and the cause was evident: a small introductory seminar in European history taught by Joseph Finkelstein. 
My English professor, whose name has long since faded from memory, was competent enough, but Finkelstein had qualities that I found electrifying. His ebullience, intensity and ironic wit made each class engrossing. He had the gift of making connections between what he taught and who we were, conveying the sense that we, too, were part of the story and not merely spectators of someone else's history. His standards were high, but there was nothing authoritarian or intimidating in his demeanor. And there was also something in Joe Finkelstein's personal background, I have to confess, that added to his appeal. Both of us were Jewish, and he was also educated at Union, but he came from upstate New York, born in Troy. He was thus familiar and yet different enough to be a link to a wider world. Although ultimately our intellectual paths diverged -- he was an economic historian, while I pursued intellectual history -- Finkelstein served as an abiding model. He had been a Fulbright Scholar at the London School of Economics, where I was to spend my junior year abroad. He did his graduate work at Harvard, and I followed suit. Over the years, we saw each other from time to time, and he generously expressed his pride in my career, which was, needless to say, immensely gratifying (and another model for the way I have come to feel about many of my own students). Our last meeting took place in Schenectady a few years before his death in 2006. He showed me with quiet satisfaction his impressive collection of rhododendrons, a nurturer to the end.

HEADLINE: For Depression Generation, an Unwelcome Trip Back in Time

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NORTH HILLS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 When Wall Street rattled, cracked and plunged and the dust had finally settled, this is what stood out for Mitchell Frank: the people lined up three deep on 42nd Street, jostling to get a look at the job listings posted on 3-by-5 cards, hungry, visibly hungry, not for food, but for a job. 
 And this is what stood out for Herbert Marks: How proud he was when he managed to scrounge up $5 in bills and coins to give to his father so he'd have some money when he went to his meeting at the Oddfellows Lodge . 
 ''He didn't know if he should take it,'' Mr. Marks recalled as he and Mr. Frank sat in the faux English library of the Bristal assisted living community off the Long Island Expressway. ''Everyone was in the same fix, but having the $5, having something in his pocket, meant so much back then. I'll never forget it.''
 It was long ago, a time when teenagers like Mr. Frank would scramble after pieces of coal thrown to them from passing trains to heat their houses. Mr. Frank is 94, Mr. Marks will be 99 in January. Both remember the stock market crash of 1929 and the Depression that followed as if they had played out just the other day.
 In finance, past is seldom precise prologue, and age just guarantees experience, not wisdom. Maybe last week's wild ride was a precursor to disaster, and maybe it was just a particularly caffeinated financial thrill ride. But for two of the 2.1 million Americans 90 and older, born closer to the Civil War than the one in Iraq, it was hard not to think of the period when financial panic turned to financial disaster almost 80 years ago. 
 Sometimes Mr. Frank and Mr. Marks saw things differently, like whether people could cope with a similar economic disaster today.
 ''People are accustomed to so much more; they take a year off to go to Europe after college -- I don't know how they would adjust, I really don't,'' Mr. Frank said, shaking his head. ''You take a 50-year-old man, two kids in college, expensive house, how can he keep that up? How can he find the same kind of work?''
 ''I have to disagree,'' Mr. Marks said, tapping his hand gently on the arm of his chair. ''Our generation coped, the next generation will cope, and the generation after that. People learn, and now there's more available to learn from.''
 But they shared a sense of disquiet, as if they believed we had veered too far off the road in too many ways -- the quality of leadership, the sense of shared purpose, basic common sense. 
 ''If you're building a house, you need to have a strong foundation,'' said Mr. Frank as they sat side by side, two thin bookends in matching stuffed chairs. ''And I'm looking around this country for a foundation, and I don't see it.''
 The two had many shared memories -- the exhausted-looking World War I veterans in their military hats selling apples for a nickel on the street, the years of economic stagnation that became a way of life, the excitement and hope generated by Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
 ''People waited all week for his fireside chats,'' Mr. Marks said of Roosevelt's radio speeches. ''He buoyed people, he gave them hope. People wouldn't miss those talks for anything. There's no one today who can give that kind of hope.''
 ''There's no leadership now,'' Mr. Frank agreed. ''The president is a puppet. The people in Congress are in it for themselves. F.D.R. was like a God to people.''
 Typical of the Depression generation, both are eternally wary about money. Mr. Marks, who grew up in Brooklyn and went on to work appraising merchandise for what was then the United States Customs Service, used one credit card -- sparingly -- for 30 or 40 years. He drove a Chevrolet Caprice for maybe eight years before buying a new one. 
 ''I'm not going to owe what I can't pay,'' said Mr. Frank, who owned a printing company and designed financial reports. ''I'm not going to buy a Cadillac if I can only afford a Ford. Today, I know people who have a dozen credit cards, and they go from one to the other like they're dealing playing cards.''
 Age 90 or age 30, we were all whipsawed last week. So on Thursday, Mr. Marks and Mr. Frank were disagreeing on how desperate the financial devastation would be, and by Friday, they were trying to gauge whether the federal rescue plan would stave it off.
 Mr. Marks said the bailout might avoid a 1929-style disaster, but it didn't do anything to address the lack of jobs, the outsourcing of economic activity, the slow slide he saw in American life.
 Mr. Frank pointed to the breakdown in families. Back then, he said, one brother would start a trucking business, the others would join. Today, he said, one is in New York, another in Chicago, another in California.
 ''I don't think that's it at all,'' Mr. Marks said. ''We were a country endowed with great natural wealth, forests and minerals and fresh water. Our agriculture was the best in the world. But that's not enough anymore. 
 ''We taught other people around the world, and now they're just as efficient as we are or better,'' he added. ''And some of them work harder. We don't have to be in a Depression to see they're coming up and we're sinking down, and we don't know how to change it.''

HEADLINE: The Vanishing Republican Voter

 BODY:
David Frum's political view of inequality (Sept. 7) reads like an internal memo from the court of Louis XVI -- equality is not a value to be pursued for its own sake but a concession that might have to be endured to avoid imminent revolution.
 Equality is the value with which the framers began our founding document and what the progress of civilization has been primarily about. In fact, the redistribution of wealth -- a conservative's most feared and hated thing -- is most of what governments do. Reasonable people can disagree about precisely how much wealth should be redistributed and where, but to say that ''equality in itself never can be or should be a conservative goal'' is tantamount to rejecting the last couple centuries of progress. 
 David Berman

 One contributing factor to growing inequality that David Frum fails to consider is Republican ideological hostility to treating public office as public service, which it has demonstrated in many of its actions, from its response to Hurricane Katrina to its conduct of the war in Iraq. Ideological antipathy to government has directly harmed the quality of governance. Research shows that in societies polarized between rich and poor, the provision of public services is compromised. We are seeing ample evidence of this in the United States. Instead of promoting real equality through government commitment to equal access to education, health care and social protection, current leaders have found it more convenient to divert attention to threats to national security.

 The reason the educated classes are increasingly voting for the Democratic Party may just be that they are so highly educated. After all, a large base of the Republican Party believes the world was created 6,000 years ago. The Republican Party is shameless in its embrace of ignorance and its assault on science, evolution, workers' rights, a woman's right to choose -- the list goes on and on. A rejection of ignorance may have more to do with the change in voting patterns among the well educated than the economic inequality Frum deplores.

 David Frum states that it is ''widely understood that abundant low-skilled immigration hurts lower America by reducing wages.'' There is no such consensus among researchers. The National Research Council report that Frum cites says that immigration reduced wages of competing natives by only 1 or 2 percent. The Pew Hispanic Center reported mixed results between 2000 and 2004. Other researchers have found positive effects except for African-Americans, who continue to be discriminated against. The allegation that immigrants cause higher tax bills has also been widely disputed.
 To the extent that white, middle-class, traditionally Republican Americans are trending toward Democrats, it may be because despite their anxieties they are revolted by the intolerant tone that most Republican candidates proudly display. 
 Martin Oppenheimer
 Princeton, N.J.
 With all due respect to Republicans, as well as employers, the large-scale import of unskilled labor has not been the driving force behind rising wage inequality. The decline of unions has played a far larger role. Unions were not wanted by employers for the same reason that low-paid, unskilled immigrants are. Unions contributed more to reducing wage inequality and assuring healthier Americans for almost 30 years, and did so more effectively, than any other government policy over the same time period. Capitalism remained intact.

 David Frum states that ''the argument over same-sex marriage has become worse than a distraction from the challenge of developing policies to ensure that as many children as possible grow up with both a father and a mother in the home.'' Why dismiss the issue as a distraction and in the same sentence parrot the scientifically-unfounded belief that children fare better with a mother and a father at home, rather than two loving parents of any gender? The same-sex marriage ''distraction'' is fundamentally about the equality of American families, the issue for which Frum argues so eloquently. Reinforcing baseless notions of parenting unmasks the limit he is willing to place on that equality. 
 Laura Durso

 David Frum correctly acknowledges that income inequality in the United States has been growing steadily and that the use of genetic technology by the affluent to enhance the ''intelligence, health, beauty and strength'' of their offspring would exacerbate this trend. But his suggestion that this challenge could be addressed by somehow ensuring that all have access to such technology is woefully misguided. The advent of these technologies would spark a techno-eugenic rat race impossible to constrain absent some system of authoritarian, allocative control. It would fundamentally change the way people regard their children and one another and undermine the integrity of the common human nature that sustains all human values, beliefs and institutions. The genetic modification of our children is a practice that conservatives and liberals alike should be able to agree poses far more risks than benefits, and should be taken off the table as an option.

HEADLINE: Bubblenomics

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The past week, by any standard, has been an extraordinary one for America's economy and its financial system. Merrill Lynch, which was founded during Woodrow Wilson's administration, agreed to be bought for a bargain-basement price, while Lehman Brothers, which dates back to John Tyler's presidency, simply collapsed.
 By the end of the week, the federal government was preparing to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in securities that no bank wanted. It appears to be the government's biggest fiscal intervention since the Great Depression, designed to get the financial markets working again and keep a credit freeze from sending the economy into a deep recession. 
 The announcement of the plan changed the mood on Wall Street and sent stocks soaring at the end of the week. But even if the economy avoids a tailspin, the next couple of years aren't likely to feel especially good. It's been a long period of excess, and the hangover could be long, as well. For the near future, the most likely outcome remains slow economic growth, scant income gains for most workers and, for investors, disappointing returns from stocks and real estate. If consumers begin to cut back on their debt-fueled spending things could get worse. 
 On Friday morning, the economists at Lehman Brothers sent out their usual weekly roundup of the news, but it came this time with a short, italicized note, explaining that the report would be the final one to appear under the Lehman banner. That bit of understatement preceded some more: ''This episode of financial crisis,'' Lehman's economists explained, ''appears to be much deeper and more serious than we and most observers thought it likely to be. And it is by no means clear that it is over.''
 Yet, historic though this week has been, there is something familiar about what is happening. Once again, we are seeing the puncturing of a speculative bubble that was the result of asset prices soaring high above the underlying value of the assets. For as long as markets have existed, bubbles have formed. And whenever one of those bubbles begins to leak, it typically needs years to deflate, causing enormous economic damage as it does.
 Only now, for instance, are the bubbles of the past decade and a half, first in the stock market and then in real estate, starting to go away. It's easy to think of the turmoil of the past 13 months as being unconnected to the stock bubble of the 1990s, which appeared to end with the dot-com crash of 2000 and 2001. That crash brought down the overall stock market by more than a third, its worst drop since the 1970s oil crisis. Corporate spending on new equipment then plunged and employment fell for three straight years.
 But dramatic though it was, the dot-com crash did not actually come close to erasing the excesses of the 1990s. Indeed, by some of the most meaningful measures, Wall Street after the crash looked a lot more like it was in a bubble than a bust.
 As late as 2004, financial services firms earned 28.3 percent of corporate America's total profits, according to Moody's Economy.com. That was somewhat lower than it had been over the previous few years, but still almost double the financial sector's average share of profits throughout the 1970s and '80s. By 2007, the share had fallen only marginally, to 27.4 percent.
 Meanwhile, the share of wages and salaries earned by employees of financial services firms continued to climb and reached a peak last year. Of every dollar paid to the American work force in 2008, almost 10 cents went to people working at investment banks and other finance companies, up from about 6 cents or 7 cents throughout the 1970s and '80s.
 How did this happen? For one thing, the population of the United States (and most of the industrialized world) was aging and had built up savings. This created greater need for financial services. In addition, the economic rise of Asia -- and, in recent years, the increase in oil prices -- gave overseas governments more money to invest. Many turned to Wall Street. 
 Nonetheless, a significant portion of the finance boom also seems to have been unrelated to economic performance and thus unsustainable. Benjamin M. Friedman, author of ''The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth,'' recalled that when he worked at Morgan Stanley in the early 1970s, the firm's annual reports were filled with photographs of factories and other tangible businesses. More recently, Wall Street's annual reports tend to highlight not the businesses that firms were advising so much as finance for the sake of finance, showing upward-sloping graphs and photographs of traders.
 ''I have the sense that in many of these firms,'' Mr. Friedman said, ''the activity has become further and further divorced from actual economic activity.''
 Which might serve as a summary of how the current crisis came to pass. Wall Street traders began to believe that the values they had assigned to all sorts of assets were rational because, well, they had assigned them. 
 Traders sliced mortgages into so many little pieces that they forgot what they were really trading: contracts based on increasingly shaky loans. As the crisis has spread, other loans have started going bad as well. Hyun Song Shin, an economist at Princeton, estimates that banks have thus far absorbed only about one-third to one-half of the losses they will eventually be forced to take. 
 One of the few pieces of good news is that Wall Street finally seems to be coming to grips with the depth of its problems. You can see that most clearly, perhaps, in stock prices, which have at long last fallen from the stratospheric levels of the past decade.
 The classic measure of whether the stock market is overvalued is the price-earnings ratio, which divides stock prices by annual corporate earnings. At the height of the bubble, in 2000, companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index were trading at 36 times their average earnings over the previous five years. It was the highest valuation since at least the 1880s, according to the economist Robert Shiller. 
 By 2004, surprisingly enough, the ratio had dropped only to about 26, still higher than at any point since the 1930s. At the start of last year, it was still 26.
 But after the market closed on Friday, the ratio was down to roughly 17, which happens to be about its post-World War II average. At least by this one measure, stocks are no longer blatantly overvalued.
 This doesn't necessarily mean they are done falling. For one thing, corporate profits could decline, particularly if households begin pulling back on spending. The unusually rapid rise of consumer spending over the past two decades is arguably the third bubble confronting the economy. It has happened thanks in part to a huge increase in debt, which may now be coming to an end, just as Wall Street's love affair with debt appears to be ending as well.
 And even if the economy does better than expected, investors may still turn pessimistic. ''We tend to go through pendulum swings,'' said Joel Seligman, the president of the University of Rochester, a longtime Wall Street observer. There are long periods of overexuberance, in which investors worry that they are missing the next great thing, followed by crises that make those same investors fear that the world as they know it is coming to an end.
 That seemed to be the case last Wednesday, when share prices of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley plunged even though the firms were still making money. Glenn Schorr, a UBS analyst, wrote an e-mail message to clients saying, ''Stop the Insanity.''
 But bubbles inevitably produce insanity, both on the way up and the way down. On Friday, the formerly laissez-faire Bush administration, along with the Federal Reserve, announced that the only way to restore sanity to the markets was for the government to buy an enormous pile of mortgage-related securities. Theoretically, the government could turn a profit on the securities if they can be sold for higher prices when normal conditions return.
 But few expect that outcome. Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, estimated that the ultimate cost to taxpayers could be in the range of $1 trillion, or about two-and-a-half times as large as this year's federal budget deficit.
 A guiding principle of economic policy in recent years has been that nobody is smart enough to diagnose a bubble until it has already deflated. This was one of Alan Greenspan's mantras during his tenure as the chairman of the Fed. His successor, Ben Bernanke, said much the same thing when he took office in 2006. As they saw it, no matter how high stock prices rose relative to profits, or no matter how high house prices rose relative to rents, regulators deferred to the collective wisdom of the market.
 The market is usually right, after all. Even when it isn't, Mr. Greenspan maintained, pricking a bubble before it grew too large could stifle innovation and hurt other parts of the economy. Cleaning up the aftermath of a bubble is easier and less expensive, he argued. We're living through that cleanup now.

HEADLINE: As Ethanol Options Grow, So Does Debate Over Them

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

DATELINE: Lindenhurst 

 BODY:
 CARS sped by the Citgo station on Route 109 here on a hot July day. If drivers noticed Bilal Oztimurlenk's station at all, their glance was more likely focused on the skyrocketing price of gas -- $4.21 for regular that day -- than on the unfamiliar blue and yellow sign that hung just below it: a sunburst around a blue drop and three puffy white clouds. ''E85,'' it read. ''85% Ethanol.'' 
 Mr. Oztimurlenk's station is a first foothold in the New York City area for E85, an alternative fuel with a much higher blend of ethanol than has been available so far; there are about 1,200 such stations nationwide, mostly in the Midwest. Despite being linked to food shortages, high gas prices and global warming, because most of it comes from corn, ethanol has boomed.
 Yet even as ethanol businesses make tentative inroads into the region, there are doubts about the industry's future. Many producers and policymakers say that the way ethanol is made today is unsustainable because corn is so energy intensive to produce. The use of corn-based fuel has sparked a debate over whether crops that could feed people should be used to fuel machines. 
 In response, many scientists and companies -- with strong encouragement from the federal government -- are searching for other, nonedible sources of ethanol, also known as cellulosic ethanol.
 But such concerns were not on Mr. Oztimurlenk's mind as he surveyed his one E85 pump.
 ''I'm a businessman,'' he said. ''We got into this because we were following the stock market and saw how companies that were related to corn were going up. We saw no one in the area had one.''
 More mundane concerns over local permits had delayed Mr. Oztimurlenk, who has had fuel in the ground since late July, from selling E85. But on Monday, he sold his first gallon -- at $2.79.
 ''Some of the people come up to the regular line and don't know they have a flex-fuel car and we tell them they can go over to the E85 pump,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''They're very pleased with the price.''
 Mr. Oztimurlenk's station is the first within 100 miles of New York City to sell E85; there are no places to buy E85 in New Jersey and Connecticut, though at least one is being planned in New Milford.
 But Mr. Oztimurlenk's Citgo station may not be the only E85 source for long. Carl Vogel, who has sold biodiesel out of a tanker truck in West Babylon for the past two summers, wants to expand his fuel selections. ''Compressed natural gas, E85, hydrogen and electric, as well as gas and diesel,'' Mr. Vogel said. He said he received at least five calls a day from people seeking E85.
 Ethanol has been considered an alternative to gasoline since the Model T, which Henry Ford built to run on both. The most common blend of ethanol fuel, E10, is 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline, and all modern, nondiesel cars can run on it. By contrast, E85 contains 15 percent gasoline, which makes for a cleaner burn but poorer mileage.
 American automakers are rapidly increasing their fleet of flex-fuel vehicles, which can run on E85 or regular gas. They far outnumber hybrids, but only about six million flex-fuel vehicles are on the road now.
 More flex-fuel vehicles means more ethanol demand and increasing concern over the use of corn.
 ''We have been accused of everything from starving poor people to increasing global warming,'' said Andrew Schuyler, director of the Northeast Biofuels Collaborative, an industry group. 
 High corn prices have also hurt ethanol, as competition for raw materials decreased profits. ''The margins have gone to zero,'' said Chris Shaw, an analyst at UBS Securities who predicts that industry consolidation is coming soon. ''It just got too big, too fast.''
 Steven R. Jany, 57, a farmer in West Windsor, N.J., said that ''back in the 2000s, we had barns full of corn.'' Growers in New Jersey were looking for another way to sell their corn to stay in business, and Mr. Jany, who is also the treasurer of the New Jersey Farm Bureau, helped organize a co-op to lure the first ethanol plant to their state. 
 But now that demand for his corn is so high, he said, there is no longer the same need. ''The market right now -- anyone will buy your corn,'' he said.
 Roger A. McEowen, who teaches economics and agricultural law at Iowa State University, said he did not see any future for corn-based ethanol. ''Eighty percent of the existing plants will be dark within five years,'' he said of biorefineries. ''Or else retrofitted to something other than corn.''
 But the drive for biofuel is not over, it is just changing direction. 
 At a research farm in Freehold, N.J., Stacy A. Bonos walked through waist-high rows of switch grass, stopping at a particularly robust plant and grabbing a handful of the grass. ''This is what you can use for fuel,'' she said. ''The leaves, the stems.''
 For the past four years, Dr. Bonos, a plant geneticist at Rutgers University, has been one of a growing number of researchers looking at improving this native perennial grass through cross-breeding to make it a better source for a new kind of biofuel that may eventually replace corn ethanol at gas stations.
 Researchers, academics and new companies are racing to come up with a practical way to produce cellulosic ethanol. Made from nonedible plant matter that often includes agricultural waste, cellulosic ethanol avoids some of the food-fuel debate and some environmental problems associated with corn production. 
 But it comes with its own challenges, chief among them being how to extract energy from tougher, woodier plant sources. Each cellulosic company has its own method for getting at the ''trapped'' fuel -- acid or microbes or enzymes (think of a cow eating grass) -- but all are spurred by Congress, which has mandated that by 2022, about 15 percent of the nation's fuel, or nearly 21 billion gallons, must come from cellulosic sources.
 Today, the number produced is zero.
 The Congressional mandate constitutes an ambitious doubling-down on ethanol technology and has generated a boon for the biotech and farming industries.
 ''Rather than cut up a smaller and smaller pie, we're baking more pie,'' said Jon Doggett of the National Corn Growers Association.
 It also thrust the untested cellulosic industry into the limelight, where it is now expected to perform. A handful of commercial-scale biorefineries are under construction, from Georgia to California. 
 In New Milford, Conn., American Energy plans to break ground this fall on a commercial cellulosic refinery in an old brass factory. ''We're taking a dilapidated old building and bringing it back to usable life,'' said Christopher Brown, the company chairman, who envisions hundreds of E85 stations in the Northeast fed by dozens of biorefineries. ''Right now, there's a need,'' he said. 
 The federal government, the ethanol industry and many environmentalists are bullish on cellulosic ethanol in part because it can come from such a wide variety of sources: agricultural byproducts like wood chips and wheat straw, organic landfill waste like paper or vegetables, or dedicated biofuel crops, like switch grass. 
 Even Mr. Jany, a lifelong corn farmer, suggested that the first ethanol plant in New Jersey should include technology for making cellulosic fuel. ''Then you reduce your dependency on corn,'' he said. 
 Although there are no commercial switch grass farms in the United States, interest in the native grass has increased sharply over the past five years. Perennial grasses can be grown on marginal lands ill-suited for food, with less need for fertilizer and pesticides. 
 ''It can grow in all sorts of places -- construction sites, abandoned areas -- areas that have poor soil for agriculture,'' Dr. Bonos said. 
 Grass is only one of a number of potential ethanol sources collectively known as biomass, a term referring to any organic matter that can be used as fuel. In a 2005 study, the federal Departments of Energy and Agriculture found that, at least theoretically, the country produces enough of this organic matter to supply 60 billion gallons of fuel annually without disrupting the food supply or straining the land. (The United States consumes 140 billion gallons of fuel each year.)
 But lingering questions about the cellulosic industry's feasibility remain. 
 ''Cellulose is going to be worse than corn, if you look at the energetics and the economics of it,'' David Pimentel, a Cornell University ecologist, said. ''It's like it's trapped in fiberglass. It takes a lot of energy to get it out.''
 Land-use competition represents another stumbling block for the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol. Just because new cellulosic crops can grow on marginal lands, as Dr. Bonos and other researchers have shown, does not guarantee that farmers will resist using more fertile lands for fuel production if the price is right.
 ''I don't think we can go on faith that biofuels will work out,'' said Nathanael Greene, a senior policy analyst for biofuel at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''We need to require that they be good'' through regulation, he said. 
 ''It all comes back to good enforcement of the rules'' by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies, he added. 
 The cellulosic industry's key to success will be how well it manages the transition from corn ethanol. Biorefineries that process corn-based ethanol today will have to be retrofitted to handle other feedstocks, while combines will have to be re-engineered to harvest messier perennial plants. 
 Those involved in the cellulosic industry say they hope that consumers will learn to distinguish between ethanol derived from edible crops and from cellulosic crops, so that opposition to corn ethanol does not extend to cellulosic alternatives. 
 Indeed, stickers on gas station pumps -- ''Contains Ethanol,'' or ''10% Ethanol'' -- never describe how the ethanol is made or from what source. But one day, if the cellulosic industry can meet the federal mandates and grassy fuel becomes a fact of life, those stickers might read more like labels at Whole Foods: ''100% Biomass Ethanol,'' ''Grown on Marginal Lands,'' ''Corn-Free.''

HEADLINE: 'Desert' Storm

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Authors subjected to a critical review face a Hobson's choice: if they complain they sound thin-skinned, but if they remain silent the reviewer's judgments stand unchallenged. Readers interested in getting beyond the distortions shot through Max Rodenbeck's review of ''A Path Out of the Desert'' (Aug. 24) should have a look at the book itself. Some of his misrepresentations are so blatant, however, that they bear rectifying even in this abbreviated form. 
 Rodenbeck writes that it is ''misleading to assert that 'the Arab regimes have implicitly or explicitly backed a range of terrorist groups.' Pray, which Arab governments does [Pollack] mean, and which groups is he talking about?'' Can Rodenbeck really not know that the governments of Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and the U.A.E. have provided formal and/or informal support to Hezbollah, Hamas, the P.L.O., Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Abu Nidal, Al Qaeda and the P.K.K., all of which engaged in acts of terrorism? 
 And Rodenbeck asks, ''Can't we just admit that American support for Israel is strategically burdensome and is driven by the passion of several domestic constituencies rather than cold cost-benefit geopolitics?'' An affirmative answer may seem simple to someone with his biases, but the reality is both different and far more complex. The American relationship with Israel was founded on a perception of strategic benefit, and while the nature of the relationship has changed considerably over the years, that perception has remained. It is not the only element of the relationship, but it remains the cornerstone, and the domestic political considerations to which Rodenbeck refers tend to affect it only at its margins. In my book, I assess the relevant evidence and explain why America's commitment to Israel remains strategically important and why its benefits continue to outweigh its costs. Rodenbeck is free to disagree, but a reader ought to expect him to explain why and to back up his views with evidence. 
 Rodenbeck may think that most of the investment coming from outside the Arab world is not going into the energy sector, but the data tell a different story. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), last year 57 percent of all non-Arab investment in the entire Middle East -- which for Unctad includes Israel, Turkey and Cyprus -- went into energy projects. Since Israel and Turkey alone account for 38 percent of all foreign investment in Unctad's definition of the region, 57 percent is artificially low, and the real number is probably closer to 80 to 90 percent. 
 Rodenbeck simply caricatures my lengthy discussion of using carrots and sticks to move Arab regimes to adopt political, economic and social reforms. I do have a single paragraph that discusses the possibility of curtailing aid, but that's it. And my conclusion is that such sticks are unlikely to have the necessary impact. Instead, I argue that the Arab regimes are too strong for the United States to fight (unless we want to invade more countries -- which I strongly recommend against), but they also recognize the tremendous pressure they face from their people for change. This creates an opportunity for the United States if we are willing to shift from scolding and threatening the Arab regimes to trying to work with them to persuade them to take steps that most of them already realize they will someday have to take. 
 As part of such an effort, I do suggest that providing additional aid can assist that process, in part because the kind of far-reaching reforms that will be needed will cause disruptions and incur real costs. Just as the United States provided aid to Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians to take risks for peace, so too should we be ready to provide aid to the states of the Muslim Middle East to help them take risks for reform. 
 I can only hope that some of the readers who may have decided not to touch my book as a result of this review will choose to read and judge for themselves.

 Certainly, some Arab states have backed groups that other governments label terrorist. But it surely is misleading to broadly condemn ''the'' 22 Arab governments for this sin. Regarding foreign investment in the region, Pollack's book says that ''virtually all . . . goes to oil exploration, production and export.'' My review noted that this is no longer true, but nowhere did I assert that most now flows to other sectors. As for America's attachment to Israel, it is odd that Pollack devotes a big chunk of his own book to explaining how nonstrategic factors, such as an instinctive liking for democracies and a sense of moral debt to the Jewish people, have shaped American policies. In other words, it is a ''bias.''

 BODY:
THE 14-room duplex at the Pierre Hotel owned by Lionel Pincus, the founder of Warburg Pincus, the private equity firm, is back on the market, over the objections of his longtime companion, Princess Firyal of Jordan. 
 The apartment sprawls over 7,000 square feet on the 30th floor, and half of the 31st, at the Pierre, on Fifth Avenue at 61st Street. The asking price in a listing by Joan Kaplan, a broker at the Corcoran Group, is $50 million, one of the highest in the city, but still shy of the $70 million being sought for the unfinished penthouse tower atop the Pierre.
 Princess Firyal, who used to be married to an uncle of King Abdullah of Jordan, filed a lawsuit to block the sale in Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, but an order by Judge Kristin Booth Glen on Aug. 28 cleared the way for the sale by Mr. Pincus's sons.
 Mr. Pincus, 78, was found mentally and physically incompetent in 2006 after cancer surgery, and his sons, Henry and Matthew, were appointed guardians. In his will, Mr. Pincus promised the apartment to the princess, and directed his personal trust to provide her with the proceeds of a sale, after expenses, if the place was sold before his death. Princess Firyal, 62, who has an apartment elsewhere in Manhattan, had said she wanted to live there. But after talks with the sons broke down, they moved to sell the apartment. (The Surrogate's Court decision was based on technical grounds and does not preclude another suit.) 
 In court papers, Princess Firyal said she had been unfairly portrayed by the sons as ''an economically motivated interloper.'' Until the sons sought to gain control of their father's affairs, she said, they were ''insofar as their father's health and happiness largely invisible and uninvolved.''
 In an affidavit, Samuel C. Butler, a former managing partner of Cravath, Swaine and Moore and a trustee of Mr. Pincus's trust, complained that maintenance expenses on apartments at the Pierre and in Miami were draining resources. ''We understand that the market for very high-end apartments thus far has been largely unaffected by the downturn in the real estate market,'' he said. ''It is not at all clear how long that will continue.''

HEADLINE: Off to Work, to Pay the Handyman

BYLINE: By LORI SENDER

 BODY:
THE cracks are spreading. Last year's faint threadlets on the bedroom ceiling now bleed through in clear jagged lines; what once were fine tracings on inner walls have begun to resemble bold inflation graphs in The Economist. The outdoor trim paint has been pulling from the house more and more each year, as that flippant decision -- water-based or oil-based? -- continues to haunt us. Our garage has a huge vertical crack into which my fingers can pass: cave crickets, the size of small scorpions and as sinister looking, only jumpier, have found these damp crevices more than suitable. 
 And this is our well-maintained house, in South Orange, N.J. The rental property, in Bradley Beach, N.J. -- the poor cousin -- is in need of insulation; upper floors lack storm windows, winter tenants grumble over their heating bill. I see my son, who will one day inherit this estate, ruing his blighted lot along with his well-intentioned benefactor. 
 I came into home ownership, by way of matrimony, in my early 40s. My husband brought to the marriage the house in South Orange and I brought a knowledge of the real estate market in Bradley Beach. That was my childhood home, and I yearned to return to a house there. It was the late '90s and property values were still low enough that we could actually consider the possibility. 
 As a child, I had observed my father's grimaces as he tended to his own Shore rental properties, loading lawn mower, ladders and endless cans of paint into his station wagon to pursue his weekend and after-work maintenance. I've looked to my husband to continue this tradition -- and he's looked right back at me. And now, at this critical repair juncture, I've come to face reality: a handyman will need to be hired.
 So I must work. The logical direction is toward a degree I never wanted, never used, never kept up, but one leading to a decent hourly wage -- my pharmacy degree. It's taken two years to get the degree back in working order, mostly studying for a pharmacy-law exam, sharing cubicles with haggard college students, me the over-50 standout. 
 ''You'll need to take a drug test.'' I'm at my first interview, at a chain store, and I'm dying to extemporize on the inanity of drug testing. I settle for a passing joke on Purim and poppy hamantashen and am offered the job. On the car ride home, I'm high on thoughts of renovations. I start from the ground up: sand floors in South Orange, replace missing floorboards in Bradley, patch cracks, fill holes from tenants' hanging of artwork, paint a lot.
 We have 40 windows in our house in South Orange, 35 in Bradley. Seventy-five windows and one window shade, for my now-slumbering, 9-year-old son. I recall how stressful it was to pick out that shade, going back and forth to Manhattan, comparing swatches, finally hiring a window-treatment professional to size the window, place the Roman shade just so, cut the blackout roller shade to fit perfectly behind it. Still, a few cracks of light come through.
 I wonder, even with a job, even with the extra income, can I possibly pull it together for 74 more windows? Sort of like child-rearing -- the energy only lasts so long. Now a good book, a glass of wine, a lawn chair in Bradley, has too much appeal. 
 Our refrigerator looks worrisome. I tell my son not to swing the door open so fast -- the useful life of the epoxy used to fix the shelving may be coming to an end. Some days the refrigerator oozes water onto the floor. The stainless steel brands call to me at our local Sears and Costco, and I admit to coveting my neighbor's.
 I figure it would take five hours as a druggist to buy a decent duvet cover, but I must be strong and look at the big decaying picture. Maybe a month's dispensing pills for an outside paint job (the trim only) with full garage paint, including crack repair. As I tell this to my husband, he smiles broadly. He can't wait to see me in a white lab coat, stepping into some Walgreens, just in time to fend off that refrigerator flood that would surely warp our non-water-resistant laminate floors. 
 I visit the pharmacy to pick up a drug test and greet my future co-workers. They glance away from their pills and look me up and down. It's big, I know, this first hello. I will be sharing their small space, and it's crucial that we get along. 
 The store is abnormally cold. I'm thinking of wearing thermal underwear and a fleece jacket under my lab coat, and a pair of Dansko shoes for those first long days of standing. I expect I'll be busy and the hours will fly, but I can't seem to get rid of the looming melancholy that this is not what I should be doing, let alone what I want.
 Still, I know the score. I never managed to write that screenplay, my memoir never got past adolescent angst, and now, with pages full of a pharmacist's life, who would read it? 
 ''Why not just sell Bradley?'' my friend asks at the school bus stop. We've gone from elusive play dates to overworked husbands to my leaky roof.
 It's hard to explain this twisted connection to property, this need to hand down land and home to my son, and mostly my hardheaded pride and persistence. Last year, while another mother and I were talking at our community pool, we both realized we had a second property to support.
 ''Where else would I put my money,'' she said. ''Bloomingdale's shopping?'' That was it -- we shared that mentality, that this home forced us into a savings plan, albeit a somewhat strangulating one. 
 My sister is thinking of retirement. I figure on another 10 years of pill proffering before I join her. I see myself reclining on a beach chair on Second Avenue Beach, without a thought of home repair, nary a tenant in sight, my biggest concern whether the direct rays of the sun are in line with my face. Then at last, when my sister turns to me -- as she does each year -- and says with a sigh, ''Isn't this relaxing,'' I can agree.

 BODY:
INDIGNATION
 By Philip Roth
 By 233 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $26
 In his new novel, ''Indignation,'' Philip Roth withholds a crucial piece of information -- and that's an understatement -- until about a quarter of the way through. This placement seems to me right on the borderline of fair game for reviewers, and not to tell it would misrepresent the book. (A more alert reader than I was might figure it out simply by looking at the table of contents.) Still, it seems mean to spoil a strategic surprise for folks who like that kind of thing. So in case you want to head for the exit now, I'm going to vamp for a couple of paragraphs of harmless generalities and evasive plot summary before getting specific. Roth has a couple more surprises, too (which you might see coming but probably won't), and I promise not to get anywhere near those. Anyhow, isn't it surprising enough that Roth, now 75, has just published his third novel in three years? 
 Well, at this point, maybe not. Roth has been burning up the track for well over a decade now. Since ''Sabbath's Theater'' in 1995, Roth has written eight novels, including two general-consensus masterworks -- ''American Pastoral'' (1997) and ''Everyman'' (2006) -- the conclusion of his long Zuckerman saga (last year's ''Exit Ghost'') and a half-dozen other exceptionally strong books. And in ''Indignation,'' his power and intensity seem undiminished. I generally prefer Roth's short, devastating sex-and-mortality novels -- ''Everyman,'' ''Exit Ghost,'' ''The Dying Animal'' (2001) -- to his larger social/political/historical excursions -- ''American Pastoral,'' ''The Human Stain'' (2000), ''The Plot Against America'' (2004) -- although I admit the big books are more fun to read, since they offer a richer menu of topical distractions from what's ultimately in store for each of us. ''Indignation,'' set during the Korean War in a small, conservative Ohio college -- hat-tippingly named Winesburg -- has something in common with both Rothian modes. It evokes a nasty period of America's social history (you know, as opposed to all those idyllic ones), but like Roth's two previous novels, it's also ruthlessly economical and relentlessly deathbound. 
 The narrator, a college sophomore named Marcus Messner, who says he used to be ''the nicest boy in the world,'' is the Everyteen of his superficially innocent era. ''In my high school years, I had been a prudent, responsible, diligent, hard-working A student who went out with only the nicest girls, a dedicated debater and a utility infielder for the varsity baseball team.'' The summer after high school, Marcus worked 60-hour weeks in his father's kosher butcher shop in Newark -- yet another of Roth's lovingly researched workplaces, like the glove factory in ''American Pastoral.'' And at Winesburg, Marcus studies all week and waits tables all weekend. ''I wanted to do everything right,'' he says. ''If I did everything right, I could justify to my father the expense of my being at college in Ohio rather than in Newark. I could justify to my mother her having to work full time in the store again.'' His goal is to become valedictorian, and since he's only human -- as well as a Philip Roth character -- ''to have intercourse before I died.'' At 19, Marcus is just beginning to distill a self out of all this slop of generic niceness: to his surprise, if not to ours, he finds a quality for which Roth's title, with its implication of justified outrage at violated dignity, is the mot juste. 
 Back when Marcus was in grade school, during World War II, he and his classmates had to learn what they were told was the national anthem of China, America's Pacific Theater ally: ''Arise, ye who refuse to be bondslaves! / . . . Indignation fills the hearts of all of our countrymen, / Arise! Arise! Arise!'' Now, during a war in which China has become the enemy, Marcus sings this call to arms in his head when forced to attend chapel, with Christian hymns and sermons about ''Christ's example'' -- objecting ''not because I was an observant Jew but because I was an ardent atheist.'' As Marcus's troubles and his defiance mount -- neither of them especially high -- he's called into the office of a cartoonishly offensive dean and again sings to himself ''the most beautiful word in the English language: 'In-dig-na-tion!' '' What has the nicest boy in the world done? Changed dorm rooms, twice, to get away from roommates who were driving him crazy. Neither this nor his subsequent infractions, linked from one to another with a horrible inexorability, would amount to anything today, and not one does a bit of harm. But in a novel set in 1951, this series of dinky moments is more than enough to bring on the denouement. Everything in ''The Human Stain,'' you may remember, turns on Coleman Silk's use of a single word; for Marcus Messner, it takes two to change his life forever. 
 Roth holds back his final surprise -- those two words, and all that they lead to, until a few pages before the end; that's the one we won't touch. Marcus, though, has gotten us only from Newark to Winesburg, and into a car for his first date with a delightful basket case named Olivia, when he stops his narrative at a cliffhanging point -- during an episode more astonishing to him than it is to us -- and imparts something as astonishing to us as it is to him. Which is simply . . . ah, but let's cliffhang for a minute ourselves, O.K.? How does Roth get away with this stuff? The cliffhanger, the obscure portent, the withholding of essential information? He doesn't use these antiquated devices ironically. And those occasional descents into boilerplate prose? It's no Barthelme-like feat of postmodernist ventriloquism that leads him to use such a phrase as ''the turbulent decade of the 1960s.'' Roth's secret, I think, is his supreme confidence as a storyteller -- and, paradoxically, a supreme humility. His writing is at the service of his story and characters; he's a pragmatist, not a belletrist. If certain conventions of plot and language do the job, why get fancy? He can break out the fine writing when the occasion requires. 
 As it does when Marcus delivers his revelation: which is simply . . . that he is dead, and has been ''for I don't know how long.'' For three pages of eloquently discomfiting monologue, Roth makes Marcus sound like a more lucid and connected version of Samuel Beckett's Unnamable: ''Even now (if 'now' can be said to mean anything any longer), beyond corporeal existence, alive as I am here (if 'here' or 'I' means anything) as memory alone (if 'memory,' strictly speaking, is the all-embracing medium in which I am being sustained as 'myself'), I continue to puzzle over Olivia's actions. . . . Who could have imagined that one would have forever to remember each moment of life down to its tiniest component? . . . There is no letup -- for the afterlife is without sleep as well. . . . There are no doors. There are no days. . . . And the judgment is endless, though not because some deity judges you, but because your actions are naggingly being judged for all time by yourself.'' Then again, this state may be ''merely the anteroom to oblivion.'' There, feel better? 
 The unnamed protagonist of ''Everyman'' at least gets a joyous flash of himself as a boy at the ocean before the lights go out; ''Indignation'' makes even that terminally grim book seem sentimental. ''Everyman'' and ''Exit Ghost'' both have a mood of sorrowful resignation; this book goes about its grieving savagely. And of all Roth's recent novels, it ventures farthest into the unknowable. In his unshowy way, with all his quotidian specificity and merciless skepticism, Roth is attempting to storm heaven -- an endeavor all the more desperately daring because he seems dead certain it's not there.

WENDY STEINER
 A professor of English and the founding director of the
 Penn Humanities Forum at the University of Pennsylvania, Steiner has
 recently taken a scholarly interest in the fashion model, whom 
 she sees ''as a reality morphing into images and representations, like so 
 much else in contemporary life, even professors. But I'm wearing 
 clothes that no professor would dare wear in the classroom.''
 Fashion credits are on Page 94.
 WILLARD SPIEGELMAN
 An English professor at Southern Methodist 
 University who specializes in poetry, Spiegelman
 teaches everything from the English 
 Romantic poets to Roland Barthes -- and still finds time for ballroom dancing. ''I think that a 
 teacher in the classroom is basically an expanded
 version of himself in private life,'' he says.
 LISA RANDALL
 For Randall, a professor of physics at Harvard
 known for her ability to translate abstract subject matter like cosmological inflation to the masses, 
 it's important for students to see her dressed in more than just a lab coat. ''I hope that seeing 
 professors not all fitting a single stereotype will encourage students to keep an open mind.''
 KEN MILLER
 A professor of biology at Brown University, Miller 
 is known to liven up clinical subject matter with 
 sports analogies and even music. But fashion, not so much. ''My students so seldom see me wearing 
 a tie that when they do, they stop me on the street 
 and ask what the special occasion might be.''
 ANNALISA CRANNELL
 Crannell is a professor of mathematics at Franklin 
 and Marshall College who doesn't dress -- 
 or teach -- by the numbers. She tries to get students 
 to explain mathematics to a nontechnical 
 audience using real-world and fictional examples. 
 ''It's very much like storytelling,'' she says.
 MICHAEL TAUSSIG A professor of anthropology at Columbia University, Taussig says his job is an exercise in ''cross fertilizing'' ideas among 
 science, art, storytelling and criticism. ''It's ultimately impossible to collapse these distinctions,'' he says. ''But I try.''

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THE Science, Industry and Business Library on Madison Avenue has large collections of books and magazines, rows of computers and even three Bloomberg terminals -- dual-screen behemoths where furrow-browed investors were mining for company data late Wednesday afternoon. 
 But the real action on that day, a little before 4 p.m., was at the library's wall of television screens, which were tuned to stations reporting a late-afternoon slide that left the Dow Jones industrial average down 449 more points. A row of men and women stood facing the screens. Some were on their cellphones and others watched the ticker scroll by. A countdown clock on one channel showed eight minutes until the closing bell. 
 The library, part of the New York Public Library system, is about three miles north of Wall Street, far away enough to put it outside the center of the recent turmoil, the job losses and the failing institutions. But last week, it was full of ordinary investors, the kind of people who rely on the library's resources and their own wits to guide their savings. They were experiencing a quiet tumult of their own.
 ''You see wealth just dropping right in front of your eyes, every day,'' said Ray Herr, who is from Staten Island and was fielding calls on his cellphone. ''It always comes back to, the taxpayers have to pay for the professionals' mistakes. Greed drove this market.'' 
 Mr. Herr, who owns a business that helps clients reduce their bank fees, said he had just returned from a trip to Detroit. Economic conditions there are so bleak that he was able to buy a three-bedroom brick house, as an investment, for $2,000, he said. Despite his bargain purchase, he added: ''You think this country's on the right track? That has to change.''
 The day's news was not bad for everyone, at least not immediately. ''I'm O.K.,'' said Medit East, a technology consultant from New Jersey. He added that he usually bet on the euro but had not done so even though the currency was up against the dollar that day. ''I'm telling myself that I wish I could have,'' he said. 
 Kristin McDonough, the library's director, was standing nearby. She said that attendance at the library's investing classes, which are run by a former pension adviser, had shot up in the past six months. Some classes have been so full, she added, that students have had to share computers. 
 But maybe on this afternoon, another day of dispiriting losses before the market regained ground later in the week, people were tired of thinking about stocks. A class in a side room on investment research started late because of low attendance. When it did begin, three students were present, along with a librarian who led them through Web sites and other resources. 
 The librarian was careful to stick to the curriculum, offering no financial advice, but there were cracks. On a tour through a Standard & Poor's Web site, she caught a glimpse of the day's news. ''Oh, my God, the S. & P. is down 57,'' she murmured. ''So the market is not doing good.''
 A man sitting near the front already knew that. As the librarian spoke, he clicked through headlines cast in scarily large type: ''European Stocks Crumble'' and ''Street Cracks Further.''
 When the class ended, he got up and hurried from the room, explaining that he had an appointment. A second class member, near the back, turned out to be a librarian who was just sitting in; he wanted to be sure people knew about the library's free information services.
 The only remaining student, then, was a 60-year-old former schoolteacher named Marc. He does not want his last name used, he said, because he has made his own share of bad financial decisions and owes people money. His anxiety level was high because of the week's events, he said, with no relief in sight. Even if the downturn offered buying opportunities, he fretted that he might miss them. 
 ''I realize that I've got so much more to learn,'' he said, eyes wide with dismay. And there seemed to be so little time. ''Six months ago, I thought it was much more easy,'' he said. ''Right now, it seems much more complicated. Now that everything is going wacko.''

 BODY:
Broke young college graduates with ideas for awesome new Web sites are about as thick on the ground as pigeons in New York City, but Jordan Goldman has a talent for getting noticed. Born and raised in Staten Island, he graduated from Wesleyan in 2004, spent two post-grad years in England and, upon his return to his native city, lived in 16 different sublets in the next two years. His own parents referred to him as the Wandering Jew. ''I was ordering Chinese lunch specials and dividing them into three,'' he remembered recently, ''and that was my food for days. My mom thought I was nuts. She kept saying, 'Get a job,' and I'd say, 'No, Ma, I have this idea.' '' 
 With no money, no contacts and no business education whatsoever, Goldman began where any 21st-century self-starter would: ''I Google-searched 'business plan,' and I found one and just plugged my own words into it. Then it wound up that Wesleyan has an alumni database, and so I looked for people who worked in finance and who graduated 10 or more years before I did. I e-mailed about 500 people, and I just said: 'Look, I have this idea. What do I do now? What comes next?' It was a fairly untraditional fund-raising process.''
 Actually, with the exception of the bit about Google, it was as traditional as can be, but given that he was 23, Goldman can be excused for thinking that he discovered the Old Boy Network. About 50 Wesleyan alums answered his e-mail messages, and one of those replies -- from Frank Sica, a former president of Soros Private Funds Management -- was the stuff of drama.
 ''He said, 'I live in Bronxville,' '' Goldman recounted. '' 'At 7:30 I order my eggs at this diner. I'm done by 8. Come up to the diner and tell me about your idea, and I'll give you until I'm done with my eggs.' '' Armed with only his idea and the ability to talk a blue streak about it, Goldman set his alarm and took a train to that diner. No one who has ever met Goldman would have any trouble guessing that by the time Sica was finished with his eggs that day, he was on his way to becoming the young man's lead investor.
 Now Goldman goes to work every day on Park Avenue, in an office with an interior window through which he can keep tabs on his 25 employees, nearly all of them even younger than he. This month his Web site, called Unigo.com -- a free, gigantic, student-generated guide to North American colleges for prospective applicants and their families -- went live for the benefit of tens of thousands of trepidatious high-school students as they try to figure out where and how to go to college. Not coincidentally, it also aims to siphon away a few million dollars from the slow-adapting publishers of those elephantine college guidebooks that have been a staple of the high-school experience for decades. A lot of the classic narratives about a young man's coming of age may seem fatally old-fashioned in the new century, but apparently, Horatio Alger still lives.
 One measure of an idea's greatness is how obvious it seems in retrospect, and Unigo's central idea -- that high-school and college students would much rather learn from one another than from a book -- is so self-evident that your first reaction is surprise that no one has acted on it before. As status anxiety has helped to drive college applications to record levels, the college-guidebook industry has expanded along with it, stoking those anxieties in order to sell you a way to assuage them, most conspicuously through their merciless numerical ranking of the colleges by every metric they can plausibly invent (''Most Millionaire Graduates,'' ''Top 10 Schools You've Never Heard Of''). But over the years, the handful of major players in the guidebook business -- a group that includes The Princeton Review, Fiske, Peterson's and especially the rankings-granddaddy, U.S. News & World Report -- have enlarged their operations without really adapting them to the habits of a generation whose first, and often only, source for information is the Internet. The guidebook publishers all have decent Web sites, but since the ultimate purpose of those Web sites is to sell the books, they have little choice but to be parsimonious about how much information they give out for free.
 On Unigo, the information is all free -- ''free,'' of course, understood as a synonym for ''accompanied by advertisements'' -- and with the exception of brief editorial overviews of each of the 267 colleges featured at start-up, all of it is voluntarily provided by current students at those colleges. ''For so long, the colleges have been able to have this stranglehold on the P.R. image of their school,'' Goldman said recently in his office, decorated boy-workaholic-style with nothing but an open box of Frosted Flakes and a toy robotic dinosaur. ''It's just harder to look at them as the main source of information. If you're a college student, you are as much of an expert on being a student at that college as anyone.''
 The beauty part is that Unigo has not only declined to enlist the colleges' help with this ''national grass-roots movement,'' as Goldman likes to refer to it, but the company has also kept it a secret from them. Unigo started soliciting input directly from students (under a kind of Internet alias, ''bystudents.com'') almost a year ago, and to date it has received more than 30,000 individual bits of content -- primarily reviews in the form of responses to an essay-based questionnaire, but also photos, videos, uploaded writing samples, etc. -- all before publicly unveiling the site or even the real name. So how many of these contributions will ultimately be chosen for inclusion on the site? 
 Goldman looked surprised by the question. ''All of them,'' he said.
 And that is the plane on which it is simply impossible for the traditional guidebooks to compete. Even the most student-oriented book -- ''The Insider's Guide to the Colleges'' published annually by the staff of The Yale Daily News, to take one example -- is forced by space considerations into a shorthand style reminiscent of a Zagat's restaurant review: student quotes are cherry-picked on the basis of how representative they are of respondents' opinions as a whole. Unigo, though, can host so much more material than even the fattest book that there is no burden on anyone's opinion to be in any way representative of anything. On the contrary, it is free to be as idiosyncratic and intemperate as college life itself. (Unigo's editorial overviews make use of those Zagat's style quotelets as well, but each quote will function as a hyperlink to the full-length review and from there to the reviewer's personal profile.)
 ''There's a nuance to colleges,'' said a Unigo editor, Nikki Martinez, who graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara two years ago. ''One of the colleges I'm responsible for is U.S.C. Forty thousand kids. Their reputation is pretty much for football. So my intern there submits a video about this little taco truck they have in the parking lot. I have a lot of friends who went to U.S.C., and the second I mention it they're all like: 'Oh, my God, the taco truck! I'm so glad you got the taco truck!' ''
 The textual content on the site takes many forms, but it all essentially adopts the tone and language and casual, critical spirit of an online product review. Even the most boosterish appraisals are often wonderfully unguarded. It is diverting to imagine the reactions of admissions officers nationwide as they read testimonials like this one from an undergraduate at Louisiana State University: ''We can drink any college under the table and do it with some class and hospitality.'' Or this, from a current Cornell student: ''I tend not to blame the suicides on the school. As for blaming suicides on the weather: if you're that cold, then buy a jacket, for God's sake. It's much less messy, and you don't have to write a note first.''
 It is possible to have your contribution rejected, at least in theory. But the extent to which Unigo abides by this anything-goes principle is bracing. A student at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, for instance, writes approvingly in his review that it is still ''a white school.'' The Unigo staff members shrug it off. ''If that's the kind of people that are going there,'' Martinez said, ''people need to know that.''
 Said Adam Freelander, a Unigo managing editor: ''Even the best guidebooks kind of make it seem like every college in the country is an awesome place to be, no matter who you are. And that's not true.''
 Every student who joins Unigo has a user profile, and while that profile might not feature his or her real name, the idea is that by garnering a few pieces of personal information -- your major, your hometown, your race, sex and political leanings -- a database is created that makes it possible for newcomers to search the site by all kinds of hyperspecific criteria. You can see how many other people from your own high school are looking at a particular college. You can contact the author of a review with follow-up questions. ''You can say, 'I only want to see reviews of Harvard by African-American students,' and have a choice of 20,'' Goldman projected, ''or by English majors, and have a choice of 50. So you can not only see a more comprehensive version of the school than you can anywhere else, but you can also see the school through the eyes of someone who's just like you.''
 The idea of letting students write, or at least contribute to, college guides is not brand new; in fact, the one significant modernization in the guidebook business in the last decade or so is the vogue for books that feature students' contributions alongside those of objective ''experts.'' It is a vogue for which Goldman, despite his tender years, can already claim a fair amount of credit. He is the co-editor of ''The Students' Guide to Colleges,'' a project he began freshman year in his dorm room at Wesleyan using nothing more than his own ingratiating manner and boundless energy to hire unpaid interns on 100 college campuses nationwide. They helped him to attract their fellow students' attention to the long-form, essay-based survey Goldman then posted online, offering only the promise that the three best responses to these surveys would be chosen to represent the authors' schools in print. By the time he graduated, the Penguin edition of ''The Students' Guide'' was selling solidly, but the book's success, as well as its limitations, got Goldman thinking about what might be wrought on a grander scale.
 ''My whole family chipped in for me to go to college,'' he said. ''They were saving from when I was 2 or 3 years old. That the best resource for a four-year, $200,000 decision are these books -- with no photos, no videos, no interactivity, only three to five pages per school on average, fully updated usually once every several years -- just doesn't make the grade. This is the most important decision people that age have ever made, and the information is just not there.'' 
 In early August, with the site code complete and the tens of thousands of individual pieces of content laboriously loaded onto it, a loosely organized parade of small focus groups, recruited via Craigslist, began to drop by the Unigo office. A pair of high-school juniors from Rye Country Day School in Westchester County were paid $25 each to spend an hour or so navigating the site, pronounced it awesome, something they would immediately tell their friends about, leaving Goldman and the others beaming in the conference room afterward. 
 Each Unigo editor has a list of 10 colleges (including, always, his or her own alma mater) to oversee; their most important task may be finding an unpaid intern on each campus willing to act as a liaison and an occasional reality-checker for Unigo's efforts. The real masterstroke, though, was the purchase of a hundred Flip video cameras, which were delivered to the on-campus interns themselves with a minimum of instructions. The results are not only vivid in a way no guidebook can match but also, in the way of the generation that produced them, often guilelessly intimate.
 A white student looks back on her decision to attend the historically black Howard University. Two girls at Notre Dame, one an official campus tour guide, visit several spots around campus: at each one, the tour guide gives you the approved spiel, and then her friend tells you what the spiel leaves out. At Wesleyan, the camera goes around a dining hall, and an offscreen student asks the different, socially stratified tables -- a table full of jocks, a table full of hipsters -- to talk about student stereotypes. A Princeton student sitting on a dorm-room couch, his face almost entirely obscured by a hoodie, talks about the difference between racial and socioeconomic diversity and why Princeton may excel at the first but fails at the second.
 ''In the 'Fiske Guide,' '' said Max Baumgarten, a Unigo editor, ''it'll say 'the University of Wisconsin sits on these lakes,' right, and you're a high-school senior, and you're like: What do I care that the school is on a few lakes? That means nothing to me. You look at a video, though, and see students hanging out in these beautiful surroundings, and that really changes the game.'' 
 It changes the game from an economic standpoint too: it costs a lot of money to travel far away from home to check out schools, and Unigo offers an unfiltered, detailed, often somewhat eccentric view of campuses all over the country. A 45-second video in which an unseen student pans around the courtyard at Sarah Lawrence on a sunny day and simply describes what she sees (including a student-run barbecue pit called PETA, which stands for ''People Eating Tasty Animals'') is so evocative that it makes the one-page U.S. News summary -- or the descriptions in Sarah Lawrence's own admissions catalog, for that matter -- read like junk mail.
 Unigo's staff members, as befits their age, do not lack for a sense of the significance of what they are about to unleash on the world. ''The colleges are going to have to change what they're doing,'' Martinez said. ''The pictures of the kids on the lawn won't do anymore.''
 If so, the colleges remain happily in the dark for now. ''I've got to be honest with you,'' Christopher Gruber, a vice president who oversees admissions at Davidson College, told me. ''I'm not spending a ton of time navigating those student-driven sites. It's too much to manage. My sense is that the traditional big players, like Princeton Review, are the major sources for online information too, in part because those are the names that parents still recognize. Those are the names that are going to have greater panache, and so those are probably the ones that will be turned to. The ones that we supply information to are the ones that we spend the most time on, filling out surveys for them to make sure that that information is accurate.''
 In early September, after Unigo offered Davidson and the other 266 colleges a two-week preview of the site -- ''because we don't want them to feel ambushed,'' Goldman explained -- Gruber confirmed that the letter from Goldman was sitting on his desk but said he hadn't yet found the time to visit the site itself. If he does, he will see reviews, photos and videos by roughly 230 current Davidson students (one-eighth of its entire student body) already posted there.
 ''I don't think they know the numbers,'' Baumgarten said. ''That's the distinction. The whole package is something they should be a bit scared of, but they're not. They don't really understand the immensity of it.''
 Unigo's 25 editors would be the first to acknowledge that their contribution to the site pales in comparison to that of their legion of student contributors. It's hard to find fault with Goldman's assertion that this is not just another Web site but a grass-roots phenomenon. But a phenomenon of what nature? If consumer advocacy seems like a strange modern lens to train on what used to be the great desideratum of millions of American families -- getting accepted into, and graduating from, a good college, or indeed any college at all -- it certainly speaks to the great leveling that the Internet has wrought in terms of consumption. ''If you look at it,'' Goldman said, ''you can review anything online. You can review the most trivial things, but you can't review your college. There's no platform for this incredibly important decision that costs so much money.''
 College, in other words, is at a certain point in your life the ultimate product, and the first truth with which its current and prospective students are concerned is truth in advertising. Schools are very much in the business of selling themselves -- about 150 colleges nationwide reject more students than they accept, and even those compete hard for the applicants they consider the biggest gets -- to which Unigo's reply seems to be: Look, if you won't sell the experience to us properly, then don't even bother. We'll just sell it to one another. 
 ''Empowerment,'' ''revolution,'' ''grass-roots movement'' -- these are phrases Goldman and his employees toss around a fair bit. They're not wrong, exactly, but there is something dispiriting about seeing that vocabulary applied here, as if the greatest empowerment to which young people can aspire is the empowerment of the focus group -- the opportunity to offer marketers ''reviews'' that help determine how those who come after them will be marketed to. Several Unigo employees repeated to me a sort of party line that ran like this: Who's a better judge of a college than its students? The potential counterarguments seem less important than the fact that they clearly consider the question a rhetorical one. Thus they feel no need to critique, for instance, their own tabulation that one of the most commonly voiced student complaints about today's college experience, nationwide, is the lack of sufficient on-campus parking.
 It all might seem less suggestive if it weren't for the fact that this whole ''grass-roots movement'' seems poised to make a lot of money -- most of which seems destined to find its way to the usual suspects, none of whom are part of a grass-roots anything.
 Asked whether he ever thinks twice about taking a position in a company with someone as young as Goldman at the helm, Sica -- the investor who listened to Goldman while eating his eggs and who now leads Unigo's board -- was surprisingly candid. ''I'm still not off the kick of saying we need a real C.E.O.,'' he said. ''We haven't needed one to date. We have a very active board. Jordan has listened and has acted appropriately, so I haven't pushed the point. But it's not clear to me what kind of person we want as C.E.O. At this point, we're still a development-stage company: we haven't sold a thing; we don't have a dollar of revenue. Once we see where we're going, I think we'll revisit that issue, and Jordan may end up as the C.E.O. then, or he may not.''
 Goldman has always made the case that his youth is in many ways his chief qualification. ''When I brought this up from scratch, some people said, 'Look, you're just a kid -- are you really the right person to do this?' And we tried to make the case that we're the perfect people to do it, because we're the only ones who know what college today is really like and who know how to reach other students in a way that someone 20 years out isn't going to.'' As for the future: ''Right now I'm still the largest shareholder, but I feel like it's kind of not about those things. If anything, I gave away a fair amount, under the idea that it was more important to get this company off the ground than to be able to say it was mine. Anyway, I don't have any sort of five-year plan. It's hopefully about a lot more than just me.'' He smiled. ''After I graduated, when I told my mom that instead of getting a job I was going to spend a year trying to finance a business plan, she thought I was totally nuts. She still thinks I'm nuts. But at least I'm nuts with a Web site.''

HEADLINE: Making Her Own Breaks, in Triplicate

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 IT took a while after meeting Niecy Nash for Abraham Higginbotham to decide he wanted to create a television series around her. Roughly 30 seconds.
 ''She walked in the door, and I said, 'I want to write for you,' '' Mr. Higginbotham recalled recently during a break in the taping of an episode of ''Do Not Disturb,'' the new Fox comedy starring Ms. Nash as the human resources manager of a boutique New York hotel. 
 Though he had seen her work on ''Reno 911!,'' the fake reality-cops series on Comedy Central, Mr. Higginbotham, who is executive producer and creator of ''Do Not Disturb,'' said he had not been prepared for Ms. Nash's infectiously cheerful attitude, seasoned with a stiff shot of eyelash-batting humor. 
 ''Her voice is not on television right now,'' he said. ''Niecy is a street chick. I wanted to show that ghetto-fabulous Mary Poppins character in a world of privilege and elitism and spoiled 20-somethings.'' 
 Little about Ms. Nash, 38, speaks of privilege and elitism. Growing up in Los Angeles in the economically distressed South Central and Compton neighborhoods, she was 15 when she saw her mother shot by an ex-boyfriend. Her mother survived, but when Ms. Nash was 22, her younger brother was fatally shot at his high school. 
 His death left her mother so depressed that she was reluctant to leave her bed. So Ms. Nash began performing stand-up comedy for her, in her bedroom. Soon her mother was inviting neighbors over to see the performances. 
 Ms. Nash graduated from California State University at Dominguez Hills as a theater major, but parts did not come easily until she cold-called a casting director and landed a role in the 1995 film ''Boys on the Side.'' Now Ms. Nash has three shows on the air: ''Do Not Disturb,'' which is seen Wednesday nights at 9:30 p.m.; ''Reno 911!,'' which is now in reruns on Comedy Central and in syndication; and ''Clean House,'' a home-makeover series she hosts, which is the top-rated show on the Style cable channel. 
 Ms. Nash said the difficulties she faced had strengthened her. ''I live by three words: no matter what,'' she said in an interview in the makeup room on the set of ''Do Not Disturb'' on the Fox studio lot here. ''No matter if I was the only one who had to show up to audition with three kids in tow. I did it.''
 At her audition for ''Reno 911!,'' a largely improvised show, Ms. Nash found herself impatient that the executives were dragging their feet about bringing actors in to interview.
 ''I opened the door and said: 'Are we going to get on with this? Because I have to have my kid at Chuck E. Cheese by 7,' '' she recalled. ''A lot of breaks have been extended to me because I'm comfortable in my skin.''
 That skin, of course, is a different color from that of most lead actors on prime-time television. ''Do Not Disturb'' is one of the few new network shows this season with an African-American actor in a lead role, and it is one of a handful of such shows on network television at all.
 ''I have no idea why that is,'' Ms. Nash said. ''I would like to think that television would be representative of the world we live in.''
 Mr. Higginbotham, who gained acclaim as a writer on ''Arrested Development'' before taking on producing roles on ''Will & Grace'' and ''Back to You,'' is less circumspect. ''The television business is racist,'' he said. ''It's homophobic, and it's sexist. Let's not pretend it's not. Even in this town I hear it all the time, from people who never in a million years would think they are that way. And that's why Niecy Nash hasn't had a network television show.''
 On the evening the first episode of ''Do Not Disturb'' was broadcast, Ms. Nash and the rest of the cast were on Stage 21, shooting the fourth episode. She had been working since 4 a.m., when she began giving interviews to East Coast affiliates of the Fox network. At 10 p.m., with one scene still to shoot, she spent a break in the filming dancing with Mr. Higginbotham to Wild Cherry's ''Play That Funky Music.''
 ''When this is over, I get to leave here and go home and be a real mom,'' she said during another break, referring to her three children, who are now 16, 13 and 8, from a recently ended marriage. ''I have to check in on my babies. Ask them, 'What did you do in P.E.?' Somebody glued a piece of macaroni to cardboard -- got to look at that. One of them just called me and asked if she could have a sleepover.''
 That mothering role is also the one that she fills in ''Do Not Disturb,'' which features Jerry O'Connell as the lothario hotel manager, Molly Stanton as a front-desk clerk and would-be model and Jesse Tyler Ferguson as the fragile supervisor of housekeeping. 
 In the ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' world of the hotel, Mr. O'Connell's character, Neal, is the public face of the institution. But Ms. Nash's Rhonda really runs the show.
 ''She has a big personality, which I think does well on television,'' Mr. O'Connell said. ''But she has also worked hard, and she's definitely due. She's what I call a modern-day triple threat: she can do improv, a sitcom and reality television. And when people see her they stop and listen.''
 The series is likely to face some challenges. Critics generally hated the first episode, and it is likely to require a fair amount of patience on Fox's part for viewership to grow significantly from the estimated 4.9 million who saw the premiere. In an environment dominated by reality shows, science fiction dramas and police procedurals, the traditional situation comedy -- filmed with multiple cameras in front of a studio audience -- has fallen out of favor. Fox's last foray into the genre, ''Back to You,'' starring the well-known actors Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton, lasted just one season.
 ''I think it's just like the bell-bottom; it will come back,'' Ms. Nash said of the traditional sitcom. ''If it doesn't, I just have to know that every day is a gift. And I try to pay it forward, by being of service, by being generous.'' 
 And, on the nights of taping, by sometimes climbing up into the bleachers in the studio and dancing with members of the audience.
 ''I have been getting a little emotional, at feeling that this is my destiny being fulfilled,'' she said. ''To have my son text me and tell me, 'I saw your billboard,' it's surreal sometimes. That's a lot for this little black girl from Compton. And it's worth a few tears.''

 BODY:
THE NINE: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court, by Jeffrey Toobin. (Anchor, $15.95.) This engaging narrative of the court's recent history offers an intimate look at individual justices, showing how personality, judicial philosophy and personal alliances can inform decisions, and it situates key rulings in a political and social context. Toobin, a former assistant United States attorney who is now a staff writer at The New Yorker and a senior legal analyst at CNN, probes the mystery of why a court full of Republicans hasn't shifted more radically to the right. (Brief answer: The Rehnquist Court was really the O'Connor Court.) 
 TREE OF SMOKE, by Denis Johnson. (Picador, $16.) The winner of a National Book Award, Johnson's powerful, ambitious novel about the American experience in Vietnam is structured around the intersecting stories of an array of American and Vietnamese soldiers and intelligence officers. Our reviewer, Jim Lewis, called it ''something like a masterpiece.'' '' It's not a perfect book,'' he added, ''but then, a perfect book would be perfectly safe.'' 
 THE SCIENTIST AS REBEL, by Freeman Dyson. (New York Review Books, $17.95.) These essays, many of which first appeared in The New York Review of Books, showcase Dyson's eloquence as an interpreter of science. Reflecting on contemporary issues in science as well as on its history, Dyson suggests that ''scientists should be artists and rebels, obeying their own instincts rather than social demands or philosophical principles.'' 
 THE CULT OF THE AMATEUR: How Blogs, MySpace, YouTube, and the Rest of Today's User-Generated Media Are Destroying Our Economy, Our Culture, and Our Values, by Andrew Keen. (Doubleday, $14.) Keen, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, argues that by undermining mainstream media and intellectual property rights, participatory Web sites are creating a world where ''ignorance meets egoism meets bad taste meets mob rule.'' We will ''live to see the bulk of our music coming from amateur garage bands . . . and our news made up of hyperactive celebrity gossip,'' he warns. 
 AN ARSONIST'S GUIDE TO WRITERS' HOMES IN NEW ENGLAND, by Brock Clarke. (Algonquin, $13.95.) The houses of famous New England writers -- Frost, Twain, Wharton, Hawthorne, Thoreau -- are burning, and suspicion falls on Sam Pulsifer, who has served time for accidentally burning down Emily Dickinson's house. Sam is pursued by the son of the couple who died in the Dickinson fire and by his prison buddies, bond analysts eager to write their memoirs. (Memoir is ''the Soviet Union of literature, having gobbled up the smaller, obsolete states of fiction and poetry,'' Sam says.) Writing in The Times, Janet Maslin praised ''the hilarity of Sam's narrative voice'' in this ''cheerfully oddball'' comic novel. 
 PROMISES TO KEEP: On Life and Politics, by Joe Biden. (Random House, $15.) This memoir by the Democratic candidate for vice president covers the personal -- his youth as a Catholic-school kid with a stutter in Scranton, Pa.; the accidental death of his first wife and their daughter shortly after his election to the Senate in 1973 -- as well as his political career. 
 THE VANISHING ACT OF ESME LENNOX, by Maggie O'Farrell. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) In O'Farrell's moving fourth novel, a free-spirited young Edinburgh woman receives a call from an insane asylum that is closing, asking her to retrieve a great-aunt of whom she has never heard. She takes Esme home and gradually learns about the events that led to her unnecessary institutionalization, and why her existence was kept secret by the family. 
 INTERRED WITH THEIR BONES, by Jennifer Lee Carrell. (Plume, $15.) The heroine of this ''brainy romp,'' as Marilyn Stasio described it in the Book Review, is an American scholar turned director in search of the manuscript of a lost Shakespeare play -- which may also settle the debate about the plays' authorship. Carrell dramatizes various academic theories as the action moves across England, Europe and the American Southwest. 
 THE TERROR DREAM: Myth and Misogyny in an Insecure America, by Susan Faludi. (Picador, $16.) Faludi, the author of ''Backlash,'' examines the cultural meaning of the 9/11 attacks, proposing that in their wake the United States created a story meant to restore ''the illusion of a mythic America where women needed men's protection and men succeeded in providing it.'' 
 HEARTSICK, PIG ISLAND, by Chelsea Cain. by Mo Hayder (St. Martin's, $7.99.) (Penguin, $7.99.) A beautiful, psychopathic killer is visited in prison by the cop she once tortured, who is investigating a new wave of murders with the help of a reporter. ''Lurid and suspenseful,'' with ''plenty of grisly surprises and tart dialogue,'' said our reviewer, Kathryn Harrison, although she thought the book was ''not as elegantly conceived'' as its model, ''The Silence of the Lambs.'' Evil is also in the air in A journalist travels to a remote Scottish island to investigate rumors that a satanic cult has raised the devil in this gruesome thriller from the author of ''The Devil of Nanking.''

HEADLINE: Evette Beckett-Tuggle and Reginald Tuggle

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
WITHIN a few months in mid-2001, Evette Beckett orchestrated her wedding to the Rev. Reginald Tuggle, the marking of three graduation celebrations for their children, the sale of her home and the purchase of another. It was, for the moment, a happy and busy time.
 Two weeks after the wedding, Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle lost her job as marketing director for Essence magazine. The tragedy of 9/11 occurred soon after, and the New York job market dried up. 
 ''I always had taken care of myself,'' said Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle, 52, a graduate of Columbia Business School who is now the executive director of business development for Nassau County's Office of Economic Development. After the wedding, she retained a separate bank account. ''I never wanted to ask Reggie for money.'' 
 But her savings dwindled. One morning, she put on her bedroom slippers and felt money crunching inside them.
 ''I know he said to himself, 'She won't ask me for it, so I'll just do this,' '' she said. ''He's smart and sensitive and very funny.''
 Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle is equally thoughtful. She draws him candlelight bubble baths after difficult workdays and serves on numerous church committees in her role as pastor's wife. And for her husband's 60th birthday, she surprised him with a documentary of his life that was shown in a theater filled with friends.
 ''She likes to plant good memories, and I like that about her,'' he said.
 Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle, whose quiet grace complements her gregarious husband, also serves as a ''healing balm'' for him in both of his professional lives as associate vice president for college relations at Nassau Community College and as senior pastor of Memorial Presbyterian Church in Roosevelt, N.Y.
 They now live in Glen Cove, N.Y., where Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle grew up and where their daughters drop in and out. Her daughter, Lauren Jackson, 21, is a senior at Tufts. His daughter Karleena, 28, is a fourth-year resident at Howard University Hospital in Washington, and Regine, 24, works for Tyson Foods in Arkansas. 
 After his first wife died of breast cancer in 1993, he began to develop a 14-point checklist for what he sought in a mate. 
 Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle received a perfect score before their marriage. ''The way she embraced my children, the way she embraced my ministry -- she keeps my feet on the ground, tells me 'You're not all that,' '' he said. 
 After seven years of marriage, they have discovered some things that the list did not account for. (''He's very good at budgeting,'' she said. ''I am not.'') Their biggest source of conflict is snoring.
 ''He snored so loudly one day I grabbed the phone and filmed him,'' Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle said. ''I threatened to put it on YouTube.'' Mr. Tuggle's retort: ''There aren't any pictures hanging on the bedroom walls. They've all fallen off because of her snoring.'' 
 Lack of sleep or not, the couple are clearly devoted to each other and to family life. They pray together every morning, said Ms. Jackson, the only daughter who has lived full time with the couple. 
 ''It's something that's very important to them, even if one of them is away from home,'' she said. ''They're a couple that works really well together.''
 The happiness of their daily life soon began to magnify Mr. Tuggle's longtime yearning to know his biological father. 
 Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle grew up in a close-knit Long Island family that friends likened to the television show ''The Waltons.'' But Mr. Tuggle, 61, was raised by a teenage mother abandoned by his father. They lived off cornbread and beans heated on a hot plate in the attic of an old house in Denver. 
 ''I never went to a ballgame with someone named Dad, never got a gift from a man named Dad,'' he said. Nonetheless, he earned two master's degrees, from Union Theological Seminary in New York and from Yale. 
 A friend -- an amateur genealogist and a former detective -- found Mr. Tuggle's father in Detroit in 2005. When father and son first connected by telephone, Ceotis Tuggle said to his son, ''God is good all the time, and all the time God is good,'' a statement that the son now shares with his congregation just about every Sunday. ''When I heard his father say that to him,'' said Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle, who was on the line with them, ''I thought, 'This is a miracle.' ''
 The couple traveled to Detroit for the elder Mr. Tuggle's 78th birthday. A banner on the front of his house read, ''Welcome home, Reggie and family, with love,'' Mr. Tuggle recalled. His father answered the son's enduring question, ''Why did you leave me?'' Mr. Tuggle said, when they sat alone together one evening. 
 ''I told him how tough it was growing up,'' said Mr. Tuggle, whose father subsequently married and had another family. ''And at that point, he stopped and he put his head down and said: 'You know what, son? All I can say is I'm sorry. At age 19, I was thinking about me. I ran.' '' 
 With his father and Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle in his life, Mr. Tuggle considers himself lucky. 
 ''I love Evette,'' he said. ''What are the ingredients for a life partner, when you look way down the road? When you don't walk as fast and you don't see as clearly? I know that in her, my back is covered.'' 
 Mrs. Beckett-Tuggle is equally grateful. ''He's a wonderful man,'' she said. ''I feel very, very blessed.''

Support for L.I.R.R. and the Third Track
 To the Editor:
 Your recent article on the Long Island Rail Road's third track project (''Third Track Plan Isn't Dead, L.I.R.R. Insists,'' Sept. 14) failed to include any mention of the broad support this project has throughout the Long Island region. The Long Island Transit Coalition, a coalition comprising 16 business, labor, environmental, planning, civic, health and transportation organizations, is representative of this majority and supports the third track for its environmental and economic benefits. 
 Not only will the third track increase capacity and efficiency for commuters to New York City, especially important as overall ridership is up by four million since recent gas price spikes, but it will also provide greater transit access for reverse and intra-Island commuters whose ridership numbers have grown by 82 percent and 39 percent, respectively, from 1998 to 2006.
 And while a few vocal opponents receive the majority of press coverage (or act as obstructionists), we also need to hold our elected officials accountable for their failure to fund transportation projects that benefit Long Islanders.

HEADLINE: Judgment Day

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
Mark Oppenheimer is director of the Yale Journalism Initiative and an editor of New Haven Review. He last wrote for the magazine about the New Age publisher Louise Hay.

 BODY:
Annemarie Bean, who goes by Anna and is a distant, poorer cousin of the family that owns the L.L. Bean clothing business, is the kind of professor who draws students to small New England liberal-arts colleges like Wesleyan. She is funny, enthusiastic, devoted to her students and passionate about what she teaches. Her subject areas are offbeat and slightly avant-garde, the kind of stuff that students, and their ostensibly liberal faculties, are said to find thrilling: African-American theater, the history of minstrelsy, ''whiteness studies'' -- essentially, the intersection of race and theatrical performance in modern America. Beyond her subject matter and top-notch education, including a Ph.D. from New York University's acclaimed performance-studies department, she just seems like a good fit for Wesleyan. She is an alumna of the college, class of '88; she is informal in her manner, tall and limber like a dancer, bright-eyed, the opposite of stuffy, eminently approachable; and she suggested lunch at It's Only Natural, the pride of Middletown, Conn., a regional mecca for vegetarian, vegan and macrobiotic dining. 
(Nothing says ''Wesleyan'' like lunch at It's Only Natural, where you eat bulgur wheat beneath paintings by local artists.) Bean knows that she belongs at Wesleyan, which is why she's especially sad that her students fired her.
 They did not actually give her the pink slip, of course, and for that matter Bean did not receive a pink slip. A visiting professor on a one-year contract with the African-American studies department, Bean was fired by not being rehired. Before her first year of teaching, she received a letter from Renee Romano, her department chairwoman, saying that she would be recommended for a second year if she met certain benchmarks in her students' evaluations of her. Specifically, for the fall 2007 term her teaching and the overall quality of the course had to be ''rated in the top two categories (Outstanding and Good) by at least 85 percent of the students in both your courses.'' When, at the end of the semester last December, she got only 76 percent in one of her classes and 73 percent in the other, she knew her job was in jeopardy. In January, she asked Romano if she should begin looking for another job. She heard nothing until mid-March, when the dean, Donald Moon, still wavering, asked her to write a self-evaluation.
 Finally, Bean says, Gayle Pemberton, the new chairwoman of African-American studies, told her she was out of a job -- partly because, Pemberton said, Bean had not received high-enough marks in the category of ''student effort,'' a category unmentioned in Romano's letter. According to Pemberton, not enough students had marked ''strenuous'' to describe their own effort in Bean's class. Put another way, Bean was being punished for her students' admitted laziness. When Bean asked Dean Moon what had happened, he referred back to the original criteria of quality of the course and quality of the teaching. Neither Moon nor Pemberton, who has since retired from Wesleyan, would speak on the record about Bean's case. A university spokesman, citing Wesleyan's policy of keeping personnel matters confidential, would say only that Bean's description of her contract ''is not accurate.'' But Bean maintains that her students -- about three-quarters of whom, after all, rated her class and teaching ''good'' or ''outstanding'' -- gave the administration sufficient reason to end her time at Wesleyan.
 A single mother, 42, with a 10-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, Bean found herself unemployed. When we met for health food in June, she was not sure what would come next. ''I'm going on unemployment starting July 1,'' she told me. ''I am selling my house in West Hartford. I have an open house tomorrow, because I can't afford the mortgage payments.'' In July, she and her children moved to Bennington, Vt., where they now live with her boyfriend.
 On one level, Bean's case seems a simple miscarriage of justice. A highly qualified teacher and scholar was hired, received good student evaluations, but was not rehired because she failed to reach course-evaluation standards that were created seemingly at random. But it might change your opinion to know that Bean was denied tenure at her previous school, Williams College, partly because of concerns about her teaching.
 And it might change matters further to know that at both schools opinion about Bean was highly polarized: many students adored her, and her classes were oversubscribed, but a small minority of students loathed her. To judge from her student evaluations, she was less an amiable mediocrity than a controversial iconoclast, striking some as a master teacher and others as an incoherent mess. ''I love Professor Bean,'' reads one typical evaluation. ''I learned very little,'' reads another. Or try this for a contrast: ''I've probably never learned as much in any class before'' versus ''Bean was enthusiastic, but it was not contagious.''
 Whatever Anna Bean is really like in the classroom, her situation highlights the difficulties encountered every time a student is asked to evaluate a professor. Today there is hardly any college or university that does not have a formal system for soliciting student feedback about teachers. How these evaluations are used varies by school. At the top universities and elite colleges, a good research record can easily outweigh poor student evaluations in the eyes of the tenure committee. Indeed, a frequent complaint of students at the best universities is that administrators don't care whether their top faculty members can teach (or even do teach). But at most other schools, the drive to teach students well -- and keep them happy and attract more applicants -- has elevated the role of student opinion in the faculty's fortunes. Administrators say their forms, often filled out by students during the last class of the term, before they take a final exam or receive final grades, provide relatively objective criteria for measuring how well a school is educating its students.
 Professors are more ambivalent, and they happily share theories -- some supported by research -- that what students are really evaluating is less pedagogy than whether a professor is funny, handsome or, above all, an easy grader. It hasn't gotten so bad that department heads are consulting popular sites like ratemyprofessors.com, where students can anonymously post any invective they want against their most despised teachers (and flag the most comely teachers with chili peppers next to their names). But Internet evaluations only wound egos; the official evaluations by students can end their teachers' careers. 
 According to Wilbert McKeachie, a retired psychology professor at the University of Michigan, the first teaching evaluations were most likely conceived by professors doing research on their own teaching. ''I think they go back at least until the 1920s,'' says McKeachie, who has studied evaluations for decades. In 1945, McKeachie entered graduate school at Ann Arbor, after a wartime Navy career in which his ship was hit by a kamikaze plane off Okinawa. ''My supervisor used to run a seminar for those of us who taught,'' McKeachie says. ''We talked about teaching, and we were beginning to use student ratings then. My dissertation compared three methods of teaching: recitation, discussion and tutorial, I called them. I used student ratings as well as measures on the final examination to assess the results.'' After seeing which students fared best on their exams, then looking at what they thought of their teachers, McKeachie argued that the students who learned the most tended to give the most credit to their teachers. ''It's not just a popularity contest,'' McKeachie says. ''The best teachers tend to get better ratings.''
 In the beginning, researchers like McKeachie were dealing with small sample sizes, using mostly questionnaires they developed themselves and administered to students at their own schools. Over time, of course, students' evaluation of teachers became commonplace in the United States, and it has since spread abroad, slowly, to places like England. To take a random sampling, the University of California adopted a system in 1969 and Duke in the mid-1970s. Wesleyan has used student input for ''more than 25 years,'' according to David Pesci, the spokesman.
 Are such evaluations reliable? By one estimate, there have been as many as 2,000 studies of the question. Some of these studies mocked the idea that you could even begin to assess with surveys something as subjective as good teaching. For ''The Doctor Fox Lecture: A Paradigm of Educational Seduction,'' a 1973 article still widely cited by critics of student evaluations, Donald Naftulin, a psychiatrist, and his co-authors asked an actor to give a lecture titled ''Mathematical Game Theory as Applied to Physician Education.'' The actor was a splendid speaker, his talk filled with witticisms and charming asides -- but also with ''irrelevant, conflicting and meaningless content.'' Taking questions afterward, the silver-haired actor playing ''Dr. Myron L. Fox'' affably answered questions using ''double talk, non sequiturs, neologisms and contradictory statements.'' The talk was given three times: twice to audiences of psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, the last time to graduate students in educational philosophy. In each case, the evaluations by the audience were highly laudatory. To these audiences, Dr. Fox was apparently articulate and intellectual, not a fraud.
 Of course, we all enjoy spending time in the company of charismatic people like Dr. Fox, and we're more sympathetic to what they have to say (indeed, that enhanced attention people pay comes close to a plausible definition of charisma). So the Naftulin study, although more in the realm of useful anecdote than of statistical analysis, at least shows that questionnaires might measure something related to good teaching. You may be far more pessimistic about evaluations after reading ''Fudging the Numbers,'' an article published last year in Teaching of Psychology. For this study, Robert J. Youmans and Benjamin D. Jee, who were then graduate students at the University of Illinois at Chicago, asked six discussion sections of a course to evaluate the professor -- but students in three sections were offered chocolate before they completed the forms, and those students gave more positive evaluations. It was a small study, but it was enough for the authors to sound a note of caution about the influence of extraneous factors on students writing evaluations. You wonder: If it's raining outside during the last class, will students feel more negative as they jot down their impressions of the course? What if the football team just lost a big game?
 Critics of student evaluations have many complaints: lazy department heads use them instead of visiting classrooms and judging for themselves who is teaching well; students have a bias against hard classes (or math classes, or early-morning classes); having students fill out evaluation forms, often at midterm and at the end of the term, wastes class time. But the great concern of those who evaluate evaluations is that professors buy favor not with their charm, nor with their chocolate, but with a far more valuable medium of exchange: grades. 
 In his polemic ''Why the University Should Abolish Faculty Course Evaluations,'' published in a faculty newsletter in 2004, Clark Glymour, a philosopher at Carnegie Mellon University, argues that giving good grades can even make up for a professor's lack of charm and wit. When Glymour was department chairman in the 1980s, a ''newly hired assistant professor consistently received the lowest faculty course evaluations in the department, and I was concerned for his career,'' Glymour writes. ''I knew the man and his outstanding scholarly work well, and I could guess the problems. He was not charming or funny or good-looking, and he had a deep and formal view of philosophical topics.'' Traditional and serious, lacking the levity students appreciate, the professor refused to seek help with his teaching, but he assured Glymour that his student evaluations would nevertheless improve significantly. ''The next semester he had the highest overall course evaluations in the department, and naturally I asked him how he did it -- had he changed how he taught or what he taught? 'Not at all,' he said, 'before the evaluations were given out, almost all of the students knew they were going to get A's. I see no reason to sacrifice my career to the cause of grade deflation.' ''
 In faculty lounges, anecdotes like these are as common as Obama supporters. But among administrators, the conventional wisdom is quite different. ''All the evidence,'' says Steven Olswang, a professor of education and the interim chancellor of the University of Washington, ''shows that student evaluations correlate with all other measures: peer evaluations, outcome evaluations. If they're good, their student evaluations are probably good.'' Evaluation enthusiasts point to studies by researchers like John Centra, who designed an evaluation form sold by the Educational Testing Service to hundreds of schools. For one study, Centra looked at evaluations from more than 5,000 classes, trying to discern if students who rated their teachers highly at term's end did so because they were expecting high grades or because they believed they learned a lot. ''What we hoped to find,'' he says, ''and we did, is that where there was good learning, there were good ratings, and expected grades were higher as well.'' Controlling for the expected grades, Centra concluded it was students' beliefs that they'd learned a lot that prompted good evaluations.
 But these studies have dangerous pitfalls. After all, when students report having learned a lot, how do we know to trust them? A certain kind of teacher might give students the impression they have been well educated, to the point where even if she gives them bad grades, they still praise her teaching.
 To know what's an effect of grades and what's an effect of learning, you need to be able to measure them separately. That's what Bruce Weinberg, an economist at Ohio State University, and two colleagues sought to do in their innovative 2007 study. Weinberg asked the Ohio State registrar for a decade's worth of students' grades and teacher evaluations, from 1995 to 2004, in both introductory and higher-level economics classes. Because he could assess how well students actually did in future classes, Weinberg had a better assessment of how much students learned than just what they wrote on their evaluations.
 Weinberg's findings gave pause. It was true that students who gave positive evaluations to their introductory-class professor were more likely to do well in future classes. But the reassuring news stopped there. When Weinberg crunched the numbers further (controlling for grades), he found that those who did well in the higher-level classes were not more likely to have given their introductory-class professor a positive evaluation. In other words, when you use performance in higher classes as the measurement of learning in the previous class, the correlation between learning and positive evaluations breaks down; it becomes plausible that it was the grade, not the actual learning, that got the kids so psyched about their freshman econ professor.
 Even if the optimists were right, and teaching evaluations could help schools divine which professors were best at communicating the facts of freshman biology, there remains a big problem: the sciences are not the humanities. We know how much basic chemistry students need to know before enrolling in organic chemistry, but it is far more debatable which facts, skills and habits of mind a teacher of black theatrical history ought to convey.
 This conundrum surely accounts for some of the murkiness surrounding the case of Anna Bean. She says she believes that part of her job is to discomfit students, to rid them of easy assumptions (for example, that being white, as she is, is the norm while everyone else is a minority). And in principle most professors would agree this is a laudable goal. But students don't always want to buy what teachers think they're selling. In their 2006 article, ''My Professor Is a Partisan Hack,'' the political scientists Matthew Woessner and April Kelly-Woessner, who obtained course evaluations from almost 1,400 students at 29 colleges, found that political-science students give poorer evaluations to professors whose perceived political views they disagree with. ''Students even report they learn less from professors whose views are different from their own,'' Kelly-Woessner says. ''That's counterintuitive. You'd expect that students would learn more from people with different ideas. But what the political psychologists say is that people tune out those who make them uncomfortable. It's like why liberals don't listen to Rush Limbaugh. Students believe they learn more from people who say what they say.'' Kelly-Woessner found that the bias works against liberal and conservative professors almost equally. ''There's some expectation today that a professor be objective or evenhanded, and if professors violate those norms, they can pay a price for it in student evaluations,'' she says.
 Professors across the political spectrum may pay that price. But Carolyn Byerly, a former journalism professor at Ithaca College, argues that her radical views and focus on how race, gender and sexual orientation are handled by the media led students to destroy her chance for tenure. ''I had submitted my tenure file -- and I also included my evaluations, which included nine consistently excellent peer reviews from colleagues who observed my teaching,'' Byerly says. ''Then came the teaching evaluations. Overall they were excellent from my students, but those anonymous, handwritten evaluations were singled out by my dean and chair, and 43 of several hundred were selected as indications that I had not met the standard of excellence for teaching. Almost every one of the 43 were full of gender bias: 'This teacher has a political agenda.' 'This teacher supports gay rights.' ''
 In one of the few lawsuits ever brought over student evaluations, Byerly sued Ithaca in 2001 for sex discrimination. She lost on summary judgment, and her subsequent appeal was denied by ''three white male judges, one of them 87 years old, who didn't understand why things like feminism and race and gender issues had anything to do with why I was brought there to teach journalism,'' she says. (Byerly is white herself.) Ithaca, for its part, would only say through a spokesman that her claims of sex bias ''did not have merit.'' And to be fair, it's hardly clear that Byerly's sex was at the root of the school's problem with her. She seems to admit as much when she describes the culture of the school. ''Ithaca, campuswide, is almost exclusively white, almost exclusively upper middle class,'' Byerly says (exaggerating slightly on both counts). ''Somebody like me, who comes in and says we have to question things like class privilege and look at the ways the news is covering gender and race -- someone like me is going to have a more difficult time getting along.''
 Academic administrators want many things, from good pedagogy to clean campuses to successful athletic teams. Among the things they want most is for everybody to get along. One obvious way they learn about dissension is through student evaluations, especially in classes where the subject matter might allow professors to air personal, possibly radical opinions. Byerly's evaluations at Ithaca showed that some of her students, an opinionated minority, felt no more kindly toward their white professor than she did toward the white, rich lot of them. She has a complicated explanation for why her department chairman and dean didn't like her, which involves the ''hegemony'' of certain corporate interests over the school. Whether or not that's entirely true, she could still be right that the school wasn't interested in her brand of liberalism. And instead of saying as much, Byerly's bosses had students, through their evaluations, do the talking.
 I have taught college students, and read evaluations of me, but I was unprepared for the naughty thrill of reading evaluations of somebody else. Getting to read what Anna Bean's students thought of her was like finding your neighbor's bank statements, or maybe medical files, on the sidewalk.
 Bean prepared me for what to expect. At both schools where she taught, many students adored her. (When she was denied tenure at Williams, many alumni wrote letters in protest.) Others, of course, were indifferent or lukewarm. And a small minority couldn't stand her. When I looked through evaluations of Bean's class, Blackface Minstrelsy, Then and Now, I found all three groups. The great: ''I found the teaching amazing. . . . I believe that the love and expertise that the professor obviously has in the subjects shines through in her teaching.'' The good: ''Teacher is well informed and has interesting topics.'' And the very, very bad: ''In general this course deteriorated and by the end of the class we weren't even talking about minstrelsy. Tremendous amounts of time were wasted by Bean's lateness (due to yoga class), absence or even inability to operate technology. . . . I found her completely unstimulating and unable to lead productive classes.''
 If you came across the whole pile of evaluations on the sidewalk, you'd form a picture of a somewhat disorganized, technologically inept, very learned, passionate teacher -- an acquired taste. It would be clear that her particular cocktail of traits was very appealing to some students, the ones who loved her passion or her subject matter so much that they didn't think her tendency to be late or frazzled was worth mentioning. You'd see that other students, meanwhile, were unmoved by her considerable energy and deep knowledge -- instead, they felt abused by her politics, her scattered style or her deviations from the syllabus.
 Bean told me that she had a good sense of who had written the most negative evaluations. ''I found there was a small group of mostly white men,'' she said, ''who sat there the whole time wearing their white hats on backward, sitting there angrily, who didn't like the class.'' The stereotype Bean was invoking is well known to recent college alumni, especially of wealthy Northeastern schools. There is a look popular among athletes and their hangers-on, who wear white baseball caps with the name of a college embroidered above the brim. When you see those boys in class, you do figure -- at least I always do -- that if they're not jocks, they're part of a jockish, frat-boy scene. On a campus like Wesleyan, these are the boys who have not bought into its famously liberal culture. And if you're Anna Bean, and you're teaching classes called Whiteness or Blackface Minstrelsy, you worry, despite your best efforts, that they might be suspicious of what you have to say.
 Where Anna Bean saw ''white men . . . wearing their white hats,'' Caroline Byerly saw an ''almost exclusively white, almost exclusively upper-middle- class''campus. In each case, their caricatures of the students they were paid to inspire probably say something truthful, if crudely expressed. There was a certain kind of student, they knew, who simply was not going to like Carolyn Byerly, the outspoken lefty, or Anna Bean, the WASP aficionado of blackface history. And there's a certain kind of class material that is bound to elicit mixed reviews, especially if a teacher lacks a deft classroom touch. When one student wrote that ''Bean constantly referenced certain individuals in the class in inappropriate ways,'' I couldn't decide who those students might have been. Were they minorities whom Bean asked about their own life experiences? Were they white-hatted athletes whom Bean singled out to provoke? Whichever it was, at least one student felt that ''the class dynamic was not only uncomfortable but never addressed.''
 Reading some students' overblown praise, and others' righteous anger, made me crave objective criteria for evaluating teachers. But for Bean's and Byerly's classes, there is no way to know what criteria to use. It would be impossible to perform Weinberg's study on the classes that Byerly and Bean teach. We could never agree on which higher-level classes would measure how much students learned the previous semester -- in what class can you demonstrate the skills mastered in Blackface Minstrelsy?
 If there's no consensus about how well evaluations work in a class like basic microeconomics, it's even more difficult to know how seriously to take them in classes like Byerly's or Bean's. An administrator must synthesize multiple ways of looking at a humanities professor -- one who was given no set syllabus and no canon of knowledge to convey, just a simple charge to develop students' minds in ways they might only appreciate decades later but are asked to describe in 20 minutes carved from the last class before vacation. If the evaluations themselves are subjective, so, too, is reading them; no matter what you think of Anna Bean, it's hard to be unmoved by one student's poignant critique that she ''made 'jokes' about how these evaluations will influence her position here and her children's health care.''
 It's unlikely that another 2,000 studies will end the debate over student evaluations. Just as students like the professors who grade them well, professors like the evaluations on which they do well. You might think, for example, that Carolyn Byerly would be an unwavering opponent of student evaluations, but it turns out that she's an optimist about their potential for good. Her epiphany came after she was hired by Howard University, the historically black school in Washington. There, her student evaluations have been positive from the start. ''At Howard,'' she says, ''I am above the national mean in almost every single category of evaluation -- the clarity of my material, organization, ability to communicate information, a bunch of things.'' Howard uses the latest version of John Centra's fill-in-the-bubble test sold by the Educational Testing Service, the corporate behemoth of the testing field. Based partly on her popularity as measured by that evaluation form, Byerly was granted tenure last year. ''I personally believe that students ought to be able to evaluate their faculty members,'' she says.
 Having died by the system, Byerly has now been granted new life by it. But to many, it's the system itself that is choking higher education. When students in the 1960s demanded more say in academic governance, they could not have predicted that their children would play so outsize a role in deciding which professors were fit to teach them. Once there was a student revolution, which then begat a consumer revolution, and along with more variety in the food court and dorm rooms wired for cable, it brought the curious phenomenon of students grading their graders. Whether students are learning more, it's hard to say. But whatever they believe, they're asked to say it.

HEADLINE: Meltdown Ripples Across Hudson

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
 LAST Monday, when the financial tornado on Wall Street first hopped across the river to roil the economy here, Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy sounded a bit like someone hit by flying debris -- stunned, and still patting himself down to check for missing parts or grievous wounds.
 ''It's scary,'' he said. ''And it's going to be challenging.'' Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch had agreed to a takeover, and for this city on the Hudson River known as ''Wall Street West,'' that could mean, according to the mayor's quick calculation, a loss of about 2,000 jobs at just two offices located within a couple of blocks of each other.
 The mayor instantly predicted that the damage to his city, tied more than any other in New Jersey to Wall Street, by virtue of proximity and PATH train, was not over. 
 In the next instant, however, he began pointing to why he believed that the city's real estate markets, both commercial and residential, would survive and even thrive. ''The good news is we still have all our greatest assets -- the biggest collection of very reasonably priced A-1 office space, located right next to the cultural and commercial financial center of the world, abundant and varied options on types of housing; four PATH stops, four ferry stops and light rail.''
 Over the last week, even as disorientation seemed to become daily reality in the financial world, various major players in Jersey City real estate, like brokers, developers, and analysts, said that they could find some strong reasons to agree, at least cautiously, with the mayor's optimism.
 ''No matter what happens,'' said Joe Panepinto Jr., a locally based developer, ''Jersey City is going to be saved by the cost differential.'' The economic challenges will make that even more imperative. ''If you're a big company, and things are hurting, the first thing you do is look at cutting labor costs,'' said Mr. Panepinto, who is a principal with his father in Panepinto Properties. That will hurt Jersey City, he said. But the next thing an executive considers to save money is cutting real estate costs, and that, he predicted, ''will lessen the effect of job loss.'' 
 Mr. Panepinto, along with other developers and the financial-services firm Cushman & Wakefield, said that prime office space in Jersey City often costs less than half of what comparable space in Manhattan does. Ken McCarthy, Cushman's director of research, said that the average cost of first-class office space on Jersey City's waterfront is $33.13 per square foot , while in Manhattan, it is $84.18 per square foot. For residential real estate, the difference is roughly the same.
 Some market experts guessed that the cost differential would narrow in the future, with Manhattan prices coming down more than New Jersey waterfront prices do, while others said that history suggests it always remains around 50 percent -- no matter what calamities and changes occur.
 ''I really think Jersey City, and Hoboken too, are in a really strong position,'' said W. Joshua Levering, a senior vice president of NAI James E. Hanson, a real estate services and property-management company, ''and frankly, I think what is going on right now just enhances Jersey City as an incredible cost-saving alternative.''
 Of course, all those people trying to assess the situation professed wariness concerning what else might occur in coming weeks and months. For example, by Thursday, some of them were keeping a close eye on rumblings about possible major bank mergers and noting a little nervously that speculation had begun that Goldman Sachs could soon be the lone independent investment bank remaining in the country.
 ''Goldman Sachs is huge for us,'' said Mayor Healy. ''Really huge. They've got about 2,000 people over there,'' he said, referring to the Goldman Sachs tower, the tallest building in the state, within blocks of Lehman's and Merrill Lynch's Jersey City offices.
 As the week neared a close, the overall picture had brightened a bit, he said. Some of the 1,700 Jersey City jobs at Lehman might be saved under a deal with Barclays to buy parts of Lehman's operations; it appeared more jobs would be saved in the Merrill takeover, and 200 jobs at A.I.G., the insurance giant, were evidently saved by the federal bailout of that company.
 The local residential real estate picture was also murky, with some bright spots, at the end of a chaotic few weeks.
 The city is in the midst of a huge makeover, as housing development has moved west from the waterfront over the past five years, and many extremely large projects are opening and expanding.
 At Trump Plaza Jersey City, a 55-story condominium tower, finishing touches are just now being put on an amenity floor with a lavish spa featuring a rain-forest simulator, a fitness center and an indoor golf room. Questions are percolating about how well the building will sell in light of the loss of some of the highest-paying local jobs, contractions on Wall Street, and the mortgage credit crunch.
 So far, said Dean Geibel of Metro Homes, the builder and partner with Trump Enterprises on the project, about 200 of the 440 units have sold -- with only ''a handful'' of those who signed contracts unwilling or unable to close.
 Mr. Geibel said that sales had slowed in recent months, but that one or two contracts a week were still being signed for condos priced at $600,000 and up. A 17-year-veteran of Wall Street before he became a developer, he said he did not see Jersey City losing its luster as a ''high-quality, high-amenity, lower-cost'' alternative to Manhattan -- and, he noted, between a third and a half of buyers at the building so far are ''international,'' and using their condos as pieds-a-terre.
 The Beacon, another huge residential project, is a conversion of the former Jersey City Medical Center that will eventually have about 1,200 units. Its developer reported that buyer interest had actually reignited in the past two weeks, following the government takeover of mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 ''Things had basically fallen off a cliff over the last eight or nine months,'' said the developer, George Filopoulos, of Manhattan-based MetroVest. He added that 215 of 300 completed units had sold.
 Now, with the stabilization of the two big mortgage companies, MetroVest is ''promoting the heck out of'' what Mr. Filopoulos called the deals that can be had at the Beacon, and getting an enthusiastic response.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 28, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The ''In the Region'' article in New Jersey and Manhattan copies last Sunday, about the effects of the upheaval involving Wall Street firms on the Jersey City real estate market, misspelled the name of a local developer who was optimistic that the city would bear up well. He is Joe Panepinto Jr. of Panepinto Properties, not Panapinto.

Tom LeClair's fifth novel, ''Passing Through,'' has just been published.

 BODY:
MAN IN THE DARK
 By Paul Auster
 180 pp. A Frances Coady Book / Henry Holt & Company. $23
 A few years ago, Paul Auster told an interviewer that ''I get the best reviews and the worst reviews of any writer I know.'' His previous novel, ''Travels in the Scriptorium,'' rewarded his best reviewers and other admirers with a reunion of previous Auster characters in a familiar plot of confused identity. With this new one, ''Man in the Dark,'' Auster takes revenge on his worst reviewers by making his protagonist/narrator a 72-year-old literary critic with multiple miseries. His sister may have committed suicide, his wife has recently died, and his daughter and granddaughter are deeply unhappy. He suffers from insomnia and walks with a crutch because his leg has been mangled in one of those accidents Auster likes to inflict on his characters. 
 As the longtime book editor of The Boston Globe, August Brill wrote more than 1,500 essays, but he now believes all this work to be ''ephemera.'' The only book project he ever began, a memoir about and for his family, was abandoned. Although he no longer writes, he tells himself stories in the dark to avoid thinking about the women with whom he lives: a daughter grieving over a broken marriage, and a granddaughter mourning a former boyfriend killed in Iraq. The novel is the narrative of one such sleepless night, a ''Long Night's Journey Into Day,'' in which Brill invents a character named Owen Brick, a happily married 29-year-old man who wakes up in a parallel contemporary world where the United States is fighting a civil war. This Rip van Brick must cope with separation from his wife, altered conditions -- random bombardments, very high inflation, no TV, few cars -- and quantum quirks, like running into his teenage ''heartthrob.'' With this woman's aid, secessionists from the federal government dictate a mission implausible: Brick must return to the ''real'' world of 2007 and kill Brill, who has caused the civil war by imagining it. 
 Brick's story is interrupted by Brill's memories, by his awareness of physical discomforts and, near dawn, by his granddaughter, who also can't sleep. She lies down next to him and slowly, persistently, forces him to reveal the most painful part of his past, his betrayals of her beloved grandmother. By morning Brill has, through this nocturnal transmission, finished his memoir. 
 Invigorated, Brill wants ''a farmer's breakfast.'' He doesn't realize the full extent of the punishment Auster has in store for him. Although a lifelong reader, Brill is in the dark as a storyteller: his alternative-world plot is hackneyed in concept and rickety in execution. But if his account of a war between American liberals and conservatives is sketchily imagined, Brill does no better with his personal materials, confabulated anecdotes rendered in a flat, chronicling style. One of his favorite phrases, which closes the book, is taken from Nathaniel Hawthorne's daughter Rose: ''the weird world rolls on.'' The sentence summarizes Brill's banality and lack of originality, which discourage emotional engagement from anyone not a blood relative. 
 ''Man in the Dark'' might be mistaken for a clever mockery of literary critics if the slackness of Brill's narration didn't also mar Auster's other recent fiction. Auster is 61, but the focal characters of his last three novels are figurative or literal old men. The narrator of ''Oracle Night'' walks like a ''shuffling geezer'' after a near-fatal illness; the narrator of ''Brooklyn Follies'' has moved to Park Slope to die; and Mr. Blank of ''Travels in the Scriptorium'' is a geriatric case. Like Brill, these characters ultimately manage a modest revival, but for long stretches their sensibilities are dull, their perceptions dim, their language fatigued. Feeble figures, they provide a low-energy, high-fiber perpetuation of the Auster brand. 
 ''Man in the Dark'' is a slightly new and improved ''Travels in the Scriptorium,'' which it partially rewrites in a semi-realistic vein. Both B-men occupy a context of imaginary political unrest, and both reveal themselves through their fictionalizing. But the buried associations between Brill's civil war and the family battles of his past keep ''Man in the Dark'' within a marginally interesting psychological realm, while ''Scriptorium'' is a self-regarding and airless authorial game. Yet the superiority of the new novel to ''Scriptorium'' becomes trivial when ''Man in the Dark'' is compared with a similar short novel by Max Frisch, ''Man in the Holocene,'' which is also about an elderly, desperate man who spends a night awake. The scientific and cultural expansiveness of Frisch's novel make ''Man in the Dark'' seem narrow and perfunctory. 
 After, say, 10 books, maybe novelists should be retested, like accident-prone senior citizens renewing their driver's licenses. Veterans of literary wars would anonymously submit a new manuscript to agents. Of ''Man in the Dark,'' I think they'd say, ''third-rate imitation of Paul Auster.'' Then the author might decide to rev up a first-rate imitation of his first-rate early work. Or he might write a fourth-rate attack on literary agents.

HEADLINE: Main Street Pauses

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
ON the co-op and condo-lined streets of Manhattan, where Main Street and Wall Street are one, real estate was on everyone's mind, as always, last week, but the nature of the conversation had changed.
 Kirk Henckels, the director of the private brokerage at Stribling & Associates, was traveling in Italy last week, but was on the phone reassuring a friend who was thinking about backing out of the purchase of a pricey Park Avenue co-op, even though he had already made it past the finicky board. The call followed a week of financial failure, government rescues and plummeting stock prices. 
 ''You are buying a home, not I.B.M. or Goldman Sachs stock; this is a long-term purchase,'' Mr. Henckels said he told the caller, and assured him the co-op would rise in value by the time the reluctant buyer decided to move on. 
 Mr. Henckels said he, too, was worried that the trophy apartment market might have been wounded in the financial disarray of the last few days. In this uncertain time, real estate is the safest place to put one's money, he said, after Treasury bills.
 Other brokers worried about the fate of pending sales to customers who worked at Lehman Brothers, who may or may not have jobs after the fog of the investment bank's bankruptcy filing clears. 
 Shai Shustik, the president of Manhattan Residential, a brokerage firm, represented a Lehman banker scheduled to close on a $1.3 million apartment in the East 40s in Manhattan. He was in suspense all week, but by late last week, there were no signs the mortgage had been pulled.
 After meeting with groups of brokers in Manhattan, Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group, said she had not heard of a single buyer who had to walk away from a signed contract, though one renter got concessions before signing a lease. 
 Above all, there is a sense of uncertainty. Some sellers, she said, are holding apartments off the market, worried about selling into a panic. ''The buyers are not exactly running for the hills, but they are definitely pitching their tents,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''They are waiting. They are holding off. There are many people who are in negotiations who decided to wait.''
 Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for two brokerages, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said some clients wanted to pause and take a simple timeout. ''People don't want to make a decision out of fear or panic,'' he said. 
 At the upper end, said Paula Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens, distinctive properties are drawing buyers. ''Everyone continues to keep their appointments, continues to keep their contracts and continues to keep their closings,'' she said. 
 New York suffered a huge collapse in residential real estate in the 1990s, set off by a stock market crash in 1987, which over time reduced the number of financial jobs and caused a deep local recession. For brokers who lived through those lean times, it is the possibility of a longer-term collapse in sales and prices that is most worrisome. 
 Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, recalled a time where there were 10,000 one-bedrooms ''that nobody who wanted'' but that eventually sold, many to Japanese and Asian investors. 
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm, often recalls appraising a studio that had so little value he could have put the entire purchase price on a credit card. 
 But many changes in New York City and its real estate market since then make a repeat of the deep quagmire of the late 80s and early 90s less likely -- barring a complete financial collapse. 
 In the mid-1980s, Mr. Miller said, there was a huge construction binge in Manhattan that produced a surplus of apartments. In the recent boom, he said, lenders were more careful, and a year ago began cutting back on lending for new developments, thereby curbing overbuilding. 
 Robert A. Knakal, the chairman of Massey Knakal Realty Services, noted that in the early 1990s, the vacancy rate for rental apartments was 5 percent; now it is just above 1 percent. 
 And in the 1990s, Ms. Lenz noted, New York's star did not shine as brightly as it does today. That was a period of declining services, rising worries about crime, and even doubts that a city as big and complex as New York was even governable. But crime has been declining for years, and parks and streets have been spruced up.
 ''New York was always on the verge in the 1990s,'' she said, adding that whenever she travels now, ''at all dinner parties, New York City is the most talked-about city in the world.''
 Wall Street, too, has changed since the 1990s. The legions of lower-paid back-office workers who toiled in the financial district are long gone, and there has been an influx of wealthy managers of hedge funds and private equity groups. Even the physical face of Wall Street has changed. JP Morgan Chase's downtown headquarters at 75 Wall Street is being converted into condos and a hotel, and a onetime home of the stock exchange at 55 Wall Street is being marketed as the Cipriani Club Residences.
 In the 1990s, Mr. Henckels said, the only buyers of expensive co-ops were top bankers who got bonuses. ''Now the top of the market is made up of hedge fund and private equity people,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Value of Drilling, and of Nature

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Save the Environment: Drill, Baby, Drill'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 15):
 For all of their meticulous calculations, I don't think Robert Hahn and Peter Passell included a considerable cost into their analysis. 
 To allow our nation to remain dependent on nonrenewable, dirty sources of energy -- even if some of it comes from our own shores -- compromises our posterity's global, environmental and economic security. 
 To pass up this opportunity to embrace clean forms of energy deprives future Americans of a foundation upon which they could build a cleaner and more stable world. 
 It is only in a ''comprehensive economic framework'' that fails to acknowledge these costs that the scales are tipped in favor of offshore drilling.
 As a young American who would live and lead in the world that would incur the costs of today's decisions -- whatever they may be -- I urge analysts and leaders to consider the well-being of young and unborn Americans when charting our nation's course. What is a bright future -- my future and their future -- worth in the analysts' ledger?
 Tyler Lucero West Henrietta, N.Y., Sept. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Robert Hahn and Peter Passell reaffirm what most opponents of ''drill, baby, drill'' already knew: expanded drilling, while profitable for the oil industry, would have a negligible impact on oil supplies and prices, and would need at least ''$400 billion'' and 15 to 17 years to make even this tiny impact. 
 By then, as Mr. Hahn and Mr. Passell implicitly acknowledge, it would probably have also produced serious environmental damage. Rather than face these facts, they try to salvage the case for savage drilling by proposing an oil-for-nature swap. 
 We're not buying it. 
 First, assigning an $11 billion value to an irreplaceable resource like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is ludicrous. 
 Second, Mr. Hahn and Mr. Passell don't mention global warming. Even if our nation had unlimited oil, we should not be burning it at the current furious rate. 
 Unless we sharply curtail the use of fossil fuels, the very Everglades that the writers hope to protect will be damaged or eliminated by rising sea levels.
 Given our soaring deficits and the sad experience with other trust fund and ''lock box'' schemes, it is naive to believe that environmental groups would ever be willing to trade certain despoliation now for this highly uncertain prospect of oil-financed conservation. 
 Brent Blackwelder James S. Henry Washington, Sept. 15, 2008
 The writers are, respectively, the president of Friends of the Earth and an investigative economist and lawyer.
 To the Editor:
 Robert Hahn and Peter Passell should factor a critical reality into their economic argument: fossil fuels are a bad investment. 
 As a nation, we need to move beyond the oil-natural gas paradigm. These fuels pollute the environment when they are extracted and our air when they are processed and burned. 
 As a result, our country must pay for the rising health care costs and the impacts associated with climate change. 
 The better win-win investment would be in renewable energy sources that do not harm the environment, address our energy independence and create green jobs for people across the country.
 Investment in solar, wind and geothermal technologies and transportation fueled by them would create trillions of dollars in economic bang without the bust for wildlife conservation, our climate, health, economy and long-term dependence on an unsustainable and volatile resource.
 Jill Rubin Beacon, N.Y., Sept. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thank you to Robert Hahn and Peter Passell for delving deeper into the ramifications of opening up Alaska and the restricted offshore sites to drilling. I would ask them to address one other question, however. 
 How would the financial impact of opening this area up to drilling now compare with the financial impact of beginning this drilling 10, 50 or 100 years from now? 
 It seems to me that the value of the oil will increase faster than inflation as world oil supplies dwindle. We get to use the oil only once. If we leave it in the ground for the future, it will serve to strengthen future generations of Americans, and the value to them will be higher than the value to us of extracting the oil over the next 20 years. 
 After all, those generations will have to deal with the ramifications of global warming and the legacy of debt that we are leaving them, among other issues. We should at least leave them with some valuable resources. 
 Thomas Huffer Green Bay, Wis., Sept. 15, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Robert Hahn and Peter Passell need to consider the real costs of burning oil versus the savings from the application of energy efficiencies. 
 Studies have shown that more than a million barrels a day, the writers' figure for the amount of oil we'd get by 2025 from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore, will be saved when the 35-miles-per-gallon standard for our cars that Congress passed last year is put completely into effect. 
 With many other easily attainable efficiencies in how we use petroleum, we could save another eight million to nine million barrels a day. We don't need that oil. 
 As for the value of our coasts and nearshore waters around the continent, these ecosystems are riches beyond calculation and are not replaceable at any cost. How do Mr. Hahn and Mr. Passell calculate the loss of the polar bears and the erosion of the permafrost from continued burning of oil? How much do they think it would cost to replace the Arctic Ocean ice and restore the shorelines along all of the United States as global warming worsens?
 Gary Braasch Portland, Ore., Sept. 16, 2008
 The writer is a conservation photographer and the author of a book about global warming.
 To the Editor:
 Robert Hahn and Peter Passell present a compelling and useful analysis of the costs and benefits of additional oil drilling. But I am skeptical about their vision for how additional oil revenues would be used. 
 Using these revenues to preserve undeveloped wilderness is a great idea, but I'm sure we could count on Congress to find a way to waste $1.7 trillion rather than invest it in environmental preservation. 
 If environmentalists could be convinced otherwise, we might be more willing to support drilling.

HEADLINE: From a Divine Order to the Public Good

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: MENDHAM TOWNSHIP, N.J. 

 BODY:
 OVER the next two years, the remains of a hundred nuns who belonged to the Sisters of St. John the Baptist will be exhumed from a wooded graveyard on the picturesque grounds of a convent here and transferred to a cemetery in Westchester County, closer to the retirement home where the convent's seven surviving nuns are moving.
 The spare words on the cross-shaped gravestones tell little about the lives of women like ''Emily Ahearn, Born May 22, 1913, Died August 18, 2003'' and ''Concepta Tuzzolino, Born November 16, 1913, Died December 9, 1995,'' nuns who devoted themselves to the teaching and care of children. 
 Yet the order's decision to sell 112 acres, which include the graveyard, for use as a township park is part of a trend that is showering gifts of land on residents of the New York metropolitan region. 
 As the number of men and women willing to commit themselves to lives of poverty and celibacy for the Roman Catholic Church dwindles -- the convent here once had 30 nuns -- and the costs of their retirement and of maintaining their buildings rises, dioceses and independent orders of nuns, monks and friars have been selling off large, idyllic properties to land conservation groups like the Trust for Public Land, the Nature Conservancy and the Open Space Institute. 
 In many cases, the properties were accumulated during the past century through bequests from wealthy Catholics or fire sales by bankrupt tycoons who were happy to find takers for their estates during economic downturns. 
 The Baptistine nuns, for example, acquired the estate here in the 1920s from the sugar baron George Mosle and transformed it into a school and orphanage. Now, 112 acres of the 144-acre property, under an arrangement negotiated for an $8.4 million price tag by the Trust for Public Land and completed in early July, will be used by Mendham Township for soccer fields and nature trails. 
 There are many other examples. 
 In the village of Mount Sinai, on Long Island, leaders of Little Portion, a Franciscan friary that is home to seven brothers, have been talking to the Nature Conservancy about how to preserve their 70-acre spiritual retreat near Long Island Sound while capitalizing on the value of the property so the friary can remain solvent. 
 Last year, the Town of Southampton, on Long Island, with the Nature Conservancy acting as matchmaker, bought eight acres in East Quogue that the Church of St. Rosalie in Hampton Bays had once hoped to use as the site of a satellite house of worship. Joining the 8 acres to an earlier assemblage of 64 acres has created a wildlife corridor of waterfront woodland that is protected against development.
 In Westchester County, the Archdiocese of New York, in 1999, sold the bulk of a 134-acre Sisters of Mercy convent that had once been the estate of Henry Gaisman, the inventor of the Gillette razor blade. The cost, $8 million, was shared by the Town of Greenburgh, the state and the county, and the land was reopened as the Hart's Brook Nature Preserve, with 15 acres set aside as a home for retired nuns. 
 Earlier this year, the archdiocese sold 75 acres of woods and wetlands in the northern portion of the former Mount Loretto orphanage property on Staten Island for use as a nature preserve. The deal was brokered by the Trust for Public Land and the price, $12.5 million, was paid by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The state had already acquired 194 acres in Mount Loretto's southern portion.
 ''We want to be good neighbors, we want to be responsible stewards,'' said Joseph Zwilling, an archdiocese spokesman. ''By making the lands available to be preserved as wetlands, as open spaces, we are able to help future generations appreciate the beauty and grandeur of these areas.''
 Just north of the Westchester border, in Putnam County, Glenclyffe, a 93-acre Capuchin Franciscan friary that had been the estate of Hamilton Fish, a mid-19th-century New York governor, was sold in 2001 for $7 million to the Open Space Institute, saving it from residential development. The institute has preserved the broad lawns and woodlands of Norway spruce and white pine, with their majestic views of the Hudson River and the Hudson Highlands, and also opened a 1.8-mile nature trail. 
 The institute has been inventive with the site's buildings as well, selling a school to the Town of Philipstown for recreation and the mammoth brick and marble friary -- complete with chapel and stained-glass windows -- to the Garrison Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to blending contemplation and social action.
 Sales like these are sometimes considered as almost spiritual endeavors because they preserve from commercial or residential development land that is seen as divinely inspired, those involved say.
 Sister Chris Loughlin, a Dominican nun who works on the conservation of religious properties in Massachusetts, said that government and social agencies had taken over so many of the institutional services provided by the church that using the land on which church schools, orphanages and hospitals once sat was increasingly viewed as a sacred way of serving people. ''What we're doing in saving land is taking God's creation out of the speculative market,'' she said. 
 More land will probably become available in coming years throughout the area. Joe Martens, president of the Open Space Institute, said there are magnificent properties up and down the Hudson River that once provided a contemplative ambience for nuns and friars but whose maintenance has become burdensome when so few members of religious orders inhabit them. ''With the number of people going into religious vocations diminishing, they have these big white elephants on their hands,'' he said. 
 In the case of the Baptistine property in New Jersey, the nuns closed the orphanage in 1937 and the school in 1992. They continued to live in the fieldstone-and-brick mansion and lease the instructional wings to Montgomery Academy, a private school for a hundred special-needs children. As the sisters' numbers thinned, they found it harder to manage the property. Starting two and a half years ago, the order entertained offers from developers to build on 112 of its 144 acres. 
 The nuns declined to comment on the sale. But Martin Dowd, a lawyer representing them, said the nuns chose to sell not to the highest bidder but to a group that they felt would enhance the life of the surrounding towns.
 He said that he had represented orders of nuns in a half-dozen property sales and that most often the motivation had been that a diminishing membership where the average age was, say, 70, could not be supported by standard sources of retirement income like Social Security.
 ''That's a very difficult situation, but one asset they can look to may be a very nice piece of real estate,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''They can sell that asset to assure their future.''
 The Schiff Natural Lands Trust, which runs a nearby nature reserve, got wind of the nuns' interest in selling and asked the Trust for Public Land to use its expertise in arranging the purchase. The $8.4 million deal involved nine pools of money. Now the property, which residents can start enjoying in about a year, will be run in common by Mendham Township, the Schiff Trust and the New Jersey Water Supply Authority. Mr. Dowd and the Trust for Public Land are still negotiating what to do with the remaining 32 acres and the mansion and school.
 Mendham Township, which has been acquiring open space for communal use since the 1960s and has protected 1,500 acres, was eager to see the purchase completed. The state also wanted to protect its water supply because the property takes in the headwaters of Gladstone Brook, which feeds the Raritan River, a major source of drinking water in New Jersey.
 ''It's an interesting deal because everyone kind of gets something out of it,'' said Richard Hehmeyer, the trust's senior project manager. ''If the nuns are going to get fair market value from a land trust or from a developer, it made more sense to do open space.''
 ''It comes full circle,'' he said. ''Historically, the Catholic Church purchased large tracts of lands at times like the Depression. They were well funded. Now, they're the seller instead of the buyer.''

HEADLINE: 2 Gas Stations, and a Family's Resolve, Confront Columbia Expansion Plan

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The two gas stations sit at the western end of 125th Street in Manhattan, anonymous amid rows of vacant factories and lines of cars edging toward the highway.
 Even for service stations, they are modest: One has peeling green paint; the second, chipped red paint and an attached car wash. Each has only a few pumps.
 But for Gurnam Singh, the businesses represent a quarter-century of hard work.
 The state, however, is poised to seize the stations to make way for a Columbia University expansion using eminent domain -- a concept that Mr. Singh, a 47-year-old Indian immigrant, was barely familiar with until a few years ago. 
 ''This is everything I have,'' Mr. Singh said, standing in front of one of the gas stations.
 Columbia plans to build a new $6.3 billion campus in the industrial neighborhood of Manhattanville over 25 years, tearing down all but two of the existing buildings in a 17-acre area and replacing them with glass-walled high rises for the university's cramped science, arts and business schools.
 For the past several years, the university has bought land from dozens of property owners and helped them find alternate sites for their businesses. Mr. Singh and Nicholas Sprayregen -- who owns four buildings in the area as part of his Tuck-It-Away moving and storage business -- are the final holdouts. There have been intermittent negotiations between Columbia and the two property owners.
 In July, the Empire State Development Corporation declared the area blighted, a step toward forcing property owners to sell their land as part of eminent domain proceedings. A ruling by the development corporation's board could come as soon as December. 
 The land battle is one of many struggles playing out across Harlem, an area changing fast as new businesses move in and prices rise, threatening to push out some of the longtime residents.
 While Mr. Sprayregen has been the public face of the opposition to Columbia -- holding press conferences and pledging to take the case to the United States Supreme Court -- Mr. Singh has not previously spoken publicly. 
 But Mr. Singh and his family agreed to an interview this month, saying they had become angered by the university's tactics. They said Columbia had relentlessly pressured them to sell their property and that university representatives had threatened them.
 Mr. Singh said the realization that he might lose his gas stations had prompted him to go to the hospital in January for exhaustion. In the end, he stayed for 18 days, the family said. And one morning a few months ago, Mr. Singh's wife, Parminder Kaur, 38, who handles the couple's business affairs, discovered blisters on her face and scalp. A doctor told her she had stress-related shingles. 
 Ms. Kaur said the service stations were as dear to her as loved ones. ''I don't want to sell them for any amount of money,'' she said. ''This business is like part of my family. Money is not everything. You don't sell your children.''
 While the university will not say how much money it has offered Mr. Singh to move, the family said that years of negotiations have left them frustrated and embittered.
 They said that one of Columbia's proposals was to pay them more than $1 million and to find them a site in Jamaica, Queens. The family says that the figure is far too low, however, and that the location is not busy enough.
 ''These properties are the bread and butter for our family,'' said Amar Kaur, 16, Ms. Kaur's daughter. ''If we lose this, it would be equivalent to losing everything we have in our lives. My parents have put blood, sweat, tears and time for the past 25-plus years to be where we are at in society today.''
 The family said that one Columbia official in particular, Philip Silverman, the university's vice president for real estate, had been ''disrespectful'' toward them. They said Mr. Silverman told them the state would simply take their property if they refused to sell.
 ''He's treating me like, 'This is an Indian family -- we don't know anything,' '' Mr. Singh said.
 Columbia denied the allegation, and Mr. Silverman did not return a call seeking comment.
 ''We reject completely the characterizations of our negotiations, and to be even clearer, though we normally do not discuss our negotiations in any form, we have, in fact, offered a range of specific sites including a site in the immediate vicinity of the current gas stations,'' La-Verna J. Fountain, the university's associate vice president for construction, business services and communications, said in a statement. 
 That site, however, would only give Mr. Singh an option to lease the new property instead of buying it, because the land would eventually be used for the second phase of Columbia's expansion.
 Ms. Fountain said the university had dealt fairly with each of the businesses it had had discussions with in Manhattanville during the past several years.
 ''Columbia University has successfully negotiated the acquisition of over three dozen properties in five years within the old Manhattanville manufacturing area,'' Ms. Fountain said. ''Many of those who sold their properties to Columbia have testified at public hearings about Columbia's fairness and ongoing commitment to resolutions supportive of sellers' continuing business and employment interests in New York. Columbia has a longstanding policy of not commenting on negotiations, though it is worth noting that the remaining two business owners are being officially represented by legal counsel in their discussions with the university.''
 Mr. Singh came to New York from Punjab in northwestern India in 1981, following his older brother, Puramjit Singh. He washed dishes in a Queens restaurant before the two pooled their money, buying a gas station in Queens and two others in Manhattanville. He worked days; his brother worked nights.
 At the time, crime in the area was high, and many drivers took their chances with an empty tank rather than stop at the Singhs' stations, which were robbed at gunpoint with regularity, Mr. Singh said.
 ''Everybody was scared to come here,'' he said. ''There were many, many holdups. What can I do? I risk my life all the time.''
 In the early 1990s, his brother was fatally shot during an armed robbery at the Queens gas station.
 Mr. Singh continued the business, and married Ms. Kaur, who was his brother's wife. They sold the Queens service station.
 As the Manhattanville neighborhood improved, Mr. Singh and Ms. Kaur managed to make a good living from the service stations, located in an old, industrial stretch near where drivers enter and exit the Henry Hudson Parkway. The family has bought a home in Astoria, Queens, and plans to send Amar, Mr. Singh's stepdaughter, to medical school.
 The family, however, said Columbia's expansion plans had stalled plans to upgrade the stations, because banks are unwilling to offer loans to businesses that might be seized via eminent domain.
 ''They are a prime example of the American dream,'' said Mr. Sprayregen, who owns a storage building that abuts one of the service stations. ''It would be a terrible signal to other immigrants who look at America as a golden beacon if someone could lose everything they've worked for because someone more powerful covets their property.''

HEADLINE: Changed Tax Landscape Is Luring Film Crews

BYLINE: By ADAM BOWLES

 BODY:
WHEN Grant DeSimone, 25, was growing up in New Canaan and then Greenwich, he dreamed of working in the film industry, a goal he thought would take him to Los Angeles or New York. So it was a touch of irony that his work as production manager on the biggest film of his career, ''Once More With Feeling,'' took him this summer to Madison, Meriden, Middletown, New London and Uncasville. 
 ''It ended up being an interesting benefit being from Connecticut and being able to shoot there,'' said Mr. DeSimone, who helped manage the logistics and select locations for the independent film starring Chazz Palminteri (nominated for an Oscar in his 1994 supporting role in ''Bullets Over Broadway'') and Drea de Matteo (who won an Emmy in 2004 for her role in ''The Sopranos'').
 These days, Connecticut is rising in the ranks of locations preferred by producers nationwide, spurred by a 30 percent tax credit enacted in July 2006 that applies to digital media and motion picture production, preproduction and post-production expenses of more than $50,000 incurred in the state. Connecticut's tax credit is one of the most generous in the nation. 
 Nearby Rhode Island and Massachusetts offer 25 percent tax credits and, earlier this year, New York raised its credit to 30 percent in the state and 35 percent in the city to keep pace, especially with Connecticut, to which it knew it was losing business. Then in April, Connecticut's General Assembly approved more film-production incentives, including spending $2.6 million on a film training program that would provide hundreds of in-state certified union workers to studios. 
 Since the tax credit was enacted, the state has benefited from half a billion dollars in related spending from more than 70 feature films, commercials, documentaries and television shows, said George Norfleet, director of the Connecticut Film Division. That total is more than the amount spent in all of the previous decade. And for the first six months of this year, the state's film industry has generated about $80 million in revenues, including that from seven feature films that have been completed or are in production.
 Wes Craven, director of ''Scream'' and ''Nightmare on Elm Street,'' has filmed parts of a new thriller, ''25/8,'' in Tolland, Kent, New Milford, Bridgeport, Norwalk and Stamford. Rebecca Miller, a Roxbury native, returned to her home state to direct ''The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,'' starring Robin Wright Penn, Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Julianne Moore. Filming took place in New Milford, Danbury, Fairfield, Brookfield and, of course, Roxbury, among other towns. And one year after filming ''Righteous Kill'' with Al Pacino in Connecticut, Robert De Niro returned this year for ''Everybody's Fine,'' with Drew Barrymore and Kate Beckinsale. 
 Connecticut may have the bucolic landscapes some producers are looking for, or the ample space for studios. It even has good urban scenery. But in truth, say those involved in the industry, there's one reason more films are being made here.
 ''It's all about the tax incentive, really,'' Mr. Norfleet said. 
 For instance, Blue Sky Studios, a digital animation studio that has produced the ''Ice Age'' series, ''Robots,'' and ''Horton Hears a Who!'' is preparing to move from White Plains to a 105,000-square-foot building in Greenwich, bringing with it 300 jobs. In March, a study by the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development showed that 13 productions in Connecticut from January 2006 to September 2007 created the equivalent of 395 full-time jobs. 
 But not everyone is enamored with Connecticut's relatively new Hollywood role. Both Shelley Geballe, president of the nonprofit public policy group Voices for Children, and Robert Tannenwald, director of the New England Public Policy Center for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, have questioned in recent months whether the credits pay for themselves. 
 Ms. Geballe wrote a report on the tax program in which she asked whether the state had become ''star-struck.'' 
 She said the tax credits were not analyzed regularly to determine whether the return on the investment was worth the state's efforts, and pointed to recent studies in Massachusetts and Rhode Island that indicated the credits there essentially amount to tax subsidies. Also, she said the tax structure was flawed because it does not include a cap on lost revenues and allows production companies set up as limited liability corporations -- which don't have to pay taxes -- to sell their credits to other companies in Connecticut that are not related to the entertainment industry.
 A third complaint of hers is that state leaders have been quick to back the ''glitz'' of Hollywood while not showing the same support of other, possibly more profitable industries, like biotechnology or green technology. 
 Mr. Tannenwald has recommended, among other things, increasing the state's revenue department capacity to monitor cost reporting, capping the revenue losses, using a state agency to determine the tax credit recipients and eliminating the marketing of credits while allowing businesses to capitalize on partial credit refunds.
 Still, House Speaker James A. Amann, Democrat of Milford, is helping lead the efforts to expand the state's entertainment industry, dubbing Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts as ''Hollywood East.'' For the last couple of years, these states have competed against one another. Now, he said, he planned to meet with legislative leaders in each of those states to discuss ways to compete with other states with active film industries. He also has another goal.
 ''Tax credits and big movies are fun, but it's more than that,'' Mr. Amann said. ''You have to get the infrastructure here.'' 
 Earlier this year, Howard Baldwin, once a part-owner of the former Hartford Whalers ice hockey team, relocated his production company, Baldwin Entertainment Group, from Los Angeles to Sonalysts studio in Waterford. Mr. Baldwin, who produced ''Ray,'' is working with Robert Redford on a feature film about the life of Jackie Robinson. He said there were ballparks in the state that would be suitable locations for the movie. Mr. Baldwin said the financial incentives to working in the state have only opened the eyes of the industry to the array of suitable movie locations, all of which are close to New York. He said that in addition to creating a significant economic ripple effect, the industry is good for the state's ''self-esteem.''
 ''There's the heartbeat, excitement and the creating of an environment that is promoting the state,'' he said. ''People can watch a movie and say, 'Oh my God, there's downtown Hartford,' or 'Oh, my God, there's downtown New Haven.' ''

HEADLINE: Ithaca Takes a Hard Look at Pod Cars

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
With its rolling hills, scenic waterfalls and ecologically minded college students, this Finger Lakes city can sometimes seem a green oasis.
 Until you sit in traffic. Then it seems like Washington, minus the politicians. ''There are tons of commuters,'' said Jacob A. Roberts, who rides a bicycle to avoid tie-ups and save money. ''At 8:30 and 5:30, it's bumper to bumper.''
 Mr. Roberts is president of Connect Ithaca, a volunteer group that works on community issues like sprawl, and the heavy traffic is one reason he was hooked when he heard about the next generation of automotive technology -- personal rapid transit, more commonly known as pod cars. 
 ''I thought, this is cool,'' he said.
 Mr. Roberts was so intrigued that he flew to Sweden last year to persuade industry leaders to consider Ithaca in their search for cities in the United States to test pod car systems. Last week, a group of urban planners, engineers and energy experts held a conference at Cornell University here to explore the idea.
 The first step was telling people what pod cars are. ''I say, 'The Jetsons,' and everyone recognizes that,'' said Phyllisa A. DeSarno, the deputy director of economic development for the city of Ithaca.
 Well, not exactly. George Jetson piloted something that looked like a hybrid of a flying saucer and a car. Pod cars are computer-driven electric vehicles that run on a monorail-like loop, usually suspended above roads, with stops at major destinations. 
 The power source varies from system to system; sometimes the cars carry batteries, and sometimes the power is in the guideway system. At each station, commuters can summon the car like an elevator, then type in their destination. The cars vary in size but hold an average of four people, and might cost users 50 cents to $1.50 per trip. Because pod cars are lightweight and do not make unnecessary stops, they are more energy-efficient than cars and mass-transit systems like buses. 
 The conference organizer, Christer Lindstrom, said a pod car system was being tested for Heathrow Airport in London and Hofors, an industrial town in Sweden. One could be installed in an American city within the next five years, he said.
 ''The U.S., of all countries in the world, really needs it, because its dependency on fossil fuels is alarming,'' said Mr. Lindstrom, the founder of the Institute for Sustainable Transportation in Sweden, a pod car information center.
 Industry experts say pod car systems are cheaper to build than light rail and subway systems; they also reduce the need for parking spaces, have fewer accidents and release no emissions. And the car gives users more security and privacy than a subway car or bus.
 Pod cars have their detractors, mainly light-rail advocates, who find the systems to be ugly and impractical, given the extensive guideways required. 
 Bringing such a system to Ithaca would be no small project. Getting it up and running would cost about $100 million and would require funds from a variety of sources, including the federal government, research grants and private investment. 
 But the biggest obstacles in any test city would be public awareness and political will, several experts at the conference said. For the plan to succeed here, Cornell, Ithaca College, the City of Ithaca and other interested parties would all have to agree to let their land be used for the public-private venture.
 ''I think all of the major players were at the conference with their ears wide open,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''They said they are very interested and looking forward to learning more.'' 
 His group, Connect Ithaca, is now working on the next step: applying for a $75,000 grant from the State Energy Research and Development Authority to study how a pod car system could reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled in Ithaca. Mayor Carolyn K. Peterson said city officials would wait for the study's findings before going any further.
 For pod car developers, the city has many advantages. ''It's a very progressive, forward-thinking, educated place,'' Mr. Lindstrom said. Just last week, Cornell announced it was in the process of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by almost one-third.
 Ithaca's changeable weather is an advantage for selecting the city as a test site, at least from the developers' point of view. ''You want to know how the track is going to work when there's snow, sleet and ice,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''You want to know what happens when it's fall and wet leaves are on the track.''
 Most important, Ithaca has the traffic to benefit from such a system. Cornell has more than 30,000 students, faculty and staff members, and Ithaca has about the same number of residents.
 ''I do think it would make a big difference,'' said Jake Lewis, 21, a Cornell senior who works in an information booth, helping drivers navigate the campus. ''Parking on the central campus, where most of the academic buildings are, is next to impossible.''
 The only other cities in the United States being considered as test sites are in California, industry leaders said. Developers are also considering small pod car systems for smaller applications like shuttling people from hotels to airports, said Peter Muller, president of PRT Consulting in Franktown, Colo.
 Earlier versions of the technology exist in a handful of places in the United States. One was built at West Virginia University in Morgantown in the late 1970s. 
 At the time, federal transportation officials considered it a difficult and expensive project, said Christopher Perkins, chief executive of UniModal Transport Solutions, a pod car developer in Irvine, Calif., who was at last week's conference. ''People thought it wasn't going to work,'' he said. 
 But it still operates today, transporting 16,000 passengers a day, and has never experienced a major accident, Mr. Perkins said. ''It's had an astonishing success,'' he added, ''but it's taken us 30 years to recognize that.''
 The pod car will not replace the automobile, Mr. Muller said, but it could greatly reduce the number of trips. ''I don't think any of us are going to say that cars are going away altogether,'' he said. ''But it could turn America into a one-car country.''

HEADLINE: Despite Successes, State Takes Reins in Hoboken

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
 THIS city has multimillion-dollar condominiums, luxury hotels poised to open and chic restaurants, all set against a Manhattan backdrop. And every year, they have attracted more residents and visitors. But despite outward signs of financial well-being, the state recently seized control of Hoboken's finances after its governing body missed a budget deadline.
 The mayor's office, the state's Department of Community Affairs and some members of the City Council said that ''pure politics'' had prompted the department's vote to enact ''broad supervision'' of Hoboken's financial affairs. 
 This city of 45,000 is one of only two municipalities in New Jersey whose local government is currently under state watch, according to the Department of Community Affairs. The other is Hamilton Township.
 ''It's an awful milestone in the city's history,'' said Councilman Peter Cammarano. ''Particularly for the City of Hoboken, because this was all so utterly avoidable.''
 How long the state will exercise its control over the city, and what the ramifications will be, are questions for which there is little consensus. By law, the state will supervise Hoboken for at least one year, having veto power over union contracts, employee hiring, contracts with vendors and any expenditure of more than $4,500. Whether the budget problems will be solved within that year remains to be seen. 
 Several City Council members said the budget crisis began last fall, when the mayor, David Roberts, handed them a budget with a shortfall of more than $10 million, much of it from unpaid health insurance costs for city employees. Several council members said it was the latest in a pattern of surprises from the administration, which they said was not providing them with any details of why the city was in such bad financial shape. The Council approved a budget on the last day of the fiscal year in June, past a deadline set by the Department of Community Affairs. Hoboken had been the last municipality in New Jersey without a budget.
 The state's announcement in June that it would wrest control from both the mayor and the Council stirred frustration and hope among council members.
 ''I'm not jumping for joy, but I had no objections to the state moving in,'' said the City Council president, Nino Giacchi.
 Councilwoman Elizabeth Mason, who opposed the takeover, said she was ''disheartened by this situation.''
 Councilwoman Dawn Zimmer said that the mayor had been fiscally irresponsible and that ''the City Council finally had the votes to put it to a stop.''
 Mayor Roberts, who took office in 2001, placed the blame at the feet of the Council, which he said was required by law to make adjustments to the budget proposed by his administration and to pass it in a timely manner. He refused to respond directly to some council members' contentions that he had contributed to the problem.
 ''I'm not going to go down their train of logic of why they did what they did,'' he said. ''This is all political shenanigans, and you're playing around with one of the most economically sound cities in the State of New Jersey.''
 Susan Jacobucci, a division director at the Department of Community Affairs, said that a supervisor, which Hoboken will have to pay for, would be stationed in the city for at least a year to monitor the budget. She said that the Council and mayor would still be required to perform their duties. 
 ''I'm not going to get involved in any of the 'he said, she said.' I want to make sure the mayor and council do their statutory responsibilities,'' Ms. Jacobucci said. ''It's the residents who are suffering.''
 She said that in most cases, when the state has supervised or taken control of a municipality's finances, it has been at the request of the municipality. In the past, East Orange, Irvington and Camden have also been under state supervision. Of those, only Camden objected to the state's intervention.
 Unlike those in Camden, officials in Hoboken will be required to perform their duties while the state will have veto power, the Hoboken corporation counsel, Steve Kleinman, said.
 ''We've been given no indication by anyone at D.C.A. that they intend to micromanage the city,'' he said. ''What they do intend to do is make sure that politics does not enter the process. That's what happened last year, to the detriment to the people of the City of Hoboken.''
