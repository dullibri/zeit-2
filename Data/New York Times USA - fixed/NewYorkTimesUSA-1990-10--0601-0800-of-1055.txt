HEADLINE: Alaska Is Top Oil State

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Alaska has surged ahead of Texas as the nation's leading oil producer, topping the two million barrels-a-day mark for the first time since Prudhoe Bay production began to decline in 1988, state officials said this week. Texas, with daily output of 1.7 million barrels, is now the No. 2 producer. Last summer, Alaska's crude oil production dropped to a low of 1.6 million barrels a day. But nearly every oilfield in the state has increased production in the last month, said Dudley Platt, petroleum economist with the Revenue Department.

The Merc's New Nikkei Futures

BYLINE: By Eric N. Berg

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in its latest bid to provide the broadest array of tools to help investors control risk, introduced a new futures contract last month based on the level of the Japanese stock market. Market professionals say the new contract could be a welcome addition to the investment scene given the increasing amount of investment in Japanese stocks by institutional investors in this country.
At the same time, however, they say the new futures contract has a number of problems that give it only about a 50 percent chance of survival.
The contract is based on the Nikkei 225, the counterpart to the Dow Jones industrial average. The Japanese index, calculated daily by the publisher of the Japan Economic Journal, is derived from the price of 225 blue-chip stocks like Nissan Motor and Fuji Bank. 
Investors who buy Nikkei futures in Chicago are betting that the Nikkei index will increase; sellers are betting that it will go down. So, institutional investors could sell Nikkei futures here as a way of hedging the value of a portfolio of Japanese stocks.
Such ''portfolio insurance'' seems to be a likely use for the new contract, and Merc officials hope it will appeal to pension funds, bank trust departments, insurance companies, ''any firm that has exposure to the Japanese market,'' said Angelo Calvello, a senior director at the exchange.
The Merc officials also say their new contract should be viewed as part of the much broader trend toward global, 24-hour trading. The New York Stock Exchange, they noted, is working on a system for trading stocks around the clock. The Merc is working with its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, on an after-hours trading system for futures called Globex. And the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange are working on a project with Reuters Holdings P.L.C., the British news and financial information service, to develop an after-hours system for trading stock options.
Outside experts say the new Nikkei contract in Chicago could be used for both hedging and speculating, but they see certain obstacles to the contract's long-term success. For one thing, similar futures contracts are already trading in Osaka and in Singapore. The Merc has gone to great lengths to make its contract different - the Merc contract, for instance, trades only when trading in Osaka is closed and is denominated in dollars, not yen.
Still, the history of futures exchanges trying to compete against other exchanges that already dominate the market for a specific contract is discouraging; most efforts have failed. Experts say the roughly 800 contracts a day that have traded in Chicago are not enough to sustain the contract over the long term.
''It's a decent start, very respectable for the first few weeks,'' said John McCormick, a former market maker at the Merc. ''But it's still not clear whether the contract will make it or not.''
Also, some people consider it a liability that the Merc contract trades only when the Japanese stock market is closed. That is because many investors like to arbitrage between the two markets, buying in one market and selling in another to try to exploit price differences. Indeed, one reason the Merc's Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract is so successful is that it allows investors to arbitrage between the futures market in Chicago and the New York Stock Exchange, which operate concurrently.
Then, too, there is concern about the Nikkei 225 itself. The index is ''price weighted,'' meaning that it does not take account of the number of shares outstanding for any given company. On the other hand, the ''capitalization weighted'' indexes, like the Topix index of some 1,100 shares generated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, does take account of shares outstanding. Most money managers assemble portfolios of stocks whose value more closely tracks indexes like the Topix than the Nikkei.
''That's why, if I wanted a proxy, I would probably buy futures based on the Topix,'' said Eric Seff, a managing director at the Chase Investors Management Corporation, a New York money management firm. A futures contract tied to the Topix recently began trading at the Chicago Board of Trade.
Although the Topix contract could prove to be stiff competition for the Merc's contract, many market experts remain hopeful that Nikkei futures will do well. The Nikkei contract has been designed so that it is relatively easy for local market makers in S.& P. 500 futures to switch pits and begin dealing in Nikkei futures.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Mostly Lower; Dow Up 6.68

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Nervousness over quarterly earnings, conflicting news on the Persian Gulf and the budget impasse combined yesterday to drive stock prices through a choppy day.
By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose just 6.68 points, to 2,387.87. Trading volume rose to 161.3 million shares, from 149.6 million on Tuesday.
But 833 stocks fell and 659 rose. Only 6 reached a new high while 248 fell to new lows. 
Among the lows were Citicorp, in a weak bank group; Sallie Mae, which is under investigation by the FBI; American Express, and American General, the big Texas insurer that took itself off the block last month.
 
Mainly Blue-Chip Gains
While the rise in the Dow was a weak three-tenths of 1 percent, the S.&P. 500 declined slightly, suggesting that what little gain there was came from the blue chips.
Smaller stocks slid, with the American Stock Exchange market value index down four-tenths of 1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index was up four-tenths of 1 percent.
One trader remarked the other day that people were buying just blue chips and that ''even if they go down, they've got good stuff.''
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said heavy computerized buying programs raised the Dow 22 points. Close to half of the gain came in buying during an eight-minute wave just after 11:30.
Stocks fell initially, rose a bit, fell back again, but began rising sharply just before 11 A.M. as traders became convinced that Congress and the President would finally be able to work out their differences on a budget package by Friday.
 
Traders' Expectations
Traders seemed almost certain that once the budget is set, the Fed would lower interest rates, pushing up stocks sharply.
Except for weakness against the yen, a steady dollar plus narrow bond gains and declining oil prices gave the market a brief lift. But by 12:30, after the Dow had climbed 32 points from its low, it began falling.
Explaining what happened, Peter J. Canelo, investment strategist for Bear, Stearns & Company, said: ''The market's trying to make a low. It's testing the lows of late September. But having just made a new low last week, it's not going to run away.
''Fundamentally, there's good reason to think the market will test that low successfully - and head higher over the next several weeks.''
He said that because of ''ample supply,'' oil prices reached a trading peak last Wednesday of $41.15 a barrel. By yesterday prices had dropped almost $5 a barrel. to $36.25. Yesterday alone it dropped $2.17.
Moreover, Mr. Canelo said, ''bond yields are coming down,'' standing unchanged yesterday at 8.88. The implication was that with rates falling, investors would be less likely to switch more money from stocks.
And, he said, ''We're seeing some stabilization in the dollar after coming down for the last three weeks.''
 
Nike Joins the Big Board
Nike, the athletic shoe producer, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, ended unchanged at 26, with 1.03 million shares changing hands.
Citicorp, which fell 1 1/8 Tuesday after reporting a 38 percent drop in profits, topped the Big Board active list again yesterday, falling 1/4, to 12 3/4, after a new low of 12 1/4. Arthur P. Soter, analyst for Morgan, Stanley & Company, downgraded the stock.
Some 11.3 million shares changed hands, including a million shares in 79 blocks of at least 10,000 shares each, suggesting that practically all of the activity came from wealthy investors or big financial institutions.
First City Bancorp of Texas, headed by A. Robert Abboud, plunged 2 3/4 in heavy trading, to 5 7/8, after hitting a new low of 4 7/8. It reported a third-quarter loss of $101.9 million.
Sallie Mae, the second-most-active Big Board stock, fell 3/4, to 35 3/4, with 4 million shares changing hands and the stock hitting a new low of 33 1/2. It rejected loan-fraud allegations in Kansas as ''without merit.''
 
Rockefeller Center Surges
Rockefeller Center Properties rose 1 3/4, to 17 1/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported that David Rockefeller had more than doubled his investment in the real estate trust.
General Electric, which fell 2 7/8 Tuesday after a 9 percent rise in profits, bounced back 1 1/8, to 52 5/8.
Household International fell 2 3/8, to 21, and Georgia-Pacific 2, to 26, after a new low of 25 3/8.
MCI headed the Nasdaq list, down 1 1/8, to 29 5/8, on 5.8 million shares after reporting a loss of $168 million.
In a strong high-tech group, Apple Computer rose 1 1/2, to 26 1/2; Microsoft 1 7/8, to 56 1/2; Sun Microsystems 2 1/8, to 21 1/2, and AST 1 1/2, to 16 1/2. Intel rose 1, to 32; Novell 1 3/8, to 20 7/8, and Quantum 1 3/8, to 14 1/2. I.B.M. rose 1 3/8, to 100 3/4, in heavy trading.
 
Tokyo Stocks Rise as Dollar Falls
TOKYO, Thursday, Oct. 18 (Reuters) - Japanese stock prices rose today as the dollar continued to plunge against the yen.
The Nikkei index of 225 stocks gained 507.72 points, or 2.13 percent, to close at 24,367.08.
The dollar lost more than one yen today on active selling by banks. It was also lower against most other leading currencies.
At midday in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 124.25 yen, down from Wednesday's close of 125.43 yen in New York. Earlier Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar fell more than two yen to close at 125.80 yen.
''Nobody expected the dollar to fall through 124.70 yen so fast in Tokyo today,'' one dealer said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading yesterday, as dealers wrestled with a number of conflicting developments.
A drop in oil prices, a stable dollar and the continued push in Washington to adopt a Federal budget were all seen as positives by market participants.
At the same time, however, economic data released yesterday, particularly an increase of two-tenths of a percent in industrial production in September, were somewhat stronger than anticipated. Most analysts had been expecting the factory output numbers to show a slight decline. 
''It's kind of a mixed bag,'' a government bond trader said. ''In the past few days there has been a bit of a pickup in demand for bonds, but for the most part everybody is sitting around waiting for something to happen in Washington or the Middle East.''
Investor uncertainty may be the least of the problems.
 
Toll on Economy Seen
In a luncheon meeting with clients yesterday, Anthony J. Vignola, chief economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company, suggested that the lengthy process of groping for solutions to the Kuwait and budget problems was probably taking a toll on the economy.
''Dithering over the budget is doing as much to undermine consumer confidence as the Middle East,'' he said. ''And the longer the status quo continues, the worse the economic outlook becomes.''
In a revised forecast, Mr. Vignola said the economy had slipped into a mild recession that will run through the middle of 1991. The risk, he added, is that the downturn ''will be longer and deeper'' than the firm expects.
On the assumption that a budget and an increase in the Federal debt ceiling will be passed in time, the Treasury said yesterday that it would auction a record $12 billion of new two-year notes on Oct. 24.
While that auction may take place on schedule, analysts said the prospects were dim that today's sale of one-year Treasury bills would be held.
Market participants today will probably get fresh evidence that inflationary pressures continued in September.
Most economists are projecting that the Consumer Price Index, which is expected to be released this morning, jumped seven-tenths to eight-tenths of a percent in September, pushed by last month's big increase in oil prices. The index rose by eight-tenths of a percent in August.
 
'Expecting Bad News'
Given the market's current state of paralysis, some analysts said that reaction to a bad inflation number could well be slight.
''I really wonder if the numbers will be that important, because everybody is expecting bad news,'' said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Ramirez Capital Consultants. ''I don't think the consumer price numbers will tell us anything we didn't already know about inflation.''
Traders did not make much of an effort yesterday to prepare for the consumer price statistics by selling bonds, the securities which are generally most sensitive to evidence of worsening inflation.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 5/8, up 3/32, to yield 8.88 percent. Late Tuesday the issue was offered at the same yield.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 100 2/32, unchanged from late Tuesday, to yield 8.73 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 13/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.89 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to up slightly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.18 percent, up 3 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged at 7.19 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.10 percent.
 
Corporate Offering
In the corporate bond market, a unit of the First Chicago Corporation offered $800 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 9 percent notes, which have an expected maturity date of April 15, 1993, were priced at $99.625 to yield 9.18 percent, 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of some bank debt issues, including Citibank, came under selling pressure yesterday. Aside from bank issues, prices of most other securities were little changed on the day, the traders said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, participants said that prices of most actively quoted issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in slow trading.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plunges Against Yen; Gold Prices Move Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen yesterday and finished mixed against other leading currencies in busy trading.
Gold prices moved higher after tumbling more than $25 an ounce earlier this week. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fetched $366.70 an ounce, up $4.70 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $366.10 an ounce, up $2.10. 
But much attention focused on the Japanese yen, which rose significantly against the dollar. Traders said Japanese portfolio managers were bringing their money home to try to support a weakening stock market and banks that had experienced declines in their capital ratios.
''People expect the Ministry of Finance to keep yen interest rates fairly high,'' which attracts investors to Japan, said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
In addition, there is the belief that ''U.S. and Japanese officials have agreed to an orderly dollar decline, and they have been tolerating it,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
The dollar fell sharply in Tokyo, settling at 125.80 yen, down from 128.05 yen on Tuesday. Later in London, it fell further, to 124.85 yen. In New York, the dollar closed off its lows at 125.43 yen but was still down from 126.79 yen on Tuesday.
Traders said a Government report showing a better-than-expected rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in United States industrial production in September helped halt the dollar's slide, even though a 7.5 percent spurt in automobile production masked overall weakness in manufacturing.
The report hinted that the Federal Reserve might have less room to ease interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to support the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities more attractive to investors.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9650, from $1.9575 late on Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.9615 to buy a pound, less expensive than $1.9655 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Tuesday, included: 1.5125 German marks, up from 1.5115; 1.2720 Swiss francs, down from 1.2770; 5.0680 French francs, up from 5.0660; 1,132.50 Italian lire, down from 1,132.75, and 1.1683 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1564.
In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $366.50 an ounce, from $364.25 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $366.20, from $362. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 8.52 cents to close at a bid $367.81.
On the New York Comex, silver prices also rose, with the contract for current delivery settling at $4.198 an ounce.

HEADLINE: He Took The Journal in New Directions

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Slim, dapper and understated, Warren H. Phillips presided for 33 years over a sharp expansion of both The Wall Street Journal and its parent, Dow Jones & Company, while insisting that the company remain true to the principles with which the newspaper was founded 101 years ago.
He became managing editor of The Journal in 1957, executive editor of Dow Jones publications in 1965, and then chief executive of Dow Jones in 1975. In all these positions, he insisted that timeliness, reliability, independence and journalistic fairness should remain the hallmarks of a company started in 1882 by Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones as a hand-delivered financial-news-bulletin service. 
In an indication of his temperament, Mr. Phillips aggressively espoused new technology, like the use of satellites to send page images, and consistently pushed the company into new ventures, while at the same time preserving a vintage Royal manual typewriter at his desk - a reminder of the roots of The Journal's enterprise and his own days as a foreign correspondent from 1949 to 1951 in Germany, Britain and elsewhere.
When he became managing editor at the age of 30, The Journal's circulation was just over 500,000 and it was the ninth-largest paper in the United States. Today, it is the country's leading paper, with a circulation of just under two million. Dow Jones's annual revenue was $238 million when he became chief executive 15 years ago; last year it was $1.7 billion. Net income increased more than five fold in the 1980's, and Dow Jones was transformed into a global media company.
Mr. Phillips, who was often seen in the newsroom, was also able to step back from day-to-day events, taking the company in new directions. He seemed to take as a precept the words in The Journal's first issue of 1889: ''We appreciate the confidence reposed in our work. We mean to make it better.'' During the 1970's, Dow Jones acquired a chain of small-town dailies (Ottaway Newspapers Inc.), a book company (Richard D. Irwin), and established its first overseas edition, the Hong Kong-based Asian Wall Street Journal. During the 1980's, it started a European edition based in Brussels, and completed the $1.6 billion purchase of Telerate, a global purveyor of financial information.
 
Move Questioned
At a time of sharp economic downturn, during which Telerate's performance has suffered and its purchase price appears high, this acquisition is being questioned by some.
The Journal was consistently updated, evolving into a three-section newspaper that went well beyond its original mission of covering just business and finance.
Mr. Phillips, who was the son of a New York garment worker and left high school at 15 before later completing an economics degree, had a broad view of what could be useful or interesting to the business community. This was reflected in a wide range of pieces. A quirky unpredictability, combined with writing that was snappy while never vulgar, became a characteristic of The Journal.
The paper added coverage of personal finance, technology, marketing and law. It started a Leisure & Arts page. To save time for readers, it introduced indexes and graphics. And it vastly expanded international coverage.
Through all these changes, The Journal's message on the editorial page remained broadly unchanged. As summed up last year in a statement, by Mr. Phillips and the new chief executive, Peter R. Kann, this was: ''Less regulation, more entrepreneurship, lower taxes, freer trade, stronger military defense, more confidence again in America's ability to lead the free world.''

With bipartisan support, the Senate approved a comprehensive budget package early this morning that would raise the taxes or cut the benefits of nearly all Americans.
The bill, passed by a vote of 54 to 46 at about 1:30 this morning, was sent to a conference committee and a final confrontation between the White House and Congress over who will pay for deficit reduction.
Senior senators and representatives immediately started preliminary talks to work out the many differences between the Senate measure and the one Democrats rammed through the House of Representatives on party-line votes Tuesday.
 
Another Midnight Deadline
It is unlikely that the conference committee will finish its work by midnight tonight, when the Government's authority to spend money expires. But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush would be willing to sign an extension of appropriations through the middle of next week if the conferees seemed to be making ''satisfactory progress.'' 
That reversed the position the President took in campaign stops this week. Then, he said he was prepared to close down the Government again if Congress did not meet the deadline. Two weekends ago, Mr. Bush suspended most Government services for three days to keep pressure on Congress.
The House approved stopgap legislation tonight that would continue the Government's spending authority through Oct. 24, and the Senate, which recessed soon after the vote on the budget measure, is expected to follow suit on the stopgap legislation later today.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, have no vote in the conference. But they will be central figures when the negotiations get tricky over the next few days, looking over the lawmakers' shoulders at every turn.
 
Tax Bite on the Wealthy
The House bill, which President Bush has insisted he would veto, would raise the income taxes of nearly all Americans, but place the brunt of the new tax bite on the wealthy.
The Senate bill, which the President said he would support Thursday, would not affect the income taxes for most people, but would hit the middle class by more than doubling the Federal gasoline tax and by cutting Medicare benefits.
Senate leaders of both parties managed over two days to beat back several amendments that would have made the moderate Senate bill more like the liberal House version.
Both versions are supposed to cut the Federal deficit, now about $300 billion, by $40 billion this year and $500 billion over five years through a range of tax increases and spending reductions.
Even before the first meeting of the conferees, lawmakers were angling for position Thursday and reaching for compromises.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and a member in the conference, said at a meeting of about 50 Democratic leaders that they should be prepared for substantial compromises to reach an outcome that could pass the more conservative Senate and that could be signed by the President.
 
Most Favored Compromise
According to people who were at this meeting of the Democratic whip organization, some firebrands argued that the conferees should adopt a bill that would invite a Presidential veto and force Mr. Bush to defend it two weeks before the Congressional elections. But that was said to be the minority view, and most of the Democrats favored striving for a good compromise.
Speaking to a group of White House interns, Mr. Bush said that the ''soak the rich'' oratory of Democrats in the House and many in the Senate was a ''smoke screen to try to hide their effort to raise the income taxes of ordinary working Americans.''
Mr. Bush said he opposed the House bill, ''not because I want to help the rich, but because I want to help everyone.''
The House bill would suspend for one year the adjustment of tax brackets and personal exemptions for inflation in a step that would cost a few hundred dollars a year in extra taxes for middle-income taxpayers. But by raising the top tax rate, increasing the alternative minimum tax and levying a surtax on millionaires, the House bill would result in a cost to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers - those with incomes of more than $200,000 - of about $11,000 a year in additional taxes.
A study by the nonpartisan staff of the Congressional Joint Tax Committee shows that the House bill would increase the taxes of those with incomes of more than $200,000 by 7.4 percent, compared with 3.7 percent under the Senate bill. The taxes of households with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 would be raised 1 percent under the House bill and 2.7 percent under the Senate bill.
Just as Mr. Rostenkowski was preparing his troops for a compromise, so was Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader.
 
'The Best We Can'
Arguing on the Senate floor Thursday against several Democratic amendments that would have made the Senate bill more like the House version, Mr. Mitchell said he, too, favored higher tax rates and a larger burden on the wealthy and hoped that would be the outcome of the conference.
''We can't guarantee a result in conference, but we're going to do the best we can,'' Mr. Mitchell told the Senate.
But the majority leader went on to say, ''We must recognize what the realities are,'' specifically that the President vowed to veto a final measure that would raise the top tax rate to 33 percent from 28 percent.
''I don't agree with the President,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''I think he's wrong. But that is the reality.'' The most prominent of the amendments rejected by the Senate Thursday was offered by Senator Al Gore, a Democrat from Tennessee. Defeated on a procedural vote of 55 to 45, it would have raised taxes on the rich and used the revenue to limit the increase in the gasoline tax and reduce cuts in Medicare benefits.
 
A Big Amendment's Fate
Thirty-seven Democrats and eight Republicans voted for Mr. Gore's amendment; 18 Democrats and 37 Republicans voted against it.
Senate leaders of both parties promised last week that they would work to defeat all amendments, and they did so. Had they not made such a pledge, the bill would have died in the Finance Committee.
The toughest challenges to their compact probably came late Wednesday night. One amendment then was similar to Mr. Gore's. Another would simply have scrapped the part of the bill that would raise the gasoline tax. Both were defeated handily. These are among the main elements of the Senate bill:
* An increase in the Federal gasoline tax to 18.5 cents in 1992 from 9 cents now.
* A doubling of the annual Medicare deductible, to $150 from $75. The monthly Medicare premiums the elderly pay for insurance against doctors' bills, now $28.60, would rise each year as medical costs increase.
* An increase to $89,000 from $51,300 in the amount of wages subject to the 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare.
* A 10 percent luxury tax on automobiles costing more than $30,000, boats costing more than $100,000, private planes costing more than $250,000, and furs and jewelry costing more than $5,000.
* Tax breaks totaling $3.5 billion over five years to encourage oil and gas production. They would not become effective unless the price of oil, now more than $40 a barrel, falls below $34.
* A limit on itemized deductions for affluent taxpayers. Those taxpayers' deductions would be reduced by 5 percent of the amount of their adjusted gross income above $100,000.
* Requirements that all state and local employees pay Medicare taxes and that those not in a public employee retirement system pay Social Security taxes.
* Higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
* A $15 billion cut in agriculture programs.
* An expansion of tax credits for poor workers.
The measure also would impose a variety of user fees for Government services, including a charge for commercial use of data from the National Weather Service.

HEADLINE: Viewing Chaos in the Capital, Americans Express Outrage

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 17

 BODY:
What will happen when Don Campbell, a 67-year-old farmer from Williamsville, Ill., enters the voting both in November?
''It's sad,'' he said, as he sat atop a roaring tractor waiting to dump a trailer load of soybeans at the farmers co-op, ''but I feel like going in there and just voting against every incumbent on the list.''
Though Williamsville is tiny, Mr. Campbell's is not a voice in the wilderness. In a 1,200-mile journey by automobile from Houston to Chicago, conversations with nearly 100 people from all walks of life found that the budget battle in Washington has awakened powerful anxieties and discontent.
The budget stalemate, many people said, is merely indicative of far greater problems. They expressed a foreboding about the economy, worries and impatience over the Middle East crisis and, most of all, a bitter disillusionment with political leadership at all levels. Still, news of the impasse in the nation's capital, like a magnifying glass that intensifies sunlight into one burning spot, is focusing people's emotions. 
 
Life Does Go On
''I don't try to keep up with what they're doing in Washington anymore,'' said Joseph Lewis Tucker, 69, as he tended the roadside stand where he sells produce near Henning, Tenn. ''There's not a thing I or anyone else can do about it.''
The anger is not so intense that it disrupts the rituals and joys of daily life. Last weekend there were celebrations for the birth of a calf to Daisy the cow in the petting zoo at the Piney Woods Fair in Lufkin, Tex. Convention-goers filled the lobby bar at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis with chatter and laughter. And the flag was saluted at hundreds of high school football games.
But the mere mention of the budget impasse can ignite uncommon rage. For instance, Jerry Barber greeted customers at her bookstore in Texarkana, Tex., with friendly grace, but when asked whether she was following the news on the budget, she responded sharply: ''I sure am paying attention, because I know they can damn well cut that budget. I'll be perfectly willing to listen to talk about raising taxes, but not until they cut back, and I'm watching them.''
Like many people, Ms. Barber, who is 53 years old, seemed almost entirely preoccupied with the tax proposals without paying much attention to the spending cuts under consideration. Except for the proposed gasoline tax, people generally do not mention any of the specific measures being debated, although there is a vague sense that the taxing of the rich is at issue. Nor did anyone offer specific suggestions of their own on how the budget deficit should be reduced.
No one person, event or institution was singled out to bear the blame. President Bush was criticized not so much for his role in the budget debate as for his failure to justify the reversal of his ''read my lips'' campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
''I am a solid Bush supporter,'' said Mark Wilcox, 54, a marketing executive from Kennebunk, Me., who was in St. Louis on Monday for a business meeting. ''But I think he's really hurt himself because he didn't come out at the beginning and deal with the people honestly and say: 'I made a mistake. There will have to be tax increases.' ''
Other people encountered during a five-day journey through a slice of America's midsection voiced similar feelings.
 
Houston
 
In Bush Country, Sense of Betrayal
In Houston's affluent Memorial neighborhood, which George Bush once represented in Congress, the wives of lawyers, oil-company executives and other professionals gather each morning in the parking lot of the Pines Presbyterian Pre-School to chat after they have dropped off their children.
Talking to two friends across the hood of a station wagon, Denise Kleypas, 32, said: ''I think what's going in Washington is so frustrating. On the one hand, you have these politicians saying that they are doing what the people want, but all that means is that each one of them is trying to get their piece of the pie, their own little programs so they can get re-elected. No one wants to make the really tough decisions.
''Increased taxes are going to be necessary, that's obvious. But Mr. Bush did say he was not going to raise taxes. He said that a lot. So now what does it mean to vote for him or anybody else? It makes you think we need a real shakeup in the whole system.''
A woman who would identify herself only as Laura P. because ''my husband is an attorney and he wouldn't like the publicity,'' said: ''We're barely making it with the taxes we have to pay now, and so it's real aggravating not to know when the tax increases are going to stop. What gives them the right anyway to raise taxes when we don't have any say in how it is spent?''
Another woman who declined to give her name, interjected: ''I saw a lady the other day buying beer and potato chips with food stamps, and then she drove away from the market in a $25,000 car. It wouldn't bother me so much what they were spending if I thought they were halfway careful about how they spent it.''
She added, ''I don't blame Bush or Congress more than the other. I think the blame is on everyone who let it get to this point, including we the people who have allowed the politicians to run our lives.''
 
Jefferson, Tex.
 
Yellow Ribbons, Fading Spirits
Train whistles hooted in the distance, and the sweetly fetid smell of Big Cypress Bayou blew in on the evening breeze as the Jefferson High School band gave a stumbling rendition of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' The missed notes did nothing to diminish the cheers that marked the start of a Friday night football game in Jefferson, Tex.
For many youngsters like those at the game, joining the armed forces has traditionally been the fastest way out of East Texas poverty, and yellow ribbons adorn many homes and storefronts in remembrance of Jefferson people who are now in the Middle East.
Military service took on a new meaning this summer. ''All of a sudden, signing up doesn't just mean a paycheck and job training,'' said John Wright, a 42-year-old speech teacher who was collecting tickets at the gate of the football field.
He added: ''Everybody thought going to fight Iraq was going to be another quick-and-dirty, like Panama or Grenada. That was great. Now it's sinking in that they might go play in the sand dunes, and no one is really interested in signing up to fight a war.''
 
'Wish They'd Hurry Up'
Bo Byrd, an 18-year-old junior who has a cousin and four friends serving in the operation, has long planned to enlist. ''I think if we just go fight this war we went over there to fight, we wouldn't be having the problem we have now of those men sitting in the desert for no reason,'' he said.
Tugging on the brim of his camouflage hat, he said, ''I wish they'd hurry up and do something, because a couple of more months and there's going to be no sense to it.''
Kenneth R. Carver, 67, retired to Jefferson after 37 years in the Air Force. Wearing an old flight jacket and waiting for the game to begin, he too was worried: ''If it continues on as the status quo, you are going to see the support break up both here and around the world. It will become a political problem, and that's bad.''
The budget impasse, he said, ''is just making things worse because it's draining away people's faith in the Government just when we may need every bit of it for this crisis overseas.''
Asked if he had a solution for the budget problem, Mr. Carver thought for a moment and then said gravely, ''What I'd like to see, and I know it can't happen, is for every single member of Congress to get kicked out so we could start with a whole new group.''
 
Arkadelphia, Ark.
 
Sick of Hearing The Politicians
Arkadelphia, Ark., population 9,150, is a little more prosperous than many of the farming towns in the Southern Arkansas clay country because it is home to two universities and a little manufacturing.
Ruben Fendley's two-chair barbershop sits in a shaded neighborhood of old clapboard houses. It is a busy place on a Saturday afternoon. A small, neatly groomed man of 58, Mr. Fendley is dismayed.
''No one has bothered to explain what this budget thing is all about,'' he said. ''Basically, all you hear is the Republicans blaming the Democrats and the Democrats blaming the Republicans.''
Jimmy White, a 57-year-old machine tool operator who was getting his hair cut, broke in. ''Heck, all they want is more money to spend around so they can get themselves re-elected, and that's all it is.''
Asked if there were any politicians that any of those present admired, Mr. White replied, ''The last one I liked was Everett Dirksen,'' the Illinois Republican Senator who died in 1969. Mr. Fendley said, ''I can't think of any of them I've liked recently, because I've never admired a man who is not doing 100 percent of what he's supposed to be doing, and none of them are.''
Laws that would limit terms of office might help, the barber said, because then ''they'd know they were going back into the rat race, and that'd keep them in touch with real life.''
 
Memphis
 
Problems Persist, Gnawing at Hope
In Memphis, the Foote Homes, a public housing project built in the 1950's, is about a mile from where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. On a balmy Sunday morning, Fred Butler and some of his friends, all of them black, gathered on a sidewalk to talk about how a bad situation for black Americans was getting worse despite the opening of some major opportunities since the days of the civil rights struggle.
Mr. Butler, 50, who prefers to be known as Fast Freddie, complained that ''they're coming around saying the Government needs more money, but then they send all that money to fight a war over yonder when the main thing is, they should have solved all the problems around here first. It's just like Vietnam.'' Vernon Yancey, a 33-year-old truck driver, said: ''I don't see how they can be hurting for money when the rich are doing so good. Everyone else is just hanging on, especially the black people, and they are the ones who get hit when the Government says it's got money problems. Look at the gas. They raise the prices. They raise the taxes. Who gets hit? It's the poor folks. The rich don't even know what gas costs.''
Sitting in a metal folding chair, Mr. Butler acted as something of a moderator during a long conversation that others drifted in and out of. At one point he said, ''Let's admit it, black people are having more things than anytime else.''
''Yeah,'' agreed Ollie Boxley, who is 35 and works with Mr. Yancey, ''kids today have all kinds of opportunities we didn't have when we were coming up.''
''And they don't want it,'' Mr. Yancey said. ''They don't want to go to school. They're too happy on the street.''
After a moment, he spoke up again. ''You hear some people blaming the poor folks for getting too much Government money, and so they say, 'Cut the programs.' That's not right, because the seniors don't get too much; the women going crazy trying to raise kids without a man, they don't get too much; a lot of people who need a place to stay don't get anything. Who's to blame when they get cut?''
 
Cape Girardeau, Mo.
 
Insecure Feelings Transcend Taxes
Around Cape Girardeau, Mo., the major worry is a widely publicized prediction that in early December an earthquake will strike along the New Madrid fault, which runs through the area. Worries over the economy are far more diffuse, yet many in the Sunday afternoon crowd at the West Park Mall, a big suburban retail center, said they were looking more than buying.
''The last several years have been such a good time economically that people feel they'll have to ride out whatever's coming by tightening up a bit and making do,'' said Lou Ann Hopkins, 36.
Her husband, Mark, 35, who works in the management of a tobacco company, said, ''I guess we've cut down some purchases recently because you have to wonder how it will be if we get a recession with all these tax increases on top of it.''
Lil Reynolds, a 51-year-old bank teller, had stopped by her favorite dress shop to check out a sale. ''I've noticed people are opening savings accounts, putting away money, paying off consumer loans, those sorts of things, because they are starting to get scared that the economy's going sour,'' she said.
She added: ''I think everyone is blaming the Government right now because of the budget. They spend so much money they don't have to spend that I'm upset, too, and I'm upset about what it's doing to the country.''
Added Diane Huntze, a sales clerk, ''Yeah, but they won't give up their spending ways.''
 
Chicago
 
In the Middle, Feeling Left Out
The intersection of Cicero and Milwaukee Avenues on Chicago's Northwest Side is at the center of an old but seemingly vibrant working-class neighborhood. But inside one of the many new commercial establishments, the Seven Cousins sandwich shop, recently opened by two sisters, Marge Sergo and Karen LaPalermo, there is gloom.
''We both work other jobs,'' Mrs. LaPalermo said. ''We're doing this because it takes a family not two incomes anymore, but three or four to make ends meet.''
As the two put Halloween decorations on the walls of their little restaurant, Mrs. Sergo complained: ''As usual, Washington is not going to be much help. The Government doesn't do a thing for the middle man. The poor get welfare, and the rich get loopholes. Meanwhile, the middle man is going to disappear.''
Mrs. LaPalermo added: ''What I can't believe is that they were talking about cutting the benefits to the old people, They got to live on almost nothing as it is.''
Mrs. Sergo had a theory: ''I like some of what President Bush has done, but let's face it: he comes from money, and he lives with money, and the Republicans are always good at protecting the rich and cutting Social Security and other stuff that helps hard-working people.''
''To me,'' said Mrs. LaPalermo, ''neither side does anything for you, so it doesn't matter how you vote. We're worried about where the country's going, but we can't change anything, not anything. It's scary. It's not supposed to be this way.''

HEADLINE: ASSAILING BEIJING, HOUSE VOTES A RISE IN CHINA'S TARIFFS

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Protesting the continued restrictions on political dissent in China, the House of Representatives voted today to raise tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese apparel, toys and other exports to this country and to set tougher conditions for tariff breaks for China next year.
But the votes may have been largely symbolic, since it is not certain the Senate - in the midst of a pre-election session largely focused on budget matters -will have time to pass comparable measures.
Should the Senate also act, the President has promised a veto that many analysts believe could not be overturned. The Administration has argued that it would be unwise to punish China when it has cooperated with the United States at the United Nations Security Council on every resolution adopted since early August against Iraq. 
 
Resolution on Tariffs
The House approved a resolution rescinding a Presidential decision last May to continue most-favored-nation treatment for China, under which tariffs are cut to the lowest possible level. The vote was 247 to 174, well short of the two thirds majority needed to override a veto.
Citing a report that at least 1,000 pro-democracy Chinese students are still in prison 16 months after the Beijing Government's crackdown in Tiananmen Square, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of upstate New York, chief sponsor of the resolution, said: ''We have just sent China a message that we haven't forgotten.''
Zhao Haiching, chairman of the National Committee on Chinese Student Affairs, one of the units in a federation representing 42,000 Chinese students in the United States, called the action a ''big victory,'' but cautioned that ''only if both Houses act can it really put pressure on the Chinese Government.''
 
A Presidential Certification
The House did approve a softer measure, chiefly sponsored by Representative Donald J. Pease, Democrat of Ohio, that approves the lower tariff status for this year but sets stiffened human rights conditions for maintaining the favored position next year. The vote was 384 to 30.
It also approved an amendment from Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, stipulatingthat one condition of continued favored status would be Presidential certification that all prisoners detained after the Tiananmen Square incident had been released. The vote on the amendment was 347 to 74.
The Senate Majority Leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, has introduced a similar bill, ending the tariff breaks in three months if the President cannot certify that the prisoner release and other human rights conditions have been met.
 
Tax and Budget Issues
This legislation, however, has not been taken up by the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction. Its chairman, Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, is immersed in the tax and budget imbroglio.
Although Congress took the lead in getting the United States to mete out economic punishment to China after the June 1989 crackdown, many analysts say there has been less interest in the issue since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August.
Beijing's support of the American position in the gulf crisis has helped its case on Capitol Hill. It has supported all eight United Nations Security Council resolutions on the situation and acted to enforce the United Nations-approved trade embargo.
In other steps to improve ties with Washington, the Chinese authorities have released almost 900 political prisoners this year. And, after President Bush's action last June to renew China's favorable trade status, they have permitted the dissident Fang Lizhi and his family to leave the country.
 
Political Conduct a Factor
Many analysts noted that whatever happens to the trade legislation, this year's legislative debate has underscored the importance of China's political conduct as a critical factor in its trading relationship with the United States.
''I have told my Chinese friends that regardless of the legislation, the political reality here is such that the renewal of M.F.N. is conditional, and that if Beijing falls away from us, it will not get M.F.N. next year,'' said Roger W. Sullivan, director of the U.S.-China Business Council, representing 250 American companies doing business in China.
The United States became China's primary export market last year. Although China buys wheat, high technology products and machinery and other capital goods from the United States, its sales of textiles and other products are earning it huge surpluses in trade with this country.
For the first eight months of this year China's surplus was $6.3 billion, almost twice the $3.3 billion over the same period last year. Withdrawal of most-favored-nation status. would mean tariff hikes that could cut off its markets here and probably lead to retaliation.
 
Warning From White House
The White House and its supporters on Capitol Hill warned that the higher tariffs would hurt American business and consumers, damage the Hong Kong economy, which is heavily dependent on China trade, and reduce American influence with China on global issues.
''Instead of the open door policy, we would have the bolted door policy,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, during the House debate.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's Trade Subcommittee added: ''I am not willing to sacrifice the interests of American farmers, businessmen and workers in a hollow show of outrage.''

HEADLINE: TWO KOREAS AGREE TO FURTHER TALKS

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Senior negotiators from North and South Korea said today that they had again failed to reach agreement on any steps to reduce mutual tensions, but that there was reason to hope that an accord could be worked out in the future.
The two sides said they would try again to discuss ways to narrow their differences in another set of negotiations on Dec. 11-14 in Seoul. Reports from Seoul, moreover, indicated tonight that the session today was more civil and cordial than the one on Wednesday.
The second round of talks between delegations led by the Prime Ministers of the two countries ended at noon in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, followed by the first meeting between an official from Seoul and the 78-year-old North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung. 
Mr. Kim was quoted by Korean news agencies as telling Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon of South Korea that ''the fact that the high-level meeting was held marks a bright prospect for our nation's future.''
 
Called Significant Move
It was also taken as significant that he used the title Prime Minister for Mr. Kang, something North Korean delegates in the talks had not done, apparently as part of Pyongyang's general questioning of legitimacy of the South Korean Government.
South Korean officials said it was highly significant that Mr. Kim, one of the world's last remaining Communist dictators, lent his personal prestige. ''It was a sign of progress that Kim personally played a role in reinforcing our efforts,'' one official said.
On the other hand, Mr. Kim's response to South Korea's request for a future meeting with President Roh Tae Woo was seen as ambiguous. Mr. Kim said he accepted the idea in principle, but only at an appropriate time, presumably after South Korea accepts the North's conditions.
As officials discussed the talks, 11 young South Koreans armed with firebombs and other weapons were arrested early this morning as they tried to climb the rear wall of the American Embassy in Seoul. There were no injuries or physical damage.
 
A Delicate Atmosphere
The incident nonetheless scored the delicate atmosphere in South Korea, since dissident student radicals are still carrying out anti-American campaigns, adopting the North Korean line that the United States is the source of South Korea's problems.
The accounts of the meetings in Pyongyang that reached Seoul tonight were a little confused and fragmentary. North Korea allowed only about 40 South Korean journalists in to cover the talks, and only a handful of reporters from Western news organizations.
The agitation of student radicals is one of several political problems facing President Roh, who has made no secret of his desire to have a meeting with Mr. Kim of North Korea to help his own political standing. But such a meeting is still seen as unlikely.
As they had in the past, the two sides bogged down on South Korea's insistence that two countries reduce tensions first by cultural, social, family and economic exchanges and later tackle difficult matters like troop levels and pledges of nonaggression.
 
Wants U.S. Troops Expelled
North Korea, on the other hand, continues to insist that South Korea agree immediately to steps in the military and political sphere, particularly to expelling the 43,000 American troops in South Korea. As a first step, Pyongyang wants Seoul to cancel military exercises with American troops.
These priorities were aired in the first round of talks between Prime Minister Kang of South Korea and Prime Minister Yon Kyong Muk of North Korea, in Seoul in early September. This time, the two sides came with specific proposals on priorities.
News reports reaching here said there was talk at the meeting today about combining the two sets of proposals, in effect agreeing to discuss military actions and cultural and humanitarian exchanges simultaneously.
A South Korean official said tonight that to the extent that there was progress in the meeting today, it seemed to be that both sides agreed that they could discuss each other's approaches all together the next time they meet. But he said it was far from clear that such talks would yield a common point of view.
 
Some Adjustments Seen
''The North tried to show us they were trying to make some adjustments,'' said Lee Hong Koo, a special adviser to President Roh who is monitoring the talks here. ''At least from my viewpoint, they are making some efforts to adjust, although there is no fundamental change of position.''
Mr. Lee said the tone of the discussions today was more muted, by contrast to the atmosphere of contention and accusation that occurred on Wednesday. He said North Korea seemed not to want to press its own point of view too aggressively after doing so on Wednesday.
For example, Pyongyang continues to demand that South Korea drop its effort to enter the United Nations by itself, cancel the military exercises with the United States next spring and free two anti-Government dissidents.
These demands were not dropped, but they were also not advanced as aggressively as they were in the past. Mr. Lee said that some South Koreans thought that the reason that North Korea wanted to put off the next round of talks until December was to allow time to see if Seoul responds.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Bush Says He Will Press Lenders To Widen Aid to Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Pledging to help Eastern European countries cope with the rising energy costs resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis, President Bush said today that he would work to arrange an additional $5 billion in international loans to those financially strapped nations.
In a welcoming ceremony at the White House for Prime Minister Jozsef Antall of Hungary, Mr. Bush said he would urge the International Monetary Fund to change its lending regulations so it could provide the extra money. Administration officials said that the revisions could include raising the limits on lending to Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
Mr. Bush said he would also ask the World Bank to speed lending to those countries by drawing on a $9 billion fund collected after the invasion of Kuwait to help countries deal with the economic consequences of the gulf crisis. 
''Like all of us, Hungary and the other new democracies of Central Europe are paying a high price for resolutely supporting the United Nations sanctions against Iraq,'' Mr. Bush said.
 
Helping Budapest Buy Grain
Mr. Bush also announced that the United States was offering Hungary $47.5 million in credits and loan guarantees that are intended to help the country buy 500,000 tons of feed grain to make up for the effects of a severe drought this year.
In addressing Mr. Antall, the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Hungary to visit the White House in more than four decades, the President was full of praise for the country's reform programs.
''Hungary is no longer an emerging democracy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Hungary is a democracy.''
Mr. Antall, in turn, credited the United States with helping to make the ouster of hard-line Eastern European Governments possible in 1989. ''You have contributed to the emergence of reform politicians such as Mr. Gorbachev, who, by transforming the Soviet Union, helped bring about new opportunities of freedom for the peoples of East-Central Europe,'' Mr. Antall said.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush's meeting with Mr. Antall focused primarily on economic issues, although the two leaders also discussed the Persian Gulf crisis and the evolving security arrangements in Europe.
 
Offers a Medical Unit
Mr. Antall said after his meeting with the President that his country was seeking to send a military medical unit to Saudi Arabia to join the international force arrayed there against Iraq. He said that Budapest was discussing arrangements with the Saudi Government.
Curtis W. Kamman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, quoted Mr. Antall as telling Mr. Bush that his country was suffering from the loss of low-priced Soviet oil supplies, as well as from the rise in energy costs that have resulted from the worldwide trade embargo against Iraq.
In remarks greeting Mr. Antall, Mr. Bush said, ''We understand that the loss of export markets and rising energy costs complicate your historic effort to transform a centrally planned economic system to a free economy.''
He added, ''And so to help ease this burden, I am announcing today that the United States is asking the International Monetary Fund to increase its lending to the countries of the region by as much as $5 billion.''
Mr. Bush said that would require that the fund start ''modifying its lending policies as appropriate,'' but Administration officials provided few substantive details on how that might be accomplished.
 
Raising the Ceilings
One way would be for the fund to raise the ceiling on how much Hungary and other Eastern European countries can borrow, Mr. Kamman said. The fund expects that it will have loaned some $2 billion to Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia by next year.
The fund is currently negotiating with Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia on the terms of loan programs. Mr. Kamman said the United States would urge the organization to accelerate those discussions.
The fund could also help Eastern Europe meet rising energy costs by including the cost of oil and other fuels in a program that is designed to help countries cope with external events that harm their economies. Energy costs are not normally included in that category.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS: ARAB LEAGUE REBUFFS P.L.O.; WON'T CONDEMN U.S.;
Iraq Offers Cheaper Oil

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 18

 BODY:
In efforts to gain political ground by economic means, Iraq sought to beat one embargo today and the Arab League moved to enforce another.
In Damascus, an Arab League agency announced a boycott of ships and planes taking Soviet Jews to Israel, while in Baghdad, Iraq offered cheap oil at $21 a barrel. Economic experts said the Arab League boycott could prove hard to enforce, while the Iraqi offer would be virtually impossible for anyone to accept. 
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, its oil exports have been severed by an international trade embargo that has closed pipelines across Turkey and Saudi Arabia and halted exports through the Persian Gulf.
The embargo is costing Iraq at least $80 million a day in lost exports, and oil prices have rocketed at times to $40 a barrel since the invasion. The benchmark price recorded by oil traders today was $34 a barrel.
The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored here, said Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi announced a decision by President Saddam Hussein today that ''Iraq is fully prepared to sell its oil to states and companies that want to buy, including the United States, and the selling price will be on the basis of $21 a barrel.'' That is the price set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at its last meeting before the invasion.
 
Few Takers Are Seen
Shipping executives in the gulf region said by telephone that they believed no one would take up the Iraqi offer because of the blockade. ''Who's going to send a tanker through 100 warships and risk it being impounded?'' said one executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. The executive recalled that even when Iraq offered free oil earlier in the crisis, no one tried to collect it.
In Damascus, meanwhile, The Arab League's Special Bureau for Boycotting Israel said today that ''airlines and shipping companies which transfer Jewish immigrants to Palestine and occupied Arab territories will be put on the blacklist.''
Arab diplomats here said the boycott was the first tangible step Arab states have taken to try to halt the immigrant flow from the Soviet Union to Israel since it gathered momentum a year ago.
Over 100,000 Soviet Jews have moved to Israel since Moscow relaxed emigration restrictions last year. The exodus has brought widespread fear among Arabs, particularly in the occupied West Bank and in neighboring Jordan, that the influx of Jews to Israel will ultimately displace Palestinians.
Most Soviet Jews have traveled by Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, to Cyprus and Eastern European destinations for flights to Tel Aviv, where Aeroflot does not yet have landing rights. The same East European airlines also fly to many Arab cities.

HEADLINE: Texas Urges Quick Action to Halt Honeybees

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESLACO, Tex., Oct. 18

 BODY:
Efforts to quarantine, search and destroy the Africanized honeybee are in full swing as state and Federal officials scramble to halt the newly arrived intruders' spread into the United States.
Gathered with Federal experts at the United States Department of Agriculture headquarters here, Texas officials warned today that prompt action to slow the bees' northward spread was essential to avoid quarantines in agricultural states that stand to lose millions from the infestation.
The first identified swarm of Africanized bees in the United States was trapped on Monday near Hidalgo, just north of the Mexican border. The bees were destroyed. 
Africanized bees have been heading north since escaping in 1957 from a Brazilian breeding experiment.
Nicknamed killer bees because of their extreme irritability and tendency to sting repeatedly in defense of their hives, the bees have been responsible for 16 deaths in Mexico alone over the past three years, researchers say. Hundreds of other deaths, as well as livestock losses, have been reported across Central and South America since 1957.
 
'Be Aware'
Dr. Anita Collins, a researcher with the Department of Agriculture who has experienced killer bee stings herself, advised: ''Be aware. Know your facts. Know what a honeybee looks like. Our best advice if you stumble into a stinging incident is to run. You can get away from them.''
But scientists emphasize that the chances of a fatal encounter with the bees are ''quite small.'' And agriculture officials insist that the real threat from the bees is to the multimillion-dollar honey and pollination industries of American beekeepers. When Africanized bees invade other hives, their aggressive characteristics dominate. The bees also are inefficient pollinators.
The bee industry says infiltration by Africanized bees has cut honey production in Central and South America by 60 to 70 percent. The bees could also devastate farmers in the United States who depend on honeybees to pollinate $9 billion in fruit and vegetable crops.
 
More Money Sought for Fight
Texas officials say they will ask for an additional $710,000 from the Texas Legislature for regulation, research and public education.
Newly trained inspectors have begun searching in a two-mile radius around the Hidalgo site, with orders to destroy any Africanized or wild bees found. Eight counties in south Texas are under quarantine, and surveyors are intensifying their inspections of a trap line that runs from Laredo to near Corpus Christi.
''If we don't do this, the economic impact will come with a quarantine from other states who perceive that we're not doing our job to halt the progress of the Africanized bees,'' said Dr. Fowden Maxwell, head of the Department of Entomology at Texas A&M University.
He said such a quarantine would be ''devastating'' to Texas beekeepers.
Bee experts say the arrival of cooler temperatures in the lower Rio Grande Valley could mean Monday's swarm is the last for this year.

HEADLINE: High Hopes of Defeating Simon Are Being Deflated

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 18

 BODY:
At a meeting a year ago, two of the biggest names in the Republican Party's stable of consultants, Robert Teeter and Roger Ailes, told Representative Lynn Martin of Illinois that if she could raise the money, she could unseat Senator Paul Simon, the avuncular incumbent whose liberalism seemed to make him an inviting target.
''It takes $8 million to win in a campaign in Illinois if you're not an incumbent,'' Mr. Ailes said this week.
But in the end, Ms. Martin will raise and spend only about $5 million. ''That's fallen short,'' her press secretary, Kathy Lydon, conceded. And with this shortfall, the high hopes Republicans had for this race, one of their top targets for 1990, are falling, too. 
Money is clearly not Ms. Martin's only problem, and her other problems have made it all the more difficult to persuade contributors to support her.
 
Impact of Budget Debacle
She opened the campaign with several missteps, including a reference to downstate voters as ''rednecks.'' Moreover, the constantly changing national agenda, and particulary President Bush's reversal on taxes, an issue at the heart of her campaign, has made it harder for Ms. Martin to gain a foothold.Even Republicans who have mounted stronger campaigns than that of Ms. Martin find themselves in trouble in these final weeks because of the damage that Mr. Bush's handling of the budget debacle has done to the party.
There is also the all-important matter of personality. If you are going to be an incumbent in this turbulent year, it is best to be like Paul Simon, the unpolitician, with his bow tie and ears sticking out from slicked-down hair. Ms. Martin has also run up against a problem that some other women seeking office have faced, a resistance from voters who find her grating. ''The Joan Rivers syndrome,'' is what David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant who used to work for Mr. Simon, calls it.
''It definitely is a problem,'' said Ms. Lydon. ''The people of Illinois have never elected a woman to statewide office.''
But while money is not her only problem, it is the one that prevents her from even making a fight on the other fronts now, less than three weeks from Election Day on Nov. 6. ''We're off the air,'' Mr. Ailes said succinctly, using consultant talk for a campaign that cannot buy television time.
 
Running Out of Money
The Martin campaign has less than a million dollars left and is conserving it for a last wave of television in the final week or 10 days.
In the meantime Mr. Simon, who raised more than $7 million and had $1.7 million in the bank as of Sept. 30, continued to buy television time for advertisements, including one that depicted Ms. Martin as an enemy of the elderly. ''Lynn Martin voted to cut Medicare three times,'' the advertisement said. ''Simon fought to protect Social Security. Lynn Martin voted to cut Social Security.''
The advertisement is the sort of distortion now routine in politics, using the word ''cut'' to mean keeping benefits from growing as quickly as they otherwise might have. And, as is standard, it does not mention votes by Mr. Simon on budget bills that might be interpreted the same way. ''Justice apparently cannot be done to this complex issue in 30 seconds,'' The Chicago Sun Times concluded.
But these are subtleties that few voters in the news markets of Illinois will hear about. ''If you don't have the money to counter the message, you're stuck with it,'' Ms. Lydon said. ''No matter how much the press does to say he's not really right on this, unless you have the money to put that on the air, you're not going to be able to reach all those people.''
Mr. Simon has stressed his roots at home. His advertisements call him ''Paul Simon of Illinois'' and one mentions that he has held 400 town meetings. But recent events, including the Persian Gulf crisis and the hearings on the Supreme Court nomination of David H. Souter, have also given Mr. Simon an opportunity to gain some publicity by showing him at work on Capitol Hill.
 
Desperate for Attention
Ms. Martin's campaign is so desperate for attention that Mr. Ailes, a lightning rod who many other clients try to keep under wraps, was brought into the state to say things about Mr. Simon that the campaign did not have money to buy advertisements to say. But Mr. Ailes got carried away, calling Mr. Simon a bunch of names like ''weenie'' and ''slimy.'' Ms. Martin had to apologize.
The exchange did little to accomplish Ms. Martin's goal of pointing out genuine differences between the two candidates. Indeed, the voters could hardly complain about a lack of choice in this race, if they tuned in to it.
During a debate on Sunday, Ms. Martin said Mr. Simon favored increased spending for every Federal program that had been mentioned. Mr. Simon rushed to correct her. He favored cuts in spending in one category, the military. Ms. Martin thanked him for pointing that out, since she did not. Ms. Martin stressed her desire to hold down taxes, while Mr. Simon emphasized his willingness to spend money on desirable goals, most particularly education.
The debate had been Ms. Martin's big opportunity to generate interest in her flagging race, which was probably why Mr. Simon's campaign shifted the date from Thursday evening, when an earlier gubernatorial debate had been widely watched, to Sunday afternoon. Mr. Simon said he could not leave Washington on Thursday and risk missing votes in the Senate, a concern Ms. Martin said he had not shown when he was running for President in 1988, a time she brings up often to suggest that Mr. Simon might again run for President.
''The only person in America who is talking about Paul Simon running for President is Lynn Martin,'' Mr. Simon said after Sunday's debate.
 
Firing Up the Campaign
The audience at the debate was a tiny fraction of the Illinois electorate, and Mr. Simon's calm demeanor prevented any clashes that might have produced the sort of follow-up by reporters that Ms. Martin needed to fire up the campaign.
An opinion poll of 866 registered voters for WBBM TV and The Southtown Daily Economist found Mr. Simon leading Ms. Martin by a ratio of 60 percent to 30 percent. Half the survey was completed before the Sunday afternoon debate, and half afterward, but there was no appreciable difference in the outcome, said Kathy Frankovic of CBS News, which conducted the survey for WBBM, an affiliate. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Wendy DeMocker, a spokeswoman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, noted that Republican challengers in past campaigns had been 30 points behind three weeks from Election Day only to win in upsets. ''We're not throwing in the towel,'' she said of the Illinois race. But she acknowledged that Ms. Martin was short of the money she had hoped to have.
So there is little left now for her to do but to talk about the lessons of her campaign. ''I've come to a conclusion we have to radically address our campaign finance system,'' she said. Ms. Martin noted that she had raised more money than any other Republican challenger to an incumbent Senator, although most of the others are running in much less expensive states.
''I've out-raised my opponent in my home state, which should be enough,'' she added, asserting that half Mr. Simon's money came from out of state.
''I've got an opponent who has raised more money in L.A. than in 101 counties of Illinois,'' said Ms. Martin. ''Thats off balance.''

Proposals Almost Certain to Emerge From Congress
 
Cigarette Tax: Increase of 8 cents (4 cents in 1991, 4 cents in 1993), to 24 cents.
Alcohol Tax: An increase of 16 cents a six-pack, to 32 cents.
10 Percent Luxury Tax: Applies to purchase price above the following thresholds: cars, $30,000; boats, $100,000; jewelry, $5,000.
Aviation Fees: Increase in passenger ticket tax to 10 percent from 8 percent, plus increases in other fees. 
Insurance: Reduced tax breaks for insurance industry.
Social Security: State and local workers not covered by a government-sponsored retirement plan to pay into Social Security.
 
Proposals in Dispute And headed For Conference
 
Income Tax Rates: House bill would extend the 33 percent marginal tax rate to all high-income taxpayers, who now generally pay a flat rate of 28 percent. New rate would apply to all taxable income above $78,400 for those filing jointly. House would also increase alternative minimum tax to 25 percent, from 21 percent. Senate bill has no such provisions.
Millionaires: House bill would impose 10 percent surtax on all taxable income above $1 million. Senate bill has no such provision.
Indexing: House bill would freeze indexing for inflation of tax brackets and personal exemptions for one year. Senate bill has no such provision.
Deductions: Senate bill would reduce itemized deductions by 5 percent of the amount of adjusted gross income above $100,000. House has no such provision.
Gasoline: Senate bill would add 9.5 cents a gallon to the gasoline tax by Jan. 1, 1992, to a total of 18.5 cents. House bill would not raise gasoline taxes.
Alcohol: House would increase tax on a gallon of 100-proof alcohol by $1, to a total of $13.50; Senate proposes $1.20 increase. House would add 22 cents in taxes for a bottle of wine, to a total of 25 cents; the Senate proposes an increase of only 18 cents.
10 Percent Luxury Tax: House would impose tax on purchase of furs for the amount above $10,000; Senate threshhold is $5,000. House would impose tax on airplane purchase above $100,000, the Senate $250,000.
Medicare: Major differences between House and Senate bills. House would impose 1.45 percent Medicare tax on wages up to $100,000, from a cap of $51,300 currently. Senate would extend cap to $89,000. Senate would extend Medicare tax to state and local employees. House would not. House would increase Medicare deductibles and premiums on the elderly, requiring them to pay $10.1 billion in new payments over five years, and would impose $33 billion in new costs on Medicare providers. The Senate would raise Medicare costs to the elderly by $14.2 billion over five years and would raise providers' costs over the same period by $32 billion.
Energy Companies: To encourage oil exploration and drilling, Senate would provide $3.4 billion in tax breaks over five years for small companies. House has no such provisions.
Capital Gains: House would exclude 50 percent of capital gains, other than securities, from taxes up to a $200,000 lifetime limit. On the sale of securities, the House would also permit $1,000 in tax-free capital gains a year for those with taxable income under $100,000. The Senate bill has neither provision.
The Poor: The Senate bill would give a new tax credit totaling $16.8 billion over five years to help low-income workers pay for child care and to help offset higher excise taxes. The House would provide at least $11 billion for the five-year period and perhaps as much as $22 billion.
 
Proposals Eliminated From Consideration
 
Heating Oil: The budget summit proposal for a 2-cent-a-gallon gallon tax on refiners for fuel such as heating oil, gasoline and diesel fuel.
Unemployment Insurance: The budget summit proposal to delay payment of unemployment income for two weeks.
I.R.S.: The budget summit proposal to raise $9.4 billion by improving auditing and collection efforts.
Small Businesses: Most of the $12.1 billion in tax breaks for small businesses proposed by the summit negotiators.

Six Men Wrestling With the Budget

 BODY:

Senator Lloyd Bentsen...Chairman, Senate Finance Committee...Texas Democrat... his main effort will be to get a bill out of conference that can be supported by both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate...he personally has no objection to higher tax rates, but would like to maintain tax breaks for oil and gas producers.
Senator Bob Packwood...Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee...Oregon Republican...he is opposed to an increase in tax rates...as one of the prime sponsors of the 1986 tax reform legislation he is supportive of limiting deductions and closing loopholes for the wealthy...is concerned that if you raise taxes, you create pressure to open the gates for new tax shelters, credits and loopholes...opposed to the provision in the House plan that would delay the adjustments in tax rates for inflation.
Senator Jim Sasser...Chairman, Senate Budget Committee...Tennessee Democrat...personally opposed to gasoline and excise taxes, but recognizes that some sacrifices may have to be made if you are going to achieve real deficit reduction...President Bush has made it clear what he will and will not accept, so that has to be taken into account if there is going to be an acceptable package...is very concerned about increasing Medicare premiums but is happier with what is being offered now than what was in the original budget summit package.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: IS THIS AN ERA'S END?;
The Anti-Tax Offensive of the 1980's Is Over, or So the Democrats Believe

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
As Congress moved toward completion of a budget package today, the Democrats who control both the Senate and the House of Representatives cast their bets that the Reagan era was really over.
For six long years, from the defeat of Walter F. Mondale in the 1984 Presidential election until only a few months ago, Democratic politicians were on the defensive on taxes. ''There they go again,'' Ronald Reagan and his fellow Republicans would say, ''raising your taxes again,'' and the Democrats would scurry for cover.
Now Mr. Reagan is gone from the Washington scene, President Bush has abandoned his no-new-taxes pledge, oil prices are soaring, the economy is slumping, and the deficit threatens to race out of control under the impact of the savings-and-loan bailout and the Persian Gulf crisis. The Democrats feel free to utter the dread ''T'' word again, though they prefer to talk about ''fairness,'' and, like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Hubert H. Humphrey and Lyndon B. Johnson, to preach that old-time religion about soaking the rich. 
 
'No More to Give'
Are the Democrats right? Have times really changed? Or are they just deluding themselves? Are they walking into a trap that they don't see?
The Senate and House conferees who will labor to produce a bill to send to Mr. Bush will almost certainly agree, if they agree at all, on a measure that imposes new taxes of some kind on the wealthy. Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, pushed that sort of bill through the House earlier this week, and although the Senate as a whole preferred milder medicine, many Democratic senators actually favored Mr. Rostenkowski's approach of making the privileged pay more.
''The middle class has no more to give,'' said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, who sponsored one of many amendments that the Senate defeated today, to her dismay and that of many of her Democratic colleagues.
''Ronald Reagan managed all through the 1980's to cast the tax debate in terms of economic policy,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a leading Democratic poll taker. ''He said low taxes meant greater growth, and people believed him. In that context, fairness didn't matter as much. Everyone was benefiting.
''Now many more people think the question is, Who pays? In that context, the old Democratic argument about fair shares is much stronger.'' Is Reaganism Alive? But a few Democrats on Capitol Hill, and many who ply their trade far from Washington, believe Mr. Reagan's anti-tax fervor is still alive.
Gov. James J. Florio of New Jersey, for example, is facing a fierce popular revolt against his policies, including a program of higher taxes. Representative Jill Long of Indiana, who won a special election on a no-new-taxes platform last year, is running far ahead this year by saying much the same thing. Two Democratic underdogs campaigning for governor in big Midwestern states, Neil Hartigan in Illinois and Anthony Celebrezze in Ohio, have gained a lot of ground in recent weeks by picturing their Republian foes as advocates of higher taxes.
''The landscape has changed,'' said Douglas Schoen, who helps plan campaigns for Democratic candidates, ''but the vast majority of people still think that waste, not inadedquate revenues, is the problem in Washington. So I tell my candidates that they have to establish their fiscal prudence first, then emphasize that they're taking the burden off working people. Otherwise, the Republicans can make us the tax-raising party again, and we lose.''
 
What Has Changed
One thing that is different about the political landscape is the replacement of Mr. Reagan by Mr. Bush, who has less of a core constituency behind him and lacks Mr. Reagan's almost magical ability to make any talk of tax increases a threat to working people, whatever the fiscal reality.
Another is the growing belief of large numbers of voters, reflected in many recent opinion surveys, that the 1980's were full of excesses that will have to be paid for sooner or later, by somebody or other. Relatively few people argue any longer that cutting taxes would balance the budget, as Mr. Reagan and the supply-siders argued with great success in the last decade.
''Politics does have some roots, however fragile, in reality,'' said Thomas Donilon, a Washington lawyer and Democratic strategist. ''Bush gave up the Republicans' strongest political hammer - the no-new-taxes pledge -because he couldn't postpone the day of reckoning anymore. The budget mess couldn't be alllowed to continue. That changes the political equation.''
For the moment, at least, the Democrats are defining the Republicans, for political purposes, as the protectors of the rich, rather than the Republicans' defining the Democrats as the tax-and-spend crowd. That, a very senior Republican senator said this week, ''will cost us some seats'' in the midterm elections next month, and could even imperil Mr. Bush in 1992.
Mr. Mondale, who is campaigning for his son, a candidate for the Minnesota Senate, sees international forces as the engine of change.
''Reagan was saved, it seems to me, by falling oil prices and cheap foreign credit,'' the former Vice President said in a telephone interview. ''They made big deficits tolerable, but now there's no alternative to footing the bill. No more open-field running, just straight through the line - and the Democrats have always been a bit better at that sort of politics.''
 
'Treacherous Ground'
Some even see Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who has made much of the Democrats' case on taxes during the last year, emerging from the budget crisis as such a hero that he will win the party's Presidential nomination two years from now.
Maybe. But as Mr. Donilon said, the Democrats are on ''treacherous ground,'' and a misstep could be very costly. Mr. Gephardt and many other Democrats thought they had a winner three years ago in Japan-bashing, and that faded away as Mr. Bush painted them again as the party of big government, at a time when most voters thought that government should get smaller.
It could happen again, especially at a time when public support for politicians of any stripe - indeed, for politics itself - is so slight.

HEADLINE: To Fix the Budget Mess, Restore Pre-'86 Taxes;
Portent in the Rough

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is often the attitudes toward the economic environment that create major changes in an economy's vitality. These ''feelings'' lead individuals to act, precipitating the feared recession. I recently discovered a soft sign for predicting recession that I think may bear the scrutiny of economists and even the Federal Reserve Board. I call it the ''golf-ball sign'' - something I noticed at the local country club as well as during travel abroad. 
People fortunate enough to have enough disposable income to allow them to play golf and hold country club memberships are known for their wastefulness. Up to two years ago, while playing golf, I observed that brand-new golf balls could often be found in the rough just off the fairway, which might be explained this way:
The fat cat hits his brand-new ball, purchased for $8 or $9, into the rough. Subliminally aware of his net worth and of his ability to generate income, he feels it isn't worth pursuing a ball that costs so little.
While playing last spring I noticed that no golf balls were to be found. Why would these same golfers, who once left quantities of balls in the rough, suddenly go into the rough and retrieve those balls? How does this relate to an early recession?
Affluent individuals have now pulled back on minor expenditures. Those who have large disposable incomes really control little of how their money is spent. Most goes automatically to mortgage, interest, car, alimony or child support payments, and educational costs. Such expenditures occur without the individuals' direct intervention.
But small expenses like golf balls, for which they pay or sign, are controlled directly. So, feeling less secure about their financial future and indeed experiencing some crunches, such people will spend that extra moment to retrieve a lost ball, even though its cost is relatively insignificant. Thus, the disappearance of easily retrievable golf balls is a sign of early recession.
When I played recently at the Royal Golf Course in Spa, Belgium, my host said not to worry about retrieving balls because in the spring he and his children had found hundreds of them in the rough along the fairways. But after playing for several holes, my friend shook his head and said there just didn't seem to be any golf balls where he normally found them. For me this was proof that the golf-ball portent is spreading internationally.

HEADLINE: New York Lost 34,000 Jobs Over Summer

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
New York City lost 34,000 jobs this summer, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and may be headed for its worst year since the dark days of the mid-1970's.
In June, July and August, the agency said, the city lost 4,300 jobs in finance, real estate and insurance; 5,200 jobs in manufacturing; 5,600 jobs in construction, and 6,500 jobs in trade, reflecting retailing's decline.
Employment in transportation and public utilities increased by 4,200, but the services sector, which expanded even after the stock market's collapse exactly three years ago brought an end to a decade of vigorous expansion, had a slight but worrisome drop. 
Almost 18,000 of the jobs lost during the three months were in private industry. The rest were in government, largely the result of the winding down of this year's census.
 
'A Double-Barreled Effect'
''We're seeing some progressive weakness that reflects the combined impact of the restructuring in a number of key industries, plus the impact of a national slowdown, which has become clearer in recent months,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the labor statistics bureau. ''It's a double-barreled effect.''
The latest losses offset a gain earlier in the year from government employment and meant that the city has lost a total of 27,000 jobs so far this year. That already rivals 1982, when the city lost 31,000 jobs, the only year it lost jobs since the city's economy collapsed in the 1970's and about 100,000 jobs a year were lost.
There was uncertainty, however, over whether the recent losses represented an acceleration in an already ominous trend that could continue into the fall.
City and state officials, said they expect that some earlier Federal employment statistics for New York City will eventually be revised downward, lessening gains recorded earlier this year and making the trend seem less pronounced.
But in another gloomy assessment yesterday, the New York State Deputy Comptroller for New York City declared that the city economy is in a recession.
According to the report, the gross city product - the total output of goods and services produced by the city's economy - was 1.4 percent lower in the second quarter of 1990 than in the second quarter of 1989. It was the third straight quarterly drop.
The report also noted that New York City's unemployment rate, which had declined steadily from 1982 to 1988, had reversed direction and reached 7.9 percent last month and that retail sales, which fell in 1989, were sinking more rapidly in the second quarter.
The report by State Deputy Comptroller Elinor B. Bachrach also noted that the weakening national economy has hurt New York City. It has reduced the demand for city specialties like legal and accounting services, and has also reduced consumer spending.
Although there is no longer doubt that New York is well into a severe slump, economists are uncertain how bad it is and how long it will last.

HEADLINE: Raise in Dispute as New York City Negotiates 3d Day With 2 Unions

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
New York City's municipal labor talks ground through their third day yesterday as city and union officials shuttled in and out of the presidential suite on the 21st floor of the Sheraton Centre Hotel in Manhattan.
Both sides refused to comment on the negotiations, which entered an intensified phase on Tuesday. The negotiators hope to reach an agreement this week. 
The unions are the 140,000-member District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the 12,000-member Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
 
Reduced Raise Indicated
Away from the bargaining table, conflicting versions emerged over a meeting that Mayor David N. Dinkins held on Friday at Gracie Mansion to discuss the labor contracts. The participants were several top mayoral aides and the administration's council of outside economic advisers.
One person who was present and who favors limiting raises said some mayoral aides had discussed the possibility of offering to settle the pending contracts for around 4.5 percent, or about 1 percent less than the raise given to the teachers' union. The teachers won an agreement providing for a 5.5 percent raise plus a $100-per-member contribution for health insurance that would effectively bring the raise to 5.8 percent.
The person, who asked not to be identified, said city officials appeared to have second thoughts about offering the other unions even 4.5 percent after the outside fiscal experts, led by Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, objected to it as still too high.
 
Report of Meeting Disputed
But two administration officials who were also at the meeting vehemently denied the account.
''It's absolutely not true,'' said the Labor Relations Commissioner, Eric J. Schmertz. ''No number was floated or discussed by anybody at that meeting.'' He said that in other settings, various city officials had discussed many possibilities but had not arrived at a single position.
The First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, said, ''There was never a discussion at that meeting of a 4.5 percent proposal or of a specific strategy or what the offer might be.''
At a news conference marking the opening of the talks, the teamsters' president, Barry Feinstein, lashed out at Mr. Rohatyn, accusing him of interfering with negotiations by urging the cancellation of the teachers' contract and arguing against any raise for the other unions. Last night Mr. Feinstein said his criticsm was based on Mr. Rohatyn's public statements, not on anything that might have happened at the private meeting at Gracie Mansion.

HEADLINE: 7 Held in Mob Extortion of Clothiers

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Two years ago, prosecutors established a dummy garment-manufacturing company in a factory on the edge of Chinatown. Their aim: to investigate persistent reports that organized-crime figures had a stranglehold over the trucking business in Manhattan's garment industry.
Yesterday, the inquiry ended with the indictments of a reputed high-ranking Mafia captain and six other men on charges that they had imposed a ''mob tax'' on almost every garment manufactured in Manhattan since 1982. 
The investigation, prosecutors said, provided a glimpse into the harsh economics of the garment industry and the impact of the Mafia on it. The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said the Gambino crime family reaped ''tens of millions of dollars'' in illegal profits.
The indictments accused Thomas Gambino of heading an enterprise that virtually monopolized pickups and deliveries in showrooms and factories in midtown and Chinatown.
 
Owned 4 Trucking Companies
Mr. Gambino, who is 61 years old, has been identified by law-enforcement authorities as a captain in the Gambino crime family. He is the son of the late Carlo Gambino, who the authorities said founded the nation's largest and most powerful Mafia faction.
Also indicted was Thomas Gambino's brother, Joseph, 54. The Gambino brothers and their relatives own 4 of 10 companies said to have been used to control trucking routes.
The 10 companies handled about 90 percent of the garment-industry trucking routes in recent years, said Michael G. Cherkasky, the head of the District Attorney's investigations division. Mr. Cherkasky said they charged shipping rates about 40 percent higher than those asked by a handful of small, independent companies in Manhattan.
Each pleaded not guilty at arraignments in State Supreme Court. Both were released on personal recognizance bonds, $1 million for Thomas and $500,000 for Joseph.
 
'Low Profile, Well Buffered'
At the arraignments, their lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, said, ''Charges like these are easy to make but proving them is quite different.''
Thomas Gambino, who lives at 6 East 68th Street, has been accused of a criminal charge only once before. He was acquitted of a Federal charge of obstruction of justice last year in Brooklyn.
A report issued last month by the New Jersey Commission of Investigation said Thomas Gambino was also influential in New Jersey's garment industry and that he ''epitomizes the low-profile, well buffered, successful businessman image common among second generation members of the Cosa Nostra.''
Prosecutors said in interviews that many companies in Manhattan that used independent truckers were later compelled by the Gambino group to reimburse it, even though it had provided no trucking services.
 
Solicited by Gambino 'Salesmen'
The dummy company, called Chrystie Street Fashions at 195 Chrystie Street, near Stanton Street, was run by New York State Police Division investigators from August 1988 to August 1989. The investigators, prosecutors said, were solicited for business by ''salesmen'' from the Gambino trucking group.
Mr. Morgenthau said that in conversations, which were recorded and video taped, the salesmen provided evidence about how the Gambino trucking group controlled routes and demanded payments.
Wiretaps and secret microphones were also installed in the offices used by the Gambino brothers at the Consolidated Carriers Corporation at 141 West 35th Street, near Broadway, Mr. Morgenthau said.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:

The Four Seasons
When the Four Seasons had its 25th birthday bash in 1985, it was more than just a restaurant jubilee. As New York's most glamorous (and among its most expensive) dining spots, the Four Seasons embodied a time of restaurant euphoria. Not too long afterward, the economy's bubble burst, and many thought that even the Four Seasons would have to adapt or sink. Bistro Four Seasons? Unimaginable.
Today, as it prepares to enter its fourth decade, the indomitable Four Seasons is showing its pedigree and prevailing in difficult times.
There have been some major changes in the kitchen in the last year. Seppi Renggli, the chef for 17 years, left and was replaced by his longtime sous chef, Christian Albin, and Stefano Battistini from the Sea Grill at Rockefeller Center. The cosseting management team, including the owners, Tom Margittai and Paul Kovi, insure that longtime customers feel that nothing else has changed. 
Dining at the Four Seasons is a dramatically different experience according to when you go and where you sit. The legendary Grill Room, with its soaring ceiling, leather banquettes and rosewood walls, is still the ultimate power-lunch destination. In contrast to the rarified Grill Room, where almost no one drinks or has dessert, the lavish Pool Room is more relaxed, with its graciously appointed tables, illuminated trees and gurgling marble pool. No one rushes here.
You surely do not want to race though excellent starters like crispy fried shrimp with sweet-spicy mustard fruits (especially at $18), silken smoked duck breast with mixed greens and pencil-thin white asparagus, Parma prosciutto with fresh figs, and lustrous carpaccio with coriander and ginger. Both soups sampled make one yearn for a snowy winter day. The tomato-tinted lobster chowder is full of big sweet chunks of meat, corn and potatoes; and mildly spicy lamb-and-barley soup has a deep rich lamb-stock flavor. A boring low-cal spa cuisine item, however, steamed shrimp surrounded by sliced cucumbers topped with tartar sauce, could persuade me to jettison my diet. And smoked sturgeon over mixed greens was inedibly acrid. The best pasta appetizer tried was thin tortelloni filled with ricotta cheese, spinach and shredded duck and served with a garnish of basil, tomato and duck.
The Four Seasons is renowned for its wine cellar, which is particularly strong in California, Italian and Bordeaux selections.
It is hard to tell that two chefs share the driver's seat here, for the menu has the same harmony it has always had. There seems to be more seafood than ever, perhaps the influence of Mr. Battistini. A thick disk of moist, peppered swordfish steak in a zippy curry sauce with small roasted potatoes and pineapple slices has an exotic appeal. Superbly fresh pompano is simply sauteed and garnished with crunchy chayote and sweet peppers. Crayfish stew on the side is the best part of a meaty but underseasoned roasted sea bass. Salmon for two, filleted at tableside, has wonderfully salty strips of skin for garnish and comes with an herb sauce aromatic of fresh tarragon. Crabs cakes are superbly meaty and golden.
One of my old favorites is still on the menu, roast duck with brittle skin and pepper sauce. It is especially good with a side dish of wild rice and pine nuts or spatzle with olives and Parmesan. Roasted sweetbreads marinated in port, a special, were deliciously crisp and were served with woodsy autumn morels and a Swiss chard sauce. One dish that oddly disappointed was veal shank for two with truffle sauce. Carved at tableside, it inevitably is cool by the time it reaches the diner, and no truffles could be detected. Moreover, I prefer veal shank on the bone with its marrow. When the dessert cart comes around the bend, you will spot two Four Seasons classics, the deadly chocolate velvet cake, which resembles a torpedo head in solid chocolate, and the fancy cake, a dome of genoise and custard gift-wrapped in a layer of chocolate. The former is much more interesting than the latter. Fruit tarts and fruit layer cakes excel, as do the hazelnut cheesecake and the Hudson Valley apple custard pie.
As the staff at the Four Seasons dons its pumpkin-colored outfits this fall, one has to give the restaurant credit for spanning three decades of dining in New York without missing a step.
 
Sam's
Three years after its completion, the restaurant complex at the Equitable Life Assurance Tower on West 51st Street has proved to be not only a dynamic dining hub, but also a catalyst for other entrepreneurs in the neighborhood. Just as impressive as the success of Le Bernardin and Palio, two luxury establishments in the tower, is moderately priced Sam's, which has brought in a younger repeat clientele. Moreover, recent visits found that the food, under the energetic chef, Gregory Anne Cox, has improved a notch since it was last reviewed late in 1987.
The setting is staggering in its dimensions: a 28-foot-high cathedral ceiling with Wild West accents; brass-and-clay-colored chandeliers, and a bronze bison grazing on top of the circular bar.
As is often the case at this time of year, my reviewing spanned two seasonal menus, so some dishes mentioned here may not be available except as daily specials. Crab cakes have always been winners, generous and dusted with corn flour. A gastronomic hybrid called Tex-Mex ravioli worked splendidly. A single ravioli was filled with toasted corn, green peppers and garlic and garnished with moist smoked chicken.
Soups change frequently. What the kitchen calls gumbo-laya had good spicy chicken sausage and shrimp going for it, and the stock was hearty, but too much clove ruined the blend. Roasted tomato soup with potato and cabbage puree, on the other hand, was excellent.
Sam's has a limited but well selected wine list that complements the food. The young service staff, wearing Western shirts and bolo ties, is nothing if not fast on the draw, particularly at lunch.
The all-American entrees here range from steaks and pastas to exotic salads. Among the pastas, our favorite was the clean and saline spaghettini with lobster and shrimp and cucumber ribbons in a fresh tomato sauce. But some pastas needed a boost, like a special with asparagus, red peppers, salmon and cream.
Other main courses were almost uniformly good: juicy lamb chops with a sweet three-onion tart, paillard of Black Angus with new potato salad and tomato salad, grilled rosemary-seasoned chicken with deep-fried laces of potatoes, and a top-notch hamburger. The Black Angus steak is well cooked, too, and richly beefy. The salmon now comes glazed with a balsamic vinegar reduction scented with honey and lavender, accompanied by a winter vegetable ragout on the side; and scallops are enhanced with smoked salmon creme fraiche, new potatoes and onion cakes. Swordfish is particularly well turned out, moist, golden and with peppery potato pancakes laced with onions.
Boston cream pie is about as high on my list of sweets as it is on the American Heart Association's, but the version here is unconventionally light. Chunky apple pie is a fine fall treat, as is the blueberry nectarine pie.
Sam's has clearly found its niche among the budget-watching corporate minions of midtown. And if you take a closer look, I'm sure you'll see a lot of their bosses there, too.

Very Private Jill O'Hara Once Again Goes Public

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
When Jill O'Hara strides to the tiny stage of Dannys' Skylight Lounge, the back-room cabaret at the Grand Sea Palace restaurant, it's hard to imagine that this vivid, confident performer in a bright red gown used to be so shy that she could barely bring herself to do an interview.
In her act, Ms. O'Hara sings material that runs from Joni Mitchell to Leonard Bernstein to David Frishberg in a big, pungent voice that is part Broadway and part folk, with a tinge of jazz. Interspersed with the songs are amusing personal anecdotes. Introducing her powerful rendition of ''Ten Cents a Dance,'' the singer tells the story of her aunt, who worked as a dance-hall girl during the Depression. Ms. O'Hara's uncle was so upset, she said, that he paid her father, who was then a hotel dishwasher, to buy up all her dance tickets. 
Commenting on Randy Newman, several of whose songs she performs, Ms. O'Hara observes that though he is thought of as cynical by many, she sees him as ''a hopeless idealist,'' obsessed with comparing the dream of America with the realities.
Such observations hardly suggest diffidence. Yet there was a time two decades ago, Ms. O'Hara said recently, when her reticence was a career hindrance. At the time, she happened to be among the toasts of Broadway. In 1967 and 1968, she portrayed in rapid succession the female lead in the original Public Theater production of ''Hair,'' co-starred with Joel Grey in the hit musical ''George M!'' and played opposite Jerry Orbach in the Burt Bacharach, Hal David and Neil Simon musical ''Promises, Promises.'' Barely 21 years old, she was a big star.
 
'I Was Very Young'
But then Ms. O'Hara pretty much faded from sight in New York. It has been only in the last year and a half that she has re-emerged as an accomplished cabaret performer, singing songs by Mr. Newman, Ms. Mitchell and Mr. Frishberg, in addition to theater and folk songs, and even a little country.
''I never capitalized on the opportunities I had back then,'' Ms. O'Hara recalled, looking back 20 years. ''I was very young and so incredibly shy that I couldn't do talk shows and things like that. The whole thing was overwhelming.''
Ms. O'Hara, who grew up in Warren, Pa., had gone to Manhattan in 1963 right after high school, singing in Greenwich Village coffeehouses. Her first professional theater work was ''Hang Down Your Head and Die,'' a satirical Off Broadway revue about capital punishment, produced by Marion Javits. The show lasted only one night, but it had the distinction of being the vehicle that brought together Jerome Ragni and James Rado, the creators of ''Hair.''
After her Broadway successes, Ms. O'Hara chose not to go to Hollywood, establishing a career in regional theater. What Is Serious? ''I couldn't bring myself to go to California, and do all the things you have to do to survive as an actor,'' she said. ''For me to live in a place where your entire life revolves around getting a prime-time sitcom seemed insane. There wasn't enough money in the world.''
A serious actress who studied for 12 years with Uta Hagen, she played leading roles in regional productions of ''The Hot L Baltimore,'' ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'' and ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' among many other plays. Among her last interesting projects, she said, was a production of Michel Tremblay's play ''Albertine, in Five Times,'' in Hartford.
Six years ago, she married Philip Jones, an architect and painter, who encouraged her to start performing in clubs.
''I'd be singing in the backyard, and he said, 'You ought to be doing this in public,' '' she recalled.
 
And the Benefits of Cabaret
Only once before had she dipped her toes into cabaret: in the 1970's, at the Grand Finale, an Upper West Side club that has since closed. Ms. O'Hara set about putting together an act, which she tried out for two nights at Eleonora's, a small restaurant cabaret on West 58th Street. In October 1988, she took that act to Dannys' Skylight Room for four nights. With her husband as the producer, she also recorded a limited-edition album.
In July, she opened an expanded version of her act: a two-hour one-woman show, ''Jill and Her Jacks,'' in London at the King's Head Theater, to warm critical reception.
If cabaret, far more than theater, is an economically marginal profession, Ms. O'Hara said she still prefers nightclubs.
''The price of working in the theater is enormous,'' she said. ''I got so tired of having so little say over my material and having my life controlled by somebody deciding whether to give me a job or not.
''Cabaret may be difficult, but artistically it's much more satisfying.''
Ms. O'Hara is to perform at Dannys' Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, at 9 tonight and tomorrow night. Admission is $12, with a $10 food and drink minimum. Reservations: 265-8133.

New Bond Request By Trump

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump is offering bondholders of his Taj Mahal casino new high-yield ''junk bonds'' in lieu of a coming interest payment and is trying to keep more than 80 percent of the equity in the casino while reducing the interest rate on $675 million of its bonds, the Trump Organization disclosed yesterday.
The disclosure, which came in a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, drew fire from the bondholders, which have been negotiating with the New York financier for several weeks about the payment on the Taj Mahal bonds.
''What he is asking the bondholders to do is to make him a couple of hundred million dollars as a present,'' said Wilbur Ross, senior managing director of Rothschild Inc., which has been retained by the bondholders' steering committee. ''We think it's a little too early for Christmas.'' 
 
Prices Depressed
The offer further depressed the casino's bond prices in the open market, where Mr. Trump is free to purchase them. The Trump Organization said it reserved the right to purchase the bonds, but its chief financial officer denied that any purchases had been made in recent months.
''The economic reality of what he's proposing is that instead of cash, we get paper,'' Mr. Ross said. ''And in that case, we would greatly prefer to have the keys to the casino.''
The Taj Mahal bondholders have a first mortgage on the casino and would almost certainly be given the property in a bankruptcy.
 
Changing the Terms
Mr. Trump's proposal would, among other things, reduce the interest rate on the bonds to 9 percent from 14 percent, permit future payments to be made in newly issued bonds, and extend the maturity of the original bonds from Nov. 15, 1998, to 2000.
Holders of the original 14 percent first-mortgage bonds on the Taj would also receive 100 percent of the common stock of a newly formed company that would have as its assets a 19.9 percent interest in the Trump Taj Mahal Associates Limited Partnership. Mr. Trump pledged the entire assets of that partnership to banks that rescued him from bankruptcy earlier in the year.
The Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, Mr. Trump's largest casino, faces a $47.3 million interest payment Nov. 15 on high-yield junk bonds that were issued to build it. But the casino has not generated enough cash to pay it out of earnings.
In yesterday's filings, the Trump Organization warned bondholders that unless the offer was accepted, Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc., the company that financed the casino, and the partnership that owns the Taj might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.
''This is far worse treatment than the bondholders would receive if we were to be in Chapter 11, so there is no point to it,'' Mr. Ross said. He also pointed out that by allowing him to keep more than 80 percent of the Taj, Mr. Trump's plan would leave the developer with all the tax benefits of owning a property that generates losses.
 
Stake of Banks
All of Mr. Trump's equity interest in the Taj has already been pledged to the commercial banks that rescued his tottering empire several months ago, and some analysts have noted that this means the banks have more to lose than the developer if the casino is forced into bankruptcy.
Mr. Trump has sought financing to buy back the Taj bonds in the open market, but it is not known whether he has been successful.
The Taj Mahal bonds lost about four points in slim trading to end yesterday at about $24 per $100 of face value, said Ray Neidl of Dillon, Read & Company.
Mr. Trump's real estate and gambling holdings are about $3 billion in debt. Last spring and summer, dozens of banks helped to cobble together a package of new loans and deferral of payments on about $1 billion out of $2 billion in bank debt.

HEADLINE: New Jump in Gasoline Price Feared

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Even as crude oil prices descend from the $40 range, gasoline prices seem poised for another significant increase, industry experts say.
But they disagree on how long oil prices will have to stay at their current elevated levels to prompt such a new surge. Some say that with gasoline inventories relatively high and an economy teetering on recession cutting into demand, prices might be stable until the spring.
If the price of gasoline already seems high, it has actually risen less in recent weeks than that of crude oil, and, taxes not included, remains far lower than in Western Europe and Japan, which compete with the United States for supplies. 
 
Oil Company Restraint Seen
For motorists, prices are already up by about 26 cents a gallon since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, to about $1.34 a gallon for regular unleaded self-serve, according to the Department of Energy. But for refiners, the price of crude oil has gone up as much as 50 cents a gallon, and even after the modest declines of the last few days the price is still up by about 35 cents. (Oil closed yesterday at $36.80 a barrel, or nearly 88 cents a gallon, in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.) And the mix of oil has shifted, creating a surplus of heavy oil products, like asphalt and fuel for boilers, and a shortage of light ones, like gasoline.
Oil executives say these numbers make it clear that at least some companies are exercising the restraint in pricing called for by President Bush after the Iraqi attack.
But as a result, refineries that are paying more for oil have not raised gasoline prices enough to compensate.''Refinery profits are dismal,'' said James Bailey, a spokesman for the Coastal Corporation, a refiner and marketer. Therefore, domestic refiners are producing less gasoline, and foreign refiners that can get more for their gasoline in other nations are sending less to this country. In a free market, lower gasoline supplies eventually mean higher prices.
If crude oil prices, which are determined largely by events and the threat of events in the Persian Gulf, do not soon fall substantially more -to, say, $30 or so - then the likely outcome is that gasoline prices will catch up with them, industry analysts say. Stockpiles are substantial at the moment and the driving season is over, which would slow any major shift, but supply is down, too.
''It can't go on,'' said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, adding that some refiners were losing money. ''Unless crude prices drop in the very near future, which isn't likely, we will have to see product prices go up.''
The president of Conoco Inc., Constantine S. Nicandros, said yesterday that when Mr. Bush made his request for restraint, ''I said, this is a temporary thing and I don't mind taking a hit for a little while.'' But eventually, he said, ''you've got to recover your raw materials.''
So far, the major oil companies, whose pricing effectively sets a ceiling on what others can demand at the pump, have sacrificed profits in their ''downstream'' operations, refining and marketing, even as profits increase in their ''upstream'' drilling operations.
Refinery margins are commonly measured by the ''crack spread,'' a formula that compares the price of three barrels of oil with that of two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of distillate oil, like diesel or home heating oil. The Oil Daily Group, based in London, reported last Friday that the spread had declined from $10 per barrel of crude in August to under $1.50 a barrel now. In some refineries, that $1.50 does not cover operating costs.
 
Windfall-Profits Tax Feared
The big oil companies appear to have sacrificed downstream profits largely because they fear that if they appear too profitable Congress will reimpose windfall-profits taxes on their oil-pumping operations.
But if the major oil companies can achieve balance that way, the artificially low prices at the pump will still have an effect, by cutting gasoline supplies. And if supplies decline even slightly more than demand, the result will be price increases, experts say.
Another reason for reduced supply is that refineries abroad are increasingly shipping to nations with higher prices. That means just about anywhere else in the industrial world, according to the Department of Energy. Since the end of July the retail price of gasoline, excluding taxes, is up by more than 50 cents in France, Germany, Italy and Britain, and 64 cents in Japan, compared with the 26-cent rise here.
A wild card in predicting gasoline prices is the speed at which demand for gasoline will shrink. It was down about 6.1 percent in September, according to the Oil and Gas Journal, and will go lower as the price rises and if a general recession takes hold. No one is sure just what amount is being consumed, and part of the September drop may be a decision by nervous buyers who stocked up in August to let their inventories decline in September.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rise 0.8% Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
With sharply climbing oil prices accounting for more than half the increase, the Consumer Price Index rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in September for the second straight month. That raised the inflation rate so far this year to 6.6 percent.
Despite the price surge, today's Labor Department report met a generally favorable reception among economists, most of whom had accurately anticipated the continuing price impact of the confrontation in Persian Gulf. They noted, for example, that the rise in the so-called core inflation - the index excluding energy and food - was three-tenths of 1 percent, less than in August and only half as much as in July. 
The report was also consistent with a slumping economy, and analysts anticipated that the oil-driven inflation, which may prove temporary, would not dissuade the Federal Reserve from cutting short-term interest rates once a satisfactory deficit-reduction plan is in place.
The higher cost of imported oil also had an big impact in the trade deficit report released by the Government today. The deficit for August rose 2.4 percent, to $9.3 billion, chiefly because of the big oil price jump caused by the Persian Gulf crisis. [Page D6.] Increases to Be 5.4% An immediate result of the report today was a calculation by the Social Security Administration that cost-of-living increases for retirees and other beneficiaries would be 5.4 percent in 1991. The average monthly benefit for retired workers rises to $602, from $571; the average for a couple, both of whom receive benefits, rises to $1,022, from $970.
Today's report, which appeared to contribute to a rally in the stock and bond markets, tended to reassure economists that inflation remained largely under control and that even the shocks resulting from the explosion in oil prices were smaller than many had feared.
Prices of plastics and other goods derived from petroleum seem checked by weak demand and strong competition, said Gilbert Benz, an economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. ''It's much more difficult to pass on price increases'' to others, he said, allaying recent fears that the oil shock would be quickly transmitted throughout the economy.
Mr. Benz also noted that inflation in services was four-tenths of 1 percent last month, markedly below the increases of six-tenths or seven-tenths posted in June, July and August. Services are an ever-growing share of the economy and are seen as harder to contain than goods prices.
The price of energy of all kinds jumped 5.6 percent in September after a 4.3 percent August advance, with gasoline soaring 9.5 percent to bring its two-month rise since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to 17.9 percent.
Among the seven main categories in the price index, the biggest impact was in transportation, where motor fuels accounted for more than 80 percent of a 2.3 percent advance. Public transportation costs rose 1.5 percent, the biggest advance since March, reflecting 1.9 percent increases in both airline fares and other intercity travel. Prices of new cars, however, edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent and used cars eased two-tenths.
 
Housing Component Up
The housing component, which represents 42 percent of the index, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in September, well below the seven-tenths of 1 percent rise for August and the lowest since May. Sharp increases for household fuels - with heating oil up 15.9 percent and natural gas up 1.5 percent - were partly offset by a decline for hotel rooms. And renters' costs rose only negligibly after two months of sharp increases.
Food and beverage prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in August, as an upturn in fruits and vegetables was more than offset by smaller increases in dairy products and each of the other major grocery-store groups. Egg prices tumbled 5.9 percent.
Apparel prices climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent, mostly because of the continued introduction of higher-priced fall and winter merchandise. Although women's and girls' apparel rose 1.5 percent, the C.P.I. branch chief, Patrick C. Jackman, said this was a smaller increase than he had expected and seemed to reflect the weak economy and intense competition for the consumer's dollar.
Inflation even slowed a bit in medical care, where prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in September after two months of nine-tenths of 1 percent increases.
 
Higher Admission Prices
The lightly weighted entertainment category - 4.4 percent of the index -jumped to an eight-tenths of 1 percent increase from two-tenths in August, mainly reflecting higher admission prices for movies, theaters, concerts, sports events and fees for participant sports.
The other-goods-and-services category fell two-tenths of 1 percent as school supplies and tuitions rose less than the seasonal adjustment factor. Before adjustment, college tuitions climbed 3.4 percent, bringing the 12-month increase to 8.3 percent.
The September price surge lifted the inflation rate for the third quarter to 7.9 percent, up from 3.5 percent in the second quarter but below the 8.5 percent first-quarter rate when energy prices were also soaring.
The consumer inflation rate was 4.6 percent in 1989.
 
Annual Rate 9.5%
Before its upward rounding, the Consumer Price Index covering all urban consumers rose 0.7604563, or 9.5 percent if maintained and compounded for 12 months.
The index covering urban wage earners and clerical workers also rose eight-tenths of 1 percent last month. It is this index that is used to adjust Federal benefit programs, including Social Security. The 5.4 percent increase for 1991 represents the amount by which prices in the third quarter of 1990 exceeded those in the comparable 1989 period.

HEADLINE: Dow Soars 64.85 Points, To 2,452.72

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stable oil prices carried the stock market sharply higher yesterday, with transportation stocks a big beneficiary.
The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chips soared 64.85 points, or 2.7 percent, to 2,452.72.
The rise also ran through most of the big stocks, with the Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues rising 6.98, or 2.3 percent, to 305.74.
Trading volume surged to 204.1 million shares, from 161.3 million the day before. It was the first time volume had passed the 200-million-share mark since early this month. 144 Stocks at New Lows While 1,116 stocks rose and 12 touched new 52-week highs, 436 declined and 144 fell to new lows. 
Among the new highs, Ralston Purina jumped 6, to a high of 107 3/8. John M. McMillin, food analyst for Prudential-Bache, said Ralston was expected to report strong earnings on Nov. 1.
Among the new lows, Freddie Mac, a quasi-government agency that buys and sells mortgages, fell 1 7/8, to 37 7/8, after hitting a new low of 37 3/4. The agency said it would charge off $124 million from its loan loss reserves, but that earnings for the quarter would not be affected.
Traders called the big market upturn just another rally in a bear market. Birinyi Associates said that despite three waves of program buying and an equal number of selling programs, the activity trimmed the Dow a little more than a point.
 
Small Stocks Show Gains
Some of the small stocks, particularly the high-tech issues, also showed strong gains.
The Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.25, or 2.2 percent, to 334.03. The small stocks on the American Stock Exchange lagged a bit. The Amex's market value index rose only 2.71 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 291.84.
''The stock market is still marching to the tune of the price of oil,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for the First Albany Corporation.
Crude oil fell early in the day to a low of $34.40 a barrel, and the Dow jumped 18 points. By 11:15 A.M., oil moved only slightly higher, and the Dow moved ahead 43 points. By 1:15 P.M. oil retreated a bit, but the Dow was ahead more than 50 points. From then on and for most of the session both moved ahead together, but by the end of the day the oil was up only 8 cents a barrel, to $36.80.
''Stocks look cheap, and there's a lot of cash and itchy investors around,'' Mr. Johnson said.
Figures released last month by the Investment Company Institute, trade group for the mutual fund industry, show that mutual funds currently have close to 12 percent of their assets in cash - the second highest in 20 years.
''That's enough for a spirited rally,'' he said.
''The only thing missing is a catalyst to move confidence just a notch, and the decline in oil prices was the catalyst.''
 
Reaction to Economic Data
Less significant to traders were yesterday's economic figures. The rise in the Consumer Price Index was lower than expected, Mr. Johnson said, and consequently was ''helpful'' in lifting the market. He added that the market largely ignored the merchandise trade deficit, which he described as being in line with expectations.
''It's hard to make the case that this will be anything but a rally in a bear market unless we get a resolution to the main problems. The Middle East crisis continues to mean that risks in the stock and bond market are very high.'' The budget talks are, of course, the other big problem.
Moving up on the drop in oil prices, Delta Air Lines rose 3 1/8, to 60 1/2; AMR 2 1/2, to 48 1/4; Southwest Airlines 1 1/8, to 15 7/8; USAir 1 3/8, to 16 3/8; Federal Express 2, to 39 1/4; Burlington Northern 1 1/4, to 26 5/8; CSX 1 1/8, to 27 5/8, and Union Pacific 1 1/4, to 64.
While AMR's earnings fell 52 percent, they were stronger than expected and helped lift airline stocks. Michael R. Armellino, the Goldman, Sachs analyst, added it to his list of recommendations.
He said he thought oil prices would drop ''substantially'' and that airline stocks would soon outperform the market.
UAL rose 5, to 94 3/8. After the market closed, the company said Keith Gollust and Paul Tierney of Coniston Partners, which owns 11.8 percent, would become UAL directors and had agreed not to change their holdings. UAL said it might repurchase up to two million shares.
Among the high-tech stocks, Digital Equipment rose 4 1/4, to 48, on 2.1 million shares despite a sharp drop in profits; it said it wanted to cut its work force by 5,000. Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/2, to 29 1/4; NCR 1 3/8, to 46 1/2; Compaq Computer 3 1/4, to 42, and I.B.M. 4 5/8, to 105 3/8, on 1.9 million shares.
Citicorp, which sold for as much as 29 5/8 in the last year, headed the Big Board active list for the third day in a row, rising 3/8, to 13 1/8, on 7.7 million shares. After a sharp drop in profits, It is expected to lay off as many as 5,000 at a cost of $100 million.
Commenting on the group, Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Advisers, said, ''I've never seen a new bull market begin without leadership from financial services stocks - insurance, banks, S.& L.'s - and these are so wounded I can't see anything more than brief, sharp rallies.''

HEADLINE: For Dow Chemical, The Good Times Stall

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Mich.

 BODY:
In the last few years, the Dow Chemical Company has ridden a wave of expansion, driven by a strong market for chemicals. But now the wave may have crested for the nation's second-largest chemical company. A number of analysts contend that the company took on too much and will be paying too dearly.
The company's aggressive expansion helped earnings to a record $9.20 a share last year from 20 cents in 1985. [But profits have started to slide - 52 percent in the third quarter, announced Thursday, and 50 percent in the second - and many analysts think Dow's earnings will tumble at least 25 percent for the year.] Dow, second in size only to E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company as a chemical producer, has in the last three years allied itself with makers of pharmaceuticals, most notably Marion Laboratories; raised its production of high-performance plastics; solidified its dominance in chemicals, and bought specialty-chemical concerns. 
 
The Market Is Sliding
But today the market for commodity chemicals, the building-block products that go into everything from tires to plastics, is sliding after three booming years as the economy slows.
''This will affect them to a larger degree than many of the other companies in the chemical industry,'' said Anantha Raman, president of Anantha Raman & Company, an investment firm based in Parsippany, N.J., that specializes in the chemical industry. Despite some significant diversification by Dow, commodity chemicals still represent nearly a third of the company's sales, more than at competitors like Monsanto and Du Pont, he said.
Analysts are also troubled by Dow's acquisition of a 67 percent stake in Marion Laboratories last year. The acquisition built the company's interest in the lucrative pharmaceutical business, but saddled it with much higher debt - $6.14 billion currently, up from $3.95 billion in 1987.
Furthermore, Dow is now in the midst of a sweeping capital spending program that will cost nearly $2 billion this year alone and that analysts fear could lead to a cash squeeze. ''I see one of the classic mistakes that a company in a capital-intensive business can make,'' said Paul T. Leming, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''They committed to an aggressive capital spending program at the peak of a cycle. Then, you have to borrow to keep funding the capital spending program.''
Adding to the uncertainty about the company's outlook is the Mideast crisis. Higher oil prices translate directly into higher chemical costs, and Dow is a leading producer of ethylene, which is derived from oil, as well as of oil-based plastics and advanced materials, which account for 40 percent of Dow's sales. It is unclear whether the company will be able to pass higher raw-materials costs along to customers in a period of weakened demand and overcapacity. [Dow reported Thursday that its net income had dropped to $282 million, or $1.04 a share, in the third quarter, from $589 million, or $2.19 a share, for the third quarter of 1989. Sales rose 16 percent, to $4.92 billion from $4.25 billion.] A Sense of Unease These developments have created some sense of unease at Dow's campus-like headquarters here, where 8,000 executives and workers have become accustomed to strong growth. Frank P. Popoff, the company's president and chief executive, acknowledges that conditions at Dow are now far from robust, but he maintains that after five years of spectacular earnings growth, it would not be reasonable to expect the pace to be sustained. ''We don't measure ourselves in short cycles,'' Mr. Popoff said. ''We are committed to industries - automotive, construction and appliance -that move in cycles with the economy.''
Mr. Popoff said the company had scaled back its budget for new plants, equipment and properties. He declined to give specific figures, saying only that Dow's capital spending budget this year would be ''less than $2 billion, instead of more than $2 billion.'' Over the next three years the company will spend $500 million less than called for in earlier plans, he said.
 
'A Very Strong Position'
As for Dow's debt level, Mr. Popoff said, ''We are not any more leveraged than we have been in the past.'' He also said that the company's plants were operating at a high level.
Mr. Popoff is not accustomed to being on the defensive against Wall Street analysts. Under his leadership, the last few years have been wildly prosperous for Dow.
In addition to strong growth in chemicals, Dow has established itself as a leader in consumer products, with such labels as Handi-Wrap and Saran Wrap plastic films and Spray'n Wash and Fantastic cleaners. The company has also solidified its position as the leading maker of chlorine and caustic soda on the chemical side, and polyethylene and polystyrene on the plastics side.
In addition, the company's advanced polymers business is considered a source of potential growth. Dow last year began a joint venture with the United Technologies Corporation to develop advanced plastics for the automotive and aerospace industries. And the outlook for that business is bright, analysts say, because of renewed interest in reducing the weight of cars.
Now, with the industry on the downturn, Mr. Popoff said, Dow's return on equity will not continue at last year's level of 35 percent, but will more likely be in the 20 percent range over the next few years. [Dow's stock, which traded at around $75 at the beginning of the year, closed Thursday at $41.625.] Several analysts, including Mr. Leming and Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bacche, have downgraded Dow's stock from ''buy'' to ''hold.''
A key reason for the analysts' disaffection is Dow's acquisition of the 67 percent stake in Marion Labs. Under the complicated transaction, Dow agreed to pay Marion shareholders a total of $1.5 billion by September 1991, or a larger amount the following year if Marion's stock price did not reach $45.77 a share. The company's payment would decrease if Marion's shares rose above $30. [Marion's shares closed Thursday at $31.125.] Even if Marion's shares increase to $35, Dow Chemical would still have to pay $1 billion.
Still, Mr. Popoff maintains that the company's strategy is sound, and he said detractors fail to look at the long-term picture. The Marion acquisition, he said, ''is the right thing to do strategically'' in an age in which the chemical industry is global and the company must compete against such international giants as ICI Industries of Britain and, BASF, Bayer and Hoechst of Germany. He added that ''we have confidence in the stock.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
If a Recession, How Serious?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IT is probable, but not yet certain, that the United States is in a recession.
The highly regarded Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics of the University of Michigan, in a report issued last Friday, estimated that real gross national product declined at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent in the July-September quarter. But this week the Federal Reserve Board reported that helped by a jump in auto sales, industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September, and it revised its figures upward for July and August, showing a slightly rising trend for the third quarter.
The basic trend in the overall economy right now can be described as wiggling around zero. The consensus forecast of the 50 economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators calls for real G.N.P. to decline six-tenths of 1 percent in the current quarter and one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1991, which would technically make it a recession. But the consensus calls for recovery to start in the second quarter of 1991 and pick up gradually as the year wears on. 
There is still some chance, however, that we can pull ourselves out of the current morass. Most important, the Fed is likely to bring down interest rates once a budget agreement between the Administration and Congress is set.
The Fed is worried about a credit crunch that could dump the economy into recession and crack its financial structure. In his Congressional testimony last July, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said: ''We have been closely watching various interest rate spreads and other indicators to determine if the pulling back of commercial banks to less lax lending standards is moving over the line, so to speak, and in effect creating a tightening in credit markets independent of actions by the Federal Reserve.'' His conclusion: a tightening ''of modest dimensions may be occurring.''
Since then, the danger to borrowers and banks alike has increased. As James J. O'Leary, economic consultant to the United States Trust Company of New York, puts it, ''Many commercial banks and life insurance companies, including many large ones, are seriously undercapitalized, raising the risk of insolvencies as large loan losses continue.'' Hard pressed for reserves, and nervous about nonperforming loans, many banks are turning down borrowers who once would have been considered creditworthy.
A tightening of private credit has the same impact on the economy as a tightening by the Fed, as Mr. Greenspan has made clear. To prevent the system from seizing up, and falling, many businesses say, the Fed should make more reserves available and bring down interest rates.
After the lending binge of the 1980's, the restoration of stricter lending standards is necessary and healthy. But the Fed is now worrying about signs that the banking system is contracting more than it should and endangering the economy.
However, the Fed still believes that the money-supply indicator it watches most closely - M-2, which includes currency in circulation and demand deposits plus time and savings deposits - is growing adequately, within its 1990 target range of 3 to 7 percent. But M-2 is in the lower half of that range, and has been slowing. A more decisive move toward easing by the Fed may be needed to prevent a worsening credit crunch that would chop into the nation's money supply.
The gulf crisis and the surge in oil prices have stirred both recessionary and inflationary fears. But higher oil prices have also spurred spending in the United States for oil drilling and production. And, assuming no further acceleration in oil prices or, preferably, a continuation of the decline that set in this week, the prospects of recovery in 1991 will be strengthened.
The biggest risk to this forecast of sluggish growth or moderate recession through the rest of this year and early next year, followed by a gradual recovery, is the threat of a financial crisis that would result if several major banks were to go under. But it is unlikely that the Federal Reserve, Congress and the Administration would permit that to happen. A more likely outcome involves rescues and mergers of threatened major institutions.
Another big risk is that of an outflow of foreign capital. Yutaka Yamaguchi, the chief representative in the Americas of the Bank of Japan, that country's central bank, said in an interview in New York that he was not greatly concerned whether the United States was in a slight recession or still growing slightly - it came to much the same thing. What he was worried about, he said, were ''external shocks that could have a negative impact'' on America's highly leveraged corporations and financial institutions. He expressed strong agreement with the Federal Reserve's policy, which he called ''very cautious.'' Too sharp a fall in United States interest rates, while foreign rates are rising, could increase capital outflow.
This must be the best-advertised, most carefully watched financial contraction ever. That in itself may help to keep it from becoming an economic catastrophe like the one in the early 1930's.

HEADLINE: A.T.&T. and 3 Regional Bells Post Slightly Higher Profits

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
A.T.& T. reported a 1.9 percent increase in third-quarter earnings yesterday despite a much higher tax liability. Three Bell regionals also posted slightly higher earnings.
''We consider it over all a very solid quarter, particularly in view of what is happening to the economy at large,'' said Morris Tanenbaum, chief financial officer at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
Higher interest expenses and the loss of investment tax credits prevented an 11 percent increase in A.T.& T.'s operating income from reaching the bottom line, Mr. Tanenbaum said. Overseas sales of telephone network equipment climbed sharply for the quarter. 
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, A.T.& T.'s share price gained $1.125, to $32.
Nynex, Bell Atlantic and U S West all reported quarterly profit gains of a few pennies a share. ''They were in line with expectations, non-eventful,'' said Marion M. Boucher, a telephone industry bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
A.T.& T.
A.T.& T. announced profits of $712 million, or 65 cents a share, up from $699 million. Earnings a share a year earlier were also 65 cents, reflecting the fact the company had fewer outstanding shares then. Sales rose 5.2 percent, to $9.36 billion from $8.89 billion.
A.T.& T., the nation's largest long-distance carrier, posted a 7 percent increase in traffic from a year earlier. MCI and US Sprint are growing faster, but the difference is narrowing, said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at Paine Webber.
Revenues from long-distance traffic, minus payments to local telephone companies for completing calls, rose only 1.5 percent as rates fell and more customers switched to new and less expensive services.
If the American economy goes into a recession, the long-distance industry will probably continue to grow, but at a slower pace, said Robert E. Allen, the chairman and chief executive of A.T.& T. The effects of a recession on A.T.& T.'s long-distance business are unclear, he added. ''It's really hard to tell because this would be the first recession in which we've had such active competition -there's really no baseline experience,'' he said, in a brief interview on Saturday at a conference in Hot Springs, Va.
Because of rising sales overseas, A.T.& T.'s telephone network equipment revenues rose 12.2 percent. The gain came despite a dip in sales to the seven regional Bells, which normally account for three-quarters of such sales.
 
Bell Atlantic
Third-quarter profits at the Bell Atlantic Corporation rose 4.2 percent, to $358.4 million, or 91 cents a share, from $344.1 million a year earlier, or 86 cents a share. Sales climbed to $3.1 billion from $2.91 billion.
Based in Philadelphia with local telephone service in six Eastern states and the District of Columbia, Bell Atlantic posted steady growth of 3.2 percent in telephone lines despite a weak regional economy. The company's results were ''right on the button, as usual,'' said Daniel P. Reingold, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
Bell Atlantic's share price rose $1.25 yesterday, to $50.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Nynex
The Nynex Corporation, which serves New York and five New England states, reported third-quarter profits of $296.7 million, or $1.50 a share, on sales of $3.4 billion. For the comparable period a year earlier, the White Plains-based company earned $288.7 million, or $1.47 a share, on sales of $3.3 billion.
''The downturn in the Northeast economy is reflected in this quarter's flat revenues in the telecommunications sector,'' William C. Ferguson, the chairman of Nynex, said in a statement.
Nynex's third-quarter results included a $1.4 million payment to the Government and a onetime reduction of $35.5 million in the rates charged to long-distance companies for completing calls.
Both moves were the result of a consent decree with the Federal Communications Commission, under which the F.C.C. dropped its proceeding against the company concerning Nynex's alleged siphoning of profits to an unregulated subsidiary from the New York Telephone Company and the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company. Nynex did not admit any wrongdoing.
The share price of Nynex fell 37.5 cents yesterday, to $70.75, on the Big Board.
 
U S West
Headquartered in Englewood, Colo., and serving 14 Western states, U S West Inc. posted third-quarter profits of $302.6 million, or 77 cents a share, up from $258.1 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased to $2.48 billion, from $2.32 billion.
The sharp increase in profits reflected the company's low growth in expenses. U S West's cost of services and products rose nine-tenths of a percent from a year earlier, while its selling, general and administrative expenses dropped six-tenths of 1 percent.
U S West's share priced rose $1.50 yesterday, to $37.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Japanese Banker to Head A Morgan Stanley Unit

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The Morgan Stanley Group said yesterday that it had hired a Japanese banker, Takeo Kani, to be chairman of Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd. and general manger of the firm's Tokyo securities branch.
Mr. Kani, 58, is joining Morgan Stanley from the Industrial Bank of Japan, where he has spent 36 years. He came to the United States five years ago to be vice chairman of the IBJ/Schroder Bank and Trust Company in New York after the Schroder bank was purchased by the Japanese bank. 
Mr. Kani will join Morgan Stanley in New York next month and will take over in Tokyo Jan. 1.
There, he will succeed David S. Phillips, 57, who is retiriing at the end of the year to become an advisory director of the Morgan Stanley Group and senior adviser to the firm in Japan, his home country.
When Mr. Phillips came to the United States to study at the University of California at Berkeley, he took the name of a professor of economics with whose family he lived and who was a close friend of his father's in Tokyo, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said.
In Tokyo, Mr. Kani will also become co-head of the firm's investment banking business, working with John S. Wadsworth Jr., the current head of investment banking. After a transition, Morgan Stanley said, Mr. Kani will assume responsibility for investment banking. Mr. Wadsworth will continue as president of Morgan Stanley Japan and deputy general manager, as well as head of the firm's investment banking business in Asia.
Mr. Kani said yesterday that Morgan Stanley was expanding rapidly in Japan and would continue to grow. The company currently employs 700 people there. Of 10 Morgan Stanley managing directors in Tokyo, six are Japanese.
Mr. Kani declined to make any comments on the direction of the Japanese stock market, saying he had been in commercial banking and felt unqualified to speak on the market at this point.
Mr. Kani graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1954 and joined the Industrial Bank that year. He founded IBJ International in London in 1975 and was named a managing director of the Industrial Bank in 1984.
''We are delighted to have a seasoned banker of the stature of Mr. Kani succeed to this leadership role,'' said S. Parker Gilbert, chairman of the Morgan Stanley Group.

HEADLINE: Reflecting Oil Cost, Trade Deficit Hits $9.3 Billion

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit continued to worsen in August, rising 2.4 percent, to $9.3 billion, the largest imbalance since January, the Commerce Department reported today. The increase chiefly reflected the higher cost of imported oil resulting from the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
The first Government report on the trade gap covering the period after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait showed that the average price of oil imported into the United States rose by $5.04 a barrel, to $19.54.
Over all, imports rose 1.8 percent, to $41.97 billion, a high, while exports were up 1.6 percent, to $32.63 billion, the third-highest monthly level. Although the trade gap widened in August from a revised July deficit of $9.12 billion, it improved over the first eight months, showing a seasonally adjusted rate of $96.8 billion, down from the $110.7 billion shortfall in 1989. 
But the further rise of oil prices since August could spell more bad news later this year.
The Commerce Department figures showed a $4.8 billion oil bill for August - 20 percent higher than in July - which would have been even greater had there not been a decline in the volume of oil imported - from 274 million barrels to 245 million.
''We're not out of the woods yet in factoring in the oil shock,'' said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley.
Excluding oil, the deficit in August, at $5 billion, showed a modest decline from the $5.4 billion in July. Non-oil imports fell during the month by three-tenths of 1 percent, against the 1.6 percent rise in exports.
The deficit has been narrowing since 1987, when it hit a record $152 billion. In 1988 the overall gap between exports and imports fell to $118.53 and in 1989 to $109.40 billion.
Over the first eight months, the non-petroleum deficit, which some Government economists consider a good measure of international competitiveness, was down 28.5 percent from the period a year earlier.
J. Antonio Villamil, chief economist at the Commerce Department, said the improvement reflected an 8.3 percent year-to-date gain in exports compared with a 2.5 percent rise in non-petroleum imports over the same period.
''We expect this trend to continue, reflecting the growing ability of U.S. industry to to compete in expanding overseas markets,'' Mr. Villamil said.
Exports, the strongest part of a weakening American economy, have been made more competitive by the recent decline in the dollar's international value compared with the German mark and the Japanese yen, and by still robust economic activity in Europe, Japan and other major markets. A declining dollar makes American goods cheaper overseas.
Exports of food, beverages, consumer goods and industrial supplies were particularly strong in August. But aircraft sales, another big item on the balance sheet, fell.
Altogether, exports of manufactured goods, at $23.9 billion, were $400 million greater than in July, they were $900 million less than the average of the first seven months of this year. Imports of manufactured goods, at $33.3 billion, were $400 million less than July and $1.5 billion more than the $31.8 billion seven-month average.
Michael P. Niemira, economist for the Mitsubishi Bank, said that exports might have gone higher during the month had it not been for the requisitioning of civilian aircraft to transport more than 200,000 American troops to Saudi Arabia.
 
Less Capacity for Merchandise
This meant less capacity to fly out merchandise for foreign customers. Although the large bulk of exports moves aboard ships, Mr. Niemira said that in terms of value, commercial aircraft take about a third of the total.
An official at the Federal Express Corporation confirmed that air freight capacity had been withdrawn in both the trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic markets as a result of Government use of the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet for the flights to Saudi Arabia.
He said it was likely, however, that shipments delayed in August for national security reasons may help swell the September totals.
A country-by-country breakdown showed that the deficit with Japan, which had been moving down earlier this year, jumped $800 million in August to $3.8 billion. One of the factors was an increase in imports of Japanese cars.
For the first eight months, the deficit with Japan stood at $26.3 billion, compared with $32.4 billion over the corresponding period last year.
In August, the United States also recorded large deficits with Taiwan, $1.2 billion; China, $1.1 billion; Germany, $1.1 billion; Canada, $509 million; South Korea, $518 million; Venezuela, $466 million; Saudi Arabia, $456 million; Hong Kong, $397 million, and Brazil, $178 million.

HEADLINE: A Saudi Oil Windfall? If Prices Remain High and Fields Intact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Whether Saudi Arabia reaps a windfall from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait depends on two big ifs - if its oilfields are undamaged by war and if oil prices stay high.
If those conditions are met, the profit is likely to exceed even the substantial new commitments Saudi Arabia undertook after the invasion: subsidies of $1 billion a month to the United States and the Saudis' neighbors in the Persian Gulf that are supporting the United Nations embargo of Iraq; about $1 billion a month in extra operating expenses for the Saudi military, and the purchase of $7.3 billion in American weapons. Much of that equipment has already been sent to Saudi Arabia, although it is not clear exactly when payment will be made.
Last week, with crude oil selling at $40 a barrel, the Saudis were thought to be able to earn as much as an additional $16 billion in the fourth quarter, which would more than cover those expenses. Oil has fallen in recent days to below $37 a barrel, and should it stay at that level the extra Saudi profits for the quarter might be closer to $14 billion. 
The real windfall could begin in 1991, if Persian Gulf tensions and oil prices remain high and the Saudi Government does not incur additional costs, said Edgard H. Habib, the senior director of the Middle East and Africa service at the WEFA Group, a large consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''What is critical in this situation is how long it lasts,'' he added. $65 Billion Extra Based on the rough-and-ready arithmetic of multiplying expanded Saudi oil production next year by nearly $37 a barrel - which is what Saudi Arabia actually receives when the world price is $40 - analysts estimate that the extra revenues could total as much as $65 billion over the next 12 months. Balanced against that would be continued monthly subsidies and military expenses, the proposed purchase of another $14 billion of American weapons for delivery over the next several years - which has drawn hostility in Congress -and a range of other expenses that are hard to estimate, like the accelerated development of oilfields.
The estimates of additional annual oil revenues are highly conditional. They assume that Saudi oilfields will not be damaged by military action or sabotage, while tensions nonetheless keep oil prices high. Yet oil traders and analysts say the surge in crude oil prices after the Iraqi invasion reflected, in part, concerns that a Persian Gulf war would destroy some Saudi oilfields, which would limit the Saudi Government's ability to benefit from higher prices.
If Saudi oilfields continue to produce at full capacity, oil prices may fall, said Fareed Mohamedi, an oil industry analyst at the Petroleum Finance Company. Contracts for delivery of oil next spring are trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange for $29 to $31 a barrel, meaning that the consensus of the market is that there will then be nearly adequate supplies and lower prices, he said.
Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's former oil minister, said recently that crude oil should drop to $15 to $18 a barrel when the Persian Gulf crisis was settled. Reimposing production quotas may be difficult then for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 
Long-Term Commitments
Higher oil prices also represent a two-edged sword for Saudi rulers, producing extra revenues now but increasing the risk that Western nations will look harder for new sources of energy. ''They've got 120 years of reserves - it's not in their long-term interest to have oil-shale production, geothermal energy and other alternatives become economical,'' said Ronald J. Rizzuto, a finance professor at the University of Denver who specializes in the economics of the industry.
Saudi Arabia has acquired several long-term commitments since the Iraqi invasion, the cost of which may dwarf any oil windfall that lasts only a few months, experts say.
Countries that have sided with Saudi Arabia are likely to expect economic assistance, said David T. Mizrahi, the editor and publisher of the Mideast Report, a New York newsletter. Saudi officials hinted at such aid when the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia established diplomatic relations on Sept. 17, he said.
 
Some Aid Is Halted
At the same time, Saudi Arabia has cut off its aid to Jordan and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in response to their support of Iraq. Jordan has lost $350 million a year, plus subsidized oil, while the P.L.O. has lost $80 million to $100 million a year.
The biggest expense to the Saudis may be a permanently larger and better-equipped army. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, said recently that his country had begun a review of the size of its armed forces. Iraq has a little more than twice the population of Saudi Arabia, but its regular army is nearly 10 times as big.
Prince Bandar and the Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment on how extra oil revenues would affect Saudi Arabia.
The country has relied more on diplomacy and lavish foreign aid and less on the size of its armed forces to maintain its independence for the last several decades. Since World War II, Saudi diplomacy has emphasized the kingdom's devotion to Islam and its defense of two of the religion's holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, in contrast to the secular Pan-Arab nationalism espoused by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt in the 1950's and 1960's and Saddam Hussein now.
 
The Social Costs
The average Saudi is unlikely to perceive any dramatic benefit from higher oil prices, said Sharif Ghalib, the director of the Africa and Middle East department at the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based research organization supported by international banks. That is because the Saudi Government had planned to cover a projected deficit this year of $6.7 billion by selling bonds, but may instead keep the additional oil revenues.
Estimates of Saudi Arabia's financial gains and losses as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait also ignore the social costs to the kingdom of being unable to defend itself and forced to accept more than 100,000 foreign troops.
The clearest beneficiaries of Iraq's invasion, although not in total dollars received, may be the oil exporters that do not border Kuwait or Iraq and are receiving higher prices for their oil. These countries include Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Yemen.
''For the countries that have high populations and low incomes, this is a fortune'' because they spent their previous oil revenues and ran up large foreign debts, said Marvin Zonis, a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business who studies Middle Eastern politics and business. ''The other countries are living and dying on these barrels,'' he said. Algeria has already said it will devote most of its extra oil revenues to the payment of overdue foreign debts.
''When the creditors see these windfall gains, they will not say, 'Sow it in your economy and pay us later,' '' Mr. Habib said.

HEADLINE: Macy Will Report Deeper Losses for the Fourth Quarter and the Year

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company's fourth-quarter loss deepened to $80 million, from $57.3 million a year earlier, and its losses for the full fiscal year ended July 28 more than tripled, to $215.3 million, from $63 million the year before, according to statements relayed to credit agencies and confirmed yesterday by sources close to Macy.
Macy, New York's biggest retailer and the operator of about 100 department stores in the East, South and West, had a sales gain of 2.5 percent in the quarter, to $1.63 billion, from $1.59 billion the year before. For the full year, Macy's sales rose 4.3 percent, to $7.27 billion from $6.97 billion. 
The preliminary figures for the year were published in The Wall Street Journal and Women's Wear Daily yesterday. The fourth-quarter results were extrapolated from the full-year results and those for the nine months ended April 28. Macy expects to furnish final results in a financial statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission late next week, One Measure of the Decline Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation fell 22.1 percent, to $721 million, from $926.1 million the year before. The tax aspect does not apply to a company losing money. In the fourth quarter, earnings before inventory accounting adjustment rose 7.2 percent, to $179 million from $167 million. ''The drop in those earnings was due to higher inventory accounting charges, which reduced the income by $35 million,'' said one executive close to Macy.
Macy is one of the nation's most highly leveraged retailers, following its 1986 leveraged buyout and its 1988 acquisition of the Bullock's and I. Magnin stores in California. In its regular, informal report to credit agencies, Macy said that its inventories were $560 million less than a year ago, which could be seen as an indication that Macy, along with most other retailers, does not expect a robust Christmas selling season.
''I think Macy's primary markets in the Northeast and California suffered from very sluggish consumer buying,'' said Janet Mangano, research director for Jesup, Josephthal & Company, New York. ''That produced the kind of top line or sales that would affect any retailer leveraged or not. But then the high leverage makes weak results seem even weaker.''
 
'Macroeconomic Factors' Cited
Ms. Mangano said that Macy had had a relatively good third quarter ended April 28 after two ''very weak'' quarters. But the improved trend waned in the fourth quarter ''probably due to the macro-economic factors,'' Ms. Mangano continued. ''But the fourth quarter may have implications for arranging future lines of credit,'' she added.
Frank Basile, chairman of the CIT Group/Factoring, New York, which has been closely monitoring Macy, said yesterday: ''You can't help but be concerned when dealing with such highly leveraged companies as Macy. But it is actually doing better than most of the others. The company has sufficient resources and support to make it through the holiday, and they have a number of options they could take afterward.''
He said that the recent sale by Macy of its credit unit to the General Electric Capital Corporation ''will benefit Macy's earnings and allow it to cut its debt.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates fell yesterday, as a better-than-expected report on inflation and an early drop in oil prices inspired buying.
The eight-tenths of a percentage point increase in September's Consumer Price Index was as high as most analysts had feared. But excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called core inflation rate rose by a much more modest three-tenths of a percentage point.
''I hate to put too much emphasis on one figure, but the core inflation number was a positive one,'' said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. 
The consumer price figures helped to generate a rash of buy orders.
''A lot of money was spent today,'' one Government bond trader said. ''That's fine for right now, but it makes you wonder if there will be any money around when the refunding takes place.''
 
Quarterly Refunding Auctions
The Treasury, which is expected to hold its quarterly refunding auctions in early November, was forced to cancel a planned auction of one-year Treasury bills yesterday because the Federal Government is still without a budget.
In place of the one-year bills, the Treasury said, it will sell $12.5 billion of 69-day cash management bills today. Analysts said the decision, which allows the Government to raise new cash before the temporary increase in the Federal debt ceiling expires at midnight tonight, effectively gives Congress more time to come up with a new budget.
''The cash management bills, which settle on the day they are sold, will give the Government enough cash to operate until the end of October in the absence of any increase in the debt ceiling,'' said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm.
The move, Mr. Crandall said, ''stretches out the time Congress has to work on the budget by another week. The Bush Administration has rolled the budget deadline back one more time.''
The Treasury Department's announcement helped to push up interest rates on some short-term bills, but had little impact elsewhere in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
Treasury prices, which early in the session rose by as much as a full point, retreated later in the day when oil prices reversed course. But the gains, particulary by bonds, continued a rally that began on Monday.
By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 10/32, up 22/32, to yield 8.81 percent, down from 8.88 percent late Wednesday. At the end of trading last Friday the bellwether issue was offered at a price to yield 8.95 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes rose by 14/32, to a late price of 100 1/2, to yield 8.67 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 3/4, up 1/4 point, to yield 8.30 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury bills, rates on three-month bills moved higher in the wake of the Treasury's announcement to sell cash management bills.
 
Three-Month Bill Rates
In late trading, three-month bill rates were offered at a discount rate of 7.24 percent, up seven basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Meanwhile, six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.18 percent.
In other developments, late Wednesday the Resolution Trust Corporation said it had selected Salomon Asset Management, a unit of Salomon Inc., as adviser on the liquidation of the agency's $3.3 billion face-value portfolio of high-yield ''junk bonds.''
Salomon, which was one of 23 firms that were vying for the business, was selected on the basis of ''technical competence and cost to the tax-payer,'' the R.T.C. said.
But market participants said they were somewhat surprised by the selection.
''Salomon doesn't really have a lot of expertise in the market, which from the Government's perspective is good, because it means they don't have any conflicts of interest,'' said one high-yield bond trader, who asked not to be identified. ''At the same time, the selection is kind of curious, because they picked guys who are largely unproven.''
The big rise in the stock market yesterday helped to reverse what had been a sharp drop in the price of a number of actively traded high-yield issues. Traders said that for the day prices of most issues were down only modestly from Wednesday's close.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues dipped by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, prices of most actively quoted issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point, participants said.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Oct. 8. The narrowest measure, M-1, fell by $6.9 billion.
The money report had no real impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Tumbling Dollar Hits A Low Against the Mark

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday, breaking though the 1.50 level against the German mark and ending at its lowest level since the mark was created 42 years ago.
The dollar also fell against other major currencies, including the Japanese yen, where it is no longer far from its low of 120.90 reached in November 1988.
Traders said there was no particular event yesterday that pushed down the dollar, which has been falling steadily since the summer. Instead, it appeared that this was the day that the dollar, weighted down by a bevy of negative factors, just finally stumbled under its burden and fell below an important level against the mark. 
 
Decline to 124.40 Yen
In late trading in New York, the dollar ended at 1.4980 marks, down from 1.5124 Wednesday and 11 percent below where the dollar was on June 1. Against the yen, the dollar was at 124.40, down from 125.43 Wednesday and 13 percent below where it was Aug. 29, the day before the Bank of Japan increased its official discount rate to 6 percent.
''There is a temerity in the marketplace,'' said Jeffrey M. Mondschein, manager of foreign exchange at the Continental Bank in Chicago. ''There is little reason to hold on to the dollar.''
Liliana Nealon, vice president for foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland, said she thought the dollar would continue to fall unless there were some official action by the United States and its allies to stop it. But she said that she did not expect any action and that the economic changes that would support the dollar, like a turnaround in the economy, would not come for some time.
 
Expectation of Recession
Among the factors pushing the dollar down are the expectation of lower interest rates, the expectation of a recession in the United States, a weak stock market and the appearance of Government paralysis, as the White House and the Congress struggle to compromise on a budget and avoid a shutdown of the Federal Government this weekend.
Adding to the negative sentiment is this factor: If there is a budget -which would avoid a Government shutdown and perhaps restore some confidence in the Bush Administration and Congress - traders say they are still likely to sell dollars because such an agreement would heighten the expectation of declining interest rates. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has promised such an easing of interest rates if there is what he calls a credible budget agreement to reduce the Federal deficit.
But if there is no budget agreement, then traders say they will sell dollars because of the Government's fiscal mess and a growing lack of confidence in the ability of the President and Congress to deal with the country's severe economic problems.
Traders said that it was likely that the dollar would soon fall to its all-time low against the yen.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New York Times Co. Posts 43.9% Drop in Operating Net

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported yesterday that income from current operations fell 43.9 percent in the third quarter, to $9.2 million, or 12 cents a share. That compared with operating income of $16.4 million, or 21 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year.
Revenue rose 1.3 percent, to $420.7 million, compared with $415.3 million in the 1989 third quarter. 
The company attributed the decline to a drop in advertising linage at the company's main publication, The New York Times, and an increase in expenses for two new printing plants.
The Times also owns 35 regional newspapers, 17 magazines, 5 television and 2 radio stations, information services businesses and has interests in paper mills.
Lisa Donneson, a newspaper analyst at County NatWest, said the earnings were in line with expectations. ''The New York Times linage is off considerably and the regional papers are doing O.K.,'' she said.
 
Lower Ad Linage
The company said advertising linage at The New York Times for the third quarter fell 10.7 percent from last year's third quarter, to 21.1 million lines, reflecting continued weakness in the New York region's economy. Last year's third quarter had one less Sunday than this year's. Many public newspaper companies have reported significant decreases in linage for the quarter.
Circulation for The Times reached record highs for the six months ended Sept. 30, with 1,108,400 copies sold on weekdays, up 40,400 copies from the same 1989 period, and 1,687,000 copies sold on Sundays, up 58,900.
The company also said operating income fell because of increased depreciation and interest expense from the completion of a new production plant for The New York Times in Edison, N.J., and a new plant at The Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News. The depreciation and interest expense reduced earnings by 9 cents a share in the third quarter.
The company said that excluding increased depreciation and interest, 1990 third-quarter earnings from continuing operations would have equaled the same 21 cents a share as in the 1989 quarter.
 
Special Gain Last Year
In the third quarter, the company's net income fell more sharply than profits from current operations. Net income, at $9.2 million, fell 95.6 percent from $210.8 million, or $2.68 cents a share, in the quarter last year, which contained a special gain of $194.4 million from the sale of the NYT Cable TV unit in August 1989.
The newspaper group had operating income of $19.6 million in the third quarter, down 43.7 percent from $34.9 million a year earlier. Revenues increased to $320.6 million, from $316.2 million last year.
The company's magazine group had an operating loss of $2.3 million on revenues of $81.1 million, compared with a loss of $4.5 million on revenues of $81.4 million in the 1989 third quarter. The most recent losses, which were anticipated, were from the costs of acquiring McCall's magazine in July 1989.
The broadcasting and information services group had third-quarter operating income of $3.3 million on revenue of $19.1 million, compared with operating income of $2.6 million on $17.8 million in revenue in the quarter last year.
The company's share in the earnings of the forest products group declined to $2.4 million, compared with $2.6 million in the 1989 third quarter.
The Times Company's stock closed yesterday at $18.625 a share on the American Stock Exchange, down 12.5 cents.

HEADLINE: First Fidelity Profit Up 29%

 BODY:
The First Fidelity Bancorporation, the largest banking company in New Jersey, yesterday announced profits of $70.1 million in the third quarter, its most profitable quarter in two years.
Third-quarter profits, which equaled $1.14 a share, were up nearly 29 percent from $54.4 million, or 87 cents a share, a year ago. 
Although problems with bad loans continue, particularly as a weakening economy causes more problems for borrowers, First Fidelity is benefiting from a cost-cutting program started early this year when it announced plans to reduce its work force by 10 percent, or 1,400 jobs.
In the third quarter, the company set aside $70 million to cover possible losses on bad loans, up from $50.9 million a year ago but well below the $300 million set aside in the second quarter. Operating expenses, for items like salaries, rent and computers, declined $30.2 million, or 12.7 percent, from a year ago.

Madison Sq. Garden Planning $70 Seats To Pay for Face Lift

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
The owners of Madison Square Garden, which is in the process of an unexpectedly costly overhaul, are preparing a plan for luxury courtside and rinkside seats that could cost as much as $70 apiece for Knicks and Rangers games in the 1991-92 season, according to former executives at the Garden.
The plan, referred to as the ''club'' or ''premium'' seat package, is to be announced to current season ticket-holders after Jan. 1. It would represent a sharp increase in costs for the spectator and perhaps a radical change in the atmosphere at the events as well. The highest ticket price this season is $45, up $10 from last season. Renovation Debt Cited One executive familiar with the plan said the price increases were necessary to help pay off the huge debt incurred by the renovation, which is projected to cost $200 million, twice the original estimate. 
''Obviously they believe there is a segment of the population capable of and prepared to pay that kind of money,'' said one former executive familiar with the plan. ''Whatever, it's still a lot of dough for a ticket,'' he said. And it stands to affect a large number of fans. According to the former officials, the plan as currently devised will involve the upgrading of close to 2,200 courtside or rinkside seats in the building, which holds more than 19,000 fans for basketball games and more than 17,000 for hockey games.
Waitress service, access to the two private clubs under construction, drink trays and larger, reupholstered seats are some of the amenities that would come with the ticket package.
The increased price of the deal, which will likely require the purchase of season tickets for both the Rangers and the Knicks, could force longtime holders of those season tickets to either relocate or abandon them altogether. The former officials said the potential for a backlash from season ticket-holders or corporations was one of the Garden's enduring fears. But, they added, if sales of the ''premium'' seats were good, the Garden plans to consider expanding the luxury section up into a portion of the arena's first promenade.
 
Celebrity Seats, Too
Additonally, according to the former officials, the Garden, which is expected to raise the price of all other seats next season, has plans to expand its allotment of celebrity and promotional courtside seats at Knick games and to sell a portion of them for $300 apiece. These ''v.i.p.'' seats are now distributed free by invitation.
One high-level Garden executive, however, insisted yesterday that the specifics of both plans were still not definite.
''We're not finalized on the plans, and for a lot of reasons,'' said Mike Walker, the Garden's executive vice president for marketing. ''The pricing, for instance, has not been determined. It's not our intent to do anything that would be perceived as taking advantage of any loyal, traditional fans.''
The premium plan, though, follows the recent national trend toward the commercial cultivation of sports events as elite entertainment, a path the Garden, a subsidiary of Paramount Communications, committed itself to when it announced in February 1989 that any plans for relocation had been scotched and that a $100 million renovation would be undertaken of the arena, which was opened in 1968.
''Our objective over all,'' said Mr. Walker, ''was to put the Garden at the top of the list as a major events center.''
 
Atop the Price List
With the proposed increase, the Garden would find itself at the top of the price list for entertainment in the city. At $65 or $70, the ''premium'' seats would outstrip the $26 best seats for a Giants football game. The top price for a Broadway show ticket is $60, although $100 has been announced for a limited number of seats to the musical ''Miss Saigon,'' which is scheduled to open in March.
The Garden's elite seat plan will be outdone only perhaps by the arrangement for Los Angeles Lakers and Kings games at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, Calif., where 128 prime courtside celebrity-type seats go for $450 each per game. At the Forum, there are also 1,704 designated ''Senate'' seats that cost $90 each and where spectators receive similar v.i.p. treatment.
A handful of arenas across the country offer extremely expensive seats, but these are usually limited in number. In Philadelphia, for example, 118 courtside seats sell for $125. The price for 75 exclusive courtside seats for Nets games at Byrne Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., is $75.
The ''club'' or ''premium'' seats, as well as the celebrity section at Knicks games, are only a part of extensive designs the Garden has and that it will unveil next fall with the completion of the renovations.
 
A $36 Top in Boston
Corporations are often willing to absorb high ticket prices to sports events for entertainment purposes, but prices in other cities vary. The top prices at the Boston Garden for hockey (Bruins) and basketball (Celtics) are $36 and $34, respectively. In the Detroit area, home of the National Basketball Association champion Pistons at the Palace in suburban Auburn Hills, Mich., the most expensive regular-season seat is $45.
The top ticket in Chicago is $45 for hockey and $25 for pro basketball. In Los Angeles, although the more established Lakers and Kings can command high prices, the top courtside seat for the rival Clippers is $25. The Los Angeles Rams and Raiders of the National Football League each charge $30 In the New York City area, top hockey prices are $28 for the Devils in the Meadowlands and $22.50 for the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum.
At the Garden, the plan includes revamped concession stands, food courts, redone and enlarged restrooms and construction of 88 luxury boxes that encircle the top of the arena and carry a price tag of from $125,000 to $190,000 annually, to be taken for a minimum of three years. 56 Boxes Opened The Garden, which absorbed a net loss of nearly 1,000 arena seats because of the box suites, opened 56 of the boxes this fall. The remaining 32 will be completed by the 1991 season.
There is, though, ample confusion about how briskly the sale of the suites has gone.
''I understand that there are a substantial number of them unsold,'' said one of the former executives.
Mr. Walker, though, maintained that 60 of the 86 available to the public were under contract. ''We're excited by how it's gone so far,'' he said. Asked whether the deteriorating economic climate, with its resulting corporate layoffs and cutbacks, had left the Garden worried about the eventual marketability of luxury seats and expensive skyboxes, Mr. Walker said:
''I don't know if apprehensive is the right word. We're aware of it and sensitive to it. We're reacting to it as any good business would.''

HEADLINE: For an Expert on Tax Code, Bradley Is Strangely Silent

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
At a time when Washington's politicians and New Jersey's voters are gagging over taxes, Senator Bill Bradley, the architect of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, is barely uttering a word here on the very issue that gained him national attention four years ago.
As Mr. Bradley seeks re-election to a third term, his campaign commercials do not mention his role in his major achievement in office, the Tax Reform Act. Nor has he given a speech in New Jersey or issued a position paper offering solutions to Federal or state fiscal problems.
Despite continued questioning from his Republican opponent, Mr. Bradley refuses to say whether he supports or opposes the $2.8 billion in new taxes pushed through the New Jersey Legislature by his longtime Democratic colleague, Gov. Jim Florio. Where's Bradley? In Washington, meanwhile, some fellow Democrats have questioned why Mr. Bradley, who is often mentioned as a possible Presidential candidate, and who played such a commanding role during the debate over tax reform four years ago, has taken a markedly low profile on taxes this year. 
Just when the nation is desperate for leadership on fiscal policy, they ask, where is Bill Bradley the tax expert?
''For somebody who has cut out a very impressive turf for himself on the tax code,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a leading Democratic poll taker in Washington, ''it is a little surprising that he has not had a front-and-center role on determining what would be a fair tax code in 1990.''
Mr. Bradley points out that this year, unlike 1986, he was not invited into the meetings of Congressional leaders and White House officials in which most budget initiatives were hammered out. In the last week he has made two statements on the Senate floor, attacking new tax concessions for the oil and gas industry and proposals that he said would unfairly increase tax burdens on the middle class.
Nonetheless, his muted voice on taxes this month reflects how Mr. Bradley has been caught in the strange crosscurrents of politics in 1990: the very leadership on fiscal issues in Washington that brought him national attention four years ago is the kind of association with the nation's fiscal mess that risks wrath from irate voters at home.
''It is a delicate position for Bill Bradley,'' said Michael McCurry, a former director of communications for the Democratic National Committee. ''Emotionally and intellectually, he has invested himself in tax reform and tax simplification. But most people are saying: 'My taxes didn't get reformed. My taxes didn't get simpler.' '' Mr. Bradley's bid for a third term is widely assumed to be easily assured for the state's senior Senator, who has raised $12 million to the $1 million of his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman. Polls show him with huge leads.
New Jerseyans, living in a state conscious of its national image, have often expressed a pride in having a Senator who has achieved stature in foreign affairs and the settlement of international debt issues, and who has been described as a possible Democratic Presidential candidate.
 
Concepts Embraced by Reagan
A good deal of the Senator's prominence grew out of his role as a proponent of tax simplification, the idea of broadening the tax base by removing most exemptions and loopholes, and lowering the rate for most taxpayers. He proposed those ideas in his 1984 book, ''The Fair Tax.''
The idea, which was endorsed with some differences by other elected officials, including Representative Jack F. Kemp, was later embraced in concept by the Reagan Administration.
This year, Mr. Bradley's well-financed campaign has stressed the Senator's commitment to children and the environment, and has dismissed attacks by Ms. Whitman, a former president of the State Board of Public Utilities, that he has shied away from leadership on fiscal issues.
Ms. Whitman has charged that Mr. Bradley was late taking a position on the President's tax proposal, and has an obligation to take a stand on the unpopular Florio tax increases, enacted by the Democratic Governor to eliminate a budget deficit and increase school aid to the state's poor cities.
''He hasn't been a leader in the Federal budget process, just as he refused to be a leader in responding to the Florio tax program,'' said Pat Morrisey, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. ''At the very least you want him to take a firm stand, one way or another.''
In a telephone interview, Mr. Bradley described the Whitman campaign's allegations as unfair, and said he has shown no shyness in discussing his record.
The root of the current Federal budget crisis, he said, was the Reagan tax cuts of 1981, which Mr. Bradley voted against. The 1986 Tax Reform Act made for a more rational process of investments in the American economy and greater economic efficiency.
''I believe the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is a reason why we did not have a recession,'' Mr. Bradley said.
 
Refused to Comment on Kean
He said he had chosen not to include tax reform in his television commercials because the topic was too complex to explain quickly. As for the Florio tax plan, he maintains it is inappropriate for him to comment on state tax issues because he is running for Federal office.
In 1982, Mr. Bradley said, he also refused to comment on the tax increases of Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican.
Mr. Bradley was also the subject of some grumbling among Democrats on Capitol Hill who said he was less than enthusiastic in suppport of recent Democratic initiatives to raise taxes substantially for affluent taxpayers.
But aides to Mr. Bradley said that many Democrats had misunderstood his position on taxing the affluent, after a vote in the Senate Finance Committee on Oct. 12. Mr. Bradley voted against that measure, they said, because it was tied to a cut in the capital gains tax and ''new loopholes for the oil and gas industry,'' not because he opposed higher taxes on the rich.
''On the one hand, you say the way you want to increase taxes is raise the rates, which I would support,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''But don't get into a bogus increase, through special interest loopholes.''
In a vote on Thursday, Mr. Bradley supported an amendment to a bipartisan budget package by Senator Albert Gore that would have raised taxes on the wealthy and used the revenue to limit the increase in the gasoline tax and reduce cuts in Medicare benefits.
Mr. Bradley then voted against the budget package, saying it would spend too much on defense and place too much of a burden on families earning $20,000 to $40,000 a year.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
TAX RISE FOR RICH IS SEEN AS A PART OF A BUDGET DEAL

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
President Bush went to Capitol Hill today to rally Republicans around a plan that would cut the Federal budget deficit without raising income tax rates. But House and Senate negotiators predicted that a final budget deal would likely include some increase in income taxes on the wealthy, as well as a rise in gasoline taxes.
After speaking privately with Congressional leaders, the President met with the 23 Republicans who helped push a White House-backed bipartisan budget proposal to passage in the Senate early this morning.
But senators who attended the session said Mr. Bush had not explicitly discussed what he could and could not accept from a conference committee that is trying to reconcile the Senate plan with a rival version that the House passed on party-line votes Tuesday. 
 
Stopgap Measure Signed
Hours after his Capitol Hill visit, the President tonight, as expected, bowed to pressure from both Democrats and members of his own party and signed a stopgap spending bill to keep the Government running through midnight next Wednesday, 24 days after the beginning of a fiscal year that still has no budget law.
An earlier stopgap measure was due to expire at midnight tonight, and Republican leaders had warned the President that forcing another Government shutdown like the one two weeks ago would be politically damaging to their party and only sour the atmosphere for reaching a final budget compromise.
 
Differences in Approach
The House and Senate versions of the budget vary in a number of significant ways, among them a proposal for increases in the income tax rate for the well-to-do, a provision that is included in the House's plan but not in the Senate's. The House version would increase the tax for those with the highest income from its current flat rate of 28 percent to a marginal rate of 33 percent, a level that Mr. Bush has said he cannot accept. The White House has been less explicit as to whether a smaller increase would be acceptable, and a number of Republican lawmakers have said they would be willing to accept a rate of 31 percent if Mr. Bush would go along.
Meanwhile, the Senate's plan, unlike the House's, provides for an increase in the Federal gasoline tax, by 9.5 cents a gallon, to a total of 18.5 cents. Opponents of this provision declare that it would hit far too hard at the middle class.
While the two houses have adopted very different approaches to raising new revenue, negotiators of both parties said today that the compromise would almost certainly include some increase in the gasoline tax, a surtax on incomes of over $1 million and some limits on deductions for high-income taxpayers.
But the most contentious issue is whether to raise the 28 percent income tax rate and, if so, by how much. The White House and many Congressional Republicans argue that an increase in the rate on the wealthy - for families in which the parents file jointly, the increase would affect those earning about $200,000 or more - would inevitably lead in time to further rate increases and to pressure for Congress to reopen loopholes it closed four years ago when it adopted the Tax Reform Act.
''I think the Administration position is much tougher on rates than it is on the surtax,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee. ''Since we are going to have to pass this with Democratic votes in the House, everyone knows that the compromise has got to be closer to the House position. The question is, How close?''
 
'Have to Persuade the House'
But the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, who is a senior member of the Finance Committee, warned that negotiators had little room to deviate from the plan passed in the Senate if they hoped to win enough votes in that chamber for the final compromise.
''If we go much from this in either direction, the bill might not pass the Senate,'' he said. ''We have to persuade the House to accept the Senate bill.''
Mr. Dole, who hoped to strengthen the Senate's bargaining position in conference, worked feverishly on Thursday night and into this morning to get a majority of the Senate's 45 Republicans to vote for the bipartisan plan worked out by Senate leaders. He succeeded, but with only a one-vote margin and only after help from Mr. Bush in persuading Utah's two Senators -Jake Garn and Orrin G. Hatch, both Republicans - to switch their votes at the last minute from ''no'' to ''yes.''
 
President Noncommittal
After the President's visit to Capitol Hill today, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the conference team, said, ''He was neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but realistic, about what he hoped we could accomplish.''
Mr. Bush was no more explicit in brief comments to reporters as he made his rounds at the Capitol, insisting that the visit was not intended to signal anything more than a desire to move the budget process forward.
''I think people recognize that more important than any individual getting it exactly his way, including the President, is to get the nation's business completed, and that means getting a deal,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'd like to move, and I hope we can convince some who have not understood that broad picture that that's what we have to do.''
Nearly two-thirds of the tax increases and spending cuts that make up the five-year deficit reduction of $500 billion sought by both houses falls within the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Negotiators from those panels are hoping that their work can be completed by Sunday night and that a final budget package can be presented to the House and the Senate for votes next week.
In addition to the increase in the tax rate for those of highest income, the plan that the House adopted earlier this week with only minimal Republican support would impose a 10 percent surtax on those earning more than $1 million a year and would avoid cuts in the Medicare program that are as deep as those called for in the Senate plan, slashes that are unpopular in both parties. But to avoid any increase in the current 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, the House plan would impose a one-year freeze on inflation adjustments in tax brackets and tax exemptions.
Congressional Republicans and the White House have said this freeze would be a direct hit on all working families, but many Democrats have argued that it would be less of a burden than increasing the gasoline tax.
''We're certainly expecting something where the flavor of the House bill will come through,'' said Representative Jim Moody, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. ''It certainly should be, since we are going to have to carry it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
A front-page headline in some copies on Saturday about Federal budget negotiations misstated President Bush's position on taxes. Mr. Bush was taking a position against increases in income tax rates, not against all tax increases.

HEADLINE: Sisters Have Special Duty to Reflect Catholic Abortion Position

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anna Quindlen, in ''The Nuns' Story'' (column, Sept. 16), cites the case of two former religious sisters asked to resign from their congregation because they signed an advertisement in The New York Times supporting the possibility of abortion.
As Ms. Quindlen and the two former sisters would say, ''Tell me about it.'' As members of religious congregations of the Roman Catholic Church, religious sisters have a special obligation to reflect the example and teaching of Jesus. Jesus certainly repeated the commandment in the Law of Moses, ''Thou shalt not kill,'' and both Scripture and early Christian leaders were consistent in including abortion - the direct taking of innocent human life in the womb - as falling under that commandment. 
Other sisters, such as Mother Teresa, have chosen to show the love of Jesus both for mothers and for the children to whom they have given birth under difficult circumstances. The decision to take innocent human life, no matter how well intentioned, cannot be a sign of compassion; caring for both mother and child is.
We would hope that all people would recognize the right to life of unborn children, which was reflected in the oath of Hippocrates followed by doctors for more than 2,500 years. We would hope that religious sisters, in particular, would accept not only this wisdom of the ages but also the teaching of Jesus, to whom they have pledged their lives.
It is in the service of the poor, of the sick and of the little ones so loved by Jesus that thousands of religious women in the United States have distinguished themselves for centuries, exercising full responsibility for networks of hospitals, schools, orphanages and homes for the aged long before women in other segments of American society could hold similar positions of fiscal and administrative responsibility.
Is the Catholic Church un-American? It has members of every race, ethnic group, social background and economic standing in the country. Its schools are open to members not only of all races but also of all creeds in American inner cities, where they offer that unique opportunity for success in a democracy, a quality education. Its hospitals, orphanages and homes are open to all regardless of creed. Historically, its members have served in the armed forces in numbers beyond the percentage of their presence in American society.
The Catholic Church believes what almost all Americans once believed - that the right to life, endowed by the Creator, is inalienable and that there is an authority beyond that of the majority, as expressed in our pledge of allegiance to the flag, ''one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justics for all.''(Most Rev.)

HEADLINE: Don't Let Redwoods Fall to Corporate Greed;
A Global Resource

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The attempt to ''save the rain forests'' is largely a futile campaign owing to a confused idea of property rights. Having collected medicinal plants in some tropical regions since 1969, I write with the knowledge that independent countries do not want outsiders like United States environmental organizations telling them how best to utilize their resources.
Various forestry and resource administrators argue that they owe their people the best possible standard of living and that hardwood is their commodity to sell on world markets. Aside from the fact that too many of these officials are often the principal recipients of most of the revenue from the sale of these desirable woods, as in Sarawak, this argument is flawed on another level. 
The Malaysian Government, for example, has told the indigenous nomads of Sarawak that they have no claim to the land, that it is owned by the Government. The nomads cannot understand how they can be forced to leave forests they and their ancestors have inhabited since the beginning of their oral histories.
Herein lies the solution. We can argue that just as governments claim that nomads have no authentic territorial claim to the rain forests, neither do they! Mere possession of land does not necessarily make an adequate claim to ownership.
In the case of the world's remaining rain forests, where a good percentage of the earth's oxygen is generated, we might claim them as a global, not a national, resource. The shortsighted exploitation of a rain forest like that of Sarawak - a 160-million-year-old ecosystem that has been decimated by 50 percent in only a few decades and will be gone forever in another 10 years - is not the right of any country. By destroying this ecosystem, the Malaysian Government is destroying one of the planet's primary survival pumps. We the outsiders whose existence is affected by the destructive actions of a few greedy individuals or countries have every right to insist that such decimation be halted.
Oxygen belongs to the plant, not to countries. If we send our troops to defend the world's oil supply, arguing that global economic health is at stake, surely we can do the same to protect global survival on a health level.

HEADLINE: High School Buildings, and Structure

 BODY:
A task force appointed by New York City's Schools Chancellor, Joseph Fernandez, concludes that a slowdown in construction and poor management of space has caused overcrowding in many high schools. The panel recommends a number of short-term and long-term solutions. Fine, but while Mr. Fernandez is at it, the whole structure of high school education needs thorough review. 
The task force found that the average city high school is used at 111 percent of capacity, chiefly because of a 10-year hiatus in school construction and cutbacks in funding in the last fiscal crisis. While overcrowding exists throughout the system, the panel focused on high schools because the Chancellor controls them directly.
Most students attend neighborhood high schools that offer comprehensive or academic programs. A handful offer enriched or magnet programs in specialized areas. But many schools are trying to serve such large, diverse populations that they lose students to anonymity and apathy.
For immediate relief at the most severely crowded schools, the task force recommends capping enrollments and moving administrators out of classrooms. For the long term, however, the panel suggests that Mr. Fernandez think about how high school education ought to be structured.
To that end, he might consider a new Rand Corporation study called ''High Schools with Character.'' The study included an intensive examination of eight New York City high schools, public and parochial, that largely serve disadvantaged youths.
Students at six Catholic and special purpose schools, called ''focus'' schools, were more successful than students in two zoned high schools. Why? Mainly because the focus schools had a central sense of mission and strong organizational structures. The zoned schools, by contrast, had diffuse missions that were defined largely by outsiders.
Mr. Fernandez's major initiative, school-based management, ought to help more schools achieve the coherence lauded in the Rand study. But the challenge is to see how reorganizing the space in high schools can create an environment for success.

HEADLINE: Soviet Capitalism? First, Stability

 BODY:
The biggest news in Mikhail Gorbachev's newest economic reform plan may not be economic at all but political. What started out as a 500-day plan to overturn Communism and install capitalism is now an 000-day plan, without deadlines or even a timetable. And his program makes clear that he's ready to rule by decree, if necessary, to restore order and compel change. 
The title of his plan, which the Soviet Parliament has just endorsed, puts first things first: ''The Main Directions for the Stabilization of the People's Economy and the Transition to a Market Economy.''
As the apparatus of command breaks down and the Soviet economy teeters on the edge of collapse, he understandably wants to put goods on store shelves. But decrees aren't likely to do that. This could become a tough winter indeed for the Soviet Union, and Americans may wind up not only as concerned observers but also as participants. Everywhere in the Soviet Union, people talk about the pace of reform. Some republics, like Russia and the Baltics, want to move fast; others, like Kirghizia and Turkmenia in Central Asia, oppose haste. But the real struggle is over control. Mr. Gorbachev would keep authority over banking, transportation, communication and foreign trade, all critical to economic change. Boris Yeltsin and others would devolve it to the republics.
As they grapple, the ramshackle Soviet economy is buckling. Individuals and enterprises, lacking incentives to produce, stop working. Hoarding, hijacking, strikes and blockades keep goods from getting to market. And governments at all levels try to hold onto goods. This winter, cities may run short of food and fuel.
That's why Mr. Gorbachev got the Soviet Parliament to strengthen his power of decree. His proposal to Parliament says, ''Transition to market relations and their effective functioning are possible only under conditions of a strong and clearly organized state power.''
He also declared that, ''In the first instance, it is necessary to use to the maximum the special powers granted recently to the President by the Supreme Soviet.'' In Moscow, there's serious talk of martial law. He may try to use troops to open blocked roads and railways, break up strikes and compel goods to come to market.
But it's a contradiction for Mr. Gorbachev to take command of markets. The same apparatchiks who have tried to strangle economic reform may use his special powers to perpetuate theirs. And he'd do well not to invoke martial law against rebellious republics. From Lithuania to Azerbaijan, wherever troops have been called out, they've only inflamed nationalism.
Americans understand the need for Federal intervention in an economic emergency. U.S. Presidents intervened when coal, steel or rail strikes threatened to shut down factories and chill homes. But force can't hold the Soviet Union together; only functioning markets can.
The bitter question remains: Can Mr. Gorbachev force goods to market before privation drives Soviet citizens to fury? That's where America might come in. Timely aid from abroad in the form of food and fuel could ease his predicament. That's something for Western governments to plan for now, before the Soviet winter.

HEADLINE: Congress Sets Tentative Pact on Immigration Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators said tonight that they had reached a tentative agreement on a bill that would allow a substantial increase in legal immigration to the United States.
The bill would allow 700,000 immigrants a year in 1992, 1993 and 1994 and would set an annual limit of 675,000 for subsequent years. The United States has been admitting about 500,000 immigrants a year, not counting refugees. 
Representative Bruce A. Morrison, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, said: ''We have reached an agreement over all on the bill. There are details still to be worked out. But the basic outline of the bill is agreed to.''''
 
Labor Shortages Expected
Under the compromise bill, the United States would admit more skilled immigrants, including scientists, engineers and medical technicians, to compensate for expected shortages in the 1990's. Congress, the Labor Department and many economists see legal immigration as a way to correct the imbalance in labor supply and demand.
The tentative agreement was unexpected. The Senate passed a version of the legislation last year, and the House passed a major bill on Oct. 3. But disagreements among some lawmakers were so profound that the Senate refused to send members into formal negotiations with the House.
After four hours of informal talks today, senators and representatives agreed on the outline of a compromise bill. They plan to convene a formal conference committee over the weekend or early next week.
The bill sets the total number of immigrants between the numbers specifed in the Senate bill, 630,000 a year, and the House bill, 775,000.
 
Relatives and Skilled Workers
Under the compromise, the 700,000 immigrants permitted in each of the first three years would be chosen as follows: 465,000 would be relatives of United States citizens and permanent resident aliens; 140,000 would be selected because of their job skills, and 40,000 would come from countries that have sent relatively few immigrants here in recent years.
Mr. Morrison also said that in each of the first three years there would be 55,000 visas for spouses and children of illegal aliens who gained legal status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
In 1995 and later years, the 675,000 visas would be distributed as follows: 480,000 to relatives of citizens and permanent resident aliens; 140,000 to workers with special skills and their relatives, and 55,000 to citizens of countries that have sent relatively few immigrants here in recent years.
Mr. Morrison said he believed the conference ''will be smooth sailing.''
But Rick Swartz, an immigration lawyer in Washington, said: ''It is possible that major ethnic and religious constituencies will find the direction of negotiations and the apparent agreement on family issues unacceptable.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Reading Lips of the Rich: Spending, Not Taxes, Is the Problem

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
As the halls of Congress reverberated with partisan slogans about ''soaking the rich'' and ''making the rich pay a fair share of taxes,'' some of America's millionaires were shaking their heads and saying that Washington politicians were all wet.
A dozen millionaires, chosen at random from among the nation's executives who had time to answer the telephone over the past few days, said that Washington was hopelessly out of touch with them and many of their high-income friends.
Nine of the 12 businessmen said it would be fair to raise their taxes, although at the same time they said the Government should be more serious about holding down spending. Only three opposed a greater contribution from the rich, saying the Government could cure the deficit by shrinking its operations.
 
Investment Banker's View
''If they are going to raise taxes on the wealthy, which I am absolutely not opposed to at all, they should also be drastically cutting spending on things like defense and increasing funding for things like education and the environment,'' said Leonard I. Green, an investment banker in Los Angeles who said his annual income exceeds $1 million. 
The comments of Mr. Green and his 11 peers do not represent a scientific sampling of high-income people, but their views erode the stereotypes of the rich being greedy tax-dodgers or captains of industry whose only motivation for expansion is that it fills their pockets and not Uncle Sam's.
Who are the rich? Do they pay their fair share of Federal taxes?
The questions are hard to answer, in part, because fairness is a subjective concept and, in part, because richness is too. An income that puts a family squarely in the middle class in New York or San Francisco, for example, might put them near the top of the heap in a small town in the Midwest.
 
Proposals Being Considered
The House and Senate budget proposals cut different slices off the pile: One House proposal would impose a 10 percent surtax on all taxable income above $1 million, which would have affected about 65,000 taxpayers in 1988. The House would also extend the 33 percent marginal tax rate to all high-income taxpayers and increase the minimum tax paid to 25 percent from 21 percent. The Senate has no such provisions, but it would limit itemized deductions.
Exactly how these proposals would affect the rich is not known, but it is clear there are a lot more people that can reasonably be defined as rich than there were 10 years ago.
Wealth has come so suddenly to so many people that they themselves cannot believe it, said John J. DeMarco, senior vice president of PSI, a Tampa, Fla., research organization that monitors the habits and attitudes of affluent consumers in frequent surveys.
 
Surge in Millionaires
''Most rich people don't think they're rich; they say: 'Me? Rich? That's somebody else. Not me,' '' Mr. DeMarco said. In the last four years, he said the number of millionaires doubled to 1.8 million from 900,000. PSI's definition of a millionaire is an individual or family whose assets, excluding a primary home, exceed debts by more than $1 million. Forbes magazine published its list of America's 400 richest people this month, noting that since 1982 their fortunes have tripled, to an average of $682 million from an average of $230 million; all told, the 400 now have $272.5 billion in assets.
The national growth in wealth was stimulated in part, experts say, by President Ronald Reagan's tax revisions, including the 1986 law that significantly lowered tax rates in exchange for eliminating most deductions.
''The Affluence Explosion,'' a marketing report put out last year by Alert Publishing in New York, summarizes surveys and marketing research on the wealthy, and paints this statistical portrait of the typical millionaire:
He (the majority are men) is a 57-year-old white business owner - a college graduate who has been married for 32 years, has two grown children, works 10 to 14 hours a day, six days a week and earns $120,000 a year. Only one in five inherited their money.
 
Spectrum of Viewpoints
As the middle class surged into the brackets of wealth in the 1980's, they brought their middle-class values and opinions with them. Apart from listing to starboard - a plurality of 47 percent of the wealthy are Republicans - affluent people hold political views that are representative of America as a whole, according to 500 interviews with wealthy people around the nation by Louis Harris and Associates in 1987. Forty percent identified themselves as conservatives, 40 percent called themselves middle-of-the-road and 20 percent said they were liberals.
''Politically they are becoming less party-affiliated, less doctrinaire, and are looking for what works,'' concludes the Alert report. ''They are less 'big government' but want the homeless housed and the environment improved, and they want the Federal Government to do it.''
Those sentiments were repeatedly echoed in interviews with the wealthy executives.
''If we could trade significantly higher taxes for a more optimistic outlook on where this country is going, we would be happy to pay,'' said Eugene M. Lang, who made his first million by inventing a screwlike device in 1948 that holds airplanes and automobiles together. He has since given $25 million to colleges and started a widely copied program that pays college tuition for inner-city children. ''I am more concerned about how the money is going to be spent,'' said Mr. Lang.
 
'You Can Afford to Pay More'
Noel D. Ginsberg, a millionaire who owns a plastics company in Denver, said any tax rise should be considerably higher for high-income people than for middle-income people - not because the higher rate would bring in so much money, but because it would restore confidence in the nation's tax system. ''I am not a tax accountant, so I don't know if the rich are paying their fair share, but if you're making over $150,000 or $200,000 as I am, you can afford to pay more,'' he said.
Nonetheless, when it comes to the topic of fairness and taxes, people's attitudes are warped by emotion and self-interest, said Howard J. Kogan, a Manhattan psychotherapist. ''The psychology is always the same: 'My money is more precious and needed by me than your money is to you,' '' he said.
Some other experts, like Dr. Thomas J. Stanley, a marketing consultant and author of ''Marketing to the Affluent'' (Dow Jones Irwin, 1988), say that most high-income people are paying their fair share of taxes, but argue that high-income people with extraordinary wealth are not paying anything close to a fair tax bill.
''It's absurd that Congress is talking about raising taxes for somebody who might make $100,000 or $200,000 in a good year, when they aren't talking about taxing the 100,000 households with net worths exceeding $15 million,'' said Dr. Stanley, noting that the really wealthy can find ways to minimize their taxable income, while those simply have a good year must report their income and pay their taxes.
A close observer of multimillionaires, Robin D. Leach, host of the television program ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,'' confirmed that the people on his program would not notice the taxes being discussed in Washington. ''They won't bat an eyelid,'' he said. ''It is nonsense. It's a cosmetic tax that only looks as though it's penalizing the rich.'' However, he opposes any tax that would cause them to bat eyelids, saying that would be a move towards socialism.
 
Wealth, Taxes and the Rich
The Internal Revenue Service's latest statistics show that in 1987 1 percent of the nation's population held 36 percent of the nation's wealth, up from 27 percent of the wealth in 1973, according to marketers' estimates based on the Census Bureau's reports. The Bush Administration says the tax burden on that the wealthiest 1 percent has sharply increased to about 27 percent of the total income tax in 1988, up from 18 percent in 1981.
But Kevin P. Phillips, author of ''The Politics of Rich and Poor,'' (Random House, 1990), said in an interview that the rich are paying more taxes because their share of national income almost doubled to 15 percent from 8 percent in the same period. ''It is not that the rich are burdened unduly,'' he said, ''it is just that they have more of the money.''
Robert David Lion Gardiner, speaking from his home in Palm Beach, captured the sorry state of the economy in an anecdote about the Ritz-Carlton in Paris charging $24 for a martini. He attributed the dollar's decline against other currencies to the failure of Congress and President Bush to rein in Federal spending. Mr. Gardiner, whose family owns Gardiners Island in Long Island Sound, said his family's money was ''old when George Washington stayed with us.''
Although he is worried that higher taxes could spark a severe recession, he conceded that it was a ''legitimate criticism'' to say the wealthy are not paying enough taxes. He said he would go along with higher taxes, adding, jovially, ''I'm for the fairness thing.''
 
Opposition to Tax Increase
George F. Kettle, who owns the Century 21 franchise for several Mid-Atlantic states, was among the minority of millionaires interviewed who opposed tax increases on the wealthy. While he would not say how much he made in 1989, he added: ''I paid $1.2 million in taxes last year and I think that is a fair share to pay. If you increase taxes and redistribute the money to the poor, that will take the work incentive away from the poor and take away the incentives for the rich to build motels and businesses that provide jobs and health benefits.''
Another opponent of higher income taxes, Peter M. Flanigan, said: ''Anybody who says that the rich are paying a lesser share of taxes doesn't know what he's talking about.'' Mr. Flanigan, a wealthy investment banker in New York, was an economics adviser to President Richard M. Nixon. ''If there have to be tax increases, the least distorting taxes are consumption taxes,'' Mr. Flanigan said, referring to proposed excise taxes on things like gasoline and cigarettes.
Ralph E. Ablon earned $2.2 million last year as chairman of the board of directors of the Ogden Corporation, a New York-based conglomerate in the food service and waste disposal industries.
He said he supported a tax increase for high-income people if it were part of a serious effort to reduce the Federal deficit and not simply part of the current ''comic opera performance'' in Washington.
None of the millionaires interviewed had anything nice to say about Congress or President Bush, but Mr. Ablon offered this on the bright side: ''The really marvelous thing about our form of government is that it is designed to survive mediocre leadership.''

HEADLINE: Drive to Organize Virginia Food Stores Is a Pivotal Test of Labor's Future

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va.

 BODY:
A young woman in a cashier's smock walks out of a Farm Fresh supermarket and ambles by Juanita Fridley and Chad Young, union organizers, who are sitting on a bench against the wall of the store. The woman buys a Pepsi from a machine and, warily, she walks back toward the organizers. She lets them catch her eye.
''Are you on your break?'' Mr. Young asks.
''Yes,'' the woman says. ''You the union?'' 
They say they are. They invite her to join them on the bench, but she declines. ''Apprehensive about talking to us here?'' Ms. Fridley asks. The woman nods. But she writes down her name and phone number and invites them to visit her at home.
''If you're just a worker and management wants to get rid of you, they scheme something up,'' Ms. Fridley said. ''The workers are frightened of management. They're frightened of us. They're afraid of losing their jobs.'' If workers are anxious, said Michael E. Julian, president of Farm Fresh Inc., it is the union that is stirring the pot. ''Our employees, the ones I talk to, repeatedly ask, 'When are these people going to go away and quit bothering us?' '' he said.
The fear, whatever its cause, runs through much of this membership drive, one of organized labor's biggest in years, now in its seventh month. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the nation's second largest after the Teamsters, is trying to enroll supermarket workers throughout the Tidewater region of eastern Virginia.
 
Test of Labor's Future
The campaign puts the eternal conflict between labor and management in uncommonly stark relief. The long-withering labor movement sees the drive as an important, high-visibility, test of its future in the American economy. The supermarket chains face pressures that have already driven several competitors to the grave. Neither side has much room to give.
Ms. Fridley, Mr. Young and 50-some other organizers of Local 400 of the 1.3-million-member union are courting 7,000 employees of the region's 52 Farm Fresh supermarkets and 43 stores of two smaller chains in the region, Bonnie Be-Lo Markets and Marketplace Foods. The organizers want to add them to the 16 unionized Super Fresh stores, similar in name to Farm Fresh but owned by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. Super Fresh's slightly higher wages and better benefits put it at a disadvantage in competing with nonunion stores.
In the Tidewater area, most supermarket employees are among the working poor - the nearly three million people who last year worked full time and still earned too little to stay out of poverty, according to the Census Bureau. The Federal poverty level for a family of four is an income below $12,000 a year.
A Farm Fresh computer printout that a union organizer obtained lists 184 people hired or rehired during three weeks in July and August. It shows that 51 started work for wages from the $3.80-an-hour Federal minimum wage to $3.99, and that 93 started at $4 to $4.49. Just three people, who had special skills and years of experience, started at $6 or more.
 
Two-Thirds Are Women
About two-thirds of the supermarket workers here are women, many of them single mothers or their families' sole source of support. Three-quarters of the Farm Fresh workers are permanent part-timers because the chain says it needs most workers only in prime shopping time, 4 to 9 P.M. Most part-timers earn $4 to $5 an hour and none receive health or pension benefits.
Full-timers, who tend to keep their jobs longer than part-timers and therefore earn a dollar or two more each hour on average, are offered health insurance and pension benefits. But many reject it because they have to pay part of the cost.
In the parking lots outside the stores, some workers steer wide circles around the union organizers. The organizers say Farm Fresh has called in the police to arrest them for violating its rule against approaching workers within 50 feet of a store. Four organizers were jailed but the courts dismissed the charges.
Few workers would agree to interviews with a reporter; fewer still would give their names. An exception was Paula Hayes, a 25-year-old single mother of two children.
A full-time employee, Ms. Hayes said she was paid $5.50 an hour and got a little support from her children's fathers but still struggles. She said she could not afford a home of her own, so she shared an apartment with another single mother. Each pays $221 a month rent.
One of Ms. Hayes' weekly pay stubs shows take-home pay of $176.71. Until a few weeks ago, Ms. Hayes said she was having around $50 a week deducted to provide health insurance for herself and her children. But she said she had to drop the children's coverage to make ends meet and now paid $13.10 to cover herself. She deducts $1 for charity.
Ms. Hayes said she liked her work. ''I'm an office supervisor,'' she said. ''I work in the back. I count all the money in the store. The cashiers come back with their tills. I tell them to count the money first, and then I count it.''
But she said she wanted a union, partly for the higher pay and better benefits that the it might negotiate from management. Even though she is an office supervisor, she said, ''most of the cashiers make what I make.''
She and a colleague said their supervisors trid to give them two consecutive days off some weeks but they never know whether that would happen, or which two days they would be, until their schedules were posted the Friday before the following week, making it hard to plan for their children's care.
Other workers see unions differently. ''I've been in a union,'' said Betty Ruiz, a consumer service representative at a Farm Fresh store in Norfolk. ''They never did show me anything. This time I'm not interested.''
At the unionized store where she worked previously, she said, ''they took money out of my paycheck'' - union dues that here would come to about $5 a week. She said management raised wages after negotiations with the union, then dismissed some workers.
''I made more money,'' she said, ''but I also worked harder.''
No one here attributes workers' poverty solely to management's frugality. The performance of the nation's economy in the 1980's required more families to put two people to work. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that nationally, average hourly wages have fallen 12.6 percent from a peak of $8.63 in 1973 to $7.54 currently, after taking inflation into account.
The corporate takeover wars took a toll, too. Farm Fresh is making payments on the $285 million it borrowed to thwart a hostile takeover in 1987, so it is losing money and would be hard pressed to raise wages even if it were willing. And Safeway Stores Inc. closed or sold its Tidewater stores, all unionized, to raise money to reduce the debt it amassed in averting a takeover.
In part because of the ground it lost with Safeway's withdrawal, the labor establishment has a big stake in this drive. Membership in unions has shrunk from a quarter of the work force in the early 1950's to 16.4 percent.
Unions have lost members with the erosion of industrial jobs, although they have been capturing new members in Government and in services, like retailing. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board said, unions won 50 percent of their organizing campaigns, the highest level of the 1980's.
Here, the Food and Commercial Workers Union, one of the more successful organizers, has an opportunity to establish a base from which to mount campaigns deeper into the largely nonunion, low-wage South.
If the union fails, on the other hand, it could endanger A&P's Super Fresh, because it alone would continue to pay higher labor costs to its unionized staff.
 
Potential Large Competitor
Further, both Local 400 and the three chains are looking over their shoulders at Food Lion Inc., a 675-store, nonunion Southeastern chain based in Salisbury, N.C., that is thought to be planning a northward expansion into the Tidewater region and beyond. A multibillion-dollar business that dwarfs the Tidewater chains, Food Lion could have the muscle to drive down wages and prices, pushing out both the union and competitors.
But if the union succeeds, the prevailing wage in the Tidewater market rise and Food Lion would find it harder to find people to work at its rates.
''No question, it's high-stakes poker,'' said Thomas R. McNutt, president of Local 400. ''This is our last potential beachhead for a highly organized South.''
The union's first objective here is signatures on beige, three-by-five cards authorizing the union to represent the workers in negotiations. Federal labor rules require cards signed by 30 percent of an employer's workers to let them vote on whether to make a union their bargaining agent.
Mr. McNutt said the local has already spent more than $1 million on the campaign since it started in April and that he is prepared for the long haul. He said he had just signed a contract on about 30 motel rooms to house the organizers until 1992.
Management seems just as determined. ''My responsibility as chief executive of this company is to find a way to satisfy the needs of our customers and at the same time satisfy the needs of our employees,'' Mr. Julian said. He said he could cut prices to draw hordes of shoppers but would have to chop wages and drive away workers. Or he could double prices and wages and drive away shoppers.
He said he does not need a union to help him find the balance. ''I'm never going to sign a contractual agreement that makes us unable to compete,'' Mr. Julian said.
He said he will be raising wages regularly without significant price increases by raising the stores' productivity - getting employees to work better or harder, or investing in machinery to help them do more work.
In this campaign, neither side has deployed the gun-wielding goons of old organizing drives. They pit lawyers against lawyers, slogan against slogan. Management plays on the workers' fears of losing jobs to strikes; the union plays on fears of management's power over wages, hiring and firing.
The union is concentrating on the fearful. ''They fear if they sign, something will happen to them,'' said the campaign's newest organizer, Karen Gompers, 27.
Presumably, Ms. Gompers lends the union a genetic edge. She is the the great-great grandniece of Samuel Gompers, father of the 20th century American labor movement. The union discovered her last summer waiting on tables in Virginia Beach.

Bush Describes Himself as 'Determined' on Kuwait

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was as determined as ever to force President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
Speaking to Italian-American leaders at the White House this morning, Mr. Bush rejected talk of concessions to Mr. Hussein.
''I'm determined as I was the day that the first troop left that Saddam Hussein's aggression not be rewarded by some compromise,'' he said. ''Not be rewarded by our failing to get him totally out of Kuwait or restore the legitimate rulers.'' 
The President reiterated this stance later in a private talk with Yevgeny M. Primakov, a member of the Soviet Presidential Council who was recently sent to Iraq by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with President Hussein.
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the President had told Mr. Primakov that ''there is no interest, either on the part of the United States or the international community, for any partial solution to the blatant aggression that Iraq has perpetrated against Kuwait.'' The two men talked for an hour and 20 minutes, an hour longer than scheduled.
 
Fate of Hostages Discussed
Mr. Bush stressed to the top Soviet official that ''the international community was prepared to consider alternative options'' if the United Nations economic sanctions and diplomacy fail to persuade Mr. Hussein to end his occupation of Kuwait.
''The President's resolve was firm and firmly expressed,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
A top Administration official said that contrary to rumors about a Soviet compromise to settle the standoff, Mr. Primakov had come ''with no plans whatsoever.'' The two men reviewed the status of the crisis, the official said, and Mr. Primakov expressed his concern about the fate of thousands of Soviet citizens in Iraq, noting that the Soviets have won permission from President Hussein to get 1,500 of them released.
Mr. Bush urged the Soviets to hold fast on sanctions, telling Mr. Primakov that American-Soviet cooperation has been a key factor in isolating the Iraqi leader.
Speaking to reporters through an interpreter after the White House meeting, Mr. Primakov said he had not brought the President a message from Mr. Hussein.
 
'I Am Not a Messenger'
''No message from Saddam Hussein, because I am not a messenger, you know,'' he said in Russian.
He added, ''I believe we should not rule out the possibilities of a peaceful solution until we have exhausted all options.''
Administration officials said that the meeting was important less for its substance than its signals. They said the meeting sent a signal to President Hussein that the Soviets and the United States continue to maintain a united front based on the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Officials said they hoped that the meeting would dispel rumors emanating from the Middle East that the Soviets wanted to promote a settlement that would reward Iraq for withdrawing from Kuwait.
At the State Department today, the spokesman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, was asked if there were any signs that Iraq was willing to compromise. ''Not that I'm aware of,'' she said.
 
Baker Urges Support
In a speech today to the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d also praised the Soviets, urging the West to support them in their time of economic hardship.
''The danger is that the breakdown of the old Stalinist system will outstrip the development of the new system -one built on universal democratic values and the rule of law,'' he said.
''Their choices will be less hard if we in the West stand by their side,'' he said, even though ''our influence may only be marginal.''
Saying that the two superpowers both regard arms proliferation ''as perhaps the greatest security challenge of the 1990's,'' Mr. Baker proposed joint talks with the Soviets on oil extraction, energy efficiency and the initiation of an international center for ecological research in the Soviet Union.
Mr. Baker also said that the President has decided to include the Soviets in the Citizens Democracy Corps program, a privately financed program intended to train leaders in emerging democracies in the ways of democratic rule and market economics.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Tunisians, Seeking Roots, Turn Toward Iraq

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUNIS, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The contrasting Western and Muslim faces of this former French protectorate mix comfortably in the bustling streets of downtown Tunis as car horns honk over the sound of midday prayers and girls in tight jeans move past women draped in traditional Arab gowns.
But while the dream of many young men is to emigrate to Europe and both French and Italian television programs are rebroadcast locally, the growing Arab identity of this North African nation has come to light in the strong sympathy that many ordinary Tunisians feel for Iraq in the current crisis.
''We like Saddam Hussein,'' a policeman in his 40's said without hesitation, echoing a widely held opinion. ''He is courageous. He wants all Arabs to be equal. He wants to give the money of the rich Arabs to the poor Arabs. The emirs gave us nothing.'' 
A 62-year-old Tunisian, who boasted that he had traveled the world, felt little differently when the subject came up. ''Kuwait is not important,'' he announced in fluent French. ''It is part of Iraq. It is not worth a war. The United States has no right to intervene.''
 
A Muslim Opposition
For President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, though, the gulf crisis has proved less straightforward. Tunisia has long benefited from being a friend of the United States and its economy is enormously dependent on trade with Western Europe and the remittances of 250,000 Tunisians living in France.
The strongest opposition to his three-year-old Government comes from the Islamic Renaissance Movement, known as Nahda, which gained ground in the 1980's in reaction to the Westernization of Tunisia that was tasking place under his predecessor, Habib Bourguiba.
And since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it is the Arab voice of Tunisia that has been raised on the streets. ''What you hear is the fruit of the accumulated frustration of the Arab world,'' a Government official said. ''The Western response has turned Saddam into a political and religious hero.''
In preparing his own response, Mr. Ben Ali has therefore measured the risks of a domestic Islamic backlash against the dangers of Western reprisals. And he has chosen a policy that balances strict adherence to United Nations resolutions on a trade embargo with public disapproval of the Western military buildup.
 
Keeping the Peace at Home
In his only major speech on the subject to date, he criticized American troop deployments more than the Iraqi invasion. He boycotted an Arab League summit meeting, creating the impression that he was trying to avoid condemning Baghdad. He has also promoted a so-called Arab solution to the crisis, urging Saudi and Kuwait leaders to be patient and reminding Western visitors of the need to appease Arab public opinion.
But his main priority has been to maintain peace at home. And in this, he has been successful. Tunisian officials say experience shows that any American attack on Iraq would result in angry protests here, but to date there have been only demonstrations against the American presence in the gulf, organized by the Government party as part of what officials call their ''management'' of the crisis.
Diplomats looking to explain Tunisian grass-roots support for Iraq recognize the impact of President Hussein's televised messages. With a strong appeal to Arab nationalism, their exploitation of envy of rich Saudis and Kuwaitis and their defiance of the United States and Israel, they have been well received throughout the Arab world.
But in Tunisia, many political experts go further, noting that pro-Iraqi sentiments also reflect the population's strong desire to reassert its Arab identity and Muslim traditions after 30 years in which both were suppressed as part of the Bourguiba Government's drive to modernize Tunisia.
 
Reversal of Policies
Under Mr. Bourguiba, not only was French preferred over Arabic as the language of Government, but he also banned prayers on television, ordered Tunisians to work all of Friday, denied the mullahs the right to decide holy days and had his police persecute leading members of the Islamic movement.
After Mr. Ben Ali seized power in November 1987, however, these policies were reversed, with the new President displaying his Muslim colors by visiting holy places in Saudi Arabia on his first trip abroad.
When he visited France on his next trip, he then surprised his hosts by speaking publicly in Arabic.
While stressing that he is the Muslim leader of a Muslim country, though, his own version of Islam is far from fundamentalist. He continues to encourage emancipation of women, he is building a Western-style market economy and to this day this country remains one of the most cosmopolitan in the Arab world, visited by two million foreign tourists a year.
When he met leaders of the Islamic Renaissance Party to encourage them to take part in a more open political system, however, he refused them the right to identify themselves as a Muslim party. ''My party is also Muslim,'' he reportedly told them. ''We are all Muslims.''

HEADLINE: Congressional Attempt to Impose Higher Tariffs on China Collapses

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
A Congressional move to impose higher tariffs on China involving billions of dollars of exports collapsed today when the Senate missed a voting deadline, thereby enabling China to continue getting low duties at least through the end of next June.
To protest the repression of pro-democracy student demonstrators, the House of Representatives voted 247 to 174 on Thursday to rescind President Bush's decision last May renewing for China the favorable tariff status known as most-favored-nation treatment.
Under a measure enacted in August, both chambers faced a deadline of midnight Thursday for action to reverse the Administration move. 
In a statement early today, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, officially pronounced the effort dead, but he said he continued to believe that given the current condition of human rights in China, Mr. Bush was wrong.
 
Bush Promised Veto
The Congressional move was largely symbolic, since Mr. Bush, a former Ambassador to Beijing, had promised to veto any resolution of disapproval, and most estimates said the two houses lacked the two-thirds voting strength to override a veto.
Mr. Bush said the higher tariffs would hurt American business and consumers, reduce American influence with China on global issues and damage the Hong Kong economy, which is heavily dependent on China trade.
Eliminating the favored status would mean up to a 10-fold rise in tariffs on the apparel, electronics, toys and other products that China sells here.
The two countries do about $18 billion in two-way business. Although China buys wheat, high-technology products and machinery and other capital goods from the United States, it has a large trade surplus with this country.
Signaling the importance of the Chinese market for American farmers, the Agriculture Department announced today that China has bought an additional 449,370 metric tons of wheat, its second purchase this week. At current prices the wheat would have a farm value of around $40 million.

Cellular Phone Deals for Alert Buyers

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Purchases of cellular telephones continue to climb rapidly, and their prices are falling with almost equal speed. As what was once a luxury becomes affordable for many Americans, competition among manufacturers and among providers of service is becoming more intense.
Prices for the phones themselves have been slashed to as little as $50 in some cases. These lower prices are tempting more and more people to buy cellular phones. But there is more to think about than just the base price of the phone. It's not like making other electronic purchases, like a television set or a stereo. 
In the first place there are three kinds of cellular phones to choose from: one for use only inside a car, a mobile phone; one for inside and outside a car, a transportable phone; and one for use only outside, a portable phone. And as many as seven plans for buying cellular service may be offered by a single provider in a metropolitan area. There is also the question of insurance, which varies with the kind of phone. 74% Growth Last Year Growth in sales of cellular phones has been astonishing. In 1989, the number of such phones in use soared by almost 74 percent, according to Dataquest Inc., a research concern based in San Jose, Calif. The increase in 1990 is expected to be another 48 percent, bringing the total number of phones to almost five million.
Steve Sazegari, a Dataquest analyst, says he expects this cellular phone base to rise by another 34 percent next year. ''Prices could come down 20 to 30 percent over the next 4 to 5 years,'' he said.
Prices have already dropped since the advent of the phones in 1983. Consumers can still spend as much as $3,000 for a unit, but many models sell for $50 to $99. Most phone sales are in the mobile category, says to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the largest and most mature segment of the market.
 
'Gimmicks in the Marketplace'
But the lowest prices offered by dealers often carry various conditions, like a commitment to use a particular cellular telephone company for a minimum period. Thus the buyer could be locked in with one service provider and cannot change to another to get better service or a lower price until the period ends.
Because cellular phone owners pay for both incoming and outgoing calls, providers are offering a slew of service plans encompassing the monthly charge and the per-minute use charge to attract customers. One plan combines a $35-a-month service charge with a use charge of 60 cents a minute in peak periods and 40 cents in off-peak periods. Another offers a $55-a-month charge and a use charge of 45 cents a minute at all times.
''Beware of come-ons,'' said Robert B. Miller, vice president of merchandising for Radio Shack. ''There are a lot of gimmicks in the marketplace. You want to be sure of not entering into a five-year agreement with a carrier'' that limits switching to a more attractive deal. The Federal Communications Commission licenses two providers in each area.
Find out whether a package of extras is included. They are often bargains. For example, the Nynex Mobile Communications Company, a service provider, is currently offering a $400 package encompassing a mobile phone, antenna, installation and a microphone. Purchased separately, an antenna could cost $60 or more and installation could cost about $100.
Cellular phones also have warranties, similar to those on other electronic equipment. Most manufacturers offer a one-year warranty on parts and labor, plus another 2 to 4 years for parts alone.
Questions have been raised about exposure to the radiation that is emitted by cellular phones. Prof. Theodore S. Rappaport of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, said that in general the low power and relatively low UHF transmission frequency is not viewed as a health hazard. But he said it is an issue that requires further study, even though cellular phone emissions are a small part of the total radiation the average person encounters each day. Professor Blacksburg is the director of the institute's mobile and portable radio research group.
As for insurance, coverage for mobile phones attached to a car and drawing power from it is not usually a part of standard auto policies. But you can buy a special electronic equipment endorsement to an automobile or homeowner policy, or a separate policy, called a floater.
Transportable phones that can be operated through either a car's electrical system or an independent rechargeable battery pack are also not generally covered under automobile policies. While the phone might be protected under a standard homeowner policy when the owner is out of the car, it is not covered inside without an endorsement to an automobile or homeowner policy, or a separate policy.
Finally, self-contained hand-held portable phones are automatically covered under a homeowner policy as personal property. They normally have a deductible amount, typically $100 to $250, that applies to the phones, and certain perils, like mysterious disappearance and breakage, are not covered. ''The safest thing with any cellular phone is to add an endorsement to a homeowner policy or get a floater,'' said Barry J. McCall, senior personal property underwriting specialist at the Kemper Group insurance company. ''Then there are no deductibles and most risks are covered.''

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Debate Over Federal Tire Ratings Just Keeps Rolling Along

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Fall is tire-buying time, and as shoppers search for quality and long wear, Federal officals, tire-industry executives and consumer advocates are still arguing over what buyers should be told.
As things now stand, Federal law requires that a tread-wear index and A, B or C ratings for traction and temperature resistance appear on a paper sticker attached to the tire and be imprinted on its sidewall.
Manufacturers are not required to give a tire's expected life in miles, and Federal officials do not endorse any system that does. That is largely the focus of the dispute. 
The argument flared again most recently in August, when the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington advocacy group, released its annual list of top-rated tires and included their expected life in miles. The list is based on data manufacturers are required to submit to the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminstration, which makes the data public but does not say which tires are best.
 
Interpreting the Data
The Tire Industry Safety Council, the manufacturers' public-relations arm, said the center's rankings showing expected life in miles, based on travel on average roads, were misleading because road conditions vary widely. Officials at the traffic safety agency agreed. But the center said that without a conversion to miles, the data are not useful. Consumer advocates also say the Government should rank tires instead of simply releasing a list of 1,800 tires and their grades every six months.
''All we are trying to do is embarrass the Government into doing what it's supposed to be doing,'' said Clarence M. Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety.
Present Federal regulations require manufacturers to provide dealers with lists of tire ratings so they can be easily reviewed by consumers. But compliance appears to be spotty.
At the Jersey City auto center for the one of the nation's largest tire retailers, Sears, tire-rating lists were not available earlier this week. Jackie Bitowt, a Sears spokeswoman, said the company provided such lists but its outlets had to order them.
Some insight into the troubled history of tire ratings sheds some light on the debate over what and how much the consumer should be told.
In 1966, Congress, concerned about deceptive tire marketing, ordered Federal regulators to develop a tire-rating system to help consumers. The results are the present Uniform Tire Quality Grading System, which rates tires on two safety factors, traction and temperature resistance, and one economy factor, tread wear.
For traction, measured by a tire's ability to stop on a wet surface, the grades are A, B and C. An A-graded tire stops the most quickly. Temperature resistance is also graded A, B and C and indicates a tire's ability to withstand heat. A tire graded A is the most heat-resistant and the least likely to suffer a blowout under the same conditions as a tire graded B or C. Tread wear is the most controversial factor. To measure a tire's life, cars are driven 6,400 miles over public roads near San Angelo, Tex. To minimize variables in tread wear because of different driving styles, the cars travel in convoys of four at constant speeds, and drivers regularly change between cars.
Tires are graded on an index, which indicates relative tread wear. A tire graded 150 should provide 50 percent more mileage than one graded 100. Under average conditions each 50 points represent a life expectancy of about 10,000 miles.
The tire industry took issue with the index and went to court in 1975 to block it. Producers argued it was of little value because a tire's life varied sharply, depending on factors like road conditions and the type of driving. ''It is a meaningless system,'' said Thomas Cole, the president of the Rubber Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Washington.
A Federal court in Washington rejected that argument, and the rating system took effect in 1979. But in 1983, the tread-wear index was dropped again, this time by the traffic safety agency, which echoed the industry's earlier argument that grading was a tricky business. The Center for Auto Safety filed suit against the agency, and in 1984 a Federal appeals court in Washington ordered the agency to reinstate the index.
The traffic safety agency, which used to publish a guide to help consumers convert the index to expected mileage, no longer does so. Barry Felrice, the assistant administrator for rule making, said the agency now believes that differences in road conditions vary too much to make mileage figures meaningful. And he insisted that ranking tires was impossible because buyers must balance a tire's tread wear against the safety factors of traction and temperature ratings.
 
What's Important May Vary
''We try to tell consumers what these ratings mean and assume they are smart enough to know what is important to them,'' Mr. Felrice said. ''Someone who does a lot of high-speed highway driving might be more interested in temperature than tread wear.''
Mr. Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety said he would continue to press Federal officials to make the tire-rating system more intelligible and accessible. He pointed out that such a system is already used by the Environmental Protection Agency, which widely publicizes its gas-mileage ratings for cars.
''Everybody knows that gas ratings vary according to driving habits, but that does not stop E.P.A. from publicizing them or ranking the best performers,'' he said.
 
BEFORE YOU DRIVE OFF TO THE DEALER
Car owners buy an estimated 175 million replacement tires annually. Most of them are steel-belted radials, the most popular tires in the country. Here are some shopping tips.
Always buy the same size as the tire you are replacing unless the car or tire maker approves the use of another size.
If you are mixing radial and nonradial tires - ask your car maker if you should - put the radial tires on the rear wheels.
So-called ''high performance'' tires will have a lower tread-wear rating than a regular tire. This is because they emphasize traction and are made from softer compounds intended to hold the road better.
Make sure the dealer registers your name and address with the tire's producer to make notification easier in case of a recall.
For a list of long-lasting tires compiled by the Center for Auto Safety, send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the center at 2001 S Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20009. For a list of the 1,800 tires rated by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, call agency's Auto Safety Hotline at (800) 424-9393, except in the District of Columbia, where callers should use (202) 366-0123.

As head of the Office of Financial Services and the chairwoman of both the Financial Services Corporation and New York City Industrial Development Agency, LERESSA R. CROCKETT has not been one of Mayor DAVID N. DINKINS's high-profile commissioners.
But in supervising a $1.6 billion portfolio of economic development loans, Ms. Crockett, 39 years old, is an increasingly significant figure in the city's troubled financial future and ''a person emerging in power and influence and likely to be a future leader in the financial community,'' according to the Women's Bond Club of New York. The 69-year-old club, whose members are female executives in investment banking, brokerage and insurance, honored Ms. Crockett on Thursday.
Ms. Crockett, a former vice president at Salomon Brothers now making $110,000 a year, less than her former salary, said, ''There's a much broader perspective in working for the city.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Strengthens in U.S. After Weakening in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly stronger in domestic trading yesterday after weakening in Europe, but foreign exchange brokers said it remained wobbly because of American economic uncertainty.
It rebounded yesterday to 1.5025 marks, after having fallen through the psychological barrier of 1.50 German marks on Thursday to 1.4970 in New York.
''This is volatile stuff,'' said Lloyd G. Atkinson, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal, ''and all indications are that this is going to continue for some time.'' 
 
Markets Still Pessimistic
Traders said the foreign exchange markets continued to display pessimism about the dollar, especially in light of the prolonged political stalemate in Washington over the budget deficit.
''We've had comments all week from Japanese, U.S. and German officials that they're either happy with the dollar right now or they welcome further gains in the yen or the mark at the expense of the dollar,'' said Michael Faust, a currency analyst with Money Market Services in Chicago.
In New York, traders said, the dollar's behavior was largely influenced by the oil market. Oil fell by about $3 a barrel, easing inflation fears and thereby helping the dollar rally a bit. Inflation erodes the value of dollars. Rises Against Yen The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, ending a long slide. In Tokyo, the dollar finished trading at 125.25 yen, up 0.85 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 125.90. In New York, the dollar closed at 125.95 yen, up from 124.40 late Thursday.
In London, the cost for one British pound rose to $1.9590, from $1.9540 late Thursday. At closing in New York, one pound cost $1.9585, less expensive than Thursday's $1.9710.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.2680 Swiss francs, up from 1.2590; 5.0295 French francs, up from 5.0165; 1,124.25 Italian lire, up from 1,122.00, and 1.1731 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1698.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.5040 German marks, down from 1.5115; 1.2700 Swiss francs, down from 1.2735; 5.0380 French francs, down from 5.0630; 1.6940 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7035; 1,127.00 Italian lire, down from 1,132.75, and 1.1675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1750.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Up Again; Copper Increases Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of precious metal futures rose for the third straight day yesterday, partly offsetting recent steep losses as a sharp drop in oil prices stirred speculation that interest rates might fall.
On other commodity markets, copper futures rose sharply and livestock and meat futures were mixed, as were grains and soybeans.
Gold futures settled $2.70 to $2.80 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the spot price, represented by the contract for October delivery, at $372.80 a troy ounce; silver was 5.8 cents to 6.1 cents higher, with October at $4.258 a troy ounce. 
Platinum outpaced the other precious metals. Platinum futures ended $10.50 to $11.50 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with October at $407.70 a troy ounce.
The metals virtually ignored a number of traditionally bearish signals including sharply higher stock prices and a stronger dollar.
Instead, metal traders focused on oil prices, which fell $2 to $3.01 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with November light, sweet crude at $33.79 a barrel. The drop was attributed to perceptions that the Iraqi-American standoff in the Middle East was moving toward a peaceful settlement. That led to a letup in inflationary worries and prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve might act to lower bank lending rates.
''The last time the Fed indicated it was easing credit policy back in July, that's when gold accelerated to the up side,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst for Paine Webber Inc.
John Jonat, who trades precious metals for Deak International Inc., also said gold's rise was a spillover from the platinum market, which rose on strong Japanese demand.
Strength in the stock market contributed to a strong rally in copper futures on the Commodity Exchange. Copper has many applications in the manufacturing and construction industries, so its price responds strongly to economic signals.
Copper futures ended 1.5 cents to 3.8 cents higher, with October at $1.267 a pound.
Cattle futures rose moderately on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line with stronger cash-market fundamentals. Traders also evened their positions ahead of the Government's quarterly cattle-on-feed report, which will be released Monday afternoon.
Hog futures fell slightly while pork bellies advanced.
Live cattle were unchanged to 0.50 cent higher, with October at 79.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.07 cent lower to 0.60 cent higher, with October at 86.85 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.20 cent lower to 0.13 cent higher, with October at 57.17 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.17 cents to 1.8 cents higher, with February at 67.17 cents a pound.

Loss Posted By Texas Instruments

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Texas Instruments Inc., one of the nation's largest makers of computer memory chips, said today that it lost $7 million in the third quarter, compared with a profit of $65 million, or 67 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue rose 7 percent, to $1.68 billion from $1.57 billion.
Falling memory chip prices, rising spending on new technology and chip plants as well as a temporary shutdown of its Philippine chip-making plant after an earthquake in July contributed to the loss, said Jerry R. Junkins, chairman and chief executive. The Philippine plant is now running at full capacity, but production was limited for four weeks. 
The third-quarter loss was anticipated on Wall Street, in part because two other large makers of memory chips, Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductor, had reported losses. Also, Mr. Junkins said last summer before the earthquake that a third-quarter loss was likely.
Texas Instruments shares fell 37.5 cents, to $25.125, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange. Fourth-Quarter Losses Seen Mr. Junkins also indicated that the company's losses would extend through the fourth quarter. He said high levels of capital spending would continue in a period with falling prices for memory chips and a weakening economy in the United States.
Prices for dynamic random access memory chips that store a million characters of memory fell from more than $6 to below $5 in the quarter.
Some Japanese chip makers have begun shipping memory chips that store four million characters. A spokesman, Stan Victor, said Texas Instruments would start shipping these new chips later this year. Prices for the four-megabyte chips are above $25.
Mr. Junkins said the company's orders for military supplies, which include missiles and computer chips, fell by 51 percent. The overall backlog declined by $640 million, to $4.07 billion, in the quarter, with most of the decline recorded in the military-electronics unit. The company has cut 950 jobs from its military-related payroll in the last four months.
Royalty payments rose to $41 million in the quarter from $32 million in the period last year.
Negotiations with Japanese and Korean chip makers on new licensing agreements are continuing, and the company declined to estimate their potential for future royalty income. Some analysts have put the figure as high as $2 billion.

HEADLINE: Zenith Reports $11.6 Million Deficit

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Zenith Electronics Corporation yesterday reported a third-quarter loss of $11.6 million on sales of $342.3 million. The consumer electronics maker, based in Glenview, Ill., said the slowdown in the economy had resulted in reduced sales of picture tubes for television manufactuers and videocassette recorders. Lower prices for color television sets also hurt the company's performance. 
Results for the quarter included a $2.4 million gain resulting from the termination of a defined-benefit pension plan. For the period last year, the company lost $24.1 million on sales of $376.8 million. In that period for the businesses that Zenith still owns, the loss was $9.1 million. The company sold its computer business to Groupe Bull of France last year for $511 million.
Demand also fell for the company's monochrome computer screens.
''The businesses that they operate in are intensely competitive and that shows up in their operating performance,'' said Russell L. Leavitt, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.
The company's stock rose 12.5 cents, to $4.25 on the Big Board.
Zenith has largely staked its future on the development of a market for high-definition systems for television sets and computers.
Zenith is developing two aspects of its high-definition system and plans to spend $10 million on research this year. The company is developing a high-resolution color cathode ray tube, known as a flat tension mask. Zenith plans to sell the screens, which provide a brilliantly clear picture even in sunlight, to computer makers, as well as use them on the company's high-definition television sets.
Zenith's chairman and president, Jerry K. Pearlman, has lobbied intensely for Government financing for Zenith, framing the discussion in terms of the United States' global competiveness. He has said producing such high-resolution displays would be the next high-technology battleground between the United States and other countries. With developments like Zenith's flat tension mask, ''It is not too late for the U.S. to win,'' Zenith said in a typical statement in a recent company report.
In August, the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency said it would provide slightly more than $1 million in financing for Zenith to develop the screen for a military work station.
The company is also developing a broadcast transmission system for high-definition television. Rival high-definition television systems are under development by companies in Japan and in Europe.
If the market does not develop according to Zenith's plans, analysts said the company's future was uncertain.

HEADLINE: Bad Loans Up in New England Bank Loss

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Bank of New England Corporation, one of the nation's weakest large banking companies, yesterday announced a loss of $123.2 million in the third quarter as bad real estate loans in the sour New England economy continued to grow.
The loss, which raised the company's total loss to $1.44 billion over the last four quarters, further reduced the already thin capital cushion the company has to absorb future losses. The company has shareholder capital equal to about 1.1 percent of assets, well below a target of 3 percent of assets it set earlier this year. 
The third-quarter loss resulted from the company's decision to set aside $100 million for possible losses on bad loans, even though its measurements of risk in its loans showed that just $30 million needed to be set aside.
''Given the current environment, the weak real estate market, and the uncertain oil situation and how it might affect the regional economy, we decided it would be prudent to be conservative and strengthen our reserves,'' said Lawrence K. Fish, chairman of the Boston-based bank.
Mr. Fish added that real estate loans accounted for 80 percent of the company's bad loans. Although the general economy is weakening, he said defaults on other kinds of business loans were not rising.
''We see businesses behaving very conservatively, and reducing their level of debt,'' the chairman said. ''We are also seeing the same thing in the consumer loan portfolio.''
Besides its loan losses, another big challenge at the bank has been to cut costs. After selling about $5 billion of assets earlier this year, including the credit card and leasing businesses, the income of the company has fallen more rapidly than expenses. Thus, it lost $48 million in the third quarter from its regular operations, not counting the loss caused by increasing the reserve for bad loans.
Mr. Fish noted that the company had cut 5,000 jobs this year and expected to cut 1,000 more by early next year. Even after cutting expenses, analysts said that profitability might be weak because of the burden of bad loans and real estate acquired from bad loans, which rose $65 million, to $2.84 billion in the third quarter. While no interest is paid on those loans, the company must still pay interest on the deposits and other money it borrowed to finance them.
In a move to rebuild capital, the company met yesterday with holders of $706 million of its bonds and presented them a proposal for converting the bonds into capital. The bank said that acceptance of its proposal would raise its equity capital to more than 3 percent of assets, but would greatly reduce the share of the company owned by holders of the existing 69.5 million shares.
With equity capital of only $255 million at Sept. 30, the bank would need more than $441 million of new capital to exceed 3 percent of its assets. Its existing shares have a total market value of only about $104 million.
Earlier this year, some bondholders proposed an exchange of each $1,000 bond for $250 of cash and new stock in the company of about $250. the bank officials declined to comment on the earlier offer from bondholders or the terms of the new offer made yesterday.

HEADLINE: Oil Lowest In a Month, Down $3.01

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil prices fell to their lowest level in a month yesterday, as oil traders' fear of war was overtaken by a belief that shooting is less likely and by prospects that supplies have just about recovered from the effect of the United Nations embargo of Iraq and Kuwait.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for November delivery closed at $33.79, the lowest price since Sept. 20. The drop, $3.01, was the third largest in the 13-week crisis and brought the decline for the week to $5.90 a barrel.
Several traders cited a statement by Taha Yasin Ramadan, the First Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, that the crisis had entered ''a phase of reassessment and reconsideration of positions.'' Various rumors circulated to the effect that Iraq was looking for a way out of the crisis. 
 
A Change in Psychology
The psychology has turned around, said one trader, Christian D. Gohler of Merrill Lynch Futures. Earlier this month, he said, ''people were in there buying with their eyes closed, people who felt there's going to be a war and you'd better be covered.''
But the dealers who were once afraid to leave for the weekend ''short'' on oil, or holding contracts that obligate them to deliver oil at a fixed price on some distant day, are now afraid to go ''long,'' he said -promising to buy a fixed quantity at a fixed price on a specified day.
An oil refiner or speculator who went long and agreed to buy in December at $40 a barrel could lose big if peace were assured and the spot price on the appointed day in December fell to $30 or less. Indeed, anyone who bought a contract obligating a purchase at $40 has lost unless prices go back up; anyone who promised to deliver at $40 has made money. For every dollar one trader loses, another gains the same amount.
 
Last Trading on Contract
Today was the last full day of trading for the November crude contract, which may also have helped to push the price down, because many contract holders did not want to take actual delivery. But the price of oil for delivery in later months also went down sharply.
''It's war and peace,'' said Theodore Eck, chief economist of the Amoco Corporation in Chicago. ''This is a Tolstoy market.''
John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, agreed, saying the balance of supply and demand did not justify a price much higher than $30 a barrel. ''Everything above that is psychology,'' he said.
Some analysts think even $30 is too high. At Pegasus Econometric Group, in Hoboken, N.J., Peter C. Beutel said production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries appeared to be 22.5 million to 23 million barrels a day, about equal to, or slightly higher than, the level before the crisis. Since the embargo, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and others have sharply raised production to make up for lost supplies from Iraq and Kuwait.
The Department of Energy, which had been predicting for weeks that the shortfall in November would be less than a million barrels a day, now says it will be less than half a million barrels a day. Mr. Beutel said that along with high production, the price was down because demand for oil products was ''dreadful, absolutely miserable.''
Heating oil inventories held by oil companies are 15 million barrels ahead of what they were a year ago, according to the American Petroleum Institute, and the weather in New York, the main market, has been warm. In addition, Ed Rothschild of Citizen Action, a consumer group in Washington, said many consumers and dealers who were caught by price increases last December decided to fill their tanks early this year.
As a result, he said, demand is weak, and among the refiners ''no one is willing to pay $40'' anymore.
Refiners had been paying for expensive oil and selling products at a price that did not reflect the increase, reducing their demand. Mr. Lichtblau pointed out that last week refinery runs averaged 13.1 million barrels a day, down from 14.3 million for the week ended Sept. 21.
On the New York Merc, heating oil for delivery next month closed at 88.40 cents a gallon, down 8.11 cents -an especially sharp decline. Unleaded gasoline closed at 87.91 cents, down 5.05 cents.
Mr. Lichtblau referred to a ''snowballing effect'' in the market. ''Once it starts going down, everybody wants to sell before it goes down further,'' he said.
Mr. Beutel predicted that there would be strong psychological support for oil at $30 a barrel. But the only certainty is volatility, he added.

HEADLINE: Midway Air Leaving Philadelphia

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Less than a year after it began an ambitious plan to make Philadelphia a hub, Midway Airlines Inc. said today that it was abandoning the effort and selling the operations to USAir Inc. In doing so, Midway, already troubled by high jet fuel costs, will lay off more employees, end 60 flights by April 30 and retreat to its home base of Chicago to ride out what could be a long and difficult period for the entire airline industry.
Midway's problems are symptomatic of the industry. Faced with sluggish traffic, continued harsh competition and the possibility of even more fuel price increases, many airlines fear deep losses in coming months.
Midway said that with fewer people traveling and with the cost of airline fuel nearly doubling since July, it simply could not afford to cover its day-to-day operating costs and continue the investment needed to make a strong hub at the Philadelphia International Airport. 
Midway said it would sell its entire Philadelphia operation - landing slots, international routes, 11 gates and other equipment - to USAir for $67.5 million. Midway established its Philadelphia hub last November by buying the assets, along with about $100 million worth of planes, from Eastern Airlines for more than $200 million. Midway will keep the aircraft: 16 DC-9 jets.
Midway said it would lay off an unspecified number of its 800 employees in Philadelphia. The carrier recently announced an 8 percent cut in its work force of 6,300. Dismantling the Philadelphia operation is a major setback that will force Midway to post a loss of more than $30 million in the fourth quarter on top of the $34 million it lost in the first half of the year. Company executives said the airline's declining resources left them no choice.
''The risk would have been continuing to drive down the same road and driving off a cliff,'' David R. Hinson, Midway's chairman and chief executive, said today in a telephone interview.
Midway had come very close to the edge. Thomas Longman, the airline analyst at Bear, Stearns Inc., said Midway had about $15.5 million in cash on June 30 out of total assets of $440 million. Although Midway has not yet reported its third-quarter results, Mr. Longman said he expected a $17 million loss, which would have nearly depleted the company's bank account. The airline pays about $3.5 million a quarter for interest alone.
''They were running low on cash, and that is why they needed to make this move,'' Mr. Longman said.
The company's share price rose 87 1/2 cents today, to $6.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Midway suffers more than many other carriers from the higher fuel costs. Its fleet is less fuel efficient and it pays a special fuel tax in Chicago that many airlines elsewhere do not pay.
Philadelphia would have helped, but the results there turned out to be a big disappointment. No sooner had Midway begun service out of Philadelphia than competitors responded with a vengeance. USAir beefed up its service from that city to points throughout the Northeast, other airlines started Philadelphia-to-Miami service, and Eastern cut fares on Northeast-to-Florida runs to $79 one way.
The competition kept Midway from charging the fares it needed to make a profit and it began to lose money substantially. Companywide losses were $50 million in the first six months of operation at the Philadelphia hub.
Mr. Hinson said Midway would now try to ride out the weak economy and high fuel costs, then make another attempt to establish a second hub. Cash Improvement Expected He said that Midway's cash position would improve greatly because of the sale to USAir and that ''there is no prospect for a bankruptcy.'' He noted that Midway took on most of its debt to finance revenue-generating aircraft rather than to cover operating losses.
But analysts say that Midway has only bought some breathing room, that it still could get into deep trouble, and that its fate may be out of its hands.
''A lot of the prognosis for Midway depends on what fuel prices and the economy do,'' said Mark Daugherty, the airline analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''A lot of airlines are anticipating a real tough period with heavy losses over the coming months.''

The Economy
 President Bush pressed Republicans for a budget cut to reduce the deficit without raising income tax rates. But House and Senate negotiators predicted that a final budget deal would include higher income taxes on the rich and a rise in gasoline taxes. [Page 1.] Legislation to regulate cable television is dead for this session of Congress, Senate sponsors declared, despite a flurry of last-minute deal-making. Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, acknowledging that he could not muster enough support to get the bill to the floor in this session, blamed the White House. [29.] The Senate passed far-reaching aviation legislation that couples new local fees on passengers to a new national policy on airport noise. The compromise measure faces uncertain prospects. [9.] A Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts executive testified that he was not informed for years that investment partnerships affiliated with Michael R. Milken had obtained a multimillion-dollar stake in a 1985 buyout by the firm. He said disclosure should have been made. [30.] 
 
 
 
Markets
 Oil for November delivery fell $3.01, to $33.79, its lowest level since Sept. 20, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The decline for the week was $5.90 a barrel, as oil traders' fear of war was overtaken by their belief that shooting is less likely, and by prospects that oil supplies have just about recovered from the effect of the United Nations embargo of Iraq and Kuwait. [29.] The Dow Jones industrial average surged 68.07, to 2,520.79, bringing its rise for the week to 122.77 points, or 5.1 percent. The drop in oil prices, new Iraqi peace feelers and strong signs of an imminent budget agreement combined to buoy stocks. [29.] Prices of Treasury bonds continued to climb, largely as a result of plunging oil prices. Reports that Congress was making progress on a budget package also lifted the debt market. [32.] The dollar advanced in domestic trading, moving to 1.5025 marks after having fallen through the psychological barrier of 1.50 German marks on Thursday. [40.] Prices of precious metal futures rose for the third straight day, with gold for October delivery settling at $372.80 an ounce, up $2.70, on the Comex. [40.]

HEADLINE: First Gubernatorial Debate Focuses on Budget Trouble

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Meeting tonight for the first debate of the gubernatorial campaign, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his three opponents scoffingly questioned one another's competence to handle what they all agreed were the daunting fiscal problems facing New York State.
The hourlong debate, which was not broadcast live anywhere in the state, quickly lost its veneer of political politeness and took on the tone of a schoolyard brawl.
''If Mario ever came in an economics class of mine - and I taught economics for seven years - I'd give him a double F,'' the Republican candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, said early in the debate.
Governor Cuomo responded: ''If ever I come to your economics class, I shouldn't be flunked. I should be committed.'' 
 
At the Time of the World Series
Mr. Cuomo had refused to debate Mr. Rinfret one on one, saying that the other candidates, Herbert London, the Conservative, and Louis P. Wein, the Right to Life candidate, deserved to be included.
The timing of tonight's debate - on a Friday night in the middle of the World Series - appeared designed to minimize coverage, and Mr. Cuomo's opponents accused him of deliberately scheduling the encounter to reduce its audience. Aides to the Governor, however, denied this, saying that other dates that had been offered had conflicted with the Governor's schedule.
Almost the entire debate was devoted to fiscal issues, and even when questions on other topics were posed to the candidates, they dragged the discussion back to economics, repeatedly disputing one another not only on questions of competence, but also on questions of fact, including what New York's tax rate is and how many workers the state employs for each 10,000 residents.
''You're dead wrong on your numbers, because you always are,'' Mr. Rinfret said to Mr. Cuomo at one point. At the start of the debate, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged for the first time that the state would probably run a deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends in March.
 
'He Did Nothing About It'
Earlier in the week, when the State Comptroller reported that state tax collections were lagging seriously behind projections, Mr. Cuomo said it was too early to tell whether the state would end the year in debt.
But tonight he said, ''I project that we will have a deficit in the current year.''
His opponents quickly jumped on this opening, arguing that the Governor should have recognized the deficit months ago and started to close it.
''It fascinates me that Governor Cuomo, Mario, discovered what I knew 110 days ago,'' Mr. Rinfret said. ''He heard me say it. He did nothing about it.''
Mr. London charged that the Governor should have cut the budget earlier to avert a deficit.
''Why are we now talking about cutting the budget when we should have been doing so eight years ago?'' he asked.
 
Specifics on Trimming the Budget
Mr. London was the only candidate in the debate to offer specific suggestions about how he would cut the state's $50 billion budget. They included cuts in the staff at the Governor's mansion, a $400 million reduction in Medicaid expenses and the establishment of a means test and a sliding tuition scale for students in the state university system.
Mr. Wein, in contrast, spoke in generalities, calling for ''a total restructuring of state government.''
''We have to return to the idea that people take care of people, not government,'' he said.
There was no clear winner in tonight's debate, which started at 7:45 P.M. Four reporters posed questions to the candidates, who were given two and a half minutes to answer and one minute for rebuttal.
 
By Bus, for $39.55
Even before the debate started, Mr. Rinfret had made the most of the free publicity the event afforded. Saying that his campaign did not have enough money for him to fly to Syracuse, he traveled here from New York City by Greyhound bus, at a cost of $39.55.
Mr. Rinfret, whose campaign tactics have raised quite a few political eyebrows, scheduled several news conferences today at bus stations along the route.
''Is this a publicity stunt?'' he asked before boarding the bus this morning. ''Yeah, in part. But we're out of money.'' As of last month, Mr. Rinfret's campaign was $90,000 in debt.
The debate was scheduled to be shown in a delayed broadcast in Albany tonight at 10 P.M. In New York City, the debate will not be seen until Monday night at 7 P.M. on WNET. In Buffalo it will be broadcast at midnight Monday. #2d Debate Nov. 4 Representatives for the three challengers charged Governor Cuomo with purposefully arranging the debate for a time slot when it would receive little news coverage.
''The bottom line,'' said Michael R. Long, the state's Conservative Party chairman, ''is that it's a very calculated move on the part of the Cuomo campaign to get as little exposure as possible. At the same time, no one can criticize him for not debating. He can say, 'What are you talking about? We had two debates.' ''
A second debate is scheduled for Nov. 4.
The Governor's aides insisted today, however, that he had no ulterior motive in agreeing to debate tonight.
 
'What's Herb London Doing?'
''The Governor is a guy who's widely in demand and who has other obligations, like running the state,'' said Gary G. Fryer, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo. In contrast, he said, ''What's Herb London doing on any particular night, and who cares?''
Mr. Cuomo, the overwhelming favorite in this year's race, is widely perceived to have nothing to gain through the debate. But his under-financed opponents see it as a critical opportunity for free media coverage.
During the last gubernatorial campaign, in 1986, Mr. Cuomo spent several months trying to avoid debating his heavily outspent opponent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive. During the current campaign, Mr. Cuomo has often insisted, in mock serious tones, that he is not a good debater.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Where Farmers Would Take a Hit In the Cause of Cutting the Deficit

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When debate began in January on a farm policy law to replace legislation that expired this year, few members of the House and Senate Agriculture committees thought the Government's 57-year-old program to subsidize basic farm commodities needed to be changed much.
Grain prices were strong, exports were high, and the net incomes of farmers had reached the highest levels in history. The cost of the subsidy programs, moreover, had fallen from $25.8 billion in 1986 to less than $8 billion in the 1990 fiscal year.
But looming at the edge of the debate was the matter of the Federal budget deficit, which made farm policy vulnerable to change overnight. Last week, the deficit finally cornered the Congressional conference committee that was writing a new farm policy law, and the results have potentially momentous consequences for farmers and consumers. 
The committee, responding to demands from the White House and Congressional leaders that they cut farm program spending by 25 percent, or $13.6 billion, over five years, approved the most important changes in the commodity price support programs since 1973.
First, the conference decided to levy a tax, requiring producers of milk, sugar, tobacco, peanuts, honey and wool to pay when they market their products. They favored the fees because it is hard to predict the results of lowering price supports.
Second, the conferees agreed to slash to $450 million from $1 billion the amount the Agriculture Department can lend directly to the most debt-burdened farmers.
Most important, the conferees reduced by 15 percent the amount of land on which crops eligible for Government price supports can be grown. Under the new rules, a farmer who signs up for Government subsidies must first set aside 5 percent to 15 percent of his land to lay fallow. He then has to take another 15 percent to grow anything he likes, but can only receive market prices, which in recent months have been much lower than the prices paid by the Government.
The change would reduce Government payments for a wheat farmer in Kansas who cultivates 1,000 acres by roughly $13,000, according to an analysis by an economist at Oklahoma State University. This alters the formula that each farmer uses to decide whether to stay in the Government program or get out. Currently, about 80 percent of corn and wheat growers participate.
The Bush Administration celebrated the new policy. ''Farmers have more flexibility to grow crops to meet market needs,'' said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. ''It should be beneficial for consumers because farmers can respond more quickly to their demands.''
In Iowa, where the nation's largest corn crop is being harvested, many predicted that the changes would drive farmers away from the programs and introduce a new level of uncertainty in grain supplies and prices. ''All the farmers across the country are going to make the same hard decision this winter,'' said Jack Kintzle, a 46-year-old corn farmer from Coggon, Iowa, and president of the National Corn Growers Association. ''The way I figure it now, if I stay in the program I'll lose money.''
Since 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the first farm subsidy law, the foundation of farm policy has been an ever more complex contract between the Department of Agriculture and producers of corn, sorghum, wheat, rice and cotton. In exchange for setting aside land, typically 5 to 15 percent of his tillable acres, a farmer receives direct payment.
The payment is the difference between the market price and a higher target price set by the Government. This year, corn farmers are likely to receive 50 cents to 60 cents a bushel from the Government, the difference between the market price of $2.10 to $2.20 and the Government's $2.75 target price. Wheat farmers will receive more than $1 a bushel.
Through most of their history, the farm programs were a light burden for the Government. But in the last five years, farmers flocked to the programs, payments mounted and criticism from economists was fierce.
Environmentalists also urged changes in the programs, contending that they locked farmers into destructive cultivation patterns, such as planting the same crop year after year, that hurt the fertility of the soil, caused erosion and led growers to use increasing amounts of fertilizers and pesticides.
The new rule reducing the amount of acreage eligible for Government payments is a response to environmentalists and economists, even if it wasn't meant to be. Farmers could use freed-up land for new crops. They might also drop out of the programs in record numbers and plant from fence row to fence row as they did in the 1970's, causing the reappearance of costly surpluses.
Farm programs, in effect, have become an immense experiment with enormous implications for the Treasury, the food supply, farmers and the environment. ''It is entirely possible,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska and a member of the conference committee, ''that after all the criticism, these changes could generate new enthusiasm for farm programs.''

Unheeded Advice

 BODY:
In recent months Felix G. Rohatyn has been complaining that one of the biggest problems facing New York City is that no one - including the Mayor and the unions - will heed his warnings of an impending financial crisis worse than the one he helped to resolve in 1975. Last week he said he would resign at year's end as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state agency that helped untangle the mess 15 years ago. But he left open the possibility that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo could persuade him to stay. ''He could lock me in a room,'' Mr. Rohatyn said, ''but all things being equal, my intention is to get out.''

THE ECONOMY
 
An Accounting Change That Raises Health Care Costs
 
Unions may have an even tougher time holding the line on health care benefits, for corporations now have a greater incentive then ever to skimp on coverage. The board that makes the nation's accounting rules voted last week to require employers to set up reserves to cover the cost of providing health care to future retirees - an expense that would reduce corporate earnings. Most companies now account for benefits as they pay for them, but the Financial Accounting Standards Board claims this does not give investors an accurate picture of a company's future liabilities. The new rule, which will take effect in 1993, is expected to cost the largest 1,000 companies a total of $227 billion. When General Mills adopted the method in 1989, its health care expenses doubled that year to more than $10.5 million. Many companies may experience as much as a 10-fold increase in their medical costs, says Pat McConnell, a managing director at Bear Stearns & Company. To narrow their liabilities and the hits on their profits, companies may be prompted to pare benefits. 
 
A Breather on the Hill
 
Congress passed another stop-gap measure to extend Government spending power five days beyond Friday night, when automatic, across-the-board budget cuts were to go into effect. The measure, which the President was expected to sign, gives Congress time to patch together a compromise budget. While a House bill passed on Tuesday would raise income taxes and make the wealthy bear most of the brunt, a Senate version, passed Thursday and preferred by the President, calls for no new income taxes, but would raise Federal gasoline tax and cut Medicare benefits.
 
Inflation Holding Steady?
 
Despite the spike in wholesale prices in September, which suggested that soaring energy prices were spreading through the economy, manufacturers do not seem to be passing their added costs on to consumers yet. The Consumer Price Index rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in September for the second straight month. But economists noted that without energy and food prices, the monthly rise in inflation was less than in August and only half as much as in July - an indication that ebbing demand for some products is keeping manufacturers from raising their prices and that inflation is largely under control.
 
A Deepening Deficit
 
The dollar hit an all-time low last week against the German mark - a decline that should continue to discourage investments in the United States. But the weak dollar has one redeeming value: it makes American goods attractive abroad. Export growth has been one of the few bright spots in the economy all year, and in August prevented the United States trade deficit from widening any more dramatically. The higher cost of imported oil deepened the deficit in August by 2.4 percent, to $9.3 billion, the largest imbalance since January. But the gap would have been worse, except for an 8.3 percent gain in exports this year, up from a 2.5 percent rise in the 1989 period. That helped narrow the nonpetroleum deficit this year by 28.5 percent.
 
Congress Defers the Damage
 
 November elections are making legislators weak-kneed. Lawmakers rejected the President's budget package two weeks ago for fear of offending constituents. Now, they are trying to distance themselves from the savings and loan crisis by delaying the authorization of $40 billion needed by the agency handling the bailout to keep the program going. Lawmakers don't want to appear eager to add to a bailout bill that is already expected to cost taxpayers $500 billion. But Congress may be just deferring the pain: The bailout agency is about out of cash, and the lack of a new allowance could stymie the process and further increase taxpayer costs.
 
Crude's Downward Drift
 
Prices of oil fell to their lowest level in two weeks, to $33.79 a barrel, down $6. The prospect of a diplomatic settlement in the Gulf and ample oil stockpiles drove the trend. Traders also saw as a desperate move Iraq's offer to sell oil at the pre-invasion price of $21 a barrel.
 
Skittishness on the Economy
 
Americans are more nervous about the economy than they have been in a decade, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. Of 960 adults polled early this month, 69 percent said the economy is getting worse and more than half said it is in a recession. Only 18 percent blame President Bush.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
 A Prize and a Plan
 
He may have won the Nobel Peace Prize last week for easing global tensions, but President Mikhail S. Gorbachev introduced a plan to switch the Soviet Union to a free-market economy that is bound to stir up trouble at home for months to come. Approved by the Soviet Parliament on Friday, the plan would sell state property to private investors, lift Government price controls and hand over many economic decisions, including determining a timetable for the shift, to the country's 15 republics. But critics, including Mr. Gorbachev's archrival, Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, prefer a more radical remedy. And some republics may secede in protest of the plan - a path pocked with peril given the interdependency of the Soviet republics, each with an economic specialty.
 
 A Break for Matsushita
 
If the yen continues to strengthen against the dollar, the Matsushita Electrical Company, Japan's largest consumer electronics company, could get an unexpected bargain on its purchase of MCA Inc., the giant entertainment company. Since news of the deal first surfaced on Sept. 24, the yen has risen 9.1 percent against the dollar, to 125.85 yen. At the current exchange and the rumored $85-a-share purchase price, the deal would cost Matsushita about $6.8 billion rather than the expected $7.5 billion.
 
COMPANIES
 
Higher Airfares on the Horizon
 
The runaway cost of jet fuel may create a $1 billion loss for airlines in the fourth quarter - more than any yearly loss ever for the industry, says the Air Transport Association. Since the Iraqi invasion, jet fuel, which represents more than 15 percent of an airline's operating costs, has increased in price by more than 120 percent. The jump is behind the 52.1 percent decline in the third-quarter earnings of the successful parent of American Airlines. Fares have already drifted upward, but some analysts estimate that airlines would need a 21 percent price hike to compensate for its costs. That is within sight: Last week, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines announced increases that could cause a rise in industry fares of at least 15 percent in two months, one of the steepest and quickest ever.
 
 A Big, Bold Aircraft Order
 
United Airlines is not as overwrought by rising costs as some carriers, which have put off buying new planes. Boldly, the airline on Monday placed the largest aircraft order ever: for $22 billion worth of long-range, wide-body planes, including 777's, from the Boeing Company. It is good news for Boeing, hurt by a downturn in military spending, and a show of strength by Stephen M. Wolf, the head of the UAL Corporation, who seems to have won a harrowing takeover skirmish with the unions. Another hint of his victory: a peace pact with Coniston Partners, a big shareholder, which agreed to stop supporting a takeover in exchange for two board seats.
 
A Surprise From Citicorp
 
Many of the nation's top banking companies reported weaker earnings for the third quarter, mainly because of losses on commercial real estate loans. The biggest surprise came from the biggest bank: Citicorp's earnings not only dropped 38 percent for the quarter, but its troubled commercial loans rose by roughly 17 percent, to $4.6 billion, prompting it to set aside an additional $283 million in reserves. Most large banks set aside reserves for at least 50 percent of their nonperforming assets, but Citicorp's provision for commercial loan losses amounts to a mere 14.7 percent. ''We expect them to add up to $2 billion to reserves next quarter,'' said Thomas H. Hanley of Salomon Brothers. ''That would bring their reserves on their bad commercial loans to the level of other big banks.'' Will Citicorp be forced to join the band of bank dividend cutters? Mr. Hanley says no.
 
With a cold shoulder from Wall Street making it difficult to raise capital, many banks are shearing their work forces, dividends and lines of business to cover loan losses. They are also becoming reluctant lenders. This year, bank loans to businesses have fallen by $5.2 billion, to $315.6 billion, the biggest drop since 1987, according to the Federal Reserve.
 
In Brief
 
Donald J. Trump is asking bondholders of his Taj Mahal to accept new ''junk bonds'' in lieu of a coming $47.3 million interest rate payment and is trying to keep control of 80 percent of the casino while reducing the interest rate on $675 million of its bonds. Why oblige? Mr. Trump says the Taj might otherwise go bust.
 
I.B.M.'s third-quarter earnings rose 27 percent, to $1.11 billion, in part because of cost controls put in place last year.
 
Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, will get another newspaper man as its head when Peter R. Kann, president, newly named chief executive, and a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter, takes over as chairman, as expected, when Warren H. Phillips retires on July 1. Mr. Phillips inspired a 15-year growth streak at Dow Jones.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Clouds scudded across the early afternoon sky as Richard Donatuti sped down the Bronx streets, whistling past piteous apartment houses, weed-choked lots, sidewalks dominated by idle people, on his way to see someone wanting a million dollars. His driving stood hair on end. He regards anyplace as fit for a U-turn and does not feel a one-way sign always must be obeyed. Office colleagues constantly rib him: ''The crash helmets are in the trunk;'' ''You're going out with Richie? Make sure you drive. Tie him up if necessary.'' 
Rarely silent, he filled the Chevy Caprice with his chatter. ''You're going to get a good feel for what I do,'' he said, narrowly missing a bus, ''which is go crazy most of the time. I'm like the old-fashioned general practitioner. I've got all kinds of customers. Boiler makers. Toy importers. The Botanical Garden. People make fun of the Bronx. Listen, I'm loaning money all over this place. Chemical Bank is making good money here. I love the Bronx.'' As the head of one of two lending units in the Bronx commercial office of Chemical Bank, Rich Donatuti lends money to small and medium-sized businesses. He is part missionary, part capitalist. It is tricky work in the best of times, but it gets done now at a dark moment for the banking industry. Banks are in dreadful shape, reeling from the lash of ill-advised loans and intensified competition, their portfolios thick with deadbeat borrowers, and many lenders have tightened their credit. Chemical itself just posted a $43.7 million loss in the third quarter, overwhelmed by problem real-estate loans.
But one market that remains attractive, although it too is slowing down, is the middle market, the loans to companies boasting sales of between $1 million and $250 million. Chemical Bank is the king of New York's middle market, biggest in the country. It estimates it does business with 36 percent of middle-market companies in the region; it has loans to them totaling $5 billion, and another $5 billion in deposits. The work pays well, producing about 15 percent of Chemical's profits, since small companies accept rates that blue-chip companies don't have to and they keep plump deposits in branch accounts, many of which don't pay interest.
One curious landscape in which to see the pursuit of the middle market is the Bronx, speckled with droves of light manufacturers, meat wholesalers and retailers, small companies with large dreams. It is here, mere miles from the slick world of gleaming Manhattan offices, that Rich Donatuti and nine other Chemical account officers ply Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse, rapping on padlocked steel doors. It is not a big growth market, nothing like Manhattan, but it is dense with solid, loyal businesses. As economic clouds darken, many companies are smarting, and some banks are retreating. Chemical, too, has grown wary, but, with other corners of banking drying up, it has been plowing the Bronx harder than ever.
The middle market is one where personal relationships matter more than points above prime, where you need to show up with a smile at customer weddings and where it doesn't hurt to play golf. It is a market where loan officers are habitually on the road. Several days of feverish trips in Rich Donatuti's Chevy offered a glimpse of a life lending money in the wilds of the Bronx, and a window into the world of small business during a harrowing time.
 
'The Tough Ones'
 A security guard was scolding a loiterer outside the Daughter of Jacob Nursing Home, where Mr. Donatuti, accompanied by Robert Pearson, a Chemical account officer, parked, on his way to meet its director. ''They talk about how parking is impossible in New York,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''Not in the Bronx. Of course, the engine's gone when you come back.''
Mr. Donatuti is 39, with short, sandy hair and lively features. He often wears a wistful expression, and he has such ardor for giving out money that it infects those who are with him. He has a contagious rollicking laugh that gets an airing a few hundred times a day. He joined Chemical after acquiring a management science degree in college, and has been there 15 years, the last 14 in the Bronx. ''I don't know what I did wrong in Manhattan,'' he quipped. ''But they won't let me back.'' An endowment fund affiliated with the nursing home needed $1 million to build a new parking garage. Militating against the loan was the fact that the home was losing quite a bit of money. ''These are the tough ones,'' Mr. Donatuti said. He confessed that if this were a brand-new customer rather than a longstanding one he would reject the loan.
 
The Board Member
Joining Mike Brucella, the director, for the session was one of the board members. She snippily said she disliked a previous proposal by Chemical that the loan be secured by Treasury bills it had on deposit. ''We can go to an S.& L.,'' she said. ''They're going out of business anyway.''
She went on, ''We've done so much for so long with Chemical. Now we feel that Chemical should be doing something for us, certainly more than what you've put down here, because we are nonprofit.''
Mr. Pearson said more information was needed on the formal tie between the endowment fund and the nursing home and about the losses experienced by the home.
''Well, we're not going to continue with those losses,'' the woman said. ''So we don't even need to start with that.''
The director interrupted and asked to speak to the woman in private. Once they were out of earshot, Mr. Donatuti said: ''She's off the wall. But I can't tell her that. When you have a situation like this, all you can do is keep things from getting volatile.''
When they returned, Mr. Donatuti said Chemical would try to generate some fresh suggestions. ''O.K., do that,'' the woman said.
Mr. Donatuti dropped in on Diane Rubin, the executive director of the Riverdale Y.M.-Y.W.H.A., which was not having a merry time. The ravages of the economy had sapped it of donations and it was finding it troublesome paying the loan from Chemical, due next July, that financed its new quarters.
''I will recommend an extension,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''But they're on our watch list of risky loans. Yet what choice is there? I could foreclose on the center and kick out thousands of people who use it and become real popular up here or extend it.''
 
'That's Reality'
 Mr. Donatuti had come to take the pulse of recent fund-raising efforts. ''We've been back to the substantial families three and four times,'' Ms. Rubin said. ''We're hearing left and right how bad the market is and how bad the businesses are. It's been a grim story.''
''I think what we need to do is get a schedule and start apprising people at Chemical of what the thoughts are,'' Mr. Donatuti said.
''It's scary,'' Ms. Rubin said. ''For the first time, we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.'' ''Oh, look, that's reality,'' Mr. Donatuti said. Ambling back to the car, Mr. Donatuti said he would push for a five-year extension. ''I don't want to deal with this stress every year,'' he said.
En route to the next appointment, Mr. Donatuti gave a baleful look out the window and remarked, ''I think the Bronx has really improved from when I started here. When I drove down the Grand Concourse then, I always saw a building burning.''
Mr. Donatuti had come to a restaurant across the street from Chemical's Bronx office, in a hushed and clean building on Riverdale Avenue. As he picked at his lunch, he pointed out that the Bronx office has loans out of about $200 million and similarly sized deposits from those customers, making the loans self-funding.
''Our bread and butter deal is a loan of $450,000 to $1.25 million,'' he said. ''I call these our singles. We hit a lot of singles and we play good defense. I've got one $8 million deal. That's a home run. But it's rare for us to clear the fences. We hit singles.''
The lending is an effective way to attract checking and savings accounts for Chemical branches. ''We only make 1 or 2 percent on loans,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''We make most of our money on balances.''
With the loss of corporate Fortune 500 business to the commercial money markets, banks have chased middle-market business with fervor. In the Bronx, Chemical frequently runs across Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover and Chase. But the sputtering economy has wrought changes. ''We're in a tough credit situation,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''I've seen it for the last six to nine months. So we're trained to look a little harder at something and wonder about the risk. Our credit is not really tightening. But we are talking to our customers more.''
 
Bar Mitzvahs and Golf
 The middle market is a business of relationships, where clients will spurn better terms from another bank because they enjoy the personality of their longtime account officer. Small courtesies add up. Just the other week Mr. Donatuti went to the bar mitzvah of a customer's son. He is a frequent golf partner of customers. It is unnecessary for him to be polite and allow a client to just barely outscore him. He has yet to find anyone needing money he can beat. ''I normally shoot 105, 107, 110,'' he said. ''Let's face it, I'm not good.''
A squirrel scrabbled across the sidewalk as Mr. Donatuti parked his Chevy in front of Dayton Industries, its outside mottled with rust stains, and hustled in to see Fred Collins, the owner. Dayton is a metal fabricator, and when Mr. Donatuti asked for his assessment of his industry, Mr. Collins gave a sad-dog look and said: ''It's been a bloodbath.'' ''How're you doing?'' Mr. Donatuti asked. ''Off 30 percent for the first six months,'' Mr. Collins replied. He said he just laid off his general manager, earning $75,000 a year. ''That was rough.'' Mr. Collins asked about refinancing some outstanding loans - totaling roughly $680,000 - to afford him more working capital.
Mr. Donatuti rattled through some numbers, appraisals and inspections that would be required. It turned out that to do the deal, Mr. Collins might have to cough up fees of more than $25,000. ''Ouch,'' he said.
''It's a lot,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''But look, I didn't ask for your first born.''
''You didn't ask,'' Mr. Collins said. ''But you can have him. He's making good money.''
Mr. Collins said he would ponder the numbers. As the banker left, Mr. Collins said, ''Hey, who'd you have watching your car?'' Mr. Donatuti gave a laugh, even though he gets that line all the time.
The wind blew small bits of rubbish across the lot outside the F. W. Honerkamp Company, a wholesaler of wood products. The company has been leasing its building and the landlord wants to sell. Mr. Donatuti needed to discuss financing possibilities. ''We want him to stay in the Bronx,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''He could easily go to Jersey or to Westchester.''
Two of the Honerkamps gathered in a conference room with Mr. Donatuti.
''O.K.,'' Mr. Donatuti said, ''so you want to know what do I need to finance this sucker?'' ''A gun,'' Frank Honerkamp said. ''Not really,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''But a lot of money.''
They sped through numbers, options, concluded that the best bet would be if the landlord cut his price and did some of the financing.
Mr. Donatuti had some simple calls. He checked on a renewal of credit with Mario Sardo, owner of Fordham Marble, a prospering marble wholesaler, who teased Mr. Donatuti that a Japanese bank had come calling and maybe he was interested. He acknowledged another credit line renewal to C. C. Controlled Combustion, a successful oil burner company. Because C. C. Control was a loyal customer, Mr. Donatuti had even agreed to assume a mortgage on an Atlantic City condominium that the president had acquired. ''You do that stuff for a good guy,'' he said.
 
Going South?
 Buckets of rain came down as Mr. Donatuti popped in on the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, an outfit that promotes Bronx development. Chemical has some mortgages through it and it regularly refers clients, so Mr. Donatuti makes a point of keeping in touch. ''How's it going?'' asked John Patterson, the group's president. ''We've had a good year and we're positioned for another good year,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''But everyone's worried about the economy.''
''You know, I heard from two banks recently that the Bronx is their best market,'' Mr. Patterson said.
''This is a very strong market,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''Of course, I do worry about what the economy will mean for our customers. Yet I look at our portfolios every single day and I don't see anyone who I think will go south on us.'' ''Is anyone expanding?'' Mr. Patterson wondered. ''A minority are,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''The majority of companies are trying to walk very, very slowly.''
On the way back to the office, Mr. Donatuti zipped past a strip of auto-glass purveyors. ''There're lots of them up here,'' he said. ''We do nothing with them. They're all cash businesses. We call them cash and carry. Get the cash and carry it to the mattress.''
On a Wednesday morning, Mr. Donatuti had a credit analysis meeting in his office. He perused an application by a company that sold repair supplies to owners of apartment buildings. It wished to borrow more money and have a mortgage assumed.
''We need to do more homework,'' Mr. Donatuti said. ''We've got to do a vendor check and a receivables check.'' ''What's his personal statement look like?'' someone asked. ''Not strong,'' the credit analyst said. ''He's got a 60-foot boat with a $400,000 mortgage. He's got an $800,000 house. He's got a Rolls-Royce. All mortgaged.''
''Maybe the bank needs a boat,'' Mr. Donatuti said.
 
Blitz Day
 Shortly after dawn, six Chemical teams of two bent over their bagels and coffee in the Bronx conference room. Today was a ''blitz'' day. A blitz is a roughly every-other-month phenomenon for Chemical's Bronx office (it's commonplace at other banks as well) during which loan officers are dispatched to competitor clients to try to persuade them to borrow from Chemical.
Mr. Donatuti was paired with Susan Rogan. Against her best instincts, she allowed Mr. Donatuti the wheel. Screaming down the Henry Hudson Parkway, he remarked, ''Over a year of blitzing, if we pick up a half a dozen to 10 solid relationships, that would be good. To get them, you need to make several hundred calls. It's a lot of work, but it's necessary.''
At the first call, an oil company, the owner was out and not expected back for the day. Ms. Rogan did note that the office was one of the nicer ones she had encountered; she saw no bugs.
At the next call, an elevator service firm, the executive vice president said business was great and he was dashing to a meeting, leave your card.
At Selby Furniture, which makes hinges for the furniture industry, the owner gave the team a warm greeting but no definite interest.
Time was now running short, because everyone was to be back at the office by 12:15 for a blitz wrap-up.
Reassembled in the conference room, the teams recounted their experiences and then classified each prospect as ''hot,'' ''warm'' or ''cold.'' The final tally was three hot, seven warm and 10 cold.
All in all, Mr. Donatuti considered the blitz disappointing. But he had no time to brood, for he had to hop into the car for another round of adventures. ''You going to drive, Richie?'' someone asked. ''Yeah,'' he said.
''Well, let's all pray.''
 
KEEPING COMPETITORS AT BAY
Though king of the middle market seemingly forever, and with a wide lead over its rivals, Chemical Bank is not without feisty competitors looking to broaden their penetration if the risk is not too great.
Citibank, which ranks as the No. 2 player in New York's middle market, finds middle-market companies suffering from less liquidity and scrambling to conserve cash.
''Yet the opportunities to do business are greater because more banks are pulling out of this market,'' said Alan Weiss, the managing director of Citibank's business and professional banking for the New York area. ''We see this as a prime time to stay committed to this market.''
Manufacturers Hanover Trust is also applying some heat. ''I think this is still a very attractive business for the bank,'' said Carol Parry, who heads the business banking group that embraces companies with sales of $3 million to $40 million. ''The problem is the economy. Businesses aren't growing the way they were so there are fewer lending opportunities, and businesses are keeping smaller deposits.''
Nonetheless, Ms. Parry, who oversaw the middle-market business at Chemical until she left in 1989, said Manufacturers is ''very aggressively looking for new business.'' Among other things, she said, the bank plans to increase marketing efforts and introduce more attractive pricing.
 
LOANS THAT GO SOUR
Though Chemical Bank feels most of its middle-market customers are loyal and solid, it has had its share of loans explode on it.
 The Bronx office writes off about $100,000 a year in bad loans, according to Richard Donatuti, who heads one of Chemical's commercial lending units there. Mr. Donatuti said he personally has written off just $2,000, lent to a silk-screening business that was ripped apart by squabbling.
Among current time bombs are the roughly $500,000 lent to a window manufacturer that branched into installation and, as Mr. Donatuti put it, ''got burnt big-time.'' The company sought protection from its creditors, including Chemical, under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, but Mr. Donatuti is hopeful that much of the money will be retrieved.
Another borrower, a medical supplier, is in Chapter 11 and Mr. Donatuti believes that $25,000 to $50,000 of loans will have to be eaten there.
The office loses some customers in other ways. It recently refused a loan to a supermarket chain because it felt the chain was overextended. Chase gave the money. And when Chemical closed a branch on 125th Street in Manhattan, a plumbing and lighting wholesaler located across the street switched to Citibank, which was more convenient.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Restrained Corporate Political Speech

BYLINE: By S. PRAKASH SETHI; S. Prakash Sethi teaches at Baruch College and the Rochester Institute of Technology. He is author of ''Advocacy Advertising and Large Corporations,'' and ''Handbook of Advocacy Advertising.''

 BODY:
In one of last summer's Supreme Court decision - Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce - the Court upheld a Michigan law prohibiting corporations from using their treasury funds for independent expenditures to advance or oppose political candidates. The case involved an attempt by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce to place a local newspaper advertisement in support of a candidate for state office. The Court held that corporations can engage in political speech only if they use segregated funds, voluntarily collected through such mechanisms as political action committees that accurately reflect the contributors' support for the corporation's political views.
Critics of the decision - including the author of the minority opinion - have been quick to raise the specter of an unwarranted encroachment on free speech. These critics contend that the decision, if left unchallenged, would lead to a further and more pernicious restraint of political debate by other groups, including businesses. 
I believe these concerns to be unfounded. If anything, the Court's decision is a step in the right direction and is in line with its previous decisions regarding free speech.
In 1986, in Federal Election Commission vs. Massachusetts Citizens For Life Inc., the Court gave a bona fide political organization the right to endorse candidates with its own treasury funds. But in this case, it was clear that the members shared the organization's political views. Additionally, in the same decision in 1986, the Court denied such rights to corporations. This set out the doctrine adhered to later in Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of Commerce.
The Michigan decision, in my opinion, adds to free speech rights. In it, the Court affirmed the right of the management to engage in political speech on behalf of the corporation. However, it also wanted to insure that what it called the ''speech attributable'' individuals, the stock holders, for example, do not have their free speech rights taken by others who abrogate those rights by claiming to speak on their behalf.
The primary issue here is the right of the management of a company to engage in political speech as if it were the corporation. The issue also focuses on the extent to which stockholders or members of a particular group have the right to influence political speech made on their behalf by the organization and its leaders.
In the corporate world, real power is controlled by a small group of top managers. These managers most often also exercise effective control over the company's board of directors. The power of shareholders is currently severely limited in influencing management decisions often even in economic areas affecting the shareholder's vital interests. By giving managers the unrestrained right to use corporate resources to express particular viewpoints, the court would be rendering a large group of legitimate owners powerless.
How would the advocates of management's right to speak on behalf of the corporation react if the management were to use corporate funds to advocate the passage of laws that strengthened management's rights against those of the stockholders in the event of unfriendly takeovers? And what if a majority of large corporations were to use their tremendous resources - such as the stockholders' money - to advocate the election of political candidates and the passage of laws that would severely restrict the rights of stockholders in voting out current management?
Morally and legally, would it really matter very much whether these shareholders were ''greedy corporate raiders,'' and that the managers were ''corporate statesmen'' acting to protect the interests of all of a corporation's constituencies? I don't think so.
Institutional investors have demonstrated greater activism in protecting shareholder rights. They should now build upon these successes by exerting more pressure on behalf of First Amendment rights. It would be a tragedy indeed if society were to endow further rights to the management without instituting realistic safeguards.
Corporate free speech under these circumstances would not only abridge the rights of the shareholders, but would also most likely misrepresent the views of the majority of workers, supervisors, and even middle managers, because no efforts would have been made to ascertain their opinions or to act upon them.
I believe that corporations should go beyond the Court-mandated provisions before engaging in political speech. Corporations should create mechanisms for building effective consensus on controversial issues of social policy. They should become more responsive to diverse views of stockholders, other corporate constituencies and public sentiment.
If corporations were to do this, it would give management the legitimacy that is a prerequisite for effective corporate governance. It would also minimize the potential for the enactment of statutes that would lead to greater encroachment on management's discretion. After all, in the real world, there exist high entry barriers into the marketplace of ideas for those without a large cache of money. It is the powerless who need the most protection to exercise their free speech rights. The Court is on the right track.

HEADLINE: Looking for Growth in the Domestic Market

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
At Mr. Micro, a three-store personal computer chain in Dallas, sales of the International Business Machine Corporation's sharp new PS/1 home computer have been brisk. The Texas retailer has sold 200 of the machines since August and its president, Marty Ackerman, says he's looking forward to Christmas.
His optimism may be ill-founded. Both market researchers and computer makers have predicted a new bloom for the home market, and a host of computer makers, including I.B.M., Philips, Tandy and most recently, Apple Computer, have piled into the market looking for new growth. Commodore, which still has 19 percent of the American home computer market, plans to enter the fray later (box). But the ebbing economy may give consumers second thoughts about spending up to $2,000 on a single purchase.
Home computer makers are used to such turns of fate. Fickle consumers bought millions of PC's in the early 1980's, only to mothball them when the fad fizzled. 
But believing the 90's are different, computer companies are plying the market anew, with approaches all aimed at making the machines simpler to use. Analysts say the home market is ripe for growth because people are more familiar with computers than they were in the early 80's and are more eager to use them at home. ''More people are familiar with using PC's at work, and are not uncomfortable with using them at home,'' said Ray Boggs of Biz Cap International, a market research firm in Boston.
According to Donna K. Bonyun, a researcher at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif., 18 percent of all households in the United States now have computers, up from 15 percent for the last three years. Dataquest expects the home computer market to expand by an annual 16.3 percent for the next five years, ahead of the business market, which it expects to grow by 12.6 percent annually.
Adds Ms. Bonyun: ''The home market is very much driven by business applications. Most people who buy a home computer are buying it for some business application.''
Indeed, at Mr. Micro, the largest group of customers for I.B.M.'s PS/1 has been white-collar workers who have been laid off by Fortune 500 companies and need a home computer to prepare resumes or start a business.
But economic uncertainties could put a chill over the consumer electronics market. Creative Strategies Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., conducted two nationwide surveys of 5,000 potential first-time home computer buyers.
The first, taken in June, showed that 1,500 of those called were considering buying a computer. Three weeks ago, almost 60 percent of those 1,500 respondents said they had postponed their plans.
''Sales of the PS/1 are basically stalled,'' said Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies. ''More worrisome, it's going to be stalled going in to the fourth quarter.''
Vowing it has done its homework and learned its lessons, I.B.M. has returned to the home market hoping to avoid a failure of PCjr. proportions.
 
The Lessons at I.B.M.
Once Burned, Twice Cautious
In 1985, the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker withdrew from that market because of the poor response to its PCjr., which was viewed as technically weak and too expensive to be treated as a toy, as I.B.M. had positioned it.
After a cautious three-city introduction in August in carefully chosen department stores, I.B.M. has declared its new PS/1 formula, based on months of market research, a success and has expanded its sales nationwide.
In the PS/1, I.B.M. has tried to create a sophisticated machine that is easy to handle. It has reduced the various choices that come with buying a home computer by putting together a ready-made package: a full-featured machine for the whole family. It has the processing power to handle spreadsheet programs and the graphics capability - I.B.M.'s top-of-the-line high-resolution graphics display is a standard for the PS/1 - to run programs like the I.B.M.-Sears Prodigy on-line service, which allows electronic home shopping and banking.
As much thought seems to have gone into packaging and marketing as into the product design. I.B.M. executives take pride in the fact that the computer comes in a single box. And it is designed to be up and running right after it is unpacked: All models come with a mouse and a modem and, rather than being barren of software, these come with a range of programs, from Microsoft's Works to special communications software which provides a plug into Prodigy.
To take the aggravation out of repairs, I.B.M. technicians can diagnose a system failure over the telephone. If something is wrong, a new computer will be shipped express within 48 hours.
But skeptics argue that by using Intel's 80286 microprocessor instead of a more powerful chip, I.B.M. has limited the scope of its potential market and repeated one mistake that undermined the PCjr. This flaw has led John C. Dvorak, a computer columnist, to call the PS/1 a ''weeny'' computer.
I.B.M. chose the less powerful chip in part because it is after first-time buyers. But critics contend that most current demand is from seasoned users. ''The PS/1 is miscast,'' said Seymour Merrin, an analyst at Merrin Research Inc. ''There are virtually no first-time users buying computers today.''
He warns that the company's statements that the PS/1 is ahead of expectations must be measured with care. The company's reports are based on shipments rather than retail sales. ''They're trying desperately to stuff the channel,'' he said. ''But there is no ground swell waiting for this product.''
 
The First-Time Tandy
Holding Down Cost And Complexity
In these recessionary times, first-time buyers are probably more apt to spend in the $500-to-$700 range on a starter computer than to splurge on a PS/1, which starts at $999 for a bare-bones model.
Of the machines to come to market in the last six months, only the Tandy Corporation's RL series, introduced in July, comes close to this price range. These machines are designed to function more as a home appliance than as a computer - no harder to use than a Cuisinart and just as practical. The company has included dozens of small programs that do useful tasks like calculate interest payments on loans and store information, but require minimal learning.
Priced between $749 and $1298, Tandy's new line has apparently been selling well against the PS/1, its closest competitor in price. Notably, Ed Juge, Tandy's director of market planning, said that the company has seen its best sales in the three cities where I.B.M. has focused its PS/1 marketing: Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas.
The Texas-based Tandy, one of the first personal computer makers, says that in recent months, its personal computer sales have been up 10 percent, largely because of the success of the RL line.
 
The Aging Apple
Replacing An Old Standard
Perhaps no company has more to lose in this new home computer contest than Apple Computer. For more than a decade, the venerable Apple II has been a standard in both schools and the home. But the II has increasingly shown its age - its graphics capabilities pale by today's standards and the computer lacks new software. Apple's share of the low end of the computer market has eroded as a result: Recently, I.B.M. has made impressive gains in sales to schools, which influence home-buying decisions.
Apple's new series of low-cost Macintoshes, introduced last week, is intended to prop up its market presence and be more competitively priced with I.B.M. computers and compatibles. They enjoy greater ease-of-use than either the new I.B.M. or Tandy home machines. Apple's new version of its Mac II, the Macintosh LC, which comes with an inexpensive color monitor, is priced to compete with I.B.M.'s $2,000 PS/1. And Apple's lowest-price machine, the $999 Classic, goes head-to-head with the entry-level PS/1.
Apple projects rapid growth for the home market. It recently told one of its mouse suppliers that the supplier's capacity to produce 250,000 mice per month might not be enough. That would more than double Apple's current sales volume of Macintoshes.
 
OFF IN THE DISTANCE: THE MULTIMEDIA MACHINE
Despite the new wave of home computers, many analysts believe that buyers won't make any purchases until a reasonably priced ''multimedia personal computer'' is developed. Such machines represent the next generation in home computer technology, combining the audio, video and animation qualities of television with the interactivity of a computer.
Most analysts acknowledge that it will be several years before prices for such machines, now $3,000 or more, fall to below $1,000, qualifying them as true consumer products. The holdup? Multimedia machines need expanded storage capacity like that offered by CD-ROM disks, which are still costly.
Yet there are several early attempts to bring together multimedia features in desktop packages. Earlier this year, Philips introduced a top-of-the-line computer based on Intel's 386 processor with a built-in CD-ROM drive that range in price from $1,999 to $2,799.
At the Consumer Electronics Show last summer, Commodore International demonstrated a system known as Commodore Dynamic Total Visionthat may be on the market later this year. The system, which is supposed to retail for less than $1,000, will look like a video cassette recorder and will hook into a television. Instead of a keyboard, the machine will be operated with an infrared remote control device.
The remaining question is whether the most popular systems will connect with the television or the computer. Japanese and European television makers are designing systems that plug directly into televisions. But American computer makers are trying to ward off the trend. Early next year, Tandy and the Microsoft Corporation are expected to unveil a multimedia home computer that will run with computers using moderately powered 286 chips. And I.B.M. is expected to enter the market in 1992.

Electricity From Wind

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
With oil prices rising and concern about the environment growing, alternative ways to generate electricity are becoming even more attractive. Now a company in Livermore, Calif., U.S. Windpower Inc., is developing a wind-powered turbine for generating electricity that according to the California Energy Commission will cost 5.3 cents a kilowatt. This would make the turbine competitive in cost with natural gas, oil, coal and nuclear power, but without the environmental impact. The new turbine has three blades, each 54 feet long, with a rotor diameter of 106 feet, nearly twice that of previous models. The generator has a rating of 300 kilowatts. Unlike previous models, which can be damaged if operated in winds that are too high, U.S. Windpower said, the turbine has an electronically controlled gearbox enabling it to operate safely in high or variable winds. The turbine is designed to produce either AC or DC electricity.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
The Lure of Single-State Munis

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
As budget talks intensify in Washington, investors are diving for cover. But they don't have to stray far from home. The prospect of higher taxes has given new luster to single-state municipal bond funds, which invest in debt issued by a state, its municipalities or agencies.
''Taxes will rise and that fuels the desire for tax-exempt income,'' said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, in Summit, N.J.
In fact, single-state municipal bond funds are the fastest-growing segment of the mutual fund industry. The number of home-grown funds, available in 30 states, has more than tripled since 1985 while assets have increased fourfold to $46.4 billion in June, Lipper said. And experts expect that growth to continue, even in the face of deteriorating municipal finances in various places and the risk that introduces. 
There are good reasons for the popularity of single-state funds: Yields are high, the stock market looks dicey and state taxes are spiraling heavenward. But erosion in some states' economies is beginning to concern investors, so be forewarned: New York and Massachusetts investors, in particular, should keep no more than 40 or 50 percent of their total tax-free portfolio in state bonds, said Christine Carter Lynch, a Santa Fe, N.M.-based money manager and editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, an investment newsletter. Even in better-managed states, she recommends tying up no more than 75 percent of tax-free assets in-state.
Any tax increases translate into better yields for single-state municipal bonds because income earned by most of the funds is exempt from Federal, state and local taxes. In many states, the state-and-local tax tab can run 10 percent or more.
But there are some exceptions. Interest on some or all bonds issued by Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Oklahoma and Wisconsin is taxable to state residents, said David J. Mangefreda, assistant general counsel for the Investment Company Institute. And some states, like Florida and Texas, have no income tax. Despite the fact that there is no tax advantage, investors buy funds from such states because ''people like to invest in bonds that they feel comfortable with,'' Ms. Lynch said. Connecticut, too, has no state income tax, but it levies a stiff tax on interest and dividends. As a result, single-state funds, whose income is tax-free, are extremely popular there.
By contrast, Indiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Utah and the District of Columbia do not tax the interest from any municipal bonds. That means that if you live in those places you get the same tax break from single-state funds as you would from any of the national municipal bond funds, which buy issues of many states.
In New Jersey and New York, interest on municipal bonds issued by those states is tax-free to state residents, but interest on municipal bonds issued elsewhere is not.
When does a single-state fund make sense? To figure the rough taxable-equivalent yield, divide the fund's yield by one minus your combined Federal and state tax rates. Then compare that with yields from another investment. For instance, a New York fund yields 7 percent and an investor in the 33 percent Federal and 7 percent state tax bracket is thinking about buying into it. When that investor uses the formula for approximating yields - 7 divided by 1 minus .40 - the investor sees that the fund's 7 percent yield is roughly equal to a taxable investment yielding 11.6 percent. (The actual yields are slightly less because state taxes are deductible on Federal tax returns.) Because of differences in the quality and maturity of bonds held by the funds, yields vary. So it pays to shop around. For example, the average 12-month yield of the 49 New York funds tracked by Lipper is 6.8 percent as of Sept. 30. But Paine Webber Municipal Classic-New York yields 7.6 percent, while the laggard, the Landmark New York Tax-Free Income, yields only 5.9 percent. The 58 California funds yield an average of 6.7 percent, but Franklin California Tax-Free Income yields 7.5 percent and the three bottom-ranked funds yield only 6.1 percent.
Other considerations: When you choose a single-state municipal bond fund, check its average maturity. The longer the maturity, the more volatile the performance because the price of the bonds in the fund's portfolio can move sharply up or down. The average maturity of the New York funds is 21.7 years, but ranges as high as 28 years for Alliance Municipal Income-New York.
In addition, tightly strained state budgets make it worthwhile to look at the credit quality of the bonds in the fund. In New York, the average fund keeps 27.4 percent of its portfolio in AAA bonds, the highest-rated, but some funds have much more.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
An Economist Kicks the Clouds Away

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
Most economists, looking at the future, are gloomy right now. Not so Mark A. Miles, executive vice president and senior economist at H. C. Wainwright Economics, a consulting firm in Boston. In a conversation with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times, Mr. Miles, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago, outlined his forecast for strong growth in 1991.
Q. What is your forecast for the coming year? 
Mr. Miles: Contrary to most people, we at Wainwright are very, very bullish. People keep asking me, is this another 1973, when we had a recession and oil-price rise? No. I think it is more like 1987, when the stock market plunged but the economy did very well. We see the economy turning around by the end of the year and accelerating into 1992. We could have 3 percent growth next year and perhaps even 4 percent in 1992.
Q. Why are you so bullish?
Mr. Miles: Let's just say it's a minority point of view. But our track record is very good. In the spring of 1981, when we made our official forecast for 1982, we called for a downturn in the economy of 2 percent. We were right. There was a deep recession in 1982. In middle of the 1982 recession, we said 1983 and 1984 would be the best two years since the Korean War. That turned out to be true. When the stock market plunged in 1987, we had already made our forecast for 1988. We said in 1988 growth would be at 4.7 percent, and it was something between 4 and 4.5 percent - pretty close. Everyone else was cutting their estimates because of the stock market collapse. But we said no recession in 1988, and we kept to it. Then, in the spring of 1989, we said there would be a recession - a mild one - in 1990, and here we are. We see 1991 as a typical first year following a recession. It will be led by consumer durables, housing, autos, appliances and retail sales.
Q. What role does higher-priced oil play in your forecast?
Mr. Miles: Ah, oil, that three-letter word. A lot of attention is going to it. That's why people ask if this is like 1973. It's true oil prices are up. But in 1973 other things were up as well. Gold was up, short-term interest rates were up and commodities were up.
But today gold prices are below where they were at the end of last year. Short-term interest rates are below where they were in July. Commodity prices are falling. The question is: Which are the more reliable signals of the economy? History and the data tell us that oil does not tell us whether the economy will grow slowly or more rapidly.
Q. You mentioned gold. What is the price of gold telling us?
Mr. Miles: The fact that gold has not risen like oil, and that other commodities have not risen, means we won't see accelerating inflation.
Q. What kind of a job is the Federal Reserve Board doing right now?
Mr. Miles: The Fed is paralyzed by two of its paradigms. One says raise interest rates because of the threat of inflation, and unless interest rates go up inflation will take off. That assumes higher interest rates are followed by lower inflation, and lower interest rates are followed by higher inflation. That's incorrect. We have found that higher Fed rates are associated with higher inflation rates. The Fed's first paradigm does not square with the facts.
The Fed's second paradigm is that the way to control a weak economy is to allow rates to fall. Our empirical work shows that changes in interest rates are destabilizing to the economy and that they cause the growth rate to flucuate.
Q. What facts do you base your reasoning on?
Mr. Miles: We have been looking at the relationship between interest rates and the economy over the last 40 years. We have been making our own forecasts for the last 10 years. We've been able to pick turning points by abandoning the two paradigms. We simply let the data tell the story.
Ideally, what we would like to have is price stability and a stable economy. We are not likely to achieve a stable economy by shifting interest rates up and down.
That means the best Federal Reserve policy is to focus on stabilizing interest rates, the dollar and prices directly. The traditional way is to hold reserves of gold or other commodities and when the dollar price of gold rises, step in and sell gold and buy dollars. When the price of gold falls, you buy back gold and sell dollars.
Q. Are you advocating a return to a fixed-exchange-rate system?
Mr. Miles: Just go back and look at the post-World War II Bretton Woods economic system. Until the mid- to late-1960's, the dollar was pegged to gold. Other countries pegged their currencies to the dollar, and they were all tied to the American inflation rate. Between 1947 and 1964, America's inflation rate averaged about 1.5 percent a year. Treasury bills averaged less than a 2 percent yield. Price stability was a major componenent in the postwar growth.
What can we in United States do by ourselves? We can stabilize inflation and interest rates in this country and get ourselves back on track. If we then were also to go to an international system where other countries tied themselves into our stability by pegging their rates and currencies to ours, they too could get their economies on track.

HEADLINE: The Baldrige Badge of Courage - and Quality

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The envelope, please. This year's winners are the Cadillac division of the General Motors Corporation, the Rochester division of the International Business Machines Corporation, the Federal Express Corporation and the Wallace Company, a Houston-based distributor of industrial plumbing supplies.
All four are recipients of the most recent crop of Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards, Presidential citations given to companies that have made the greatest strides in improving quality and consumer satisfaction with their products and services.
Initiated in obscurity three years ago, the award has rapidly become a glittering prize for many top executives who see it as an official recognition of their behind-the-scenes efforts to improve quality. ''The Baldrige award has helped rally business around a common objective,'' said John F. Akers, the chairman of I.B.M.
Some quality experts say the requirements to win the award are having an impact on American business that goes well beyond the companies that have actually applied. ''We have sent out 175,000 copies of the guidelines for application this year alone,'' said Curt W. Reimann, an official at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, who directs the program. ''We are defining what quality is for the nation. Companies are using these criteria as a self-assessment tool.'' 
The application forces companies to go through a detailed self-examination in seven categories: leadership, information and analysis, strategic quality planning, human resource utilization, quality assurance of products and services, quality results and customer satisfaction. The number of requests for the guidelines booklet has soared from 12,000 in 1988.
The Baldrige award, named for the former Secretary of Commerce who was killed in a rodeo accident in 1987, is loosely modeled after Japan's Deming Award, which has been presented in Japan since 1951 to recognize achievements in improving quality. The enormous economic success of Japanese companies, based in recent years more on a reputation for quality than on low price, has deeply impressed American managers, many of whom have lost markets to the Japanese.
Ironically, the Japanese award is named after W. Edwards Deming, an American quality specialist whose ideas were eagerly adopted by the Japanese in the 1950's after being largely disregarded at home.
The Baldrige award is now bringing attention back to those ideas. ''I feel good for what it is doing for the United States,'' said Norman E. Rickard, vice president for quality at the Xerox Corporation, a 1989 Baldrige winner. ''When we started in 1982 there were not many places in the United States where you could get information on total quality control.''
Baldrige award winners are required to share their knowledge. For example, Motorola Inc., Westinghouse's nuclear fuel division and Milliken & Company have given dozens of seminars and sent hundreds of speakers to other companies.
Part of the message is the argument that better quality does not necessarily mean higher costs. In fact, it can actually lower production costs, when flaws are eliminated and hence no longer require time and labor to correct. Armand V. Feigenbaum, a quality consultant who heads the General Systems Company, said his studies have indicated that 10 to 40 percent of the total productive capacity of a typical company exists solely to fix or replace poor-quality work.
''The widespread application of Baldrige standards could add 7 percent to the gross national product,'' Mr. Feigenbaum said. He said the figure was based on an economic model of the economy and estimates of the gains from quality improvements.
The Baldrige award program was established by Congress in 1987 when improving quality was moving to the forefront of many corporate agendas. The competition was intended for profit-making corporations in three categories: manufacturing, service industries and small business, defined as companies with not more than 500 full-time employees.
Applicants have to fill out a detailed questionnaire with 33 categories, each weighted with a certain number of points out of a total of 1,000. An example: ''Employee involvement. Describe the means available for all employees to contribute effectively to the company's quality objectives; summarize trends in involvement.'' That is worth 40 points.
The applications are reviewed by a board of examiners chosen largely from industry, but with a sprinkling of academics and consultants. Companies that pass muster on paper are visited by a group of examiners to make sure that what has been described is accurate. A nine-member panel of judges makes the final decision. The awards are limited to two companies in each category.
Although the award is public, most of the proceedings are conducted in secret. The applications are treated as confidential and an outside contractor is used to administer the program; as a result, the records are not subject to Freedom of Information requests. The names of unsuccessful applicants are also concealed.
Organizers defend the secrecy as necessary to persuade companies to reveal information that could be helpful to competitors if made public. ''If you really describe what you are doing, it is going to involve proprietary information,'' said A. Blanton Godfrey, chairman of the Juran Institute, a quality consulting firm, and a member of the Baldrige panel of judges. ''We felt confidentiality was necessary to get people to play the game.''
The organizers also go to great pains to avoid conflicts of interest among the judges. For example, an examiner from the Digital Equipment Company would not be assigned to read an application from I.B.M.
The names of the companies are deleted in the early stages of judging and examiners do not know who else is working on a case until after the first round of ratings. The result, Baldrige officials say, is to insulate the process from commercial or political influence.
''We have devised a process we like to think of as impenetrable,'' Mr. Reimann said. ''Sixteen different people have to render judgment in the average case,'' and the candidates do not know who they are. ''We do not think there is any possible path for company or political influence.''
Cadillac and I.B.M.'s Rochester division are the 1990 winners in the manufacturing category, after failing to make the cut last year. Federal Express is the first to have won in the service category (nobody was deemed worthy last year or the year before), and Wallace is only the second in small business. (The first was Globe Metallurgical, a foundry based in Cleveland that won in 1988.) To John Grettenberger, the general manager of Cadillac, the award is a vindication of the progress Detroit has made recently in catching up with imports in quality. ''For the last four years we have been the top domestic manufacturer in consumer satisfaction surveys,'' he said. ''Now we have a Presidential citation.'' The award noted that Cadillac's warranty had been increased to four years or 50,000 miles from one year or 12,000 miles in 1988, but its warranty related costs dropped 29 percent in the last four years. ''In tests of 1990 and 1991 cars, nearly all models met or exceeded world-class levels for reliability and durability,'' the award citation said.
At I.B.M. Rochester, the Baldrige examiners noted that improvements in quality had translated directly into productivity gains. Revenues per employee increased 30 percent from 1986 to 1989, and the time to develop a new mid-range computer has been cut in half.
Larry L. Osterwise, the manager of the division, said the feedback from the failed 1989 application motivated the company to push harder to improve quality. ''We learned a lot about ourselves through the application and the self-examination it involves,'' he said. One change, he said, was to formalize the procedure for forming problem-solving teams. Another was to focus training programs more sharply.
''Education around here used to be like a college catalogue - you could pick and choose. After 1989 we decided there were things everybody needed to learn in terms of customer needs, defects and benchmarking. Everybody got educated about that in nine months.''
Baldrige winners say the principal benefit of the application process is the internal changes required, not the reward itself. ''The point is not to win a trophy and go back to the old ways of doing things,'' said Jack Roberts, vice president for quality at Federal Express. ''The objective is to change and improve the quality of the service we provide.''
Mr. Roberts said because of his company's rapid growth, older measures of performance, like the percentage of packages delivered on time, have become obselete. ''We are delivering 1,250,000 packages a day. If we have a 99 percent success rate that means we have thousands of customers a day that are unhappy with us. That is unacceptable. Our objective is to drive down the absolute number of failures.''
The award cited Federal Express's use of computers and tracking systems to follow packages and its Service Quality Indicator performance index, which is transmitted to each employee every day. ''Executive bonuses rest on the performance of the whole organization in meeting performance goals,'' the citation noted, adding that bonuses are suspended if employees do not rate management leadership at least as high as the previous year in an annual survey.
Although most Baldrige winners prefer to emphasize the internal benefits, it is clear that winning is good for business as well. ''If you talk to district sales people, you hear stories of them getting their foot in the door to talk about quality and that later led to sales,'' said Sam Malone Jr., a spokesman for Xerox's Rochester quality office.
Indeed, Mr. Grettenberger thinks the award will brighten the outlook of General Motors employees who have been ground down by a decade of market share loss to the Japanese - as well as helping move a few more Cadillacs out of the showroom. ''The great benefit is to the corporation itself,'' he said. ''When you go around the offices and plants you see people smiling again.''
 
A WINNER'S ROAD MAP
The Wallace Company, which is based in Houston, supplies pipes, valves and fittings to the huge chemical and petroleum refining plants that dot the Gulf Coast. Delays in delivering parts can result in the shutdown of major facilities with losses to the refineries counted in thousands of dollars an hour.
So to the $100 million-a-year company - this year's Baldrige winner in the small-business category - fast action is important. The company decided that the quality of its service was a matter of knowing precisely what customers needed and moving on it as quickly as possible.
''We found that the Baldrige criteria were a good road map to where we wanted to go,'' said Michael E. Spiess, a vice president of the family-owned company. ''It was easy to understand, but tough to do.''
The award noted that the company has improved its rate of on-time deliveries from 75 percent in 1987 to 92 percent this year, as a result of programs that emphasized teamwork and training.
Customers are surveyed regularly on the company's performance. And there is a rule that all customer inquiries and complaints must be addressed within 60 minutes.
To insure that parts meet customer expectations, Wallace insists that its own suppliers guarantee products for at least a year. It has cut the number of suppliers to 325 from more than 2,000 in 1987 to weed out those unable to perform.
''We decided to use quality,'' Mr. Spies said, ''to differentiate our business from others in the same field.''
The effort has paid off. According to the citation, sales have grown 69 percent since 1987 and profits have grown more than sevenfold.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Market in Moscow's Future

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
John J. Phelan Jr., the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, made a promise to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the President of the Soviet Union, on a visit to Moscow just over a week ago.
Mr. Phelan, a 35-year veteran of free markets, told the Soviet leader that the New York Stock Exchange would take special note of the opening of a stock exchange in Moscow. A plaque would appear near the urn in the exchange boardroom that commemorates the first trading of Czarist bonds in New York in 1905. And the Soviet flag would fly next to the American flag on Broad Street. 
But Mr. Phelan, on his return from a three-day conference on stock markets, also said that the day of celebration is some time off. Even if limited trading begins in a year and a half, which he thinks is likely, a vibrant and useful stock market in the Soviet Union is a hope for much further in the future.
''They still have only a vague notion of what a market is,'' he said in an interview.
This is important for investors to remember - as well as for officials in the Soviet Union and elsewhere who want to stimulate their economies by selling state-owned companies to the public.
Indeed, proposals for investing in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are multiplying and many will ultimately require an efficient and liquid stock market as the avenue for taking profit. This is true already in Hungary, which recently opened its first stock market. And it will be true for the Soviet Companies Fund, a venture announced last week by Batterymarch Financial Management of Boston and Soviet officials. The fund will invest from $400 million to $1 billion in Soviet companies.
Mr. Phelan said that the first trading in the Soviet Union is likely to begin with notes and bonds. Already, some banks in Leningrad are selling notes at an 11 percent interest rate that could become tradeable. But he also said the Government probably would decide to sell some state-owned companies soon and have that stock traded in the new market.
This will provide important experience. But it is a long way from a small start like that to an efficient exchange in a country where trades that produce a profit are still illegal. Despite all the talk of free markets during the recent conference, Mr. Phelan said, the Soviet officials kept asking, ''When does the state come in to set the price?''
''I am worried that the expectations are greater than what can be produced in the short term,'' Mr. Phelan said. ''Three years to a big, broad liquid stock market is more a hope than a reality. But in the intermediate to long term, I think they can get a market up and do a lot of privatizing.''
The Tokyo market stock rallied last week with the Nikkei 225 index rising 2,090.88 points, or 8.5 percent, to close at 24,481.49. Friday was the most active day of the year: 1.1 billion shares traded hands as investors scrambled to get back into the market. The index is now 24 percent above its low point for the year, which was reached after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the official discount rate was increased by the Bank of Japan.
The reason for the rally is a new confidence riding on the back of the strengthening yen. There is also a hope that as the yen gets even stronger, the Bank of Japan will lower interest rates, which have already fallen slightly. And there are some recent signs that the economy may be slowing a bit, a goal that the bank has pressed in its fight against emerging inflation.
''It is really a turning point for the economy and for the stock market,'' said Akira Suzuki, chief strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. ''As interest rates start declining, the stock market will clearly start recovering.''
But Mr. Suzuki is even a little bolder in his predictions. ''For the coming three to six months,'' he added, ''Japan's equity and bond markets seem the most attractive of the world's major markets in terms of possible currency and price appreciation.''
Given the history of the Tokyo market this year, some investors may be forgiven if they are skeptical. The Nikkei 225, which ended 1989 at 38,915.87, fell 28 percent during the first quarter of 1990 and had recovered only slightly before it began a second slide that accelerated with news of the Iraqi invasion. The market fell a total of 49 percent before hitting its low of 19,781.7 on Oct. 1.
Mr. Suzuki thinks that institutions and individuals who were hurt so badly by the declines will begin to buy again when the Nikkei gets to 25,000, which is only a good day's rally away. And this means, he said, that ''28,000 is an easy target.''
Buyers are already starting to flock to companies that are the natural beneficiaries of a stronger yen and lower interest rates: those with a domestic focus, including the housing and construction sectors, retailing, trading companies and even some banks.
And with a decline in long-term interest rates from their high of 8.7 percent toward 7 percent, Mr. Suzuki sees the market moving to 30,000 and beyond. This would be a rally of 50 percent from the low for the year. But put another way, it would be a recovery of just half of what the market lost this year, which does not seem unreasonable.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
And Now a Blast From the Past: Stagflation!

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Pornography, like beauty, may be in the eye of the beholder. If so, what is happening to the Federal deficit is patently obscene, says Mark L. Melcher, the director of Washington research for Prudential-Bache Securities.
''The deficit-reduction package now working its tortuous way through Congress doesn't even begin to address the fiscal problems facing this nation,'' Mr. Melcher said, as House and Senate conferees grappled with their latest legislative contraption on Friday. 
Moreover, the rosy and unreliable economic predictions from the Office of Management and Budget offer little but comic relief, in Mr. Melcher's view. Tomorrow, the Government will disclose the Federal budget figures for September, the final month of fiscal 1990. Even with the monthly surplus of $19.7 billion that Mr. Melcher expects, the resulting 1990 deficit would approach $222 billion, about what it was in 1986. In other words, all of the deficit shrinkage achieved in the prosperous times since then has vanished. And the threatened recession isn't even here yet, fumes Mr. Melcher.
Nevertheless, the market took heart from weaker oil prices and marked the third anniversary of the crash of 1987 by closing at 2,520.79, 122.77 points, or about 5 percent, higher than the previous week's close and, for the record, about 45 percent above its level on Black Monday.
The rally didn't reassure Edward McKelvey, senior economist with Goldman Sachs. Mr. McKelvey, too, sees a sordid ugliness enveloping the nation in the coming year. He gives it a name: stagflation.
You remember - stagnant economic growth coupled with chronic inflation. That's what Mr. McKelvey and Robert Giordano, his boss and the director of economic research at Goldman, are forecasting for 1991.
Now, an economy with anemic consumer demand and declining prices for real estate and many non-oil commodities would not seem to be an obvious candidate for an attack of stagflation . But Mr. McKelvey notes that the nation's factories are near full capacity and unemployment is still relatively low - factors he sees as putting upward pressure on production costs without easing demand.
And Washington isn't helping either with its budget proposals, he adds. ''The tilt toward excise taxes and user fees, without meaningful cuts in fiscal spending, does create an inflationary bias to this particular package,'' Mr. McKelvey said.
To be fair, the Goldman team is not absolutely certain that the economy is due for a siege of stagflation. It might not be that lucky. ''All the routes that avoid stagflation lead to recession,'' Mr. McKelvey said. ''There's no significant upside here.''
He added, a bit wistfully: ''What you'd really like to do is to live in the O.M.B.'s post-1991 world, where inflation is low and growth is strong and you just melt the budget out of existence.''
Unfortunately, in his view, you just can't get there from here.

HEADLINE: TV VIEW;
Jesse Jackson Courts the Viewer/Voter

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the once and probably future Presidential aspirant who has lately taken up journalism, has quickly climbed the heights of the profession. Since the last Sunday in September, he has presided over a syndicated hour program called, yes, ''Jesse Jackson.'' The title is accurate. Mr. Jackson narrates the documentary passages, leads the panel discussions, puts questions to members of the studio audience and occasionally addresses the television camera, for instance, when announcing a pause for a commercial. He does not personally deliver the commercials for products, but causes are another matter. In New York, at 9 P.M. on Channel 11, the program finds itself up against Fox's popular ''Married . . . With Children'' and has not been doing nearly as well as Mr. Jackson did in the 1988 primaries. 
The journalist-advocate holds a respectable place in the history of American press and television, from the muckrakers to Edward R. Murrow, and like those estimable predecessors, Mr. Jackson stands with the little guys against the big shots. Retired politicians have also been known to transform themselves into journalists of a sort, Edward I. Koch, lately Mayor of New York, being a conspicuous recent example. But Mr. Jackson may be the first active seeker for the Presidency to devote himself to journalism more or less full time between elections, which raises questions about his intentions. Is he simply putting the image won in politics to the service of his new career, or is he using the new career to advance the old one?
For example, was his journey a few weeks ago to Baghdad, where he was granted an interview with Saddam Hussein and allowed to return to the United States with a planeful of released Americans, an example of journalistic enterprise, a humanitarian act or a political ploy? Given the significant place that Mr. Jackson has attained in American public affairs, such questions become inescapable, and in his current television endeavor, he shows little disposition to avoid them.
The panels on ''Jesse Jackson'' have more than the customary complement of minority participants, and the subjects come straight from the agenda of his Rainbow Coalition: the plight of American Indians, expressions of prejudice against blacks by Japanese officials, the threat of a cut in Federal student loans, with particular attention to the effects on blacks. This week, it's ''environmental racism.'' Compared with what often passes as subject matter on ''Oprah'' and ''Donahue,'' these are serious concerns, deserving of a public hearing. What the public gets to hear on ''Jesse Jackson,'' however, is mostly on one side of the case, and everybody knows which side.
Mr. Jackson promised that his opening program, on the clashes between groups of Indians and soldiers and police in North America, would expose ''the shameful conditions of native Americans in the United States.'' Newsreel footage shows Canadian soldiers being confronted by Indian women and men whom Mr. Jackson calls ''Mohawk warriors.'' Mr. Jackson, who says that he visited the scene of the Canadian confrontation with ''other journalists,'' is seen holding a press conference in which he calls, in his imitable way, for moving past ''face-saving to life-saving.'' An instance of a journalist covering his own performance. Indian spokesmen review the history of betrayal by American officials and of continuing designs by mineral and energy companies on their ''sacred burial grounds'' and on other land that they say is like a mother to their people. Words like ''genocide'' and ''holocaust'' are applied.
Much of this was effective. The Indian leader Russell Means in particular got across the point about the casually dismissive national attitude toward Indians by offering a possible sports-page headline, ''Washington Redskins Scalp the Chiefs.'' Why not, he asked, have the Cleveland Jews playing the Washington Negroes?
So the case was made, but Mr. Jackson, the journalist, evidently could not come up with any hard questions for his Indian guests, for example, about the quality of leadership on some of the relatively well-to-do reservations. He knew whose side he was on, so why complicate matters?
Perhaps if the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs had accepted the invitation to send a representative, the discussion would have picked up, but to judge by the second program, that is doubtful. It began with an apologetic appearance by the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Ryohei Murata, who was repeatedly pressed by Mr. Jackson and his other guests to compensate American blacks for the discriminatory words and actions. Mr. Jackson called for ''a summit meeting'' between Japanese ministers and black businessmen to discuss ''economic reciprocity.'' It was like sitting in on a lobbying session.
Similarly, the discussion about a threatened cut in college loans was weighted with opponents of the cuts. Representative Carl D. Pursell, a Michigan Republican, who served as straw man on the four-person panel, said that he would rather cut defense spending and assured the panelists that nothing approaching the $2 billion reduction in college loans referred to by Mr. Jackson was going to be made. But nobody seemed to be listening. The Congressman's main point was only that the budget crisis required reductions in all areas. ''Do you mean students should bear the burden?'' asked the moderator but did not pause for a response. So much for discussion.
Mr. Jackson did better in last Sunday's program about the commercialization of college athletics, particularly in a prison interview with Charles Thomson, the former University of Oklahoma quarterback who has been convicted of selling cocaine. But most of Mr. Thomson's account of a star athlete's life (whisky, women and other perks) had already been publicized, and Mr. Jackson had his customary difficulty in getting his panel (two coaches, a football player and a sportswriter) to carry on a conversation that went much beyond the obvious. The segment was filled with sloppy runs and wild passes. Mr. Jackson's own contributions sometimes fumbled: ''The students who in fact are generating the resources are scandalized for asking for money.''
The premise in every case is that the host knows where justice resides and conversation is orchestrated accordingly. His efforts at getting straight answers on the matter of defaults on student loans were largely ineffectual, but his questions to high school students in the studio showed where his interests really lay. ''If student aid is cut,'' he asked a black girl, ''can you go to college?'' That would be difficult, she replied. The same point was made in a report on another black student who needs aid to attend college. The attractive youngsters were being set against faceless political forces, a common television device.
So ''Jesse Jackson'' is more advocacy of a standard sort than journalism. But there are other reasons, mainly having to do with Mr. Jackson's style, why it does not make for exhilarating television. The speaker who can be so rousing on a political platform turns out to be stiff in the studio; his dully written narration of the hour's documentary segments tends to be muddy, diction not being his strong point.
The set, a bare-looking table and some bleachers, seems to have been put together on the cheap, and his encounters with his studio audience, which he conducts like a schoolteacher, have little spontaneity. Most disappointing, he is proving himself a weakish interviewer, willing to settle for canned statements when they suit his predilections.
Perhaps ''Jesse Jackson'' the program will help to keep Jesse Jackson the politician in the public eye. But so far, like a star athlete who does not perform all that well in the classroom, he has not demonstrated much affinity for the journalist's calling.

HEADLINE: SOUND;
Some Loudspeakers Reward the Bargain Hunter

BYLINE: By Hans Fantel

 BODY:
In the present economic climate, budget crunching has become a favorite exercise wherever you look. Audio is no exception. These days, even formerly profligate audiophiles wonder how to shave costs without cutting quality - or, as one of them puts it, to be frugal without being stingy.
This leads to a search for components offering exceptional dollar value. Not always the cheapest - for cheap goods are just that and no bargain at any price. Rather, the quest is for those rare items that manage to match - or at least approach - performance levels normally found only in costlier models. The next several columns will conduct a bargain hunt for just such products. 
Starting with loudspeakers seems a good idea, for it is among speakers that one encounters the greatest diversity of design, the widest range of prices and, on occasion, the least correspondence between quality and price. The latter is what we are looking for: models that sound a lot better than their price would indicate.
There are plenty of overpriced loudspeakers, some of them good. But to find a good underpriced speaker takes persistence and lots of listening. Even so, it can be done, and here are a few examples, including some less-known brands that deserve to be more widely heard.
For example, a Canadian company called PSB, based in Pickering, Ontario, has lately gained broader distribution in this country precisely because its speakers offer outstanding sound at prices below par. Even the least expensive model in the company's line - the PSB20MKII, listing at $225 a pair - has the natural, spacious sound that marks all PSB designs, and even its bass response is highly creditable for its compact dimensions of 13.5 by 8.5 by 6.3 inches.
But perhaps the best bargain offered by PSB is its Model 50-MKII. This is a floor-standing speaker priced at $550 a pair that hints at no compromise. Its sonic depth, warmth and detail are rarely matched in this price range, and even massively orchestrated music sounds natural and convincing. In their overall sonic character, PSB speakers resemble the better British brands. They achieve clarity without overdue brightness. There is no aggressive edge to the sound. The music is all there, but it doesn't shout about itself.
Another winning combination of tonal merit and dollar value is to be found in B.I.C.-Venturi speakers, made in Stow, Ohio. Its Model V62 is certainly one of the best speakers to be had for under $100 ($199 a pair), and the elegance of the cabinet, with its beveled corners, belies the low price. Its sonic balance suits all kinds of music, classical as well as popular.
Listeners favoring a somewhat more pronounced treble to bring out the percussive detail in popular music should also audition the Mordaunt-Short MS3.10 ($229 a pair). It is notable for being able to project extremely clear sound at comparatively high volume levels - something rare among small speakers in this price class.
Boston Acoustics of Peabody, Mass., has long been a standby for audio bargain hunters in search of speakers with a natural tonal balance. These designs are happily free of the acoustical tricks frequently used to dramatize the sound. At $260 a pair, the Boston Acoustics A60 Series II has become something of a classic among budget models, while the Model T830 - at $500 a pair - sets a fine standard of performance in the midprice range.
Getting ample bass from low-cost speakers has always been a problem. In this respect, Pinnacle Loudspeakers of Hauppauge, N.Y., has achieved wonders with its patented version of a bass reflex enclosure. It features interior ducts, angled within the enclosure in a way that extends the lower range. As a result, a small speaker like the Pinnacle PN-5+ ($179 a pair) yields far deeper bass than is normally heard from a small, inexpensive speaker. By the same design principle, the company's larger PN-8+ (19 by 12 by 12 inches, $399 a pair) manages to reach to the very bottom of the musical range, with audible output down to the lower depths at 30 Hz.
Even though these speakers' main strength lies in the lower part of the tonal spectrum, their upper range is more then adequate and agreeably smooth. For listeners wanting lots of low sounds at low prices, the Pinnacle may be tops.

HEADLINE: Suriname, in Army's Ever-Tighter Grip, Skids From Tranquillity to Turmoil

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARAMARIBO, Suriname, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Ten years after he overthrew the elected Government in this once-peaceful land, the former sergeant who is now commander of this country's small army is using violence to keep control of the country, Surinamese civic and human rights leaders and foreign diplomats say.
Under Comdr. Desire D. Bouterse's orders, the human rights leaders and diplomats say, Suriname's army has been responsible for scores of murders of perceived opponents and has razed villages. At the same time, he is fighting a guerrilla insurrection that has hastened the flight of Surinamese from this former Dutch colony to the Netherlands, the United States and neighboring French Guyana. In the last year alone, diplomats estimate that 10 percent of the population of 400,000 fled.
Commander Bouterse's military control continues despite elections held nearly three years ago in which a coalition of civilian politicians won 95 percent of the vote in defeating a party allied with the army. The result was seen as an overwhelming rejection of Commander Bouterse's nationalistic railings against the Netherlands by a people who have long been South America's most prosperous but who, under military rule, had grown accustomed to mysterious disappearances, widespread shortages and skyrocketing inflation. 
With its small population, abundant production of bauxite and alumina, and a massive aid program from the Netherlands, Suriname was the economic envy of South America throughout most of the 1960's and 70's.
 
President Declines Interview
But when the Dutch interrupted their aid in 1982 after the army executed 15 critics, and bauxite markets collapsed, this country fell on a period of hard times from which it has never recovered.
The President, Ramsewak Shankar, and Vice President, Henck Aaron, declined to be interviewed or comment on the political situation, an attitude that some say reflects their insecurity.
Dr. Artie Jesserun, a member of the National Assembly and rising star of the Mr. Aaron's National Party of Suriname, advocates gradually increasing political and civilian pressure on the military.
''It appears on paper that we have a powerful President, but he has no power,'' he said in an interview. ''The legislature also has no power. The power is with the army. They have the guns and they have shown their readiness to use them.
''We are slowly moving to the point where we will have an eruption,'' he added. ''In the coming months or maybe years, there is going to be a stronger movement to force democratic change and nobody will be able to stop it, even if it takes time to build.''
Since losing the 1987 elections, diplomats say, Commander Bouterse, a voluble 45-year-old former sergeant major and physical education instructor, has replaced his fatigues with linen suits, fine leather boots and designer sunglasses, while steadily working to block government initiatives in areas as diverse as peace talks with guerrilla forces and plans for economic restructuring. At the same time, Commander Bouterse's men have set out to silence critics.
In the last year in particular, observers say, the intimidation has grown steadily bolder, as the 3,000-member army sparked a spree of brazenly violent incidents. They included attacking the police in drive-by shootings and assassinations and using telephone threats against ordinary citizens.
 
Army Role Denied
Commander Bouterse declined to be interviewed, but Army Chief of Staff Badresseein Sital denied any army role in the violence and intimidation. He said the military was forced to become more assertive because the Government had become ''a helping hand to neo-colonialism.
''International notions of democracy and the codes and rules - that doesn't apply here in Suriname,'' Commandant Sital said in explaining why the army has repeatedly overruled the civilian authorities. ''Whether in bringing peace or development, the Government has not respected its commitment to the Surinamese people. It is the responsibility of the army to correct that.''
Last fall Commander Bouterse, irritated by criticisms of his refusal to abide by a Government peace plan to stop a four-year jungle insurgency by Maroons - descendants of slaves who escaped Dutch plantations in the 17th century - warned in a speech that his men would soon begin ''raising pitbulls'' to quell his opponents.
 
Human Rights Leader Attacked
The threats materialized in December when a hit squad launched a 3:30 A.M. attack on the home of the country's leading human rights advocate, E. Stanley Rensch.
Mr. Rensch, a soft-spoken 50-year-old, said he fled out the back door as his house was being sprayed with gunfire and eventually escaped to the Netherlands. Explaining his return to the country last week, which quickly prompted renewed threats, he said, ''Everyone interested in justice here must take risks.''
Also in December, on the anniversary of the 1982 torture and execution in military custody of the 15 civilian critics, the national courthouse was burned down, destroying almost all of the country's legal records including, many critics say, documents that might one day have been used against Commander Bouterse in matters ranging from those killings to persistent reports of army involvement in cocaine trafficking.
Officials in the Netherlands, quoted in press reports, have estimated that more than 60 percent of the cocaine that reaches their country is smuggled by Colombian cartels via Suriname.
In March, Ronny Brunswijk, the leader of the Jungle Commando, the Maroon insurgency fighting to topple Commander Bouterse, visited the capital for government-sponsored peace talks. During discussions at Commander Bouterse's office in army headquarters, according to police accounts that the army does not deny, two of Mr. Brunswijk's bodyguards were shot dead at point-blank range. Mr. Brunswijk himself was held for several days before a threat by his rebels to blow up a huge hydroelectric dam forced his release.
The killing of the bodyguards, seen by many here as an act of uncommon treachery, generated sympathy for Mr. Brunswijk in this ethnically diverse capital, which had previously regarded the guerrilla leader as a Maroon fighting solely for Maroon interests.
 
Police Inspector Murdered
In an interview, Army Chief of Staff Sital called the killing of the bodyguards ''a normal act,'' saying that the Jungle Commando were terrorists.
Perhaps the most traumatizing of all recent events, however, was the murder in August of the country's chief police inspector, Herman Gooding, a crusading lawman who was investigating charges of involvement by senior officers in cocaine trafficking.
In response to the murder, most businesses closed for a day and a handful of protest groups formed and were quickly able to mass 10,000 people in the streets to denounce military abuses and call for government action.
The police have remained on strike ever since, holed up at their union headquarters where they have barricaded surrounding streets. Most streets are without policemen, though the military police have begun to undertake some of their tasks.
But with the Jungle Commando on the defensive and the police marginalized, many residents here have begun to despair that the army can be brought under control with outside assistance. They speak of many possibilities ranging from a full-blown invasion to disarming the army to providing increased training and support for the police.
Because of their strong emotional ties to the Netherlands, many Suriname residents look to that country to save them. The recollection of an incident in 1969, when Dutch marines landed in the Netherlands Antilles island of Curacao to put down a political uprising and looting, offers hope to those wishing some sort of intervention.

And Now the Hard Part: Making Hussein Give In

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Eleven weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Administration officials still appear determined to confront President Saddam Hussein, but they are discovering just how difficult their policy is to sustain and showing some signs of anxiety about how the crisis will be resolved.
''It was a lot easier to see how to get into this thing than it is to see how to get out of it,'' a senior Administration official said.
While the officials acknowledge that recent diversions - from the budget debate to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in Jerusalem - have sapped some of the momentum of their anti-Baghdad policy, it does not appear to have drained their resolve. Interviews with senior policy makers indicate that they still do not want a face-saving way out for President Hussein and are steadily building up military power in the Persian Gulf to convince the Iraqi leader that he has only two choices: stay in Kuwait and risk the destruction of his army, as well as his Government in Baghdad, or leave and survive. 
While officials have never expressed it in public, convincing the Iraqi leader that those are indeed his only two choices is the key to their strategy. Officials believe that while economic sanctions might be a necessary condition for persuading the Iraqi President to pull out unconditionally, they probably are not sufficient. There is no modern historical precedent for economic sanctions inducing one country in a conflict to engage in unconditional surrender. The sufficient ingredient, officials say, is the credible threat of the Iraqi Government's destruction.
 
Bush Sees Soviet Expert
Washington's rejection of any partial solutions, and the stark choices it is offering Baghdad, were conveyed personally by President Bush on Friday to a Soviet Middle East specialist, Yevgeny M. Primakov. Mr. Primakov came to brief Mr. Bush on his visit to Baghdad two weeks ago and his lengthy discussion with President Hussein. American officials are hoping that Mr. Primakov, who has known Saddam Hussein for 20 years, will, one way or another, relay that message back to Baghdad.
But officials concede that while their objectives remain the same, the events of the last two weeks have underscored for them how difficult they will be to achieve. Diversions from the Israeli-Palestinian dispute have preoccupied the State Department, and shifted the focus of world attention. Behind-the-scenes tussles with the French over how harshly to condemn Israel at the United Nations has sown doubts among policy makers as to as to how much Paris can be counted on in the pinch.
More and more anxiety is being expressed by Congress about the potential for thousands of bodies coming home from a gulf war, and more and more lawmakers are saying aloud what they only whispered two months ago. As the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, put it during last week's budget debate: America is in the gulf for one reason and one reason only: ''O-I-L'' - and that is not something parents are anxious for their sons and daughters to die for. Finally, the distraction of the budget problem has diverted President Bush's attention and made it impossible for him to devote as much attention to the gulf crisis as he did a month or two ago.
''Oh, the good times are over,'' remarked Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. ''It was exciting to land all that equipment over there and watch the buildup, but now that they are there and nothing is happening and we didn't scare Saddam and we may now might have to fight him, and then the Israelis got into the middle - well, we are all starting to become a little anxious. It means we may soon face the hideous choice of pull out or go in, and George Bush has not really prepared the American public for this choice.''
 
A Different Phase Now
Adminstration officials acknowledge these sentiments, but insist that many of them were the natural product of the gulf policy moving into its second phase, which they always said would require patience. The first phase of the policy involved moving troops to Saudi Arabia, raising billions of dollars in support from allies, building an international coaltion against Iraq and imposing United Nations sanctions. One dramatic headline followed another, and the American public barely stopped to calculate the costs.
Now that the policy has shifted into its second phase - seeing whether the sanctions and the military buildup are working to change Iraqi conduct - it is understandable that people would get bored and nervous.
For now, Administration officials do not appear perturbed enough by these diversions and strains to feel that their policy has been derailed. In fact, they point out that the Iraqis have just announced gasoline rationing, citing this as a sign that the sanctions are really beginning to hurt.
Rather, a senior official said, they view the events of the last two weeks as ''a warning signal'' about the dangers of a policy built largely around coercing Iraq through diplomatic and economic sanctions, which could require months or years to have an effect.
The lesson that they appear to be drawing is that they must take a variety of steps in the United Nations to refocus attention on Iraq, and its destruction of Kuwait. But they also must start thinking more seriously about what sorts of military measures, short of war, they might be able to take to persuade President Hussein that the alternative to his unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait is destruction of his leadership.
American officials acknowledge that despite the large-scale troop buildup in the gulf, their intelligence assessments, which Mr. Primakov confirmed, indicate that the Iraqi leader is still not convinced that Mr. Bush is ready to sacrifice American boys to drive him out of Kuwait.
Getting that point across is not easy. Administration officials identify with a point that the strategist Thomas C. Schelling, in his classic work, ''Strategy of Conflict'' makes: In a crisis, if one side looks too controlled, too disciplined and too sensitive to arguments and counterarguments, then it lacks credibility with its adversary.
Mr. Schelling wrote that if a man is in an car and playing a game of chicken with another driver coming at him, the best way for him to convince the other driver that he must move aside first is if he starts the race by throwing out the steering wheel of his car. This apparently irrational act will have the rational effect of convincing the other driver that he has no choice but to change course.
Administration officials concede that one of Mr. Bush's main problems today is that he appears too moderate and controlled, too much part of an international coalition, to be able to convince Mr. Hussein that his only options are to stay and die or leave and survive.
As an important policy maker put it: ''Unless the sanctions have a greater impact on Saddam then they have up to now, we will have to make the military threat more credible in order to convince him to settle now through diplomatic means.''

Amid Preparations, No One Can Say When War Might Break Out or End

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Two and a half months after American forces were sent to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, military commanders and political officials are finding it difficult to assure achievable goals in an ambiguous conflict whose outcome they cannot easily control.
In interviews over the last three weeks, American, Saudi and European military and political officials have pointed to the growing realization that if war comes, its human, economic and political costs are likely to be high.
They say there is little prospect of winning a neat ''victory'' in such a conflict and that its consequences for the region and for the United States could prove severe.
''We can retake Kuwait and hit the Iraqi Army hard,'' said an American official. ''But what happens after that is hard to say.'' 
At present, American and other forces are engaged in a steady military buildup designed to accompany growing diplomatic pressure on Iraq.
 
Testing Iraqi Defenses
Barring unexpected developments, American officials say they do not forsee a war beginning for at least two months. They add that the United States and other countries are likely to seek further United Nations backing before initiating any military attack.
American forces are not yet fully deployed in the desert here and a British armored brigade is just arriving. In the air, American jet fighters are testing Iraqi defenses by flying at the border and recording the signals of Iraqi radar - but pilots say the Iraqis often foil the exercise by refusing to turn on their electronic equipment.
In the midst of such martial preparations, no official can say with assurance when war may begin, nor how and when it might end.
American military planners and political analysts here run countless scenarios - all of them possible, none of them certain. Officials say prediction is difficult because of shifting alliances and sudden developments in a Middle Eastern region that is inherently unstable. American planners say they have yet to decide if their goal is simply to liberate Kuwait, or to destroy the Iraqi military, Iraqi weapons factories and the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, as well, perhaps by sending a multinational force to occupy Iraq.
There is little doubt that the forces here can retake Kuwait and destroy much of the Iraqi army and air force. But there are grave doubts about the costs of occupying Iraq and the future of a defeated Iraq.
 
The Ideal Scenario
Saudi and American officials say war with Iraq may deepen the identity crisis Arab societies have been suffering for decades as they confront a period of threatening change that many see as spurred by Western societies they both admire and fear.
''The way we win will be as important as winning itself,'' said an American diplomat here. ''We have to think about Iraqi and Arab reaction to a humiliating defeat at the hands of the United States.''
American planners admit they cannot predict the reaction of the Iraqi people to an outside attack, especially the reaction of the country's Shiite Muslim majority.
Several diplomats said the ideal scenario would be to force an Iraqi withdrawal that brings the downfall of Saddam Hussein. But they admit there is no assurance of this and no certainty that a more mainstream leader would replace him.
Uncertainty is heightened by the possibility that Iran or Syria might invade Iraq to seize disputed territories, or that Iraq's long-abused Kurdish people will rise up and demand a state of their own.
 
New Terrorism Expected
There also is a realization that American and civilian casualties may well be high in a war of rockets, heavy armor, poison gas and possibly biological weapons. The Western hostages held in Iraq may die. Leaking poison from bombed Iraqi chemical plants may kill civilians.
American officials have sought as much Arab participation as possible in the military force that may attack Iraq. But so far Arab states have sent minimal troops, increasing the political exposure of American, British and French forces sent here.
There appears to be a possibility that American forces could find themselves used by Arab states in a regional feud that, but for the importance of oil, appears distant from traditional American concerns. This is a region dominated by rigid military dictatorships and Arab monarchies.
In the event of war, American planners expect a new wave of terrorist strikes against American and European targets. They say they fear American embassies could also be attacked in several Arab countries, especially Jordan.
''The American Embassy in Amman will probably burn,'' one American official said.
Several diplomats said they feared further polarization between Israel and the occupied Palestinian population it controls. If Iraq were to attack Israel, American officials say, the conflict could easily widen to include other Arab countries, threatening the present alliance against Iraq.
It is a scenario that causes planners here particular concern. Faced with Arab demands and the need to assure future oil supplies, American and international pressure may grow on the Israeli Government to negotiate autonomy for the Palestinians.
Saudi, Kuwaiti and American officials say war with Iraq will redefine attitudes toward the defense of oil reserves and the Persian Gulf states that hold most of them.
It appears likely that a multinational force will remain, backed by a security pact aimed at imposing a degree of stability in a long-volatile region where Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia will continue to vie for influence.
For the United States, the crisis has the makings of a defining experience for a troubled and economically weakened superpower finding its way in a post-cold-war world that it will strongly influence, but not dominate.
American officials and troops express bitterness that of all the nations arrayed against Iraq, it is the United States that will likely bear the greatest burden - in blood, in dollars and perhaps in ideals.
Despite much talk of Arab allies and international censure of Iraqi aggression and loss of oil supplies, Arab, European, Asian, African and Latin American participation in the alliance against Iraq is minimal.
Many nations of these other regions are more dependent on Gulf oil supplies than the United States. But most of their armies have remained safely at home. Even Saudi Arabia, by far the most threatened state, has reacted to the crisis in part by trying to pretend that life is normal.
While divisions of Americans are here to defend this kingdom, most Saudis appear to assume that their affluent lifestyle will go on much as before, secured by booming oil profits and millions of imported foreign workers.
Frank and opinionated in the way of young Americans, the more than 200,000 American troops deployed in this region are outspoken in interviews about their concern that their lives not be spent in a war whose goals are not clearly defined and not fully supported by the American people.
In more than 200 interviews and conversations in distant desert bases, on sun-baked tank turrets, at jet fighter take-off lines and inside maintenance hangars, the American men and women sent here by their President constantly ask what it is they are expected to do and whether their countrymen support their mission.
Citizens of a strongly ideological nation, they are imbued with an ethos of democratic liberalism, intensified by the Manichean American sensibility of a world divided into good and evil.
 
Prospect of Broken Illusions
American troops become visibly uncomfortable when discussing the thought that they are here to defend low oil prices and the near-absolute monarchies that dominate Saudi Arabia and most other gulf states.
Discussions with soldiers stationed in the desert here makes it apparent that the political cost of broken illusions or large American casualties in a treacherous war is likely to be high, both for President Bush and for the American people.
Faced with such daunting and unpredictable futures, it is not surprising that many American and Saudi officials say they hope Iraq withdraws from Kuwait, avoiding a wider war.
Saudi officials say that if Iraq were to withdraw, Saudi Arabia would back American, British and French demands that Iraq pay large war reparations, or face indefinite sanctions and a naval blockade.
But if Iraq does not begin a complete retreat sometime in the next two to six months, every official interviewed said, there will be no alternative but to fight.
''President Bush and the United Nations have said Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait,'' said a senior American official here. ''If Saddam Hussein does not comply, then yes - there is going to be a war.''

Poor Nations Worried by U.S. Payout in Gulf

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 19

 BODY:
A plan by the United States to use about half of the roughly $22 billion it hopes to raise toward the costs of the Persian Gulf crisis to pay for American military operations there is causing increasing concern among developing countries and aid experts, diplomats and United Nations officials say.
The American proposal would leave enough money to meet the needs of the three ''front line'' developing countries bearing the biggest share of the cost of United Nations sanctions against Iraq and occupied Kuwait - Turkey, Egypt and Jordan.
But other developing countries, which are also seriously affected by sanctions, complain that there will be no money for them if the United States takes so much. As a result, some want the oil-exporting countries to distribute more of the roughly $150 billion a year they will receive in windfall profits from the gulf crisis if oil prices remain at present levels, these officials say. 
Developing countries with oil of their own, like Mexico, Algeria and Nigeria, have so far prevented third-world countries from formally asking the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a bigger share of this windfall. But Egypt and Kuwait's government-in-exile are considering asking this year's United Nations General Assembly to urge rich countries to give more aid to poorer nations affected by the sanctions.
 
Treasury Declines Comment
The United States Treasury now hopes to raise about $22 billion from the world's richest countries to help pay the costs of the gulf crisis this year and next, United Nations and other officials say. The Treasury this week declined to comment on the estimate.
The aid is being sent directly from the donor countries to the recipients. But the flow is monitored by the Gulf Crisis Coordination Group, which comprises representatives of the major aid-giving nations.
Saudi Arabia is expected to provide $8 billion, Kuwait $4 billion, Japan $4 billion, the European Community $2 billion and Germany $2 billion. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will lend affected countries $2 billion more.
United Nations officials say the Treasury now plans to use about $1 billion a month over the next 10 months to pay for American military operations in the gulf, or about half the total contributed by donor countries. Japan and Kuwait have already earmarked half their contributions for the American military effort.
This will leave about $12 billion for the three front-line countries, which are expected to suffer $12 billion to $14 billion of economic damage in 1990-1991 as a result of lost exports and remittances from workers in the gulf as well as from higher oil prices.
The cost of the crisis for Turkey is estimated at $5 billion over this period. The figures for Jordan and Egypt are $4 billion and $3 billion respectively.

Jordanian Economy Devastated by Effects of the Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The port of Aqaba is still. Tourism, which brought in more than half a billion dollars last year, has evaporated. Fruit and vegetables intended for export are rotting at the border.
As punishment for its criticism of the presence of American troops, Saudi Arabia has cut off oil. Of the more than $2 billion pledged by Europe and Japan to countries affected by the Persian Gulf crisis, only $4 million has been received here. 
Jordan is facing an economic catastrophe of such enormity, said Crown Prince Hassan, that the political stability of the country may be in jeopardy.
 
Country in a Double Bind
''If there is a war we are lost, but if there is no peace and this crisis continues we are also lost,'' the Crown Prince said in an interview. ''Even the United States says we are scrupulously implementing the United Nations sanctions, but we are still being penalized by Saudi Arabia and the West. Jordan is being pushed into the Iraqi camp, into an extremist frame of mind.''
There are no discernible shortages in Amman, and the shops and restaurants are crowded. But the confrontation in the gulf is having a devastating impact on the economic underpinnings of this country of 3.5 million people.
Jordan's traditional markets - Iraq and Kuwait, which accounted for 30 percent of its exports - have been lost because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the United Nations embargo on trade with Baghdad. Saudi Arabia, its other major market and the country that could have compensated Jordan for the loss of Iraqi oil and trade, has shunned Amman.
Jordan has tried to adopt what it sees as a neutral stance: condemning Iraq's invasion and carrying out economic sanctions against Baghdad while criticizing the presence of foreign troops and trying to avert a military clash. But in Riyadh's view King Hussein of Jordan has been acting like a lawyer for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq - making the best case for his actions and giving his brutal Government a human face.
 
A Billion-Dollar Loss
According to the latest Government figures, by the end of the year Jordan is likely to lose more than a billion dollars in revenue - at least 30 and possibly as much as 50 percent of its anticipated gross national product.
Remittances from Jordanians and Palestinians working in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, expected before the crisis to total some $730 million, will decline by $320 million. By Oct. 11, official statistics show, 133,149 Jordanians had returned from the gulf. Because many fled Kuwait without money or possessions, they will cost the Government an extra $300 million in social services this year, the Government said.
The drain of returning Jordanians on the country's scarce resources would have been far greater, Crown Prince Hassan said, had Israel not agreed to waive its regulations and permit some 40,000 Jordanians who lived on the West Bank before working in the gulf to return to their homes in Israeli-occupied territory.
Finding jobs for returning Jordanians here is extremely difficult, given the rate of unemployment, officially 20 percent but by some estimates closer to 40 percent.
''We are really the second victims of the gulf crisis,'' said Ziad Fariz, the Minister of Industry and Trade. ''All of our economic sectors have been hit.''
 
Trucks Carry Furniture Home
Mr. Fariz said Jordan's truckers, who once formed a major industry, have been reduced to transporting the furniture of Jordanians fleeing Kuwait to Jordan.
Early in the crisis, Jordan was accused of violating the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq. This week the United States was permitted to station monitors at the Jordanian-Iraqi border to inspect truck cargo to see whether Jordan was enforcing the embargo.
''So they opened the trucks and found furniture,'' Crown Prince Hassan said. Then, he said, the British also wanted to inspect cargo.
''We told them that the day of high commissioners and viceroys are over,'' he said. ''The degree of humiliation is clear.''
Foreign aid has also been affected. Some $300 million of assistance to Jordan provided by Iraq and Kuwait has vanished. Jordan currently receives only one major form of assistance from Iraq: oil. Amman is not paying Baghdad for it, but is crediting it against Iraq's $310 million debt to Jordan at a rate of $16 a barrel. While that is far below the current market price, the United States and other countries in the alliance have not objected, aware that without that oil, Jordan's economy would collapse.
 
Restrictions on Cargo
Tawfiq Kawar, president of the Jordanian Shipping Agents Association, said in an interview that Saudi Arabia was attempting to restrict all shipping through Aqaba, not just cargoes bound for Iraq. Some 200 containers destined for Jordan were waiting in Jidda, unable to find ships to transport them, he said. In the past few days, he said, Riyadh had begun delaying ships bound for Aqaba to pick up cargoes of Jordanian phosphates, the country's major export. Along with potash, shipments of phosphates are expected to suffer a 50 percent decline, roughly $250 million.
Mr. Kawar said that exorbitant war-risk insurance rates coupled with arbitrary inspections that delayed shipments to Aqaba between one and 12 hours had resulted in a 75 percent decline in cargo unloaded at Aqaba.
To service its $8.4 billion debt, Jordan will need roughly $500 million dollars by the end of the year, said Hans Heino Kopietz, a London-based Middle East analyst who recently visited Amman. He estimated Jordan's cash reserves at about $170 million.
A senior official said, ''We have absolutely no idea where the rest of the money will come from.''
Jean Ripert, a former United Nations official, recently completed a report after a four-day mission to Jordan for Javier Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations Secretary General. Mr. Ripert concluded that Jordan's economy might collapse next year if greater amounts of foreign aid were not immediately forthcoming.
''Something has to happen,'' Mr. Ripert was quoted as saying in Friday's Jordan Times. ''Such a country will not survive unless something happens in the region.''

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSION;
Thousands March in 16 Cities to Protest U.S. Intervention in Gulf

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
Thousands of people rallied in New York and 15 other American cities yesterday to protest the United States' military buildup in the Persian Gulf. It was the largest demonstration against the American presence in the gulf since President Bush first sent troops after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Similar rallies were held in other nations, including Australia, Canada, England, Italy and Panama, said rally organizers from the Manhattan-based Coalition Against the U.S. Intervention in the Middle East. 
 
'Won't Fight for Texaco'
In Manhattan, a parade of marchers six blocks long wound its way through midtown before rallying at Times Square in the late afternoon. Many chanted, ''Hell no, we won't go; we won't fight for Texaco'' or ''Money for peace, not for war.''
The police estimated the crowd at about 5,000; marchers said there were more than 25,000. The march was peaceful, with three arrests on minor charges reported.
The march included contingents representing students' groups, Vietnam veterans, senior citizens, Palestine Liberation Organization supporters, labor groups and homeless people from Manhattan's Lower East Side. There were 10 military reservists, including two who have been called for active duty and have refused to go.
Former United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who formed the coalition, was joined at the head of the march by Michael Moore, a documentary film maker. There were speeches before and after the march, including two by the military reservists now considered absent without leave.
Stephanie Atkinson, 23 years old, of Murphysboro, Ill,, joined the Army Reserves six years ago to pay for college, she said, and was called to active duty in Saudi Arabia last week. ''I believe in the economic sanctions and in honest negotiations, not war,'' she said. ''If I have to go to jail, I'll go.''
Organizers said they began planning for the march after a speech by Mr. Clark on Sept. 13 at Cooper Union drew 2,500 to an auditorium that seats 1,000.
Leo Brody, a retired typographer who came from Long Island with about 20 other retired men and women, said: ''Isn't this proof that the people are not 100 percent behind Bush?''
Mumtaz Hussein, a Pakistani whose mother now lives in Kuwait, said many Kuwaitis supported Iraq's invasion. ''They are happy that the oppressive regime is removed,'' he said. ''My mother's family has been there 20 years and they've had no rights there. We would be happy if the same thing happened to Saudi Arabia.''
Mr. Clark told the marchers that the turnout was ''terrific.'' ''I hope they're listening in the White House,'' he said.
In Washington, 125 people rallied at the White House to demonstrate against the deployment. The White House declined to comment on the demonstration.
The Manhattan rally was the largest. Organizers said about 1,000 marchers gathered in San Fancisco, 200 in Cleveland, 200 in Boston and 100 in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: MALAWI CRITICIZED BY A RIGHTS GROUP

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The Government of Malawi, one of the larger recipients of United States economic and military aid in sub-Saharan Africa, has been harshly criticized in a report by a human rights organization for the killings of political opponents, intolerable conditions in overcrowded jails and ethnic discrimination.
''Although many states in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from greater political violence than Malawi, there are fewer African countries with such a combination of totalitarianism and personal despotism,'' concluded the assessment on Malawi issued this month by Africa Watch, a group based in London.
Much of the 116-page report, which reviews the 26-year rule of President H. Kamuzu Banda, concurs with last year's State Department report on human rights in Malawi, a sliver of land in southern Africa that is miserably poor and, because of an almost total ban on foreign reporters, largely forgotten.
Like Africa Watch, the State Department pointed to the murder of a leading political dissident; the death in prison, apparently from torture, of a Government official suspected of leaking information, and the use of arbitrary detention to suppress any sign of dissent. 
 
U.S. Criticizes but Gives Aid
But Africa Watch points to what it calls the inconsistency between the declared interest of the United States in human rights and its policy of increasing economic and military assistance. Unlike other black-ruled nations in the region, Malawi has maintained formal relations with South Africa and thus has been praised by the Bush Administration for being a ''reliable partner'' in Southern Africa. The Government has also been lauded by the United States for admitting nearly 800,000 Mozambican refugees, the largest concentration in refugee-laden Africa.
This year, Malawi was rewarded with $21.5 million in United States economic aid, up from $18 million in 1987, and was one of the handful of African countries to receive military aid. American officials said the military help of $2.2 million, nearly double the 1989 assistance, was to be spent on M-16 rifles, grenade launchers and training.
In detailing human rights abuses in Malawi, Africa Watch said those arrested in the 1980's without charge and still in jail included the country's only neurosurgeon, Dr. George Mtafu and its best-known poet, Jack Mapanje.
The organization said Fred Sikwese, the principal protocol administrator in the Ministery of External Affairs, was arrested in February 1989, apparently because he was suspected of leaking information about Malawi's relationship with South Africa.
When his family visited him at Lilongwe Prison a month after his arrest, he was weak from lack of food and possibly from torture, the report said. He died in prison shortly after the visit. The authorities refused to give his body to his family for burial, the report said.
 
Exiled Journalist Slain
A Malawian journalist living in exile in Zambia, Mkwapatira Mhango, died after a firebomb attack on his home in Lusaka last October. The circumstances of the attack point to Malawian security guards in Lusaka having carried out the attack, the report said. The Malawian Government has said the deaths had been the result of internal feuding within the Malawian opposition.
Describing a police shooting in March this year, the Africa Watch report said 20 protesters were shot dead in Lilongwe after city residents threw stones at a convoy of armed police. The report said that the shootings were not mentioned in the heavily censored Malawian press but that two senior police officials were dismissed after the incident.
The Africa Watch report said it did not agree with suggestions by the State Department that there was little ethnic discrimination in Malawi. The organization said President Banda, a member of the Chewa ethnic group from the central region of the country, had practiced a policy of ''systematic exclusion of people from the northern region, as well as Yaos from the southern region, from political power.''
A system of limiting educational opportunities for northerners, who have traditionally excelled at school and at the national university, was introduced three years ago, the report said.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Recent Crises May Help Cause of European Unity

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Caught off guard successively by the collapse of Communism, the unification of Germany and the Persian Gulf crisis, the 12-nation European Community is now using all three surprises to give new momentum to its search for greater economic and political unity.
The eventual shape of this unity is still the subject of intense debate, with Britain among the countries determined that it should not lead to anything resembling a United States of Europe or even a loose federation of nations with its capital in Brussels.
Yet the events of recent months appear to have convinced most community governments that they must accelerate their step-by-step approach to integration if the region is to emerge as a major economic bloc that can play a major political role in the world.
German unification has provided new impetus for what is known as economic and monetary union, a daring concept that includes establishment of a single European currency and central bank as a follow-up to the existing plan to create a single regional market by the end of 1992.
But in political terms, the gulf crisis has proved even more of a watershed. ''The gulf crisis has become a test of how the community responds to world events,'' one community official said. ''It has been a great definer of where it can work together and where it cannot.'' 
Prompted by embarrassment at having to rely on the United States to defend its vital interests and criticism of its disorderly military response in the weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the community now seems ready to start coordinating its foreign and defense policies.
''We thought for a long time that a common foreign and security policy would be more difficult than economic and monetary union,'' France's Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, noted recently, ''but it seems that we now have better prospects for political and security union.''
At a summit meeting in Rome next weekend, community leaders hope to set the stage for the complex negotiations necessary to turn these two objectives into reality. And while it is still unclear where they will lead, fears that the community had lost its way now seem to have evaporated.
 
Threats Become Opportunities
''What at one point looked like threats to the community have now turned into opportunities,'' one French Government official said.
The formal negotiations will take place at two parallel conferences on economic and monetary union and on political union that will open in Rome in December and aim to complete their work before the single European market begins operating in 1993.
But already next month, when a 34-nation summit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is held in Paris, the community hopes to demonstrate to the United States, the Soviet Union and other countries that it is well equipped to serve as the principal pillar of the new Europe.
Earlier this year, it decided it could best do this by not immediately inviting in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. Rather, while Britain favored ''widening'' the community, the majority preferred ''deepening'' it in the sense of speeding the integration of the existing 12 members.
A primary objective in this was to anchor a powerful united Germany to the West, something that was considered more likely if Germany was required to make immediate commitments to further European integration than if it emerged as the dominant force in a looser regional arrangement.
 
Germany's Role in Europe
As it happened, eager to appease European anxieties about Germany's new strength, Chancellor Helmut Kohl enthusiastically embraced this approach, repeatedly insisting that he wanted to see ''a European Germany and not a German Europe.''
The single voice of dissension remains that of Britain's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who has warned that she will not accept a single European currency and, after Bonn and Paris proposed new steps towards political unity in April, that Britain will cede no further sovereignty.
Preparations for the Rome conferences have nonetheless continued. And while disagreements over the timing of economic and monetary union have emerged, with Germany and Spain cautioning that it should not be rushed, only Britain still disapproves of the final objective.
Earlier this month, though, Britain took a major step toward its community partners when it brought the pound into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, thus tying it to other regional currencies and, in effect, fulfilling one of the prerequisites of monetary union.
Since then, Mrs. Thatcher has insisted that Britain's economic policies will never be decided by the European Commission, the community's executive branch, which is based in Brussels. But more than ever, other community governments seem determined to move ahead with or without Britain.
The only important change in the plan presented last year by Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, seems likely to be that the clock for economic and monetary union will now start on Jan. 1, 1994, rather than one year earlier.
 
Effect of the Gulf Crisis
Until the Gulf crisis, in contrast, the French-German initiative on political union had lost momentum. In June, European leaders approved the idea of a conference on this subject to make amendments to the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which created the original six-nation Common Market.
But while Italian, French and even German leaders spoke poetically of an eventual federation, it soon became apparent that the conference itself would probably limit itself to strengthening such institutions as the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the European Commission, without moving toward what might ordinarily be understood by political union.
With the gulf crisis, though, the focus changed drastically, exposing the community as an economic giant with a weak political voice and no military power and challenging the 12 members to look afresh at their role in the world.
Specifically, while the community quickly denounced the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and imposed a trade embargo on Baghdad, it was prevented by its own charter from coordinating the region's military response or even from discussing military matters.
The immediate result was that although Britain joined the United States in a multinational force protecting Saudi Arabia, and France independently sent troops to the gulf, it took three weeks before a nine-nation group called the Western European Union, which had long been moribund, provided a regional umbrella.
 
The Debate Intensifies
But since then, the debate about political union has intensified, with Italy, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the community, proposing that the Western European Union be absorbed by the community. A former British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, has even argued that a coordinated defense policy could lead to creation of a European Army.
On the other hand, Britain and France, Western Europe's two nuclear powers, favor less drastic changes. Yet it was Mrs. Thatcher who first criticized Europe's slow reaction to the gulf crisis, while President Francois Mitterrand of France has long favored a European security role as an alternative to full dependence on the United States.
Community experts said that with different approaches to a coordinated foreign and defense policy still being discussed, no major decisions were expected next weekend. For example, several governments are eager not to be seen weakening the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. There is also the unresolved question of how Ireland's neutrality should be handled.
Yet, in an area that was out of bounds only a few months ago, there is already a consensus that where common political and security interests are at stake, community members should be ready to work in unison.

HEADLINE: Ecologists' Foe to Become Amazon Governor

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Hoisting the banner of an Amazonian backlash against ecologists, Gilberto Mestrinho likes to boast, ''I wasn't elected by the trees.''
Instead, it was the voters of Amazonas state, the heart of Brazil's Amazon, who elected Mr. Mestrinho Governor on Oct. 3.
Most of Brazil's governorship races face runoff votes Nov. 25, but Mr. Mestrinho won handily on the first round. His landslide was partly because of his 35-year experience in state politics and his popular opposition to ''foreign ecologists.'' 
''The center of ecology should be man,'' the Governor-elect said in an interview in his penthouse apartment by a beach here. ''Ten million people can't be condemned to die of hunger so the animals and trees can grow.''
As he views the world, foreign ecologists are working in league with foreign business interests to bottle up the Amazon's tremendous wealth in timber, furs, minerals and oil.
''As soon as the satellites showed that Amazonia is the richest mineral province in the world, immediately the movement started that the Amazon is untouchable,'' said the 62-year-old Governor-elect, whose fans have nicknamed him ''Boto'' after the Amazon River porpoise.
''Behind the environmental movement, there are economic interests who fear that economic development of the Amazon would risk investments made in other parts of the world,'' said the man who will govern Brazil's largest state, an expanse almost three times the size of France.
''Most trees in the Amazon are rotten with termites and fungus,'' Mr. Mestrinho continued. ''We should cut and replant with better species.''
One logging restriction adopted this year requires registration of all chain saws with the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Renewable Resources, known as Ibama.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Mestrinho won whoops and hollers with bellowed promises to ''throw abusive Ibama agents in the clink.''
''In Canada, Finland and the United States, people use chainsaws,'' he in Rio de Janeiro. ''Why do our people have to go back to axes?''
He also proposed that Brazil legalize a long-established practice in the Amazon, hunting for meat and for pelts.
''The world consumes 7 million alligator skins a year - that's $7 billion,'' he said. ''If the industrialized world is against it, why don't they prohibit the use of skins?''
In a rare point of common ground with ecologists, Mr. Mestrinho said he would promote ''green tourism'' -ecological safaris for foreigners. In one boost for Amazonian tourism, President Bush is to start a Latin American tour with a visit on Dec. 2 to Manaus, capital of Amazonas state.
''It's very positive that Mr. Bush is coming,'' said the Governor-elect, who takes office in Manaus on March 15. ''It's very important that outsiders get to know the reality of the Amazon.''
 
President Backs Ecologists
Pushing a traditional, aggressively pro-development stance for the Amazon, Mr. Mestrinho may find that attitudes have changed since he last left the state governor's offices, in 1987. Brazil has a growing ecological movement in the nation's industrialized south and a new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, who is committed to limiting environmental damage. ''Weird proposals'' the Rio daily, Jornal do Brasil, recently said of Mr. Mestrinho's views. ''Old conceptions about the forest and ecology - a grab bag that not only goes against good sense, but even sounds like a joke.''
In Brazil state governments need to get along with Brasilia to receive federal funds, and it is doubtful that Mr. Mestrinho will get far with his ''forest improvement'' schemes.
Indeed, within four days of Mr. Mestrinho's election, the president of Ibama, Tania Munhoz, slapped a mining company with a $1 million fine, a record environmental fine for a mining operation in Brazil. She then fined a lumber company $1.9 million, a record for a lumber operation in Brazil.
Asked for his reaction to the raids in his state, Mr. Mestrinho snapped, ''Absurd exhibitionism.''

HEADLINE: BEIJING AND SEOUL SIGN TRADE ACCORD

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 20

 BODY:
China and South Korea agreed today to exchange trade offices, a move that the Seoul Government hopes will eventually lead to the establishment of diplomatic ties.
China has close relations with its hard-line Communist ally, North Korea, and Chinese maps still depict an undivided Korean peninsula with its capital in the north. But over the last few years, South Korea's stunning economic development has captured the interest of a growing number of Chinese scholars and officials, both because they would like to duplicate the growth and because they would like to attract South Korean investment. 
The signing of the agreement today, at a ceremony in Beijing, will lead to the formal opening of representative offices before the end of this year in each capital. Formally, the offices will represent the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation, but they are also empowered to issue visas and handle consular affairs.
 
Embassies Not Mentioned
Officially, Beijing's position is that while the offices are necessary to facilitate growing trade, they will not lead to an exchange of embassies. To reassure North Korean officials, the agreement today was disclosed in a four-sentence dispatch by the New China News Agency, and no senior Chinese officials attended the ceremony.
''It is believed that this will promote nongovernmental trade and economic and technological cooperation between China and South Korea,'' the press agency reported.
China and South Korea originally considered exchanging trade offices in 1988, but hard-liners in Beijing objected that any Seoul representative office should be allowed only in coastal Shandong province rather than in the capital. The exchange was further delayed after the military crackdown in June 1989, when one of the architects of improved relations with Seoul - Bao Tong, secretary to the Politburo - was dismissed and arrested.
The rise of the hard-liners led to closer ties with North Korea, whose orthodox Communist President, Kim Il Sung, sought commitments from Chinese leaders that they would not go too far in building relations with Seoul. Mr. Kim is believed to have made a secret visit recently to China to ask Chinese leaders to delay any exchange in trade offices, but his appeal was apparently rejected.
 
Indirect Trade
In addition to a small amount of direct shipping between South Korea and Chinese ports such as Lianyungang, indirect trade through third countries exceeded $3.2 billion last year. That compares to trade with North Korea of less than $600 million each year.
South Korean companies in recent years have poured into China to look for investment opportunities, and some South Korean-financed joint ventures have begun manufacturing refrigerators, drugs and other products. Conglomerates from South Korea also donated millions of dollars to Beijing for the Asian Games several weeks ago, and a few South Korean companies have opened offices in Beijing - normally using the names of subsidiaries registered in the United States.
Yet many South Korean executives complain that despite their investments, they still have been treated as second-class citizens and since the crackdown, there appears to have been a cooling of their enthusiasm to do business with China.

HEADLINE: Here at Last, Killer Bees Are Met With a Yawn and a Snigger

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESLACO, Tex., Oct. 19

 BODY:
There is no talk of killer bees at Andy's Cafe 2 here, no panicked calls to the City Hall in nearby Alamo, not even a mention of the bee invasion in The Beeville Bee-Picayune.
But over the next few years, the Africanized honeybees will have a dramatic impact on beekeepers and agriculture as they cause a reduction in both honey production and pollination. And their long-awaited arrival here in the Lower Rio Grande Valley this week set off speculation about possible effects on everything from lawsuits to wearers of beeswax-based hair replacement systems.
Still, after years of films like ''The Swarm'' and ''Saturday Night Live'' skits of John Belushi in killer bee regalia snarling, ''Your pollen or your wife,'' the bees' arrival has been something of a welcome anticlimax.
''Here in the valley, people have been anticipating this for so long, people are just sick of hearing about it,'' said Dave Mayes, with the department of agricultural communications at Texas A&M University. ''People know more about the bee, and their anxiety level has decreased.'' 
 
A 3,000-Bee Swarm
The relaxed response is likely to change as the bees become more prevalent and as stings are reported. Beekeepers view them as a serious threat to the $150 million in honey produced in the United States annually and to American agricultural products, worth nearly $10 billion, that bees help pollinate.
Still, when the first swarm of aggressive bees finally buzzed into Texas, their debut played out here much as their spread across the country probably will - an epochal event for beekeepers and a real, but minor, risk for the general public.
Officials from the United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Thursday that a 3,000-bee swarm of Africanized honeybees was found and then destroyed Monday in one of the department's pulp-paper traps about a mile north of the Rio Grande.
The discovery means that 33 years after African bees were inadvertently let loose in Brazil, the aggressive strain has entered the United States.
Although the Africanized bees' sting is no worse than that of other bees, the bees are extremely aggressive in defending their hives and have the potential to attack and sting in angry swarms.
There are no precise figures on fatalities. The Government of Mexico says at least 16 people have been killed by the bees there in the past three years, and some experts estimate that 700 to 1,000 people have been killed by stings since 1957, when the bees escaped from a Brazilian breeding experiment and started heading north at about 200 miles a year.
 
'I Just Read Past It'
For the most part, the bees' arrival in South Texas was met with yawns.
''I saw it in the paper, but I just read past it,'' said Jesse Delgado, manager of Andy's Cafe 2, a popular Mexican restaurant. ''No one has even mentioned it.''
A hotline set up to give out information on the bees received only about 15 calls, most from nervous residents who wondered if hives near their homes could contain the Africanized bees.
But John Thomas, a Texas A&M entomologist, said some people are so panicked by the thought of the bees they are in a constant state of anxiety about their arrival.
''I still get calls, primarily from elderly widows, wanting to know when it's going to get to Corpus Christi, or when it's going to get to Houston, and how far north it will go,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''They want to sell their home and move to St. Louis or Kansas City or Chicago before the real estate market crashes because of the bee panic in San Antonio.''
In Houston, Tom Magliaro of Tom Magliaro's Hair Additions, says he worries that Africanized bees might attack the 60 to 80 clients of his who have used beeswax to attach new hairs to thicken existing ones in thinning areas. He raised the specter of a terrified client driving along in a convertible with a three-pound swarm of Africanized bees chasing his hair. The New Pet Rock? In Beeville, where President Bush goes for his annual South Texas hunting trip, Jeff Latcham, general manager of the Bee-Picayune, said his paper found the state of the oil industry and the town's imperiled Naval Air Station more newsworthy than the bees' arrival 200 miles to the south.
When the subject was raised, Mr. Latcham joked that the bees might provide an economic opportunity for the town, which, it turns out, was named not for the insects, but for Col. Bernard E. Bee, President Sam Houston's Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas.
''Maybe we should figure out a way to make some money off the bees, like the pet rock,'' he said. ''Maybe we should have a commemorative stamp and mail it from Beeville.''
Experts say a more telling test of the public's reaction will come in a year or two when, inevitably, there is a stinging incident.
The incident this week ''was totally controlled,'' said Anita Collins, Research Leader with the United States Department of Agriculture's honey bee research laboratory here. ''Eventually, there will be one where someone is stung severely or dies, and that will be more difficult.''
Still, experts say that even when the bees arrive in greater numbers the risk of a fatal sting will be less than that of being struck by lightning. In 1987, the last year for which figures are available, 99 Americans died after being hit by lightning and 53 died from stings by bees, wasps and hornets, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
 
An Industry at Risk
For the bee industry, the risks are far more immediate and real.
''The arrival of Africanized bees in the U.S. is probably one of the biggest things that has ever happened to U.S. beekeeping,'' said James Tew, an entomologist at Ohio State University who puts out a beekeeping newsletter called Apiculture Awareness.
The Africanized bees are harder to work with, produce less honey, and are of less use in pollination, experts say. In Mexico, beekeepers reported a 20 percent reduction in honey production in areas infested with Africanized bees. Officials say the United States beekeeping industry could face annual losses of $26 million to $58 million after the arrival of the bees, if no effective steps are taken to limit their spread.
And some say the bees bring an added hazard: the potential of dangerous swarms of aggressive lawyers.
''Handling the bees wouldn't be the big problem,'' said Orley Taylor, an entomologist at the University of Kansas. ''Handling the interaction with your neighbors would be the problem. We're a very litigious society, and the biggest problem associated with Africanized bees as far as I'm concerned is the potential for litigation.''
 
Accepting the Inevitable
Beekeepers hope that the bees will lose some of their ferocity as they move north and breed with other bees, though there is little evidence that this has happened in the past. Instead, their main hope is that by carefully managing their hives, being sure, for example, that they are stocked with European queens, bee keepers will limit the impact of the Africanized bees.
''In Texas, the beekeepers have accepted that it's coming, and we have to deal with it,'' said Glenn C. Mace, president of the Texas Beekeepers Association. ''We're going to do our best to maintain European stock in our hives. It'll take a little more time and labor, which translates to money, but I think we can do it.''
For the entomologists who flocked to the hackberry tree near Hidalgo where the bees were found this week, the discovery was as much a source of excitement as a threat.
''Bees are far more interesting than most of the people we know,'' said Mr. Thomas of Texas A&M. ''They sting, they die, and they laugh all the way to the grave.''

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTION: Political Memo;
In '90 Races, Abortion Is Not the 'Silver Bullet'

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
A year ago, the abortion issue roared across the political landscape like a rough midsummer storm.
After the Supreme Court gave states new latitude last summer to restrict abortion, candidates reeled and panicked over the issue, elections seemed to turn on it, and both parties scrambled to adjust to the suddenly awakening power of the abortion rights movement.
Today, in the midterm elections of 1990, the politics of abortion looks more complicated, more subtle and, at a time of crisis in the Persian Gulf and economic turmoil at home, less dominant than it did in the fall of 1989.
This is not to diminish the political impact of Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Court's decision in July 1989 that galvanized the abortion rights movement. Abortion is a central issue in many elections this fall, from the race for governor in Florida to the race for Senate in Iowa. Support for abortion rights is now widely considered a net advantage for a candidate, while it was often considered a liability in the pre-Webster era. 
 
No Longer the Magic Issue
''Am I more prone to talking about being pro-choice this year than I was six years ago?'' asked Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who was dogged by abortion protesters in his 1984 campaign. ''Absolutely.'' Mr. Harkin, a Democrat in one of the most competitive Senate races this year, is running many commercials on radio stations across Iowa that compare his support for abortion rights with the anti-abortion stance of his opponent, Representative Tom Tauke.
In North Carolina, Harvey Gantt, a Democrat, has been highlighting his support for abortion rights in his challenge to Senator Jesse Helms. And in Florida, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Lawton Chiles, has recently begun to contrast his stance with that of Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican and staunch abortion opponent. Some Democratic strategists argue that support for abortion rights could make the margin of difference in several of these close races this year.
Still, a variety of analysts and politicians agree that the abortion issue is not the magical ''silver bullet'' it seemed to some in 1989, when L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia built his successful campaign for Governor around it. Even Kate Michelman, the executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said: ''Right after Webster, it was the issue that was moving politics. Now it's become part of a global political framework.''
 
Distracted by Thoughts of War
Part of this, perhaps, reflects a diminished sense of threat among people who support legal abortion. The wholesale changes in state abortion laws that were widely predicted after the Webster decision have yet to materialize. ''The focus has shifted, the world hasn't changed overnight and women aren't being imprisoned for talking about this,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican poll taker working for candidates on both sides of the issue.
And this year, unlike last year, the abortion issue is competing with the issues of war and the threat of recession. Shelly Bain, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League in Iowa, said, ''There's a lot going on in our economy and in our world to take people's minds off abortion.''
The politics of abortion is also becoming more complex, more nuanced. In 1990, the issue seems much less partisan than it did in 1989, when Democrats who supported abortion rights squared off in Virginia and New Jersey against Republicans who opposed abortion. This year, to the relief of many Republicans, a combination of serendipity and strategy has blurred party lines.
First, the serendipity: Some of the highest-profile races this fall involve Republicans who support abortion rights, including Senator Pete Wilson in the California governor's race and Jim Edgar in the Illinois governor's race, as well as the Senate campaigns of Representatives Claudine Schneider in Rhode Island, Lynn Martin in Illinois and Pat Saiki in Hawaii.
 
Keeping the 'Big Tent' Up
The governor's race in Kansas pits Joan Finney, a Democrat who opposes abortion, against Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican who supports abortion rights. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Gov. Bob Casey, a Democrat who opposes abortion, is being challenged by Barbara Hafer, a Republican who supports abortion rights.
Republicans have tried to highlight this diversity since the '89 elections, with Lee Atwater, the national Republican chairman, depicting the party as ''a big tent'' with room for differing views on abortion. This is a very different message from the party's 1988 platform, which is firmly anti-abortion and committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized it.
The ''big tent'' doctrine has filtered down to the states, with varying degrees of grumbling on both sides. In Iowa, for example, incumbent Gov. Terry Branstad is a staunch opponent of abortion who spent two hours at the Iowa Right to Life convention in Waterloo last week, participants said. But he has picked as his running mate a Republican woman, State Senator Joy Corning, who supports abortion rights.
 
No Waffling
Democrats say the Republicans have only managed to postpone the moment when they must decide where the party truly stands. Republicans might have finessed the 1990 midterm elections and the appointment of a Supreme Court justice, David H. Souter, who won confirmation without stating his views on Roe, but they cannot finesse the 1992 platform, Democrats say.
''I think probably the best political fight in America will be how the Republicans deal with their platform on this issue in 1992,'' said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker who works for the National Abortion Rights Action League.
Still, politicians in both parties are becoming increasingly adept at managing the abortion issue. ''We did do a lot of study on this, and tried to do a lot of training,'' said Mary Matalin, chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. ''But the main contribution I think we made was the big picture one, which is to make candidates understand that this is a character issue, and if they treat it as such, they'll be O.K.
''If you waffle on a character issue, then that defines your character, and you just draw attention to a fatal flaw that people loathe in their politicians,'' the Republican official added.
 
Exaggerated Importance
Abortion opponents, who say news organizations exaggerated the power of the abortion rights cause in the 1989 elections, say they are confident they will more than hold their own this year. ''I think we're going to do very well in some of the races that the pro-abortionists had picked that they thought they were going to win, like the Texas governor's race, the Ohio governor's race,'' said David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee.
In the meantime, the politics of abortion continues to play out. In Iowa, for example, Don Avenson, the Speaker of the Iowa House, won the Democratic nomination for governor in large part because of his support for abortion rights. But his stand has not been enough to overcome Mr. Branstad, according to an Iowa Poll in The Des Moines Register last week, which showed the Governor, a strong abortion opponent, with a considerable lead.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTION;
Usual Flurry of Election Ads on Television Becomes a Blizzard This Year

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
Feeling overwhelmed by political advertising this year? There's a reason: Candidates and their consultants say they are bombarding the electorate with more political advertisements than ever before.
Spending for televised political commercials in the first half of 1990 was almost 34 percent higher than in the first six months of 1988, a Presidential election year, according to the Television Bureau of Advertising. While much of that can be attributed to the inflation of advertising rates, some consultants say they have been producing and broadcasting 20 percent more commercials than in past campaign cycles.
Candidates, consultants and media-buying specialists say there are several reasons for the proliferation of political advertising, including these:
* A ruling by the Federal Communications Commission in September forced broadcasters to stop charging premiums for political advertising on television, lowering costs below the projections made at the beginning of the year and giving campaigns an unexpected boost to their treasuries, which many are using to increase their advertising volume. 
 
* Voters are tuning out political advertising more than ever because of competition for their viewing time from cable television, videocassette recorders and advertising clutter, forcing campaigns to double the number of times that people must see an advertisement before its message sinks in.
* An increase in press scrutiny of political advertising has, paradoxically, given campaigns more source material for negative commercials.
* Candidates are fearful that if they do not react immediately to negative charges made in their opponents' spots, they will go the way Gov. Michael S. Dukakis did in the 1988 Presidential campaign, when he failed to combat George Bush's attacks.
 
'You've Got to React'
''Mike Dukakis taught everybody a lesson,'' said Hank Morris, who is creating commercials for Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic nominee for governor in California. ''You can't let anything go. You've got to react.''
Because of what one Republican consultant, Adam Goodman, called ''Dukakis-induced paranoia,'' candidates are parrying each other's advertisements much more quickly and much earlier in their campaigns. Their ability to take an advertisement from idea to air within 24 hours - in the past, a practice that was used only in the final weeks of a campaign - is now being used months before Election Day.
Quick responses have become such an apparent need that some consultants say they have created and broadcast advertisements in six hours, hastening the process by beaming them off satellites and sending them to television stations on the campaign trail.
An advertisement by the campaign of Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, featured articles clipped from newspapers charging Mr. Schuette with ''attack ads'' and ''distortions.'' The commercial underscored one of the paradoxes of this year's campaign: increased scrutiny of political advertising appears to have fueled more negative ads by providing material for campaign messages that attack an opponent's commercials.
This year more than a dozen major newspapers are trying to assess the truth or falsity of political commercials, some in boxes that quote the text of the advertisement and try to judge its veracity.
In the last month alone, newspaper articles critical of an opponent's advertising have been featured in commercials for Senator Levin; Bruce Morrison, the Democratic candidate for governor in Connecticut, and Harvey Gantt, a Democrat who is challenging Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. Windfall From the F.C.C. A candidate's ability to react has been abetted by a cash windfall, courtesy of the F.C.C.
By law, television stations are required to charge political candidates no more than the lowest rate they charge their best commercial customers, who receive discounts for buying time in bulk. But commercial advertisers generally buy ''pre-emptible'' time, knowing that if an advertisement is bumped it can run at other times.
Stations have interpreted the lowest-rate rule as requiring them to charge politicians low rates only for such pre-emptible time. But the candidates' spots must run before Election Day, so they are forced to buy fixed time, whose rates the stations are free to set.
In July the F.C.C. raided television and radio stations in five cities, seizing the records they are required to keep on political advertising sales. In September the commission issued a report saying that at almost all the television stations, political candidates paid far more than commercial advertisers for advertising. At one station, which the F.C.C. did not name, mainstream advertisers paid an average of $2,713 for a 30-second spot; candidates, on average, paid $6,000.
The commission affirmed that stations must charge politicial advertisers no more than they charge commercial advertisers for the same time slots, and threatened to fine stations who violated the rule or to hold the violations against them when their licenses come up for renewal.
 
Ad Prices Cut 20% to 30%
People who specialize in buying time for political advertising say television stations around the country reacted immediately, dropping their prices for political advertisements by 20 percent to 30 percent. This enabled candidates to buy more advertising now or stockpile the savings for televised volleys late in the campaign.
It appears they will need them. Political media buyers say that, in an effort to pierce the electorate's torpor, they have had to double the amount of time they buy for their advertisements.
Larry McCarthy, a Republican consultant who is creating spots for several House candidates and for Pete Wilson, the Republican nominee for governor in California, attributed the difficulty of reaching people to the same demons troubling mainstream advertisers: ''increased video choices because of VCR's and cable, and more advertising clutter because of 15-second spots and 10-second spots.''
Tony Fabrizio, a Republican media buyer, said that to reach at least 96 percent of the voters on television campaigns used to buy enough time to assure that each voter would see an ad five times. Now, he said, campaigns are hitting each viewer 8.2 to 8.6 times.
''It's scary,'' Mr. Fabrizio said. ''The sponge isn't absorbing as well.''

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTION;
NO CLEAR LEADER IN CALIFORNIA RACE

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20

 BODY:
They have dueled over limits on how long elected state officials may serve, crime and punishment, growth and environment, as well as taxation and spending. But the race between Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein for governor of California stands just about where it started more than four months ago: deadlocked.
''It is very much up in the air,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Center for Politics and Policy at the Claremont Graduate School. ''This campaign is so close anything could make a difference.''
Barring the unexpected or a major gaffe, the campaign has come down to what political professionals call the numbers. Both candidates appear to have solidified their bedrock support: Ms. Feinstein, the Democratic candidate, who is a former Mayor of San Francisco, in the San Francisco Bay area and Mr. Wilson, the Republican, who is a former Mayor of San Diego, in the more conservative Southern California counties of San Diego and Orange. #4 Counties Seen as Critical So both sides are concentrating on getting out the vote in their strongholds and on advertising in the vote-rich Los Angeles area, where half of California lives. ''It all depends on the margins in the four perimeter counties of Los Angeles,'' said Bill Carrick, Ms. Feinstein's campaign manager - Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside and northern Orange counties. 
Tacticians for both national parties have called this race a top priority. With its population at 29.3 million in the 1990 census, California is expected to gain up to seven new seats in Congress in 1992 and the Republicans are hoping to have a Republican Governor to veto any reapportionment plan drawn up by the Legislature, which is under overwhelming Democratic control and is expected to stay that way.
The latest public opinion polls gave both camps something to cheer about. The independent California Poll, released Oct. 12, gave Mr. Wilson the edge, 47 to 42 percent, with 11 percent undecided. With a sample size of 1,021, the margin of sampling error was three percentage points either way.
On Oct. 18, a statewide survey taken by The Los Angeles Times found the race virtually dead even: 42 percent for Mr. Wilson and 41 percent for Ms. Feinstein. The sample size was 2,154 and the margin of sampling error was also three percentage points either way. The poll found Mr. Wilson leading by 2 to 1 in Orange and San Diego Counties and by 5 to 4 in the agricultural Central Valley. Ms. Feinstein led by almost 2 to 1 in the San Francisco Bay area and by a slight margin in Los Angeles County.
 
'Gender Gap Has Evened Out'
While much has been made of Ms. Feinstein's appeal to women, both surveys seem to show that Mr. Wilson has offset any advantage his opponent might have had in this area. In the California Poll, Mr. Wilson led Ms. Feinstein 49 percent to 41 percent among men and 46 percent to 44 percent among women. The Los Angeles Times reported that the results from its poll showed male voters favored Mr. Wilson by a margin of 10 points while female voters favored Ms. Feinstein by 7 points.
''This tells us the gender gap has evened out, disappeared,'' said Mr. Wilson's campaign manager, George Gorton. Eileen Padberg, a Republican political consultant who ran George Bush's campaign in California in 1988, theorized that with the possibility of war in the Middle East and a recession, women were turning to Mr. Wilson, as a Senator, for his experience.
But the Feinstein camp found it encouraging that two-thirds of the undecided voters were women.
Ms. Feinstein, who came from far behind to capture the Democratic nomination, has portrayed herself as a bright new face in California politics, an agent of change for a troubled state. In the Los Angeles Times poll, 59 percent chose her as the candidate for change, as against 13 percent for Mr. Wilson.
 
'Tale of Two Cities'
Mr. Wilson, a moderate in the Republican spectrum, has based his campaign largely on what he calls the ''tale of two cities,'' a comparison between his record as a Mayor and Ms. Feinstein's, arguing that he reduced taxes in San Diego while she was raising them in San Francisco. In an appeal to women, he comes down hard for long prison terms for rapists, saying women ought to feel safe when they walk alone at night.
Ms. Feinstein assailed Mr. Wilson for missing votes in the Senate, and he returned to Washington Monday to take part in the budget debate. Although Ms. Feinstein had Mr. Wilson on the defensive, neither candidate can be confident.
The candidates have carefully tailored middle-of-the road platforms that are especially Californian. They both present themselves as supporters of the right to abortion, as backers of the death penalty and as stalwart defenders of the environment, differing in details and attacking each other's sincerity on each issue. For example, Ms. Feinstein has endorsed a far-reaching measure, called ''big green,'' that would rewrite California environmental law, while Mr. Wilson says it tries to do too much and would undermine the Governor's authority.
They have clashed directly on some issues. Senator Wilson supports a ballot measure that would impose strict limits on the terms of state legislators, while Ms. Feinstein opposes it. Ms. Feinstein has proposed a special state commission to manage growth, while Mr. Wilson says such decisions are more properly made at the local level. Mr. Wilson backs merit pay for teachers; Ms. Feinstein, backed by the main teachers' union, is against that.
 
Campaigning in Wilson Territory
As Mr. Wilson spent this weekend in Washington, Ms. Feinstein took full advantage, with numerous campaign events in Southern California, including a breakfast with black ministers in Los Angeles, a brunch with abortion rights groups in Santa Ana, a fund-raising event in Long Beach and a meeting with leaders of Kids First, an education advocacy group.
''We need to do well in Southern California,'' said her press secretary, Dee Dee Myers. ''We'll be spending the bulk of our time here.''
Her campaign manager, Mr. Carrick, suggested she planned to tie Mr. Wilson to the budget troubles in Washington. ''He's part of the mess,'' he said. ''We are basically waiting for the car wreck. Whenever it is, to associate him with that is a plus for us, particularly when people are looking for someone not part of the Washington-Sacramento political culture.''
At their only debate so far, on Oct. 7, Mr. Wilson tried to turn public resentment at politicians to his own advantage, announcing that he was backing a ballot measure, Proposition 140, that would limit state senators and statewide elected officials to a total of eight years in office and State Assembly members to six years.
 
Feinstein Benefits From Ruling
While that got Mr. Wilson the debate headlines, his campaign manager, Mr. Gorton, said that it had not provided much of a lift for him and that the campaign intended to focus more on issues of taxation and the economy. ''Our polls show the economy has gone from fourth to first - people do not want their taxes raised,'' he said.
Further complicating matters was a Sept. 25 ruling by a Federal judge voiding the state's limits on campaign contributions. With only $686,733 in the bank compared with Mr. Wilson's $3.3 million, Ms. Feinstein quickly raised $750,000 from such diverse sources as the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, the California Teachers Association, Ted Field, the Hollywood producer, and Chevy Chase, the comedian.
The victory may turn on who is better at what political consultants call ''the ground game,'' the unglorious but crucial effort to get out the sympathetic vote and discourage other voters. Republicans are making an enormous effort to distribute absentee ballots to Republican voters, while the Democrats see moderates, independents and Republican women as targets of opportunity. The Democrats also hope that conservative Republicans, many of whom are unhappy with Mr. Wilson's stands on abortion and his opposition to offshore oil drilling, will stay at home.
So far the campaign has been comparatively polite by national standards, but members of both camps say it might become more negative in the final stretch.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Agree on Immigration Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators will meet early next week to work out final details of a bill that would allow a substantial increase in legal immigration to the United States.
The compromise bill would allow 700,000 immigrants a year in 1992, 1993 and 1994 and 675,000 annually in subsequent years. The United States has been admitting about 500,000 immigrants a year, not counting refugees, people who are fleeing persecution.
Under the bill, the United States would increase the allowable number of skilled immigrants, including scientists, engineers and medical technicians, so as to compensate for expected shortages of skilled labor in the 1990's. Congress, the Labor Department and many economists see immigration as a way to correct the imbalance between labor supply and demand. 
 
'An Excellent Compromise'
Representative Bruce A. Morrison, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, said he and other key members of the House and the Senate reached the agreement on Friday night.
''There are details still to be worked out,'' Mr. Morrison said in an interview. ''But the basic outline of the bill is agreed to. It is an excellent compromise.''
The tentative agreement was unexpected. The Senate passed a version of the legislation in July 1989, and the House passed a major immigration bill on Oct. 3 of this year. But disagreements among lawmakers responsible for immigration policy were so profound that the Senate, which wanted to set immigration levels much lower than the House did, refused to enter formal negotiations.
But after four hours of informal talks on Friday, senators and representatives agreed on the outline of the compromise. They plan to convene a formal conference committee early next week. Much of the conference report has already been written by Congressional aides.
The conference report is subject to approval by both chambers and by the President.
 
Splitting the Difference
The compromise sets the total number of immigrants in between the 630,000 a year specified in the Senate bill and the 775,000 in the House measure.
Under the compromise, the 700,000 immigrants permitted in each of the first three years would be chosen as follows: 465,000 would be relatives of United States citizens and permanent resident aliens; 140,000 would be workers with special job skills, or close family members (an increase in this category of more than 80,000); 40,000 would be residents of countries that have been allowed to send relatively few immigrants to the United States in recent years, and 55,000 would be spouses and children of aliens who gained legal status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
In 1995 and later years, the 675,000 immigrant visas would be distributed as follows: 480,000 to relatives of citizens and permanent resident aliens; 140,000 to workers with special skills and their relatives, and 55,000 to citizens of countries that have sent relatively few immigrants to the United States in recent years.
 
Reservations Voiced
Mr. Morrison said: ''The basic goals of the House bill that I sponsored have been attained. We will get a substantial increase in employer-sponsored immigration. We have expanded family immigration. And we will have a substantial program for countries previously disadvantaged under the immigration law, like Ireland, Poland and Italy.''
Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the sole Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, said in an interview after the informal negotiations on Friday night: ''We struck a deal. We haven't got it all in writing, but we struck an oral deal, and I think it's in the national interest.''
Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who has worked closely with Hispanic groups, said today that he endorsed the overall agreement on numbers of immigrants, even though he had reservations about some parts of the compromise bill.
''It is better than existing law, but it's a far cry from the House bill,'' which was more generous to aliens wishing to join relatives already in the United States, he said.
Mr. Morrison said he believed the House-Senate conference would be ''smooth sailing because we have sailed all the rough waters already.''
 
'Far From Over'
But Rick Swartz, an immigration lawyer in Washington, said it was possible that Hispanic groups and some religious organizations would find the agreement unacceptable because of the way it treated family-related immigration. ''This process is far from over,'' he said.
Under current law, there is no immigration limit on American citizens' immediate relatives, who include spouses, unmarried minor children and, in some cases, the citizen's parents. The compromise bill would count immediate relatives under the overall ceiling for legal immigration.

HEADLINE: Allies Say Budget Impasse Could Hurt World Economy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
For America's allies, the budget fiasco in Washington has created an image of a rudderless, indecisive Government, the prey of special interests. It is not an image they savor.
''It's horrifying to see all this from the outside,'' said Hans-Jorg Rudloff, chairman of Credit Suisse-First Boston, a leading investment bank in London. ''It says a lot about the weakness of America because America will inevitably lose its position in the world if it can't put its financial house in order. Sure, America's military might is still there, but the same economic might is not there.'' 
For years, many economists and executives around the world have said that unless the United States budget deficit is brought under control, it will spell trouble for America's and the world's economies, since it could mean higher interest rates in the United States and elsewhere and increased difficulties for Washington in attracting foreign investors to finance its deficit. With the current turmoil in Washington, those concerns have been reinforced.
 
'Disgraceful Behavior'
Partly as a result of the long stalemate between Congress and the President, Japanese investors are showing greater reluctance to invest in United States Treasury securities, after years of financing as much as 40 percent of Washington's borrowing.
''The attitude of the Japanese is very much like that of other investors around the world: they look at the U.S. budget process as a bit of disgraceful behavior for the Government of the world's largest economy,'' said David Resler, an economist with the Nomura Research Institute in New York.
The budget crisis is just one factor contributing to a net flow of investment funds out of the United States this year. Many foreign investors who once saw America as a land of golden opportunity have pulled back because of plunging real estate prices, a weaker stock market, the savings and loan crisis and fragility among the nation's commercial banks.
An agreement to reduce the Federal budget deficit substantially could reverse this trend, say many economists overseas, because such an accord could mean lower interest rates, a long-term strengthening of the American economy and perhaps a rebound in real estate prices.
''A lot of foreign investors will feel more reassured about America's economic course when they see the deficit brought under control,'' said Michel Develle, chief economic adviser for Banque Paribas, an investment bank in Paris.
 
Others Asked to Sacrifice
Many Europeans say they find it contradictory that American officials urge Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to slash their budget deficits and make other sacrifices as they begin their leap from Marxism to a market economy.
''The battle between a Republican President and a Democratic Congress over the budget has given the post-Communist countries an unfortunate example of how policy can also be mismanaged in a capitalist economy,'' said Christopher Johnson, chief economic adviser to Lloyds Bank in London.
In Eastern Europe and the third world as well as Western Europe, resentment is growing over the perception that because of its budget and trade deficits, the United States is hogging available investment funds, making them less available to other nations.
''A nation as rich as the United States should not be the major importer of capital that is desperately needed in much poorer parts of the world,'' said Mr. Rudloff, of Credit Suisse-First Boston. ''It's America's duty as a world power to put its house in order.''
 
'Need Some Changes'
Many foreign observers have concluded that the standoff in Washington shows that America's budgetary process needs to be revamped.
''The rules of how to resolve the budget situation need some changes,'' said Peter Trapp, vice chairman of the Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, Germany.
In Western Europe, where taxes, social spending and investments in infrastructure like railroads and highways are generally higher than in the United States, there is widespread criticism of the seeming unwillingness of Americans to pay the bill for the level of government services they want and, some Europeans say, need.
Many European admirers of America seem to miss the time when the United States was far and away the economic top dog, and they now talk of a nation with a crumbling infrastructure, a mediocre school system and astonishing urban problems that will make its economy less competitive.

HEADLINE: Yet Another Incarnation for a Versatile Tax Credit: Child Care Aid

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Embedded in the huge budget packages that have passed the House and Senate is a secret weapon that lawmakers have used for 15 years to give working poor people an income supplement intended to help them improve their economic state and stay off welfare.
The tool is the earned-income tax credit, and through it some low-income workers can receive a cash payment of almost $1,000 this year to offset their tax burden.
But depending on the political climate, the credit changes its stripes. This year, it has been portrayed as an offset to higher Social Security payroll taxes. Just a few years ago, it was presented as the best way to make up for no increases in the minimum wage. And now lawmakers are selling the earned-income credit as a way to help poor families with their child care without creating new social programs and bureaucracies. 
The Senate Finance Committee's budget legislation, passed early Friday, would increase the earned-income credit, along with two other related tax credits, by $16.8 billion over the next five years, with all but $5 billion intended for helping families pay for child care. The $5 billion is intended to offset the increases in gasoline taxes and other use taxes that are also in the legislation.
The plan passed by the House on Tuesday would increase the benefits taxpayers receive through the credit by as much as $22 billion, with $11 billion intended for child care. The two chambers are now trying to work out differences in the budget legislation.
 
Questions on Effectiveness
But while the credit is being promoted as a way to help families pay for child care, experts are questioning how effective it can be for that purpose.
They point to two major weaknesses. One is that the higher taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol in the Senate bill would fall so heavily on lower-income taxpayers that the entire benefit people received from the earned-income credit would be consumed.
Second, they note that simply giving poor families a big lump-sum payment after they file their tax returns does not necessarily help them with child-care payments through the year, nor does it address the quality of child care centers or the skills of those who run them.
''We're trying to kill so many birds all at once with this credit that we're not going to do any one thing very well,'' said Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington.
In the history of the credit, its periodic repackaging at the whim of politicians is not new. Conceived in 1972 by former Senator Russell Long, Democrat of Louisiana, the credit eventually took effect in 1975, and at that time was intended to offset rising Social Security taxes. But the credit soon took on the mission of keeping low-income workers in the work force and off welfare rolls by giving them a tax break for earning income.
 
How the Credit Works
It accomplishes this by rewarding low-income workers more as their pay grows, up to a point.
As earnings rise to $6,810, a worker is given a 14-cent credit against taxes for every dollar earned. For the 1990 tax year, that will mean the maximum benefit is $953. From $6,810 up to an income of $10,730, that full credit remains in place. When earnings exceed $10,730, the credit begins to decline at a rate of 10 cents for every $1. Finally, at an income of $20,264, eligibility for the tax credit ends.
In the 1980's, particularly in the last years of Ronald Reagan's Presidency and early in the George Bush's, a drive was begun to raise the credit, with backers arguing that it would compensate for the the Administrations' refusal to go along with higher minimum wages.
 
Political Labeling
Only in the last 18 months, as Congress has pushed hard for legislation to improve child care, has the tax credit become the favored vehicle.
The approach is in line with a free-market philosophy of putting the money in the hands of consumers and letting them decide, rather than creating new Federal bureaucracies, regulations and accompanying spending.
''Politically, it has certainly helped to label the current increase as child care, but in fact it can pretty much be all things to all people,'' Ms. Sawhill of the Urban Institute said.
While most of the increase are described in the legislation as a benefit to cover child-care payments, the recipients are not bound to use the money for that.
While the House budget legislation calls for a straight increase in the credit, the Senate measure includes increases in two other programs for the poor as well.
 
Unequal Benefits Cited
One would change the dependent child-care tax credit, making those who owe no taxes eligible for it. Currently, this credit can only be used to offset taxes paid, and some lawmakers have argued that it thus benefits primarily the middle- and upper-income people.
By permitting the poor to receive direct payments for dependent care, the program would channel an added $4.9 billion to poor families over five years.
The second program in the Senate measure is intended to provide $2.9 billion to help low-income workers pay for the health insurance for children. To be phased in over four years, the program would give a maximum tax credit of $375 to those who pay for health insurance for their children, or 5.5 cents for every dollar earned up to $6,810.
There are other issues surrounding the use of the earned-income tax credit. Noting that it is given equally to families that have one or both spouses working, experts say such a system is fine if its aim is simply poverty relief. But if the purpose is to underwrite the cost of child care, the single parent or the family in which both spouses work have much greater costs of child care than families in which one spouse works and the other stays in the home.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat from Connecticut, termed it ''ludicrous'' to consider the the earned-income credit as a way of improving child care.
The credit ''is an important aid to the poor,'' he said, ''but there is no way to prescribe on what the money will be spent. I suspect a significant portion will not end up going to child care.''

HEADLINE: Social Security Benefits to Rise by 5.4% in January

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Forty million Social Security recipients will get a 5.4 percent increase in benefits in January, the biggest such increase since 1982.
Under Federal law, the cost-of-living adjustment is made automatically each year. In 1991, it will cost the Government $13.5 billion. 
Money for Social Security benefits comes from the Social Security trust fund, which had assets of $163 billion at the end of 1989. The surplus in the trust fund tends to make the overall Federal deficit look smaller, as the Government generally shows spending and receipts for Social Security along with those for other programs in a single budget.
Like Social Security, several other benefit programs are indexed for inflation and linked to the Consumer Price Index. The programs include Supplemental Security Income for the aged, blind and disabled, Civil Service retirement benefits and military retirement benefits.
 
Welfare Benefits in Decline
The Congressional Budget Office says that such entitlement programs, under which payments must be made to applicants who meet criteria set by law, account for nearly half of all Federal spending, or $550 billion in a $1.2 trillion budget in the fiscal year 1990.
Some benefit programs are not tied to the Consumer Price Index. Thus, for example, the level of benefits in the main Federal-state welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, has not kept pace with inflation. In a typical state, the purchasing power of welfare benefits has declined 39 percent in the last 20 years.
For Social Security recipients the average monthly benefit, now $571, will rise to $602 in January. For an elderly couple, both receiving Social Security, the average monthly benefit will rise to $1,022 from $970.
Social Security recipients got a 4.7 percent increase in benefits last January. The increase in 1982 was 7.4 percent.
 
Method Under Criticism
The indexing of Federal programs, to protect beneficiaries from inflation, been criticized by some conservatives, in both the Republican and Democratic Parties, because it tends to increase Federal spending.
But P. Royal Shipp, senior specialist on social legislation at the Congressional Research Service, said indexing was ''introduced in Social Security as a means of constraining the growth of the program.''
''The 1972-73 legislation pegging future automatic benefit increases to the Consumer Price Index was sought largely by conservatives as a means of curbing even larger ad hoc benefit increases,'' he said. ''The old ad hoc, separately enacted benefit increases of the past might have sometimes exceeded the inflation rate, but each and every increase was also accompanied by a review of its effect on the financial condition of the program.''
With automatic cost-of-living adjustments, there is no requirement for such scrutiny. But Congress can pass a law delaying or reducing a scheduled increase in benefits and has done so on occasion.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Aide's Departure Signals Growing Tensions

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The resignation of Mayor David N. Dinkins's liaison aide with Hispanic groups underscores a growing frustration between Hispanic political and civil rights advocates and an administration that they fear has been taking them for granted.
The director of the new Mayor's Office of Latino Affairs, William Nieves, said on Wednesday that he would resign at the end of the month. Mr. Nieves said limited resources and a lack of access to the Mayor had hampered his effectiveness as an ombudsman for Hispanic interests.
He said in his resignation letter he had been a victim of ''unjustified character assassinations in the media.'' He later told friends that the attacks had been motivated by mayoral advisers wanting to oust him after he and the Mayor had publicly disagreed over Mr. Dinkins's support for him. 
Advocates of Hispanic rights have criticized the administration's handling of the resignation and warned that simply replacing him without improving the job would be unacceptable. The advocates said the problem went deeper, that the administration had to work to regain its credibility with Hispanic voters who supported Mr. Dinkins's election.
 
'Learning Curve Is a Lot Flatter'
''I don't think anybody anticipated the Dinkins administration would develop such a poor relationship with the Latino community,'' the executive director of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, Angelo Falcon, said. ''Their learning curve is a lot flatter than I think anybody anticipated.''
Hispanic voters were part of the coalition that with other ethnic groups and unions helped elect the first black mayor. Some advocates of Hispanic rights who drummed up support for Mr. Dinkins said they felt used. They said they saw Mr. Nieves's appointment as a harbinger of cordial relations with the city government. Mr. Nieves was an early backer of Mr. Dinkins and helped raise money for him.
Their expectations were tempered by the fact that unlike his counterpart in the Koch administration, Luis A. Miranda Jr., Mr. Nieves had a smaller staff and did not have an open door to the Mayor. He had to go through the constituent affairs director, Victor M. Quintana, and Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch.
Relations grew tense when Mr. Dinkins characterized as assassins three men whom Mr. Nieves said he considered heroes. The three were Puerto Rican nationalists who fired on Congress from the spectators' gallery in 1954. The Mayor was criticized again when Hazel N. Dukes, head of the state N.A.A.C.P. and an adviser he appointed president of the Offtrack Betting Corporation, made derogatory remarks about Hispanic immigrants, for which she later apologized.
 
'Keeping the Community Remote'
Advocates of Hispanic rights said the the head of the Latino Affairs Office should be able to call on the Mayor directly. Although the organization of the office may be typical of Mr. Dinkins's hierarchical style, some critics see it as a slight to Hispanic residents. ''He is keeping the community remote from him by having all this protocol,'' the coordinator of the Hispanic Coalition for Dignity and Justice, Carmen Canales-Ambert, said.
In what he described as an effort ''to put this issue to rest,'' Mr. Dinkins defended his record yesterday before a group of Hispanic lay people and clergy at the Catholic Center at First Avenue and 55th Street. ''This nonsense of direct access to the Mayor is really a straw man put up by some of my Latino friends who did not support me in the first place, who supported Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani,'' he said in a departure from his prepared speech.
The Mayor named Hispanic people whom he has appointed like Mr. Quintana and Fire Commissioner Carlos A. Rivera. Mr. Dinkins also distributed a report on programs serving Hispanic New Yorkers.
''Does the Latino community prefer to have a liaison to the Mayor or have people like Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Financial and Economic Development, handling things in the first instance, not by communicating with me?'' he asked. ''She does the job.''
''I don't think this administration has turned its back on the Latino community,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''We have been fair and inclusionary.''
 
Meeting at Gracie Mansion
He added that Mr. Nieves had ample opportunity to talk to Mr. Dinkins. But Mr. Lynch acknowledged that the administration needed to reach out more and said an advisory council of Hispanic civic leaders would be formed. ''We want good public relations from it, but we don't want it just to be a public-relations office,'' he added.
Mr. Dinkins announced his plans for the council at a meeting last month at Gracie Mansion, and Mr. Falcon said, ''The administration is going to have to come up with not a nice new improved office, but nice new improved policies.''
Dennis Rivera, president of hospital workers' union, Local 1199, a major early supporter of Mr. Dinkins, said he had sometimes been impatient with the Mayor's seeming lack of response. But he added that Mr. Dinkins had rightly devoted attention to fiscal problems.
''Some of us who got impatient with David failed to see the immense pressure he has,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''There are those in the financial community and those who didn't vote for him who really want him to fail.''
Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said Mr. Dinkins could ease relations by becoming more involved in Hispanic residents' problems. ''David's heart is in the right place,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''But he may have to be a little more hands-on on these issues.''
Some Hispanic voters said they, too, had to become more involved, rather than assume that because the Mayor was from a minority group that conditions would automatically improve for all other minority groups.
''I guess you have to fight City Hall anyway, rather than wait for the Mayor to do the right thing,'' said Elizabeth Colon, executive director of the Association of Puerto Rican Executive Directors.

HEADLINE: New York Farms Showed Record Profits in 1989

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
New York farmers earned profits of $807 million in 1989, the highest amount ever recorded in the state, the Agricultural Statistics Service reported last week.
Despite a sharp rise in production expenses, the net income of the farmers last year was 20 percent higher than in the previous record year of 1987, the service said.
''It was a real good year for farmers,'' said Mark F. Emery, a spokesman for the New York Farm Bureau. 
The major reason was a rise in the price of milk sold by the state's dairy farms, which constitute the largest economic segment of the state's commercial farming.
With the increase in milk revenues, all the state's farms showed a combined gross income that topped $3 billion for the first time, reaching a record level of $3.28 billion, according to the statistical service. The previous record of $2.98 billion was reported in 1987.
The figures also reflected a turnaround from 1988, when both gross and net farm income dropped from 1987. In 1988, gross farm income fell to $2.95 billion, and net farm income dropped to $661 million, down from $674 million the year before.
Despite relative stability in milk prices early this year, Mr. Emery said that a projected drop in those prices, along with rising fuel costs, could reduce farm profitability in 1990.
''We are cautiously optimistic about 1990,'' he said.
Richard T. Maquire, the State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, said he did not expect 1990 to be as good a year for farmers as 1989, mainly because of an anticipated drop in milk prices caused by increased production.
The large increase in profits on New York farms last year contrasted with figures from Connecticut and New Jersey. Both states reported higher gross farm incomes, but Connecticut showed a drop in net income and New Jersey only a slight increase.
In Connecticut, gross farm income rose from $427.2 million in 1988 to $434.6 million in 1989, but profits fell from $146.2 million to $138.5 million. In New Jersey, the gross farm income in 1989 rose to $767.4 million from $728.3 million the year before, while the net income increased to $248.3 million from $246.2 million.
Neither of those states has a large dairy sector like New York's, so rising milk prices did not offset farmers' increased production costs. In 1989, Connecticut had 3,900 farms operating and New Jersey 8,100.
In New York, the number of commercial farms operating in 1989 was 39,000, down from 41,000 the year before, according to the statistics service. Of the total, about 11,600 were dairy farms, and those farms accounted for 55 percent of all cash receipts by New York farms. Last year, the dairy farmers sold their milk for a total of $1.56 billion, up from $1.4 billion the year before.
Other segments of New York agriculture also showed increases. Greenhouse and nursery products were sold for $262 million, up from $232 million, vegetables rose from $222 million to $243 and fruit from $142 million to $161 million.
Those increases more than offset the rising costs of production, which were up 8 percent overall last year, from a total of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion, the statistics service said. Most of the increases came in the costs of pesticides, feed, fertilizer, taxes and labor.

(Joyce Dopkeen/The New York Times) (pg. 32) As Tax Revenues Drop in Region, Cuts Are Small but Close to Home

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
With tax revenue stunted by the weak economy, state, county and local budgets are being tightened throughout the metropolitan region in ways that are touching nearly everyone in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Just as the entire region charged ahead with New York City in the mid-1980's, the region now is tagging right along with the city's slump into tough fiscal times. Mayor David N. Dinkins's scramble over the last few weeks to close a yawning budget gap is being viewed as a warning by governments large and small to get their own houses in order while there still is time.
There have been few layoffs or substantial cuts so far. But life in the region is being changed in scores of ways that are small but frustrating, and are likely a harbinger of harder times to come. 
 
Decline in Tax Revenues
Professors at the University of Connecticut are emptying their own wastepaper baskets because of maintenance cutbacks. In Holmdel, N.J., only half as many shade trees are being planted this year as had been planned. New Haven has canceled its New Year's Eve celebration. And the Whirlwind roller coaster at Rye Playland may not be replaced right away when its current lease at the Westchester County park expires.
Receipts of important taxes in all three states are lagging behind projections, and the shortfalls are leading officials to contemplate far greater austerity.
''If we make corrections now, we will not get like New York City,'' said Katherine S. Carsky, the Republican head of the budget committee on the Westchester County Board of Legislators.
The chief problem is a drop in the jobs, corporate profits and real-estate values that produce the taxes on which governments run. From town halls to the statehouses, a scramble is on to avoid a full-blown fiscal crisis and to deal with an economic future that was dimming even before the Persian Gulf crisis pushed up the cost of energy and the rate of inflation.
Revenue from sales taxes, income taxes and business taxes have dropped from last year in most places, and property tax revenue has also fallen in many areas. And even where tax collections increased, they have remained below anticipated levels.
New York City's problems are the most severe right now, with Mr. Dinkins considering large layoffs and deep budget cuts, and investment analysts calling for sterner measures and declaring a so-called credit watch, an indication that they believe serious fiscal problems exist.
But the tattered economy has put pressure on government budgets at all levels. And the fiscal trouble facing states means more fiscal trouble for towns and counties, as state aid dwindles.
New York State is not as hard-pressed as New York City, but Gov. Mario M. Cuomo acknowledged in a gubernatorial debate on Friday night that he expects the state to run a deficit this year. Tax receipts are running about $200 million below budget estimates.
In Connecticut, the tax on corporate profits is down about $66 million from last year, an indication of weakness in the state's business sector. Some $36 million of the drop-off is due to changes in accounting methods, said Gordon J. Frassinelli, executive budget officer in Connecticut's Office of Policy and Management. Nevertheless, Connecticut could end the year with a budget gap of $390 million, including a deficit of $157 million carried over from last year.
Because both New York and Connecticut are holding elections for governor this year, fiscal experts believe budget problems are being highlighted but bona fide solutions - like higher taxes and tough cutbacks - tend to be evaded. Wait, they say, until next year.
 
The New Jersey Approach
The situation in New Jersey provides an example. Before last year's election for governor, Standard & Poor's, the investment rating service, declared that New Jersey's economy had topped out and that balancing the first budget after the election would require a tax increase.
Neither candidate for governor agreed. But within months of taking office, Gov. Jim Florio pushed through a $2.8 billion package of taxes.
While taxpayers around the state screamed, some fiscal monitors had a more postive reaction. ''New Jersey has done what it takes before the other states because it had its election a year earlier,'' said Hyman C. Grossman, managing director of the government finance department at Standard & Poor's.
Because of the tax increase, Standard & Poor's earlier this year took New Jersey off the credit watch and raised its credit rating.
Since New Jersey raised its sales tax rate to 7 percent from 6 percent and added paper products, telephone calls and many other items to the list of those covered by the tax, revenues for the first quarter are up sharply from last year's. But state officials are worried because corporate taxes, realty transfer taxes and other revenue sources are falling behind expectations.
 
Lots of Little Cuts
Disappointing tax collections have forced Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties to restrain spending, primarily by putting a freeze on all hiring. Suffolk County Executive Patrick G. Halpin recently proposed holding the line on taxes, but said that to do so he would have to lay off 295 county workers next year.
Counties and municipalities, which rely primarily on property taxes, are being hurt by the real-estate slump. The drop in prices has led to an explosion of property tax appeals, many of which end up in tax reductions for homeowners and headaches for local officials.
Few governments have taken steps as drastic as layoffs. But the many little steps to save taken together form a pattern of annoyances, inconveniences and frustrations.
For instance, $10 million was taken from the $117 million budget for New Jersey's Division of Motor Vehicles, which runs the state's auto inspection stations, where drivers must have their cars inspected once a year. The cuts forced the division to scale back hours and eliminate Saturday inspections all together.
The changes took effect July 2. Soon, lines of cars were snaking around the stations and frustrated drivers howled in anger. So loud were the protests that Governor Florio agreed to restore some of the lost funds, which shortened lines, although the stations remain closed on Saturdays.
Other side effects of the budget crunch are being felt throughout the region. Benches and swings in Connecticut state parks are going longer without fresh paint. The Plainfield Symphony Orchestra will have to play on a flat stage instead of a raised platform because it lost a $10,000 grant from the New Jersey Arts Council and cannot afford the cost of moving the platform.
 
No Leaf Pickups
When Connecticut imposed a 5 percent across-the-board budget reduction this summer, the University of Connecticut eliminated a dozen custodial positions. For safety reasons, bathrooms and locker rooms still are cleaned every day, but faculty offices are being skipped, leaving professors to carry their own wastepaper baskets out to the dumpsters behind their buildings.
In Stamford, Conn., homeowners in the northern, more suburban half of town will have to find their own way of disposing of autumn leaves, because the city has suspended pickups there to save money. It suggested that residents rake leaves into the woods or compost them.
In Holmdel, a suburban township in central New Jersey, officials have been pinching pennies to keep taxes from rising again. This year, said Mayor Peggy Lasky, some $300,000 worth of road repairs and other capital improvements were delayed and the shade tree commission's appropriation was halved to $2,500.
In New Haven the city's six-person Department of Cultural Affairs was shrunk to a one-man bureau.

Fashion in Paris: Irrelevant, but Who Cares?

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Fashion is different here. The French seem to take a special delight in pure style, style as an end in itself, independent of business. So while Seventh Avenue is in a dark mood, amid talk of war and recession, the Paris fashion scene this season retains its ebullient kick and unabashed sense of fun.
The spirit is dramatically evident at the current round of spring ready-to-wear shows, many of which have held fast to their tradition of outlandishness and blatant irrelevance to women's lives. At Thierry Mugler's extravaganza Thursday, celebrities like Diana Ross, Lauren Hutton and Jade Jagger came down the runway to the roars and whistles of a crowd that included Madonna and Danielle Mitterrand, the wife of the French President; the clothes themselves were manifestly unwearable.
 
A Prosperous Feeling
Where would you go in a fairy-godmother skirt 10 feet wide? Or a skin-tight vinyl bodysuit? But then again, who cares? These are styles of the future, clothes to play with your robot in, as one model did on stage. A separate, more commercial line was shown privately to the stores. 
There is a prosperous feeling here, and the fashions show it. The Europeans, while not unconcerned, do not believe events in the Middle East will hurt their businesses much, French executives said, except insofar as it affects their customers in the United States.
Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, some French couture houses have had orders canceled. Nina Ricci, which sells 60 percent of its made-to-order clothes to Arab clients, has probably suffered the most. But Persian Gulf clients account for only 8 percent of couture sales over all, said Jacques Mouclier, the president of the Chambre Syndicale, the trade organization of French couturiers.
While the buying power of the American stores has been substantially reduced by both financial problems and the relative decline in the value of the dollar, manufacturers here believe that any loss of American orders will be offset by their growing business in Asia, especially Japan, which is now second only to the home market as an outlet for French luxury goods.
In many ways Paris is on a roll, its $16 billion-a-year fashion machine fueled by the great commercial houses like Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior, who show later this week.
While no new stars have arisen here lately - and few strikingly new looks have been produced - the city has had a continual influx of novel talent. There were the Japanese, in the early 80's. Then there were the Italians, like Romeo Gigli, who made a splash with his exotic clothes two seasons ago but retreated to his showroom this season. Most recently it has been the English, and most notably John Galliano.
On Wednesday in one of the big tents set up in a courtyard outside the Louvre, Mr. Galliano showed the kind of a collection about which veteran fashion editors - fashion nuns, as they are sometimes called - grimly shake their heads, or say something sublimely ambiguous like: ''The clothes looked better from the back.''
The models, all at least six feet tall and seemingly hired from a genetic engineering company, appeared on the exalted fashion catwalks in patchworked psychedelic jeans; these were followed by big washer-women's skirts layered over insulation batting and paired with tank tops. From the waists, loose suspenders dangled, and heads were topped with little Tyrolean hats. This is what is known as ''a lot of look.''
Some of the department store buyers looked stunned. ''They are all just looking for another blazer,'' scoffed a fashion photographer. Well, Mr. Galliano gave it to them. There were men's-style pinstriped jackets, but with an extra sleeve worn as a scarf - or a sling. Where this will sell, other than near an orthopedic hospital, is not clear.
Continuing his deconstruction of clothing, Mr. Galliano then sent his Valkyrian troop out clutching enormous clumps of the aforementioned batting material to their unclad bodies. It looked like shearling, but no fur for Mr. Galliano; he is pro-insulation.
 
Wedding Dress of Paper
 None of this is to gainsay this designer's achievement. He showed chiffon slip dresses, very close to the body, very sexy, that many women would instantly find appealing.
For the finale - traditionally a wedding gown - the model came out in a sculpted white paper dress, which makes everything about the honeymoon night a lot easier.
The original fashion deconstructor is Jean-Paul Gaultier, a dyed-blond Frenchmen, who is revered here. Fashion groupies who don't even dream of getting into his shows stand outside and beg for copies of the program. This season it was a large pop-up card with a serpent and nude figures.
The theme of his show Friday, held in a theater on the Champs-Elysees, was ''Rasta Adam and Eve for Today.'' The models, in dreadlock wigs, came out as couples dressed for some bizarre new Eden. The first wore nothing but spandex bicycle shorts and leafy codpieces as the sound system played a version of M. C. Hammer's ''Can't Touch This.''
Here again was Madonna in the front row, in a black dress with chiffon sleeves and a rosary bead necklace, accompanied by Steven Meisel, a New York photographer, who wore his trademark floppy rabbit fur hat with ear flaps throughout the show. It was only about 90 degrees.
Her current boyfriend, Tony Ward, modeled in the show, and at one point presented her with a little Madonna doll in a Gaultier pin-striped suit slashed at the rib cage, like the one she wears in concert. For some reason, she undressed it immediately.
 
Jackets with a Twist
 For all the frisson generated by the audience, there was real excitement in the clothes, which were a departure from the Gaultier collections that broke clothes down to their underpinnings and always seemed to hint darkly at bondage. This collection was rosy and cheerful, a loving statement about the possibilities of dressing.
The models reflected the new softening. There was a distinguished elderly women with silver hair who wore a jeweled suit and embroidered stretch T-shirt with quiet dignity and a pregnant model who wore a pretty floral maternity dress. There was lots of see-through vinyl, rose-printed leggings and, as always, jackets with a twist - seams held together by knots of fabric or a pinstripe men's suit that was all one piece.
The French maintain that fashion was born in France (they don't give a date), so it is only natural that they should come to it more able to absorb its outrages, more attuned to its subtle messages. Indeed, here the real fashion show is often before and after the runway productions.
Last Tuesday a young avant-garde designer, Olivier Guillemin, held his show in the Musee de l'Homme, in the section devoted to the dawn of man. For this event, the men in the audience outfitted themselves in patent leather jeans, with patchwork print blouses and chiffon scarves tucked under their motorcycle jackets. The women wore, variously, black tights with shiny Beatle boots, striped velvet pants suits, or bright red 60's shifts with dangling pink plastic jewelry.
But the strangest scene was outside the fashion show of Mugler. His shows are always extraordinary theater, but when word got out that Diana Ross and other celebrities might appear as models, it became the hottest ticket in Paris.
A mob of chic elite waited hours in a drizzly rain to get in. At one point, a melee erupted as the diminutive designer Azzedine Alaia demanded entry from within the writhing maw of pressing bodies.
 
Steel Hot Pants (Scary)
 As he was admitted, the crowd surged against the metal barricades. A well-dressed woman fainted. She was carried in, her patent leather shoes dangling limply, just like in an old movie.
''That's how she's getting in,'' said someone in the crowd.
Once inside the long, narrow, sweltering room, the privileged 500 or so fanned themselves frantically with their programs as Ms. Ross shimmied and vamped along with all the other supermodels in what was a burlesque of a fashion show. Very few of the styles shown here - the chunky plastic red robot suits, the jeweled see-through body stockings, or the polished steel helmet, bra and hot pants (scary) - will ever be sold. Mr. Mugler designs and produces a separate collection of wearable clothes in friendly fabrics like wool and cotton that are sold in thousands of department stores around the world.
Nevertheless, the crowd loved it. There was Madonna again, in Pucci tights and faux-fur-trimmed parka, next to Mr. Meisel in his bunny hat. The temperature was at least 115 degrees, but he never took it off. Now that is fashion.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
BUSH TERMED OPEN TO TAX RATE RISE ON UPPER INCOME

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
In a break that could lead to a compromise in the budget negotiations, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has told lawmakers that President Bush could accept an increase in the tax rate for the wealthy to 31 percent from 28 percent now, staff assistants from both parties said today.
No specific word seeped out of the private tax negotiations that went on all day. But a variety of political advisers to senior lawmakers and tax experts who are familiar with the issues and the views of the participants said that Mr. Bush's concession on a rate increase brought the shape of a possible compromise into sharper focus. 
They said other aspects of the compromise would probably include a surtax on the very rich, a limit on the itemized deductions the wealthy could claim and a modest rise in the Federal gasoline tax. Is a Smaller Rise Acceptable? Mr. Bush had previously said he would reject any budget deal that provided for a top tax rate of 33 percent, a level that would be imposed under a budget bill passed by the House last Tuesday. But he had been less explicit as to whether a smaller increase would be acceptable. Over the last month, Mr. Bush has gone back and forth about how high a rate he would accept if taxes on capital gains were not cut, but this is the first time that one of his top advisers has told Congress explicitly what the President would take.
With President Bush's top policy advisers looking over their shoulders, Senators George J. Mitchell, Bob Dole and Lloyd Bentsen, Representative Dan Rostenkowski and a few other lawmakers huddled today trying to work out the final tax deals that are the most controversial aspects of a budget plan that is supposed to reduce the Federal deficit by $40 billion in the 1991 fiscal year and $500 billion over five years.
''It's suddenly starting to dawn on people that they're not too far apart, that this may not be so hard after all,'' said a staff assistant to one of the main negotiators.
 
Demands of Bush and Democrats
The main difficulty the negotiators face is to reconcile the political needs of the President, who insists that tax rates not be raised significantly, with the demands of Democrats that the wealthy bear the brunt of deficit reduction.
Last Tuesday, the House, voting along party lines, approved a Democratic bill that would raise taxes by $149 billion over the next five years, 68 percent of it from taxpayers with annual incomes above $100,000. The central part of this bill would increase the tax rate on the richest taxpayers to 33 percent from 28 percent.
On Friday, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill, supported by Mr. Bush, that would raise $146 billion, 42 percent of it from households with incomes above $100,000. Tax rates would not be increased under this measure, but the Federal gasoline tax would be raised to 18.5 cents from the current 9 cents.
The conference committee that is working on the differences in the two versions hopes to finish by Sunday night. The full House and Senate must pass the compromise and President Bush must sign it for it to become law.
Under a measure enacted Friday, the Government's authority to spend money will lapse at midnight Wednesday.
 
Elimination of 'Bubble'
Mr. Brady said Mr. Bush would agree to a top tax rate of 31 percent, so long as the ''bubble'' was eliminated from the tax code. The bubble is the anomaly in the current tax law that forces families with taxable income from about $80,000 to $200,000 to pay 33 percent on the portion of their income that falls in that range. No taxpayers now pay more than 28 percent of their total income in taxes.
One effect of such a change would be to raise the taxes of those with incomes of more than $200,000 a year and to lower the taxes somewhat of those with incomes of $80,000 to $200,000.
Another effect would be to permit an increase in the alternative minimum tax rate to 23.25 percent from 21 percent. This is paid by high-income people who have so many deductions that their rate falls below the minimum tax level. The rate of the alternative minimum tax is determined by taking 75 percent of the top rate.
These changes would not raise much money, perhaps as little as $3 billion over five years. But they would give Democrats the political benefit of having forced the President to go back on his pledge not to raise tax rates.
Moreover, other changes under consideration could actually push the top rate for the wealthy above 33 percent.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the Administration's budget director, met this morning with Senator Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, in Mr. Dole's office in the Capitol. Down the corridor, Senator Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, and Senator Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee, were also plotting strategy.
Several times, Mr. Dole and Mr. Packwood, with stacks of paper under their arms, left Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu behind and walked down the hall to confer with Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Bentsen.
On one such trip, the two Republican Senators were hailed just outside the Senate chamber by Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. He wanted to introduce them to his weekend companion, the actress Debra Winger. That may have been the only meeting today in public.
This afternoon Representative Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee and dominates the House negotiators, walked over from his office across the street to meet in Mr. Mitchell's office.
The strong support of Mr. Rostenkowski and his House Democratic colleagues is essential to any compromise, since most Republicans in the House will probably vote against whatever the negotiators produce. The House Republican whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said as much in a speech on the House floor today, maintaining that any new taxes would further damage the economy.
Although they had no direct word from the talks, experts following the negotiations from the outside sketched out a possible compromise that would raise $160 billion over five years, giving the lawmakers about $15 billion extra that they could use to reduce cuts in Medicare benefits or to pay for tax breaks that might be needed to win votes for the final package.
These are the elements that such a compromise might include:
Deduction Limit. The Senate bill would reduce itemized deductions by 5 percent of all adjusted gross income above $100,000. If the limit were raised to 10 percent, that would generate $56.5 billion over five years and would have the effect of making the tax rate of those affected as high as 34.1 percent.
This provision, probably acceptable to the Bush Administration, is opposed by lawmakers from high-tax states like New York and California. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said he feared that it would be the first step toward further limitations on deductions. But Mr. Moynihan is the only lawmaker from New York or California among the tax negotiators.
Surtax. The House bill would place a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million. If the income level were lowered to $500,000, it would raise $11.7 billion over five years. The Administration opposes the surtax, but few in Congress have objected to it. It would mean, in effect, that the tax rate on the very rich would be as high as 44.1 percent.
Gasoline Tax. The Senate bill would more than double the gasoline tax, now 9 cents a gallon, to 18.5 cents. That steep a rise is unacceptable to House Democrats, who say it would put too much of a burden on the poor and middle class. But Mr. Rostenkowski has favored a higher gasoline tax in the past and might accept a 5-cent increase. That would raise $21 billion over five years.
Payroll Tax. The Senate bill would require state and local employees, who are entitled to Medicare benefits, to pay the Medicare payroll tax. Mr. Rostenkowski is adamantly opposed, apparently because of the effect on public employees in Chicago and Illinois. But if his objection can be overcome, it would generate $5.2 billion over five years.
Corporate Interest Deduction. The Senate bill would not allow companies to take a deduction for the interest they owe on back taxes. If the House accepts this provision, it would raise $4.1 billion over five years.
Gas Guzzlers. The House bill would double the Federal tax on cars with low gasoline mileage. This could raise $500 million over five years.
Many provisions of the House and Senate bills are identical or so similar that compromises should be easy to work out.
These include higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products; a 10 percent luxury tax on expensive cars, boats, planes, jewelry and furs; an increase in the amount of annual wages subject to the Medicare payroll tax, and an increase in the tax credit for poor workers.

HEADLINE: Leadership Is Changing at Board of Elections

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
A LONG-STANDING impasse at the county's Board of Elections, where voting results have been delayed by what state investigators described as the two Commissioners' ''inability to properly function together as a team,'' appears to have been resolved.
The Republican Commissioner, Antonia R. D'Apice, has announced her retirement after more than 20 years of government service, effective Nov. 24. Her probable replacement is Carolee Sunderland, the vice chairwoman of the County Republican Committee and executive director of the County Republican Party.
Mrs. D'Apice's Democratic counterpart, Marion B. Oldi, may also be replaced before the end of the year, but not because Mrs. Oldi is seeking retirement. ''I want to finish out my 20 years,'' she said. ''Then I'll retire.'' The issue will be decided by the executive committee of the county Democratic Party, which heard Mrs. Oldi's plea for re-appointment Wednesday night. 
 
A Priority for Political Leaders
Whether she is replaced or re-appointed for a final two-year term, her successor will probably be Lloyd King Jr., the Democratic deputy commissioner at the Board of Elections since 1984. Mr. King, who has a law degree, worked for the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Interracial Council for Business Opportunity before coming to the Board of Elections.
A change in the leadership of the Board of Elections had become a priority for county Republican and Democratic leaders since the apparent inability of the two Commissioners to work together became a factor in the board's operations and caught the attention of the state's Director of Election Operations, Thomas R. Wilkey.
Mr. Wilkey came to Westchester in February last year to review the election process following what he said was the ''hectic'' atmosphere in counting Westchester's 1988 general election results. He made 30 recommendations, but indicated that most of the board's problems could be ''solved by resolving the personal attitudes and indifference of its two Commissioners.''
A follow-up visit earlier this year revealed little or no improvement in the situation at election headquarters at 134 Court Street in White Plains. The reason, he said, was ''the two commissioners' inability to establish any form of communication with one another.'' He described assessing Westchester's election procedures as ''an exercise in futility.''
Mr. Wilkey met with members of the county Board of Legislator's Community Affairs and Housing Committee. Timothy S. Carey, the committee chairman, said, ''He told us the Westchester County Board of Elections was the worst in the state of New York.''
 
Meetings on Solving the Problem
That led to a meeting with County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who suggested that the legislators meet with their party leaders to solve the problem of the Commissioners, adding that ''perhaps both should be let go.'' Election commissioners are selected by the parties; the Board of Legislators can approve or reject the candidates, but it cannot select them.
John E. Hand, the Republican chairman of the Board of Legislators, said earlier this year that the county's Republican leaders ''in particular'' should be ''doing more'' to solve the problem as Mr. O'Rourke and the majority of legislators were Republicans.
Mr. Wilkey had avoided comparing the work of the Commissioners, although he did point out that Commissioner Oldi, in a lengthy response to his critical report, sought to make changes or explain why they could not be made, while Commissioner D'Apice's reply, he said, was ''brief and inadequate'' as well as difficult to interpret.
Finally, the county's Republican and Democratic leaders, Anthony J. Colavita and Dennis Mehiel, met to seek a resolution of the problem. Last week, Mr. Mehiel recalled that ''Tony and I felt it was essential that somebody be replaced.'' Mrs. D'Apice said last week that she ''was not asked to leave.'' ''But once the thought of retirement had been created,'' she said, ''I thought, well, that's fantastic. I'll do a little traveling - I'm going to Italy for the first time in March, without having to think about village elections - and get involved in politics, perhaps helping a candidate who represents my feelings.''
The party leaders, at one point, had felt it would be unlikely for one Commissioner to remain while the other left. But that apparently is not the case now, with Mrs. D'Apice's retirement firmly fixed. Mr. Mehiel said it had ''given us a chance to reconsider Marion's situation.''
Mrs. Oldi has made it clear that she would like to stay ''to finish out my 20 years'' in government service ''in the job I'm in right now.'' She said she had ''two years and a couple of months to go'' for her pension. ''At that point I will graciously bow out with dignity,'' she added.
Mrs. Oldi said she would accept another county job or a state job, either of which would count toward her pension, ''but with the budget crunch in Albany the Governor's office has nothing.'' As for a county job, ''They're going to be laying off people,'' she said. ''In any case, a Republican-controlled county isn't going to create a job for a Democrat.''
 
A Vote After Election Day
Mrs. Oldi's fate, therefore, will be determined in large measure by the party's executive committee, of which she is a member. She presented her case before the committee at a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday evening. Mr. Mehiel said they had agreed beforehand not to vote on the matter until after the Nov. 6 election.
All of this has been a bit awkward for Mr. King, Mrs. Oldi's apparently designated replacement, as they work together at the Board of Elections. Mr. Mehiel described Mr. King as ''eminently qualified and well liked in the party.'' Mr. King was recently named to a statewide technology task force to explore improvements in electronic voting machines and ballot counting.
Born and raised in Manhattan, Mr. King attended schools there, served in the Army, graduated from New York University with a bachelor's degree and from Brooklyn Law School in 1956. He said that in New York City he was a member of several political clubs.
''I worked in support of Hulan Jack,'' the former Manhattan Borough President and a friend of the family. ''My father was his best man,'' Mr. King said. ''He was very involved in politics, so it came naturally for me.''
 
From Law to the I.R.S.
Mr. King worked as a legal apprentice for a Manhattan law firm but did not pursue a career in the law, switching to the Internal Revenue Service where he became a supervisor of audit-enforcement procedures and the officer in charge of civil tax enforcement.
In 1967, after 11 years with the I.R.S., Mr. King joined the Office of Economic Opportunity as a fiscal manager. He determined the resolution of audits of 200 community-action agencies financed by the Federal office and prepared fiscal projections for an yearly budget exceeding $125 million.
He served briefly as Director of Urban Affairs for the International Council of Shopping Centers and then spent nine years with the Interracial Council for Business Opportunity, becoming executive vice president and vice president of Westchester and Putnam affirmative action programs.
He lived for 17 years in Mount Vernon, where he was president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, before moving to Larchmont 18 years ago. Mr. King and his wife, Barbara, who were married in 1953, have two sons, Jeffery, 31, a construction inspector with an environmental engineering company, and Todd, 28, who works in marketing and sales for a telephone company in Albuquerque, N.M.
 
The Republicans' Choice
Carolee Sunderland, the Republican choice to replace Mrs. D'Apice, has been a Rye Town resident for 20 years, coming originally from Ossining. For the last 10 years, she has been an active member of the county Republican hierarchy. She started out volunteering, she said, ''and came on board at county Republican headquarters as a typist in 1980.''
''I worked closely with Margaret Soter,'' the former deputy county chairwoman, ''who taught me how to run the office,'' Mrs. Sunderland said. ''I do all the conventions, including the organization of the county delegation to New Orleans in 1988, when Bush was nominated.'' A major part of her work has been organizing the election petitions that she will soon be inspecting as an elections commissioner.
Mrs. Sunderland's husband, Kenneth, is a machine mechanic for Arnold Bakery in Greenwich, Conn. They have two sons, both students at Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains. Kenneth, 18, is a senior and Keith, 14, is a freshman.

HEADLINE: S.& L. Crisis Hurting State's Economy

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE problems facing the nation's troubled savings and loan associations and the methods used by Federal regulators to solve them are undermining the state's economy in ways that will ultimately be felt by almost all New Jersey residents, experts say.
Banking officials, legislators, economists and construction industry representatives say the savings and loan bailout is resulting in tighter credit for all borrowers, substantial reductions in new construction and an increase in unemployment across the state.
Paradoxically, however, the slowdown in the building industry may increase values of existing homes to even higher levels than those seen in the middle to late 1980's.
To date, the Federal Government has ordered the takeover of 13 New Jersey savings and loan associations, including United Savings, FSB, of Paterson; the Elysian Federal Savings Bank of Hoboken and the City Federal Savings and Loan Association of Bedminster. The largest takeover was that of City Federal, with 75 New Jersey branches. 
The effects of the bailout on the state's economy are compounded by the already sluggish real-estate market that has slashed property values, the impact of sales and income tax increases and the threat of a nationwide recession.
''We are seeing the beginning of an enormous credit crunch in real estate,'' said Dr. George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of city planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. ''The banks are in feeble condition, and their answer is, 'Don't lend on real estate.' And in this business, when the banks catch a cold, the man in the street sneezes.''
Dr. Sternlieb stressed that depositors' bank accounts were safe; under Federal regulations every account up to $100,000 is insured. But banks, he said, must be more than a safe haven for savings. ''They provide the lubricant that keeps the state's motor running,'' he said. ''And when that lubricant is missing, the motor grinds to a halt.''
The catalyst that sent the credit market into its current tailspin, Dr. Sternlieb said, was not so much the savings and loan crisis as the Government's response. As Congress realized the the threat posed by the failure of savings units across the country, he said, it passed legislation that would prevent the associations from repeating mistakes of the past.
 
No More Good-Will Loans
That legislation, the Financial Institutions Restructuring and Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1989, strictly limited the amount of money that savings and loan associations could lend to borrowers, Dr. Sternlieb said. Before that act, he said, savings and loan associations had been making loans secured by intangible collateral like good will or the anticipated value of a project or a business.
In addition, Dr. Sternlieb said, the savings and loan associations were lending out higher percentages of their available capital, and were maintaining lower reserves against bad debts, than state-chartered savings banks and commercial banks. The 1989 legislation increased the capital requirements and reserves against bad debts, putting the savings and loans on a more even footing with the other lenders.
In the rapidly rising real-estate market of the mid-1980's, those practices posed no major problem. But when real-estate values began to decline, much of the collateral on which savings and loan associations had based their loans evaporated. At the same time, developers, finding it difficult to sell their properties, began falling behind in their loan payments.
And that, said Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice president of the Plainsboro-based New Jersey Builders Association, began a decline in the construction industry that continues to this day.
''Historically, when we have gone into a recession, the reaction of the financial community was to cooperate with the builder, to rearrange financing and ride out the storm,'' Mr. O'Keefe said. ''But this time around, the financial institutions are much more skittish, and I think we are all paying the price.''
 
Other Lenders More Vigilant
The increased caution by lending institutions, Mr. O'Keefe said, has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of lines of credit for many builders. ''And when the cash flow is cut off, that can leave an otherwise viable project dead in the water,'' he said.
Though the 1989 legislation applies primarily to Federally chartered savings and loan associations, even state-chartered savings banks and commercial banks have become more vigilant in their lending policies, particularly for real-estate development.
''The problems of the savings and loans have now infiltrated the commercial banks,'' said Lewis Fromkin, president of Samuel Fromkin Construction in Wall Township.
''You have a bunch of scared rabbits in the banking industry who are absolutely mortified to make a loan in the real-estate sector without 100 percent collateral,'' Mr. Fromkin said.
 
Borrowing in Singapore
Mr. Fromkin said his company had shrunk to two full-time employees from 12 in the last year. In addition, he said, he has not been able to obtain any financing for new projects from lending institutions in the area, including those that his company has been doing business with for years.
''They have flatly turned us down,'' Mr. Fromkin said. ''They tell us, 'We're not interested in New Jersey real estate.' ''
Mr. Fromkin said he was able to secure only three new loans in the last few months; his lending banks were in Denmark, Britain and Singapore. ''I just can't get money here in the state of New Jersey,'' he said. Edmund Lawlor, president of the New Jersey Savings League, in Cranford, a trade organization of 132 savings and loan associations, said current regulations had indeed limited the amount of money that can be lent to individual developers. But the main reason for decreased borrowing, he said, is decreased demand for loans, resulting from the depressed real-estate market. ''The major impediment is the market itself,'' Mr. Lawlor said. Kurt E. Schaub, a spokesman for the New Jersey Bankers Association, a Princeton-based trade organization of 123 commercial banks, also acknowledged that developers were finding it more difficult to obtain loans, but said that customers of commercial banks would not notice major changes in policy.
For the commercial lenders, Mr. Schaub said, ''It's business as usual.''
Commercial banks, Mr. Schaub said, have always operated under stricter lending guidelines than savings and loan associations.
Representatives of state-chartered savings banks say their lending practices are also unchanged.
''Our underwriting practices have always been more stringent, and therefore our lending policies have not changed,'' said Samuel Damiano, president of the New Jersey Council of Savings Institutions, a trade organization based in West Orange.
''All lenders were caught up in the economic downturn,'' Mr. Damiano said. ''But those who were more conservative experienced less of an effect.''
State banking officials acknowledge that New Jersey builders are experiencing serious problems obtaining financing.
 
'Changed the Rules Overnight'
''I'd say that we perceive it the same way they do,'' said the State Banking Commissioner, Geoffrey M. Connor. ''There certainly is a credit crunch in the home development business.''
Last June, he said, the State Department of Banking held a daylong hearing on the issue. Legislators, economists, state and Federal business experts and representatives of the banking and construction industries provided testimony.
One of the conclusions drawn from the hearing, Mr. Connor said, was that the new Federal savings and loan regulations were enacted without an adequate transition period. ''They changed the rules overnight,'' he said. One major change in effect limited the amount of money a savings and loan association could lend to one borrower.
Before the law, Mr. Connor said, a savings and loan association could lend an individual borrower up to 10 percent of the bank's total deposits or 100 percent of its net worth, whichever was greater. Under the new law, a savings and loan can lend an individual borrower as much as $500,000 or 15 percent of its tangible capital, whichever is greater.
As a result, some developers who had received promises of large loans under the old regulations saw that the amounts they could borrow were substantially reduced under the new ones.
''Many of the borrowers were cut off in midstream,'' Mr. Connor said.
 
Banks 'Don't Have the Capital'
When those borrowers began to look elsewhere for loans, Mr. Connor said, they found that new financing sources more difficult than ever to locate. The savings and loans, he said, ''basically stopped making construction loans.''
''What's happened since,'' he said, ''is that many of the commercial banks have also slowed down in making those loans as well.'' And that, some economists say, will have a direct effect on everyone. ''It's going to be far tougher to get a mortgage,'' said Dr. Paul Nadler, professor of finance at the Rutgers Graduate School of Finance in Newark. ''The banks simply don't have the capital.''
Home mortgage loans are likely to be more selective, Dr. Nadler said, and those loans are going to be based more and more on the earning power of the buyer rather than on the value of the collateral, he said.
 
Some Benefit to Homeowners
That, however, may result in an unexpected benefit to homeowners who have watched the value of their real estate dwindle over the last few years.
Under ordinary circumstances, construction experts say, tighter credit would result in a decline in property values. But ''in a perverse kind of way there will actually be a benefit from the credit crunch,'' said Mr. O'Keefe of the New Jersey Builders Association.
With construction money difficult to obtain, fewer new homes are being built. As a result, he said, there will be an increasing demand for existing housing, which will lead to increased prices.
''We may quickly be back to the days of high rates of appreciation,'' he said.
But some builders see that as a two-sided coin: high property values for sellers will simply mean higher costs for buyers.
''Sure, the demand is going to be there,'' Mr. Fromkin said. ''But if you're going to buy a house, you're going to end up with the same problem you had three years ago.''
 
Unemployment in Construction
Unemployment in the construction industry and associated trades is approaching a crisis, industry experts say.
Frank Spencer, president of the Carpenters Union Local 1578 in Camden County, testified at the June hearing that the effect of tight credit was ''devastating to the construction industry'' and that severe unemployment would result.
''I was right on target,'' Mr. Spencer said in a recent interview. ''We've probably got 175 guys out of work. And as construction workers get laid off, then all the businesses that are supported by the construction industry - lighting fixtures, carpet, ceramic tile - they all slow down too.''
That, he said, puts additional strain on social services and can cause serious financial problems for families facing long periods of unemployment.
''If workers are out of work for a long period of time, they start to lose their health benefits,'' Mr. Spencer said. ''Then you're just digging a deeper hole.''
But even those in the industry who have managed to find work for their employees are having a difficult time getting paid for their services.
''The banks created the situation we're in by lending money to people who shouldn't have gotten money,'' said Frank A. Speziali of Spease Inc., a Glassboro carpenter contractor who has built about 400 homes in the last seven years.
''The builders end up losing their projects back to the banks, and contractors like myself are out on the hook and suing people to get our money,'' Mr. Speziali said.
''A year ago I had 150 to 200 men working for me on a number of different projects,'' he said. ''Now I've got six carpenters working and hundreds of thousands of dollars out on the street. It's killing me.''
 
INSTITUTIONS TAKEN OVER
To date, Federal regulators have ordered the takeover of 13 New Jersey savings and loan associations, said Andrea M. Plater, spokeswoman for the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency responsible for managing the failed institutions.
Of those taken over, three have been sold, in whole or in part, to other banks in healthy financial condition. They are:
City Federal Savings and Loan Association of Bedminster.
Elysian Federal Savings Bank of Hoboken.
Metropolitan Federal Savings and Loan Association of Denville.
The following associations are currently under the management of the Resolution Trust Corporation:
City Savings Bank, FSB, Bedminster (which represents the 66 branches of the City Federal Savings and Loan Association that have not yet been sold).
Colonial Federal Savings Association of Roselle Park.
First Atlantic Federal Savings and Loan Association of Plainfield.
Mainstay Federal Savings, FSB, of Red Bank.
Mercer Savings Bank, SLA, of Trenton.
Mutual Aid Federal Savings and Loan Association of Manasquan.
Nassau Federal Savings and Loan Association of Princeton.
North Jersey Savings and Loan Association of Passaic.
United Savings, FSB, of Paterson.
United Savings and Loan Association of Trenton, N.J., FA.
Yorkwood Federal Savings and Loan Association of Maplewood.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Start Converting Shoreham to Gas

BYLINE: By THOMAS A. TWOMEY Jr.Thomas Twomey Jr., a member of the Long Island Power Authority, headed the committee that recommended converting Shoreham to gas.

 BODY:
THE final debate over the fate of Shoreham is about to begin.
The Long Island Power Authority, created by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature, has released a report that concluded that converting Shoreham to a natural-gas plant is technically, economically and environmentally viable. The study determined that a conversion could provide an economical power supply for Long Island.
The analysis was favorably received by the trustees of the authority, many of whom have long opposed the operation of Shoreham as a nuclear plant. By a unanimous vote, the trustees authorized the hiring of a project manager and other technical experts to help decide whether or not to proceed with the conversion by the end of the year. 
Long Island officials, once divided over the fate of Shoreham, seem united in support of the conversion. Suffolk County Executive Patrick G. Halpin and Representatives George Hochbrueckner, Thomas J. Downey and Robert J. Mrazek all issued statements supporting the conversion.
Leaders of Long Island's business community, who in the past have been advocates of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, have also expressed support for the conversion proposal.
So who is opposed to the idea? The Bush Administration is accelerating its efforts to reopen the Shoreham as a nuclear plant. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins recently urged the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to deny the Long Island Lighting Company the right to transfer the plant to the Long Island Power Authority for decommissioning.
The Energy Department argues that Shoreham should operate a nuclear plant to reduce Long Island's dependence on oil imported from the Middle East.
But Lilco's oil doesn't come from the Arab nations. The vast majority of it comes from Venezuela. And by converting Shoreham to domestic and Canadian natural gas, we will reduce our dependence on oil even from South America, and we will do that with a clean, safe and abundant energy supply.
Natural gas does not deplete the ozone level, does not create acid rain, and adds very little to the greenhouse effect. It does not create a costly ash or radioactive-waste disposal problem. With natural gas, there is no decontamination problem at the end of the useful life of the plant, saving ratepayers millions of dollars. And our grandchildren will not be paying for the storage of nuclear waste created by the electricity we use today.
Best of all, there is an abundance of this clean fuel in America and Canada. Pipelines already exist, carrying natural gas to Connecticut from the Southwest.
The Federal Government seems about to approve an application by the Iroquois transmission system for a new pipeline from Canada down to Connecticut and then across Long Island Sound to Commack. It would connect Connecticut with the pipeline from the Southwest, thereby flooding Long Island with large quantities of natural gas never before available.
By using Shoreham as a natural gas plant, substantial savings to the ratepayer can be achieved. The non-nuclear Shoreham equipment, including transformers, switches, cooling systems and the turbine, can be harnessed in a conversion.
By using this equipment, a conversion to a 900-megawatt plant would cost approximately $550 million. To build a plant of the same size at a new site without using the existing Shoreham equipment would cost about $960 million. In addition to this 80 percent increase in cost, there would be the difficulty of finding a suitable site on Long Island for such a plant.
But even if a gas-fired plant is technically feasible and environmentally sound, does Long Island need one? Given its projected load growth and its current resource plan, Lilco expects to meet all of its obligations, including its reserve requirement, through the year 2005 without a converted Shoreham.
However, included in Lilco's plan are upstate sources of energy that would be more expensive than the electricity from a converted Shoreham.
By converting Shoreham, we would have available a cheaper energy source. And because the power would be generated on Long Island rather than imported through cables from upstate, it could prove to be more reliable. The conversion could be designed to permit Long Island to put into early retirement some of Lilco's current oil-fired plants, which use oil imported from Venezuela, thereby reducing the amount of imported oil consumed for electrical power.
The savings from a converted Shoreham would be increased by an aggressive energy-conservation program. The power authority estimates that Long Islanders can save 12 percent of their electrical consumption by installing energy-saving devices and better refrigerators, freezers, lighting fixtures, furnaces and hot-water heaters.
Utilities in other states have assisted in paying the cost of such new equipment, producing lower electricity bills for their customers while producing profits for their shareholders. Lilco's efforts to date have focused only on reducing peak load, rather than on reducing the annual use of electricity.
Once Lilco commences a true energy-conservation program, the power authority estimates, it will save about 500 megawatts annually by the year 2000. This is about the total projected output of Shoreham.
The combination of an effective energy-conservation program plus the conversion of Shoreham to natural gas would produce a cohesive energy plan critical for Long Island's economic well-being.
Before the planning for the conversion of Shoreham can commence in earnest, however, the Bush Administration must withdraw its opposition to Governor Cuomo's Settlement Agreement to close Shoreham. The contracts have been ''signed, sealed and delivered,'' so no matter how long the Administration obstructs the transaction, Shoreham will never be operated as a nuclear plant unless, of course, Congress declares war and directs the Federal Government to nationalize Shoreham with many others for our national defense.
Any attempt to reopen Shoreham would result in another decade of litigation, with no progress in developing a cohesive energy policy for Long Island. Meanwhile, the Administration, with its ultraclose ties to the nuclear industry, is costing Long Island about $8 million for each month they delay approving the transfer of the plant to the power authority.
Much of this is the cost of maintaining employment at Shoreham, which is no longer needed. That is about $100 million a year. That money could be better spent on a truly effective energy-conservation plan or even the Shoreham conversion. Instead, it is being wasted.
If Long Island commits itself to a strong and meaningful program of residential and commercial energy conservation and at the same time pursues the conversion of Shoreham, Long Island's energy future will soon be secure. There will be plenty of energy for healthy growth. We will be far less reliant on overseas sources of oil. Best of all we will have saved millions of dollars in energy bills for ourselves and our grandchildren.
After years of confusion and struggle over Shoreham, Long Island now has a rare opportunity to forge a cohesive energy policy. How tragic it would be if the opportunity were lost because of misguided and shortsighted Federal intervention.

HEADLINE: Budget Pinches Day-Care Assistance

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
AT the Norwich office of Infoline, the state's social-service information center, hardly a day goes by without an inquiry from a parent seeking to qualify for reimbursement for day-care costs for low- or moderate-income families. But the answer now is always no. The 16-year-old reimbursement program, which day-care advocates say helps keep working parents off welfare, is accepting no new clients as it struggles to stay within its budget in the state's new era of fiscal austerity.
''We get calls constantly from people who are struggling to pay for day care and make ends meet at the same time,'' said Mary Kraemer, the child-care coordinator at the Norwich Infoline office. ''Many people would qualify for the reimbursement program, but because of funding, the state cannot service any more people.'' 
Connecticut's Commissioner of Human Resources, Elliot A. Ginsberg, acknowledged the ''overwhelming need for the program.'' ''But we're not opening it up,'' he said. ''We have to stay within the budget.''
State Senator Kenneth L. Przybysz, Democrat of Uncasville, called the reimbursement program a success. But he noted Connecticut's ''very difficult financial times'' and the need for cost containment and budget cuts in many areas.
 
Pushing Families to Welfare
The program ''is the saving grace for single mothers who have job skills,'' said Gail Joslin, who coordinates family-life programs for the Connecticut Conference of the United Church of Christ. She noted that single mothers in jobs paying about $13,000 a year were hard pressed to pay day-care costs, which generally run from $70 to $130 a week for each child.
Daisy Martin, of Meriden, said she found the program closed to her. ''It puts me in a situation where I cannot afford the day care I would like,'' she said.
Mrs. Martin, a widow, is raising her 5-year-old grandson and must leave him with a friend while she works, she said. But the boy has problems, including seizures, she said, and she would like him in a day-care program with a trained staff. She noted that he is in a school program for only 10 hours a week.
Ms. Kraemer said that being denied the benefits of the reimbursement program could impel some single parents to go on welfare rather than going to work. ''That would be the natural thing to do,'' she said, if paying the full cost of child care took up most of a paycheck.
Since its inception in 1974, Purchase of Services, as the reimbursement program is officially known, has provided payments on a sliding scale and permitted clients to choose any form of day care approved by the state, from professionally staffed centers to relatives' homes. Over the years, the reimbursements have become larger and available to more families.
In 1985, the program served families with incomes up to 55 percent of the state median and provided up to $40 a week in reimbursement for the first child and smaller amounts for additional children. Now, families with incomes of up to 70 percent of the state median qualify; the maximum reimbursement is $75 a week for each child, and the average payment is $45 a week. In June 1989, the program served 4,843 families; by June 1990, it served 6,634 families.
 
Rolls Closed in May
Growth brought problems. In the 1989-90 fiscal year, the program overran its appropriation from the legislature and was given a $4.5 million deficiency appropriation.
For the 1990-91 fiscal year, the program has been given $19.7 million, including $1.5 million in Federal funds, but the Department of Human Resources announced in May that it would not accept any new clients because to do so could put it over budget again.
''We don't want to put people on and then be forced to make some other drastic move,'' Commissioner Elliot said. The department will continue to review its figures each month, he said, adding that he could not predict when it could accommodate new families. Turnover in the program is low, he said.
''This situation severely limits parents' choices, which puts a lot of stress on the family system at a time when the stresses are already escalating,'' said Nancy Scoyers, a spokeswoman for of the Connecticut Commission on Children. ''Where is our commitment to working families?''
Terri Cutler, who operates the Asylum Hill Family Development Center, in Hartford, said the department's action on the reimbursements could mean a loss of clients at day-care centers like her's. Parents may seek unlicensed care, she said, or resort to ''the day-care shuffle,'' taking children for place to place.
''I love the day care my son is in now, and he loves it,'' said Angela Berry, a single mother who lives in Hartford and works for the State Education Department. But she said that if she did not receive the state reimbursement, she probably would have to make other arrangements for her son's care.
''Some parents I know would have to stop working if they didn't have the program,'' Ms. Berry said.
 
'Tough Decisions'
Carol Mingo-Revill, child-care coordinator for Catholic Family Services, in Meriden, noted that the Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance provides child-care reimbursements to its clients for several months after they enter the work force. She said that the new limits on Purchase of Services might cause some people to go on welfare for a time, so they can qualify for child-care reimbursement when they return to work.
Officials said they were worried about future financing of the reimbursement program. It ''cannot grow without Federal dollars,'' Mr. Ginsberg said.
''These are some tough decisions for financially tough times,'' said Senator Przybysz, chairman of the legislature's Human Services Committee.
But advocates like Ms. Scoyers criticize cuts in spending on the program as a false economy.
''Some of these families are going to end up on welfare,'' she said. ''And that's going to cost more. This is a short-term investment to keep families working and a long-term investment in our children.''

HEADLINE: Raising the Standards for Appraisers

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Real Estate appraisers, under fire for their role in the savings and loan crisis and hurt by a housing recession that has spread from Montauk to Malibu, are facing tough new requirements for education, licensing and scrutiny of their work by state and Federal regulators.
An appraiser's charge has always been to exercise independent judgment about property value. That responsibility made them key watchdogs against excessive, unsustainable price escalation - and it has now put them at the center of the storm over what caused the boom-and-bust cycle that is buffeting down values.
At worst, critics say, the appraisal industry engaged in widespread fraud during the boom of the 1980's, ignoring professional standards, surrendering to pressure from lenders and sanctioning highly inflated real estate prices. At best, according to many analysts, too many appraisers were simply asleep on their watch. 
''An appraisal is supposed to reflect economic reality, and the assumptions that were made in the late 80's were unambiguously wrong,'' said David Shulman, director of real estate research at Salomon Brothers, the securities firm.
Even within the appraisal industry, executives acknowledge deep lapses. Although many appraisers are highly trained, they say a lack of uniform standards, combined with the rush atmosphere of the 80's, drew into the field many with little or no experience.
In many communities, the brokers selling houses were called upon by banks to appraise them, thereby collecting two commissions. In others, the credentials necessary to appraise a house seemed indistinguishable from those needed to lead a Boy Scout troop or a Welcome Wagon steering committee.
''We had barbers and cosmeticians appraising real estate,'' said David S. Bunton, executive vice president of the Appraisal Foundation, a group established in Washington by the nation's eight separate appraisal trade associations to write new standards for the industry and advise the Federal Government on new requirements. ''It was bound to lead to problems.''
The fallout is particularly severe in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where property values soared at the highest rate of appreciation in the nation during the 1980's, and have now fallen back. To whatever extent the blame lies with inflated appraisals, officials say it must be shared by banks and thrift institutions, which aggressively sought to expand their real estate loan portfolios, and often conveyed to the appraisers the values needed to make their deals.
''Appraisers told us that if they didn't tell banks what they wanted to hear, they wouldn't get any more assignments,'' said Lou Grossi, an examiner and appraisal industry specialist for the Connecticut Real Estate Commission.
''It was common practice,'' Mr. Bunton said. ''They called it 'hitting the numbers.' ''
Now, with much of the real estate industry reeling under the weight of foreclosures, sinking property values, failed savings and loans and deep loan losses at large commercial banks, the appraisal industry is poised for an overhaul.
Some of the changes have already been ordered by Congress, which has required all states to regulate real estate appraisal more stringently under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, better known as the savings and loan bailout bill. The law requires all appraisers working for federally chartered or insured lending institutions after July 1, 1991, to be licensed or certified by their states. Even experienced appraisers will have to enroll in courses and pass examinations to conform to the law.
Other provisions, enacted over protests from banking lobbyists, require professional appraisals for all real estate transactions in which more than $50,000 changes hands. The banks, which have argued that the appraisals are not necessary for transactions under $100,000, maintain that the provision adds unnecessary costs, which will be passed through to consumers, in small transactions.
So far, 38 states - including New York and Connecticut, but not New Jersey - have conformed to the Federal rules setting up certification courses and examinations, or establishing state commissions to enforce the Federal mandate. Not everyone is satisfied with the initial results.
''We are very concerned that this will become a process of self-regulation and of special interests overwhelming the public interest,'' said Gail S. Shaffer, the New York Secretary of State, who opposed a law, signed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in September, that gives a framework for meeting the new Federal appraisal rules.
The New York State law will establish a nine-member board, with six of the members chosen from the appraisal industry, to create courses, examinations and licensing and certification standards. Mrs. Shaffer had advocated greater state control, and objected to making appraisers a majority of the board.
Connecticut ithat anticipated Federal scrutiny and have already adopted conforming rules. The requirements for training in Connecticut, which take effect for appraisers on Jan. 1, establish two levels of credentials. One is a state license for those appraising residential real estate financed by state-chartered lenders. The higher credential is a Federal certification for those dealing with federally chartered or insured lenders, or appraising large commercial properties.
Connecticut's appraisers will have to take 165 hours of course work and have two years' experience to obtain the Federal certificate.
The new rules are still being debated in New Jersey, where a bill in the state Senate calls for separate credentials for appraisers working with state chartered and federally chartered or insured lenders. To conform to the new Federal law, the state must adopt a detailed plan by the end of the year.
Perhaps the most important aspect of the new rules, many experts say, is that they should make appraisers more independent of pressure from lenders and more accountable for their work. In future cases of real estate foreclosures or failures by lending institutions, both state and Federal regulators will review the work of appraisers, and revoke the certification or license of those who have shown themselves inept.
For home buyers, the down side of the new regulations may be higher closing costs. In most home purchases, buyers pay the fees of appraisers, even though the appraisers are selected and given their instructions by lenders.
Bank executives have sharply opposed some of the new rules, saying they will create a temporary shortage of qualified appraisers who have completed the required course work. At many small lending institutions, lending officers have for decades assumed the role of appraisers, and enrolling them in licensing and certification courses will be an added cost, the lenders say.
''Whether it's a small rural bank that suddenly has to hire outside appraisers or a bigger institution that must have its employees pass exams, there will be a cost,'' said John C. Rasmus, senior counsel for the American Bankers Association.
Others maintain the costs will be insignificant, particularly compared to the huge price now being paid because of the inflated appraisals that contributed to the savings and loan crisis. Congressional investigators, after reviewing records of failed savings and loans, found that more than 8 in 10 had glaring errors in appraisals on their books.
''The appraisers did not cause the crisis, but the various schemes by savings and loan executives would never have worked unless appraisers stepped up to the plate,'' said Peter Barash, a Washington lobbyist who last year served as staff director for the House Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs Committee, which investigated the savings and loan debacle.
Congressional testimony brought many examples to light. In one, a savings and loan in Los Angeles had a piece of undeveloped property to be subdivided for houses appraised at $3.5 million, but its appraiser's report intentionally did not mention that the land had been used as a toxic waste dump. A later appraisal put the value at $300,000.
Although no one knows how much of the thrift industry debacle would have been averted if appraisers had done a better job, Mr. Barash said studies have concluded that 20 to 25 percent of the cost of the public bailout would have been saved. The cost of the bailout is now projected at $300 billion to $500 billion.
Experts say the new requirements will force appraisers across the nation to proceed in a much more uniform way. Once training and certification programs are established in the states, uniform reporting requirements are to be established and required by the Appraisal Subcommittee, a group established by Congress with representatives of the Federal Reserve Bank, Comptroller of the Currency and other Federal agencies that oversee the banking system.
A result is likely to be much more standardized appraisal methods than those historically used. The most common in residential real estate is the ''comparable sales'' method in which appraisers examine recent selling prices of similar properties. Critics say many appraisal mistakes of the 80's were based on comparable sales analysis.
In many states where training and licensing requirements were lax or nonexistent, determining a comparable sale often meant little more than a phone call to a brokerage and an owner of a small business living in the neighborhood where a sales contract had been signed. More often, bank lending officers did the appraisal themselves. They relied on their knowledge of selling prices and assumed that values would rise quickly, thereby covering any mistakes that might be made in a slightly inflated appraisal report.
Other, more sophisticated appraisal methods are to be covered by the new law. One is the ''replacement value'' analysis, in which appraisers estimate land values, construction costs and other costs required to replace an existing building.
The other method, used to appraise commercial buildings, requires complex projections of rental income and vacancy rates, the amount of time rental property is likely to be vacant between tenants, and other variables.
Appraisal industry executives say the new Federal rules are not the only source of pressure for change. They maintain that banks and thrift institutions, which continue to pay the appraisers' commissions, have made a rapid about-face in their expectations of what appraisal reports will show and in their willingness to finance a deal in which an appraisal might be too high.
''There is definite pressure to keep values low,'' said Scruggs Love Jr., president of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, the nation's largest organization of appraisers who work on commercial real estate deals. Responding to the pressure on the industry, Mr. Love's organization is merging with the National Society of Real Estate Appraisers, the largest industry group that specializes in residential appraisals.
''Appraisers are used to pressure, but things may now have swung too far,'' Mr. Love said. In one example, he said, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency established by Congress to dispose of real estate held in the portfolios of failed thrift institutions, has adopted a policy that may lead to imprudently low appraisals.
Under the policy, announced in Washington earlier this year, the agency will assign properties to regional asset managers who will seek appraisers through competitive bids. But the asset managers will receive a bonus if the properties are sold within a year, thereby putting pressure on them to discourage appraisals considered high enough to block quick sales.
''There is a strong interest in having appraisals set low,'' Mr. Love said. ''As an appraiser, I don't think this is satisfactory procedure.''
Bankers said they, too, were encouraging their appraisers to evaluate property conservatively.
Peter Brooks, senior vice president for corporate services at Chemical Bank in New York, said ''the message now is don't give us a Mercedes appraisal when the market calls for a Ford appraisal.''
Perhaps the biggest problem for appraisers is that making an appraisal today is more difficult that at any time in memory. One reason is that the number of sales has slowed dramatically in many regions, making it much harder to find comparable sales data. Another is that the value of property has declined and may continue to sink.
''For appraisers, double-digit inflation hides a multitude of sins,'' said Mr. Bunton of the Appraisal Foundation. ''But in a declining market, no one knows when we will hit bottom. It requires appraisers to also play the role of economists, and no one can be very comfortable with that.''
''The abuses of the 1980's have led to a broad effort to make more realistic appraisals,'' said Mr. Shulman of Salomon Brothers. ''The problem is knowing what values really are.''

HEADLINE: Perspectives: New York City Planning;
Shaping a Role in a Time of Transition

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
After six months as chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, Richard L. Schaffer is making his mark as a thoughtful and academically trained professional in a position that in the past has gone to an experienced operator in city affairs.
His temperament and professional background no less than the development climate itself seem to herald a loftier, but perhaps less involved, role for the commission he heads in the development affairs of the city.
The contrast to such predecessors as Sylvia Deutsch, Herbert Sturz, John Zuccotti and Donald H. Elliott is notable. All were close to the mayors they served and heavily involved not only in shaping but also in advancing the zoning and land-use proposals they supported through the institutions of government.
They were activists. But they were operating in environments where development activity was either strong or deemed worthy of stimulation by public action. In contrast, after a burst of approvals of major long-term projects by the Board of Estimate before it was dissolved last summer, development activity and private applications for land-use changes have subsided. 
It may be time, many are saying, for long-term planning. The term is inherently vague. It could lead to a broad restudy of zoning. But it is being emphasized at a time when the City Council can be expected to move independently to reshape or undercut site-specific plans during a review procedure.
This is a period of institutional readjustment, wrought by the revised City Charter. The City Council has replaced the Board of Estimate as final decision-maker on all major land-use decisions, and, as it may turn out, minor ones as well. It is not clear how actively the office of Mayor David N. Dinkins will lobby in the Council for approval of Planning Commission decisions, or how successful it would be if it did.
In an interview, Mr. Schaffer stressed the process side of the planning function rather than substantive goals that have made some planners, in eras of urban growth of the past, play the role of civic visionary. The Planning Commission chairman is also the director of the Department of City Planning, guiding the work of a large professional force.
''Planning should be a process for managing urban change in which you balance efficiency, equity and citizen participation,'' said Mr. Schaffer, who has taught urban planning at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research. Efficiency refers to the physical conditions necessary for economic functioning. Equity refers to the relative distribution of benefits and burdens. And citizen participation, the open involvement of the public in influencing decisions, must be ''meaningful,'' he said.
Mr. Schaffer was not one of Mayor Dinkins's earlier appointments. He took office only in April, and basically supported the major, often controversial, proposals that other agencies or the Mayor's office managed to shepherd through the Board of Estimate.
He sees planning largely as an attempt to balance values and build a consensus. With development activity down, the opportunity to do this on private land-use applications is minimal. The 13-member Planning Commission has mainly been involved in exhaustively reviewing applications by the Department of Social Services for lease renewals at numerous day-care centers around the city.
Another major activity has been the preparation of a Charter-mandated document stating the criteria for choosing sites for city facilities. It will be issued in November and followed a month later by a mayoral ''statement of needs,'' in which all the facilities anticipated over the next two years are to be specified.
These Charter-mandated tasks were imposed at a time when the city's choice of sites for new transient housing for the homeless was a divisive public issue. But the statement mentions no specific type of facility, and is instead a generalized and bland statement, more notable for what it does not say than for what it does.
What it does not say is that facilities should be classified merely as beneficial or burdensome to their host communities, and that each community should have a balance of each. Instead, it distinguishes between neighborhood and regional facilities (libraries and fire houses on the one hand, for example, and garbage transfer stations and shelters for the homeless on the other) and suggests that where feasible the regional facilities should be well-dispersed.to be applied as a guide for siting choices over the next two years. A mayoral ''statement of needs'' listing these facilities is due in December.
Mr. Schaffer chairs a Planning Commission on which there is no shortage of members with a planning background. Eugenie L. Birch is director of the graduate program in urban planning at Hunter College. Victor G. Alicea holds a doctorate in urban planning. Maxine Griffith heads a planning and design firm. Amanda M. Burden directed the development of design guidelines for Battery Park City. And Ron Shiffman, who has been a force in planning and housing affairs since 1963, heads the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development.
Planners are talkers. There has been much talk over seemingly not overwhelming issues at Planning Commission hearings since the summer, according to observers, as commissioners struggle to put minor planning decisions in a suitable planning framework.
They could find none, it seems, to justify the application of Clorinda Romano, an infirm widow living at 162 East 83d Street, for a curb cut to allow her to install a driveway and use a first-floor storage area in her town house as a garage. A similar privilege had been granted previously to a neighbor. After a year of effort by her architect, 75 blueprints and a positive recommendation by the Planning Department, the commission rejected the application 7 to 2. Mr. Schaffer was in the minority.
And it was only after exhaustive discussion that the commission consented to allow a Brooklyn developer, Stephen B. Jacobs, a rezoning of a 100- by 150-foot plot for a building on Fourth Avenue that conformed to a more far-ranging zoning plan that the department's planners intend to put forth. There was hesitation about getting out ahead of the rezoning itself.
But Mr. Schaffer is sanguine about the thoroughness of the deliberations. ''Many of our commissioners believe that planning is a combination of physical, social and economic analysis,'' he said.
Once the commission acts positively, however, the applicant still faces the possibility of an adverse outcome in the City Council. Lawyers who represent major applicants planning projects already report that they are trying to involve members of the City Council's Land Use Committee, and especially its subcommittee on zoning, planning and landmarks, at an early stage of plan preparation. Undoubtedly it is too soon to judge how the City Council and the Planning Commission will interact, but applicants and their counsel plainly feel that getting projects through will require even more preliminary consultation than it has heretofore.
On the first test of the new Borough President's appeal procedure - the ''triple no'' - the City Council has shown itself prepared to overturn a land-use decision made unanimously by the Planning Commission if a Borough President protests.
In this case, a College Point, Queens, developer, Philip Schorr, was seeking a small street demapping to permit the construction of six two-family houses. The ''triple no'' refers to Borough President Claire Shulman's appeal to the Council after she and Community Board 7 in Queens had previously voted against the application, before the commission approved it. The Council voted it down last week, providing no written record of the reason. Mayor Dinkins had five days to veto the Council's action, but he let it stand.
The episode provided no reason to expect the Planning Commission or the Mayor's office to take a forceful role before the Council in backing land-use decisions in ''routine,'' if locally controversial, matters.
''It should not be expected that the City Council will agree with us in every case,'' said Mr. Schaffer. ''They didn't here. But we are at the beginning of a new process, and it's a new role for the City Council too.''
The full test of New York City's new land-use review system lies ahead.

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Inheriting a Co-op
 
Question: If a co-op owner leaves the apartment in a will to an adult son or daughter, is the co-op board obliged to approve the new owner because of the family relationship? . . . Charles Bannett, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. According to Stuart Saft, a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, most co-ops do not allow the transfer of shares and the assignment of a proprietary lease without board approval, even to the children of shareholders.
In considering approval, Mr. Saft said the board would be looking primarily for evidence that the person who has inherited the apartment would be able to handle the maintenance and mortgage payments. 
 
Buyer Beware
 
Question: With a friend, I recently bought a weekend home about 100 miles north of the city. Next to our property is a parcel owned by a group called the Ancram Landowners Association that we were told functions ''occasionally'' as a picnic site. But on our second weekend were were awakened by the sound of gunfire. The association, it seems, uses the property as a rifle range.
The shooting continued all day. We believe this information was withheld from us by both the realtor and the owner. Do we have any recourse? . . . Jan Michael Hanvik, Manhattan.
 
Answer: Maybe. According to Brook Boyd, a lawyer specializing in real estate matters, most sales contracts include a clause saying the seller makes no representations other than those in the contract. But this clause, he said, would not prevent a purchaser from getting a judgment for fraud.
''The broker,'' said Mr. Boyd, ''may be liable for fraudulent misrepresentations. And the seller may also be liable, since a broker ususally acts as the seller's agent.''
If, however, the open space was also used as a picnic area, the broker and seller may be liable only if the broker knew that the property was also used as a shooting range and it would have been difficult for the buyer to discover this on his own. He advised buyers to investigate not only the property they intend to buy, but also adjoining properties.
 
Convertible Mortgage
 
Question: I have a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage with a convertible feature. The convertible rate is based on the required net yield for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, covered by 60-day mandatory delivery commitments.
My mortgage bank can give me the 60-day figure on the first day of each month on the telephone, and some newspapers publish figures for the 30-day mandatory delivery commitment.
I want to know if it is reasonable for me to monitor the 30-day rate in the newspaper as an indicator of which direction the the 60-day rate may go? . . . Mark Teteris, Manhattan
 
Answer: Maybe. According to Arthur Saitta, an assistant vice president at the East River Savings Bank, for the past six month there has been a correllation between the two rates - a difference of .05 percent - but this is not always the case.
''Any time there is an adjustable-rate loan,'' said Mr. Saitta, ''the bank is required to disclose the performance of these indicators on a set day and month. The 30-day rate will be lower, but the margin is not always as consistient as it has been lately.''
He suggests you contact the Federal National Mortgage Association - known as Fannie Mae - for this information.

Danbury Mall Spreading Retail Ripples

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A shoppers' bonanza generated by the Danbury Fair Mall on the outskirts of Danbury is expanding, fed by a stream of seemingly recession-proof customers - some 10 million a year.
Most drive in on Route 84, a six-lane state highway that connects with major routes from New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and other parts of Connecticut.
In March, construction began on 200,000 square feet to be added to the 1.3 million-square-foot mall, which opened in 1986 and is the largest in the state. The new space, scheduled for completion next March, includes an 85,000-square-foot Lord & Taylor department store, a 50,000-square-foot building with 20 shops and a 1,500-car garage. Financing for the $38 million project was arranged by Aetna Life Insurance Company's Realty Investors unit. 
In addition, one of mall's four anchor stores, G. Fox, a unit of the chain based in Hartford, is adding 40,000 square feet.
The May Company of St. Louis, which owns 14 department store chains, acquired the Lord & Taylor stores in 1986, including one in the Westfarms Mall in Farmington and another in Stamford.
''We are in a $3.6 billion expansion project,'' said Jim Abrams, May's vice president for communications, ''expecting to open 90 new stores among the various chains through 1994, most of them located in malls.''
John Kraus, president of the management division of the Wilmorite Corporation of Rochester, which built the Danbury mall, said the site -just off exit 3 of Route 84 and once the home of the Great Danbury Fair - had been ''coveted by every developer in the country.''
''There was nothing serving that whole area out toward Brewster, N.Y., and Interstate 684,'' Mr. Kraus said.
Wilmorite, which has developed 20 malls, mainly in the Northeast, is also building the additions.
Along an eight-mile stretch east of the mall, from exit 3 to exit 8, a host of retail establishments sell a range of goods and services, including cars, furniture, clothing, electronics, food and travel packages. Mall stores tend to be more expensive and include Laura Ashley, Lenox China, Ann Taylor and Godiva Chocolates. They have attracted customers who in turn created a market for more moderately priced merchandise. Less expensive and discount stores are nearby, as are dozens of sit-down and fast-food restaurants, supermarkets, movie theaters and bowling alleys.
The growth in retail activity has sent commercial rents to $25 a square foot from $12 in the last two years, said Michael Ryer, president of Ryer Associates, a local realty firm. ''And there are few vacancies,'' he said. Rents at the mall range from $45 to $65 a square foot.
The mall generates about $400 million in annual sales and $1.8 million in tax revenues for Danbury. ''The payroll of 2,000 employees is being recycled back into the local economy,'' said Clarice Osiecki, director of the Danbury Chamber of Commerce.
The mall manager, Patricia Frisaro, said its 225 shops and 20 restaurants are 98 percent leased, and business is brisk at the four anchor department stores, G. Fox, Macy's, J. C. Penney and Sears. Surface parking for 6,000 cars is spread over the 108-acre tract.
Separated from the mall by lawns and a large duck pond is a 196,000-square-foot shopping center called Danbury Square. Developed by Zoldan Equities of White Plains, the 20-acre complex opened in 1989 with almost all of its 30 shops preleased at around $25 a square foot. Loehmann's, Innovation Luggage, Toys R Us and Herman's World of Sporting Goods are among them.
''I think retail opportunities have been ignored,'' said Alex Zoldan, the president of Zoldan Equities, ''and we will be seeing a lot more fill-in projects like ours, with stores that benefit from being near a mall but can't afford mall rents.''
A Jordan Marsh department store that closed on Federal Road in July is to be converted into a complex of furniture, home improvement and other specialty stores called Danbury Place. ''We will complement the mall,'' which is about three miles to the west, said Alexius Conroy, president of the Conroy Development Company of White Plains, the new owner.
Mr. Conroy said he was attracted to the site by Stew Leonard's, which sells dairy products, meat and produce in a huge tent for around 20 percent less than most retailers. ''Their presence makes this a destination location off exit 6 or 7,'' Mr. Conroy said.
Work is expected to begin on the 21-acre site next July, with completion by the summer of 1992. The project is expected to contain a maximum of 300,000 square feet, either through enlarging the present 170,000-square-foot building or demolishing it and rebuilding.
''We will accommodate tenants ranging in size from 2,000 to 100,000 square feet,'' Mr. Conroy said.
Stew Leonard's is building a 205,000-square-foot store on 42 acres behind the tent. Plans for the store, which is scheduled to open next August, call forlife-sized animated cows and singing milk cartons, live musicians and a petting zoo.
An older retail complex off exit 8 of the highway contains four contiguous shopping centers called Berkshire, Nutmeg Plaza, Plumtrees Plaza and Route 6 Plaza, where rents are $11 to $15 a square foot. Tenants include Service Merchandise, Bradlee's, Marshall's, Waldenbooks and Radio Shack.
''We started with 125,000 square feet in 1981,'' said Ervie Hawley, the developer. ''Now we have 650,000 square feet.''
But the success of the mall and nearby shopping centers has often been at the expense of merchants in nearby communities.
James O. Rogers, president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association in Hartford, noted that in larger cities, malls have ''separated shopping from other forms of commerce, because of a perception that downtown is unsafe, and parking is extremely inconvenient.''
''Now, even small towns are losing business to the malls,'' Mr. Rogers said.
Increasing vacancies on Main Street in Ridgefield and other communities in the Greater Danbury area have persuaded local merchants to band together to study options for keeping customers.
''We didn't want the Danbury mall to be there,'' said the president of the Ridgefield Chamber of Commerce, Pat Freeman, ''but it's a fact of life and we are going to have to deal with it.''

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Upper Madison Avenue;
Three Modest Projects for the 'Best Street in the City'

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Contrary to the growing quiet in real estate development, upper Madison Avenue may actually undergo a kind of building boomlet in coming months, with three projects approved for construction from 64th to 72d Street.
While each is modestly scaled, they might have a significant cumulative effect on that portion of the avenue within the Upper East Side Historic District, whose skyline has remained relatively unchanged in recent years even as storefronts changed constantly.
From south to north, the first project is 720 Madison, an eight-story office and retail building, with 18,000 square feet of space, near the southwest corner of 64th Street. It is being designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, of Manhattan, and developed by Joel Seiden of Kushner/Seiden Properties, also of Manhattan. The project won approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission in January. The site is now vacant. 
Mr. Seiden said he was negotiating with ''several multi-national retail tenants'' and may get a single user for the whole building. ''The building will provide a world-class home in the best retail location,'' he said, ''and we are excited about its development.''
The next project is Madison House, a 16-story apartment building on the northwest corner of 65th Street. It is being developed by David F. Frankel, of Manhattan, to designs by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, also of Manhattan. The project, on a site now occupied by a two-story taxpayer, was approved by the landmarks panel last month.
The third project, also designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, is 888 Madison Avenue, a four-story commercial building with 20,000 square feet of space above grade, on the southwest corner of 72d Street. It is being developed by Lawrence and Melvin Friedland of Manhattan. The landmarks commission approved it in April. A two-story taxpayer will be expanded and reclad in the process.
Lawrence Friedland said the construction job had been put out to bid. ''We hope to be getting our numbers back in the next month or two and commence immediately thereafter,'' he said. ''We are at present speaking to some very high-end users that are contemplating leasing the entire building. We hope to find the proper single tenant.''
''I think Madison Avenue - so far - has been very recession proof,'' he said. ''Upper Madison Avenue is probably the best street in the city - that and 57th Street.''
By Mr. Friedland's estimate, the brothers' portfolio includes a dozen buildings in the East 60's and 70's. ''We are probably the largest owners on Madison Avenue of retail space,'' he said. Besides No. 888, where seven shops were vacated for the rebuilding project, their only other vacant store on Madison is No. 744.
Retail rents on Madison Avenue, from 61st to 72d Street, range from $175 to $325 a square foot, according to figures published by the Real Estate Board of New York. Only Fifth Avenue, from 51st to 59th Street, commands a higher price - $250 to $500.
''Rents on the street are very high,'' said C. Bradley Mendelson, managing director of Edward S. Gordon. ''They are not high in comparison to the Ginza in Tokyo or 57th and Fifth, but they are high in the general context of New York City.
''The typical retailer wants 2,500 to 4,000 square feet and wants to enjoy - quote - the European shopping experience. People who go there don't go with the expectation of a large retail return at the sales level. They go for the advertising and public relations prestige.''
What about the ''mom-and-pop'' stores that also have contributed so much to the character of Madison Avenue?
''It's not a cheerful subject - I've had the worst month ever,'' said Jane Stubbs, proprietor of Stubbs Books and Prints, at 835 Madison Avenue, between 69th and 70th Streets, which specializes in architecture, with sidelines like social history, food and wine and English books from the 1930's.
''Things are slow in general,'' said Anna Christensen, owner of Chocolate Soup at No. 946, between 74th and 75th Streets. ''Everybody seems to be feeling that.'' Her 23-year-old store, which has been on Madison Avenue since 1980, specializes in children's clothing, accessories and toys. ''There are hardly any stores like mine left on Madison,'' she said. ''Most of the stores now are European. It's starting to look like Rodeo Drive.''
Among the chic European boutiques are several ''For Rent'' signs. Fourteen storefronts between 61st and 72d Streets, not counting 888 Madison, are currently vacant. Perhaps only one in three of these spaces is actually available for immediate lease, Mr. Mendelson said, with others already spoken for or tied up in larger deals involving the whole building. Yet the psychological effect can be discouraging.
''It's the principal shopping street in America,'' Ms. Stubbs said, ''and to have these vacancies is quite grim.'' Or as Mr. Mendelson described 888 Madison in its current condition: ''For the lay person on the street, it looks like a depression.''
''The stores that are empty eventually get filled,'' said Halina Rosenthal, president of the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, a preservation group that keeps a close watch on the area. ''The problem is that the rents are totally out of sight. What do you have to sell in order to make that? How many handbags? In the long run, the only people who can afford it are people who are using it as a showcase. They don't count on the store to make money. All they need is the presence on Madison. The smaller shops that have to sell - I don't see how they can make it.''
With varying levels of enthusiasm, the preservation group supported all three of the new Madison Avenue developments.
Perhaps the greatest enthusiasm was expressed for 888 Madison, whose facade is divided into limestone and terra-cotta bays. The landmarks panel said the building would be ''richly articulated in the tradition of late 19th- and early 20th-century buildings, expressed in a modern vocabulary of materials and design,'' that it would be ''in keeping with the scale and massing of other buildings in the streetscape'' and ''sensitive to its prominent corner site.''
Although zoning rules would have permitted an apartment building two and a half times larger than the commercial development, the landmarks commission would probably have taken a very dim view of a tower at that corner. Also, Mr. Friedland said, a big residential development was not what he and his brother had in mind. ''We were really not looking to make a great deal of money,'' he said. ''We were just interested in doing a nice project. We never wanted a larger building. That's not our thing.''
Asked why 720 Madison Avenue was kept small, John H. Beyer, the architect, said: ''We decided on eight stories because of the design context. A 12- or 15-story building would have been terrible. There is no way Landmarks would have approved it.''
Also, he said, the size of the elevator and mechanical core needed for a taller building would have been impractically large, given the small size of the building lot.
The first Madison House proposal called for a 22-story tower and the razing of two adjacent brownstones. Preservationists were adamantly opposed. The architect, Hugh Hardy, returned with a second proposal, for a 15-story building that would not require demolition of the brownstones. The project went through a third change, to improve the marketability of the apartment layouts.
One project that preservationists wanted nothing to do with was an 11-story building proposed for the southeast corner of 67th Street by the developer Burton Handelsman and the architect Thomas diCarlo.
In denying the application last month, the landmarks commission criticized the building's scale and the way in which three row houses on the site, dating from 1871, were incorporated into the new structure.

HEADLINE: Minority Firm Joins Davis, Brody Architects

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
One of the most prominent minority-owned architectural practices in New York, Bond Ryder & Associates, was absorbed last week by the much larger firm of Davis, Brody & Associates.
Although the 21-year-old Bond Ryder office had managed thus far in the recession to stay busy, its melding with Davis, Brody was partially a hedge against the lean and bruisingly competitive times faced by the profession, particularly small firms.
As part of the change, J. Max Bond Jr. has become a partner at Davis, Brody. Nine of his 12 colleagues moved with him from mid-Manhattan to join some 100 architects in the Davis, Brody offices at Hudson and Spring Streets. The firm, founded in 1952, is best known for big residential projects in Manhattan - Zeckendorf Towers at Union Square, Waterside on the East River and Riverbend Houses in Harlem, for example - as well as academic, commercial and institutional buildings. 
A founding partner of Bond Ryder, Mr. Bond is also dean of the School of Architecture and Environmental Studies at the City College of New York and a past member of the City Planning Commission.
The other founding partner, Donald P. Ryder, is retiring. It was his decision to do so that prompted Mr. Bond to restructure the practice.
Among Bond Ryder's better known works are the Martin Luther King Center for Social Change, in Atlanta, which includes Dr. King's tomb; the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, on Lenox Avenue, between 135th and 136th Streets; the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, near Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and the Towers on the Park apartments on Frederick Douglass Circle, at the northwest corner of Central Park.
''That is a firm with a tremendous history,'' said David Castro-Blanco, of Castro-Blanco Piscioneri & Associates of Manhattan, who recently headed the minority resources committee of the American Institute of Architects.
''Bond Ryder created a climate of good work and an aura of success, which is so much needed in the minority community,'' he said. ''So in that sense, it's a loss. But it comes with a gain. It enhances the opportunities for Bond Ryder to do work that they would otherwise have been excluded from and, from a professional point of view, that is terrific.''
''We view it as very positive,'' Mr. Bond said in an interview conducted among packing crates and mailing tubes during the last hours in his old office at 244 West 49th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.
''This would make a firm that is far more representative of the diversity in the New York community,'' Mr. Bond said. ''There are very few black partners in really good firms. I hope this would represent another kind of opportunity for black and minority architects.''
''I don't think, personally, that there will be any loss of identity,'' he said. ''It will really increase the resources we can provide to the clients we've traditionally served.''
Both Mr. Bond and Lewis Davis, a partner in Davis, Brody, said their firms share a broad philosophy.
''We always felt that architects had a social responsibility,'' Mr. Davis said, ''that it wasn't enough to do a little gem, that we had to do more. Each firm was interested in housing from the outset.''
Mr. Bond got together this past summer with Mr. Davis, a longtime friend and associate, who recalled their breakfast this way:
''Max looked a little solemn. He said: 'Don Ryder has decided to retire. For me to be dean and run the office is going to be impossible. I have several options. I could disband the firm completely and be an academic or I could work with somebody.' I looked at him and said, 'Why don't you join us?' It was a spontaneous reaction.''

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Of Belts and Bags and Baby Seats

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
My daughter picked up her first new car last Wednesday. Her name is Jonalyn, and she and I spent a lot of time in the dealer's lot trying to figure out how well the mechanized seat belts would work with the child-safety seat.
She is the same age that I was when I bought my first new car, but there are differences. There were no serious baby seats in 1962, and my car was a harvest gold Corvair Monza because I was hot for a sporty coupe. Jonni is interested in safety and practicality and her car is an alabaster Ford Escort station wagon. 
Safeness is the trend today, whether in general well-being or as it relates to risk and automobiles, and Jonalyn is at one with her generation. But buyers - and legislators - of any age have become more concerned with safety at the wheel. As an example, 36 states and the District of Columbia now have laws requiring seat-belt use, and all 50 states require safety seats for infants.
As it turned out, the manual lap belt in Jonni's new Ford worked just fine. The motorized shoulder belt that had worried us just went buzz-zoom and swooped up and over the child seat. In fact, my 3-month-old grandbaby was probably the safest person in the car, riding backward and strapped in tight enough to trap a gurgle.
The Escort is a neat little car, a clone of the Mazda Protege, and I was pleased when my daughter and son-in-law sought my approval of their purchase. But, like a lot of automobiles these days, Ford's Escort does have those infuriating motorized belts that trundle across the top of the door to provide shoulder protection.
They meet 1991's Federal edict on passive safety, but they are less than safe because they don't complete the job of buckling up.
A lap belt is crucial for protection in a crash, and the Sturm und Drang of all that motorized buzziness lulls an occupant into forgetting that the lap belt still must be latched by hand. In addition, the robot belts are annoying, startling the unwary, prone to choke you, and intent on knocking things out of your hands.
They are, however, the main form of compliance with the passive-restraint law, at least until air bags become universal. Happily, that is happening, and most of the early critics, this one included, are now convinced that the balloons work, inflating and deflating in a fraction of a second to protect drivers from serious harm in frontal collisions.
Chrysler claims to be the world leader in air-bag production, and all of its American-made cars now have a bag in the hub of the steering wheel. General Motors will triple the number of its cars with driver-side bags during the 1991 model year, and the corporation says that its entire fleet will have them by the fall of 1995. Ford, too, will have them in all of its cars by the mid-90's, and driver-side bags now are standard on nine of the company's lines.
Foreign makers also offer air bags in many of their cars, and Mercedes-Benz was the first of the world's manufacturers to make them standard, adding them to a couple of 1985 models. The following year, the company made them standard across the line. Generally, the bags, known as supplemental restraint systems or S.R.S., are installed only on the driver's side, but more and more passenger bags are being offered as standard or optional equipment.
Detroit has had its share of brickbats when it comes to safety, but it was Cadillac that first attempted to sell air bags, making them available as an option in 1974. The experiment was a dismal failure and it proved what the auto makers thought they had known all along: In those days, and earlier, safety just didn't sell.
Ford had learned the lesson the hard way back in 1956, when it added such features as ''deep-dish'' steering wheels, seat belts, padded dashboards and safety door latches. The company mounted a Lifeguard Design ad campaign - and lost a vast number of sales to Chevrolet, no matter that the ads featured a cuddly ''safety bear'' who pointed out the sensibility of the new devices.
There may have been other elements that hurt the company's marketing performance, but Ford quickly ended the campaign, while keeping the improvements. In Detroit, at the time, the saying was that ''Ford sells safety but Chevrolet sells cars.''
All of that has changed, and new-car dealers now say safety ranks with quality in the top considerations of their customers. In fact, a survey by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that 68 percent of buyers rate safety as the most important criteria in making their choice.
Next to air bags and three-point seat belts, antilock brakes are perhaps the most important new technology, but better handling, all-wheel drive and improved vehicle structures also contribute to making automobiles safer than ever. Unfortunately, though, even the best technology can't defeat the laws of physics, and the size of a car is still a major factor in its safety. All things being equal, the larger the car the safer the people inside.
According to the insurance institute, the problem with small cars isn't confined to crashes with larger vehicles, although it is true that the occupants of the smaller cars fare worse. But even in single-vehicle accidents, the death rate for occupants of small cars is more than double the rate for larger cars.
Figures from the insurance institute also show that claims for crash damages are much higher for small cars than for large ones, and all of that can be particularly dismaying as soaring gas prices spur ever lighter and tinier automobiles.
Economy is important, of course, and compromises must be made. My daughter's Ford Escort is one of those small cars that we are talking about, and one can only hope it doesn't get bent in any serious way. After all, the grandbaby is my first. His name, by the way, is Henry Marshall.

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
When the World Series traveled west, from Cincinnati to Oakland, the other day, a group of men moved east to continue a process that could have a far greater impact on many more cities throughout the country than the two whose teams are in the World Series.
The group consisted of two teams of negotiators involved in talks for a new agreement between the major leagues and the minor leagues. Fans don't pay much attention to such matters, but the negotiations will affect 202 teams in 19 minor leagues in the United States, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. More than 25 million people saw those teams play this year.
Major league officials have said they hope to conclude the talks by the end of the World Series, or at least the end of this month. But the reaction of the minor league people to the economic proposal presented by the majors last Thursday in Washington indicated they would have great difficulty meeting that deadline. 
''The proposal that has been presented has far-reaching effects,'' said Sal Artiaga, commissioner of the National Association, the umbrella organization for the minor leagues. ''The economic package on the table would bankrupt us. We are willing to do our part, but the terms that have been proposed are way out of line.''
That was Artiaga's initial reaction to the proposal. By yesterday, he said both sides had moved beyond their original positions and he characterized the development as progress.
The major leagues want to reduce the amount of their subsidy to the minors. If they cannot reach an agreement, the minor leagues would have a drastically different look next season. Owners of minor league clubs would still own them, but they wouldn't have any players.
The players, about 100 in each organization, belong to the major league clubs. If there is no agreement with the National Association, the players would still play but in a different setting. Major league officials have been working on contingency plans, and while no complete plan has been adopted, ''they are far enough along that they feel comfortable with it,'' an official of one club said.
Barring a new agreement, minor league baseball for the most part, if not completely, would be played in Florida and Arizona multi-field complexes used for spring training and the lowest classifications of the minors.
There has been some talk of having upper-classification teams, AAA and perhaps AA, play in their existing cities if stadiums are available, but some clubs prefer having all of their teams at their complexes.
The plans will be discussed, and very likely completed, the first week of next month when general managers, farm directors and scouting directors gather at their annual meetings in Scottsdale, Ariz.
The expiring agreement ''has not been changed in decades,'' said Steve Greenberg, deputy commissioner of the major leagues. Known as the player development contract, it covers the areas subsidized by major league teams in their working agreements with their minor league affiliates. Included are such expenses as salaries of players, managers and coaches and costs for spring training, medical payments and travel. The current cost is about $2 million per club, according to Bill Murray, director of baseball operations in the commissioner's office.
The majors want the minors to pick up what they think would be a more equitable share of the expenses. They were prompted to seek a reduction in their subsidy because of the escalation in the value of minor league franchises.
Joe Buzas, a longtime owner of minor league clubs, acknowledged that he could get $5 million for his New Britain, Conn., club, a franchise he was given 35 years ago. He bought the Portland, Ore., club five years ago, he said, for $1 million and could sell it today for $6 million. In 1976, he added, he bought the Reading, Pa., club for a token dollar then sold it 10 years later for $1 million.
In 1979, Ben Bernard bought the franchise in West Haven, Conn., for about $75,000, then moved it to Albany a year later and sold the club in 1985 for more than $2.5 million. The Edmonton franchise of the Pacific Coast League is changing ownership for $6 million Canadian. Teams in the Class A California League that a few years ago sold for about $125,000 now bring between $900,000 and $1.2 million.
The negotiations involve other elements, but it is the amount of the subsidy that will determine the success of the talks.
''We don't want to see a major disruption of minor league baseball, but we want to see the contract improved,'' Commissioner Fay Vincent said. ''As of this moment, I'm not pessimistic about an agreement. I don't know how optimistic I can be. I'm hopeful.''
 
Randolph's Three-Decade Streak
 Willie Randolph, who had an outstanding career as the Yankees' second baseman, continues to prosper while his former team has deteriorated. Not only is he back in the World Series, an achievement that has eluded the Yankees for nine years, but he has also joined an elite circle.
Willie Mays, Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, Jimmy (Ace) Wilson and Randolph are the only players who have had World Series hits in three different decades. Wilson did it for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1928-30-31 and Cincinnati in 1940.
''I didn't even think about playing in three different decades, let alone getting hits in all of them,'' an obviously pleased Randolph said. ''That's nice. It's pretty neat. It's something to tell my grandchildren about. And since I have four kids, I guess I'll have plenty of grandchildren to tell.''
 
A Fine for Reds' Owner?
 Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, has not gained any praise for her post-season behavior.
Before the first game in Cincinnati, she went on the field twice and addressed the fans to tell them that the Series was being dedicated to United States troops in the Middle East. Except she never got it quite right. Once she referred to ''East-West'' and the other time to ''Far East.''
Major league officials were embarrassed by her comments and her demeanor. She was told not to take the microphone the second time, but she did anyway. Schott most likely will face disciplinary action - a fine - by Commissioner Fay Vincent after the Series, but such action is never announced.
 
Padres: No Trade for Gwynn
 Tony Gwynn, who had an unhappy end to his season in San Diego, was a topic of discussion among officials and others. One person who thought he was being helpful whispered to Gene Michael and Stump Merrill of the Yankees that Gwynn was available if they wanted to try to make a trade for him.
The only problem with that idea is the Padres don't plan to trade their best hitter.
''He's not available,'' said Joe McIlvaine, the team's new general manager. ''I intend to hold onto him. I'd like to have him on my side for once. I'm sick and tired of seeing him beat us.''
 
Post-Season Sharing
 The Mets and the Cincinnati Reds have clearly expressed their views of former teammates.
Ken Griffey Sr. left the Reds in mid-August (he initially ''retired,'' then was released), but his teammates have voted him a full World Series share. The Mets traded Mike Marshall to Boston in late July, and his teammates voted him no part of a share of their second-place money.
The Mets, on the other hand, awarded a half-share each to Tom Herr, Charlie O'Brien and Pat Tabler, all late-season acquisitions. Daryl Boston, whom the Mets signed three weeks into the season, will receive a full share.
Marshall, however, will not go through the winter without any post-season money. The Red Sox voted him a one-quarter share of their division championship money.
Dave Johnson, whom the Mets dismissed as manager after seven weeks of the season, was voted a one-third share, and Chuck Hiller, who became the third-base coach when Bud Harrelson became the manager, will receive two-thirds of a full share.
The Pittsburgh Pirates showed their appreciation for the pitching performances turned in by Zane Smith and Randy Tomlin, both of whom joined the team in August. Each was voted a three-quarters share.
The most unusual award was voted by the San Francisco Giants to Dan Quisenberry, who relieved in five games for them early in the season before he retired. His former teammates voted Quisenberry $26 from their third-place money and will accompany the award with a note. Quisenberry could not explain the $26 award or the note.

BLACK, FRENCH, AND AFRICAN
A Life of Leopold Sedar Senghor.
By Janet G. Vaillant.
Illustrated. 388 pp.
Cambridge, Mass.
Harvard University Press. $29.95.
Leopold Sedar Senghor has led the double life that many writers clearly dream of (whatever Plato may have thought about the place of poets in a republic) but that very few are ever allowed to lead - successful careers at one and the same time in art and in politics, so that mastery of the word is accompanied by mastery of men, so to speak. Still alive today at 84, he has seen his literary efforts marked by the publication of various books of verse - beginning in 1945 with ''Chant d'Ombre'' - and crowned in 1984 by his election to the immortals of the Academie Francaise. Also in the 1940's, he was prominent among those leaders who guided his native Senegal - a small, poor but interesting West African nation - out of colonialism, and he was the principal figure in Senegal's achievement in 1960 of independence from France. As president, Mr. Senghor was no poetic figurehead. He ruled Senegal with real power until he stepped down as president in 1980, at age 74. 
Although some of his literary fame in France probably derived from his political prominence, his achievement as a poet is genuine. Mr. Senghor developed a striking style that reflects a colonial's exhilaration with his master's language (there is probably no sweeter literary high), but a reverence liberated almost from the start by his selection of models (Rimbaud and Baudelaire in particular) who emphasized imagination and originality and subverted French cultural norms. His own poetry was chiefly inspired by his brooding on the problems of race and identity that have teased cultivated Africans suspended between two worlds - on the one hand, the mythic past and still potent myth-making present of Africa, and on the other, the glories and dangers of European civilization, of which alienation from Africa was the most provocative.
Trained as an academic in Senegal and Paris, smitten by the allure of complex ideas elegantly expressed, he tried to think out what he early understood to be his delicate position between Africa and Europe. Mr. Senghor's name is forever linked with those of Aime Cesaire of Martinique and Leon Damas of French Guyana as the main spokesman for the controversial idea of Negritude (the term is actually Cesaire's).
Negritude refers to an African essence, replete with philosophical and psychological consequences, that is distinct from the European essence, which carries its own contrary baggage. As the three men freely admitted from the start, Negritude was inspired in large part by their readings of black American writers such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Alain Locke and Langston Hughes, who had been forced by raw American racism to question the absolutist cultural claims of whites long before colonial intellectuals began to do so.
As important as Mr. Senghor has been as a poet, ''Black, French, and African'' is only a little concerned with him in that way. Janet G. Vaillant's textual analyses are prudent as far as they go, but she does not dwell either on the mystery of his individual creativity as a poet or on more than the basic elements of his formal development. Even more submerged in the book than his poetry is Mr. Senghor's personal life, a fact that will not please some lovers of biography, or of gossip. For example, three women are mentioned as his romantic involvements, but although he married two of them, all are given the shortest of shrifts - passed over in hardly more than two or three lines. In a male biographer, such discretion today might lead to charges of sexism; in any biography, and especially one of a poet, it tends to foreclose the possibility of definitiveness.
The curious thing is that one can tell that Ms. Vaillant - a former Bunting Fellow at Radcliffe and now an associate director at Harvard's Soviet and East European Language and Area Center program - knows a lot more about Mr. Senghor than she lets on; she seems informed even when she is close-mouthed. Less successfully, she also depends at times on what one might call a romantic notion of psychology typical of many biographers, whose subjects, for example, often have nervous breakdowns because of ''overwork.'' In Mr. Senghor's case, depression at one point seems to lead to malaria, which is equally curious as psychology or as tropical medicine.
In large part, Ms. Vaillant may be responding in her omissions to the fact that from the start Mr. Senghor was more foxy and timidly elusive than impetuous or even brave in facing the world. On paper, as a poet, he was hot-blooded, but in real life he seemed to prize control. He was almost prim compared with the fierce beauty of his lines, the sparks struck by his theorizing about culture and the intrinsic glamour of his transcultural situation.
Even so, there is an important story to be told, in that Leopold Senghor's life and Senegal itself are distinguished by challenging paradoxes and anomalies. He achieved his political triumph in Senegal in spite of the fact that he was of the Serer tribe in a land dominated by the Wolof and on a continent apparently dominated by ethnic rivalries; he was also a Christian when most of his countrymen were Muslim. He ruled with authority, yet was also the first African leader in modern times (or so it is said) to give up power voluntarily. Negritude did not prevent him from keeping the French so closely involved in Senegal's affairs that the nation sometimes seemed independent in name only.
Mr. Senghor's career might not have been possible elsewhere in Africa: Senegal possesses a longstanding tradition of electoral politics and consensus-seeking that facilitated his vision of a community moving into the modern economic and industrial world in partnership with its former masters. According to Amnesty International, the nation has maintained a fine record on human rights - the envy of the rest of Africa, if the rest of Africa could envy such a thing. Even an apparent attempt at a coup d'etat during Mr. Senghor's presidency was not only bloodless but almost apologetic in tone.
Ms. Vaillant is adept at examining the particular realities of Serer, Wolof, Muslim and Christian social practices and traditions in Senegal, and at locating Mr. Senghor in youth and age within this complicated structure. She is also sound in critically examining key phases, events and elements in his career, including the depth of his love of French culture and French people - his second of his two wives was French - even as he was pushing Negritude. Also well treated here is Mr. Senghor's emphasis on consensus in political dealings, which made him seem unprincipled or opportunist at times but did not prevent a certain ruthlessness from surfacing late in his career, when he was derided as ''the little Nazi'' by some Senegalese (who obviously hadn't met any real Nazis). For all its discretions, ''Black, French, and African'' is a noteworthy study of a remarkable life.

MEMOIRS OF GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN
Edited by Charles Royster.
Illustrated. 1,136 pp. New York:
The Library of America. $35.
Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman formed a remarkable team. Grant was steady, reticent and self-assured, Sherman brilliant, volatile and self-critical. Native Ohioans and graduates of West Point who resigned from the antebellum Army, both men experienced difficult times early in the Civil War. But they quickly learned they could count on one another and forged an unshakable personal and professional bond. ''You are now Washington's legitimate successor,'' Sherman told Grant in March 1864, ''and . . . if you can continue as heretofore to be yourself, simple, honest, and unpretending, you will enjoy through life the respect and love of friends, and the homage of millions of human beings . . . for securing to them and their descendants a government of law and stability.'' Grant praised Sherman similarly in January 1865, remarking on ''how noble a man he is'' and adding: ''I am glad to say that I appreciated Sherman from the first feeling him to be what he has proven to the world he is.'' 
''Memoirs and Selected Letters: Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Selected Letters 1839-1865'' and ''Memoirs of General W. T. Sherman'' illuminate this fascinating collaboration, leaving no doubt that Grant acted as the superior and Sherman the gifted lieutenant. Sherman told a fellow officer, ''I'm a damned sight smarter than Grant; I know more about organization, supply and administration and about everything else than he does; but I'll tell you where he beats me and where he beats the world. He don't care a damn for what the enemy does out of his sight but it scares me like hell.''
Grant's unswerving expectation of victory inspired Sherman, whose moods shifted from elation to despondency, freeing him to pursue his friend's strategic designs with absolute confidence. ''I knew wherever I was that you thought of me,'' Sherman wrote Grant in recalling their campaigns of 1862-63, ''and if I got in a tight place you would come - if alive.'' Grant allowed his subordinate ample latitude and praised him often. When Sherman's critics suggested he had not conceived the march to the sea, Grant silenced them with a single crisp sentence in his ''Personal Memoirs'': ''The question of who devised the plan of march from Atlanta to Savannah is easily answered: it was clearly Sherman, and to him also belongs the credit of its brilliant execution.''
Each of the memoirs revises popular perceptions about its author. The editors, leading scholars in the field, have supplied detailed biographical chronologies, notes and commentaries on the texts, and the decision to append 176 of Grant's letters to his narrative permits readers to compare his postwar recollections with what he wrote at various points in his life (Sherman's book already contained a number of his important letters). It is a commonplace that Grant possessed ordinary talent but won victories because of Northern industrial capacity and reserves of manpower. His memoirs demolish this view by revealing the mixture of subtlety and daring that yielded magnificent results at Vicksburg, Chattanooga and the crossing of the James River in June 1864. Grant sometimes did resort to foolish frontal assaults, as he frankly admitted: ''I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made. I might say the same thing of the assault of the 22nd of May, 1863, at Vicksburg.'' Over all, however, Grant had exceptional strategic vision.
The key to Grant's leadership may be found in his tribute to Zachary Taylor: ''General Taylor was not an officer to trouble the administration much with his demands, but was inclined to do the best he could with the means given him. . . . No soldier could face either danger or responsibility more calmly than he. These are qualities more rarely found than genius or physical courage.'' Grant possessed those ''rare qualities'' in abundance. His decision to accompany the Army of the Potomac in the spring of 1864, rather than return to the West where he and Sherman had gained so many successes, underscored both a sense of responsibility and a belief in his own moral strength: ''When I got to Washington and saw the situation it was plain that here was the point for the commanding general to be,'' he wrote. ''No one else could, probably, resist the pressure that would be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans and pursue others.''
Grant's plan for final victory sought to destroy the logistical underpinnings of the Confederacy. Before Shiloh, he had tried ''to protect the property of the citizens whose territory was invaded. . . . After this, however, I regarded it as humane to both sides to protect the persons of those found at their homes, but to consume everything that could be used to support or supply armies.'' His vision of war thus veered toward a modern framework within which civilian property and morale became legitimate targets. Sherman's last campaign through Georgia and the Carolinas, and Philip H. Sheridan's destruction of the lower Shenandoah Valley in 1864, implemented Grant's broad strategy with terrible effect.
Grant nonetheless satisfied the American preference for reluctant soldier-heroes. When he arrived at West Point he did not expect to stay in the Army for life, or even to graduate. He never glorified combat and he thought the Civil War worthwhile only because it opened opportunity to a larger segment of society and confirmed the strength of republican government in the United States. ''This war was a fearful lesson,'' he warned near the end of his memoirs, ''and should teach us the necessity of avoiding wars in the future.''
Grant's personal memoirs have earned plaudits from critics over the years. Free of the romantic gloss that encumbers many Civil War reminiscences, the narrative marches forward in economical prose that occasionally achieves true distinction. The work also enjoys a reputation for honesty and fairness. But in fact Grant ignored the controversy over his alleged drinking problem; he treated his able Chief of Staff John A. Rawlins shabbily; he forgave Sherman's and Sheridan's lapses while holding others outside his inner circle to a more demanding standard; and he habitually inflated Confederate manpower while reducing his own. He also kept silent about personal details that have vexed students over the years, such as how a young man christened Hiram Ulysses Grant became Ulysses S. Grant (the middle initial stood for nothing) at West Point and remained so thereafter.
Sherman's memoirs appear less graceful because many letters and documents interrupt their flow; yet Sherman conveys greater lyric power than his friend. ''Then we turned our horses' heads to the east,'' he wrote of the start of the march to the sea. ''Atlanta was soon lost behind the screen of trees, and became a thing of the past. . . . The day was extremely beautiful, clear sunlight, with bracing air, and an unusual feeling of exhilaration seemed to pervade all minds - a feeling of something to come, vague and undefined, still full of venture and intense interest.'' Blunt by nature, Sherman told more of the personal side of his story. Typical is his account of a crisis in 1861-62 when several newspapers questioned his sanity for insisting that the pacification of Kentucky would require 200,000 Union troops. He admitted that his countrymen believed ''there was more or less of truth in the rumor that the cares, perplexities, and anxiety of the situation had unbalanced my judgment and mind.'' ''I could not deny the fact,'' he continued, ''and had to submit to all its painful consequences for months. . . . The newspapers kept harping on my insanity and paralyzed my efforts. In spite of myself, they tortured from me some words and acts of imprudence.'' Grant's encouragement helped Sherman, who flirted with suicide in late 1861, and the pair began their notable string of victories at Shiloh in April 1862.
Sherman's memoirs also highlight the irony of his reputation as the South's grimmest foe. Sherman liked the South. Slavery troubled him scarcely at all. He held the superintendency of what became Louisiana State University during 1860, left that post reluctantly after Louisiana seceded and blamed the war on ''mad'' Southern leaders who ''seemed determined that their people should drink of the very lowest dregs of the cup of war, which they themselves had prepared.'' Although he saw the need to provide land for freed slaves, he expressed more concern that attention to black rights might alienate Southern whites and produce anarchy in the postwar South.
Military imperatives led Sherman to repress his fondness for the South. He believed waging hard war would hasten the end of fighting and save Northern and Southern lives in the long run. ''If the people raise a howl against my barbarity and cruelty,'' he stated after ordering civilians to evacuate their homes in Atlanta, ''I will answer that war is war, and not popularity-seeking. If they want peace, they and their relatives must stop the war.'' He concluded that ''the people of the South would read in this measure two important conclusions: one, that we were in earnest; and the other, if they were sincere in their common and popular clamor 'to die in the last ditch,' that the opportunity would soon come.''
Unlike Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, the Confederacy's premier military team, Grant and Sherman neither solicited divine help nor looked to elan to accomplish their ends. Relying instead on superior Northern resources sternly applied, they destroyed the Southern will to resist and forced the principal Confederate armies to surrender. Their memoirs do much to explain how they achieved victory and anticipated the coming century's mode of warfare. To follow Grant and Sherman across the brutal landscape of the Civil War is an engrossing and instructive journey.

NORTH OF HOPE
By Jon Hassler.
518 pp. New York:
Ballantine Books. $19.95.
Since 1977, with the publication of ''Staggerford,'' Jon Hassler has given us a series of wonderful novels that have earned glowing reviews and a loyal, fervent following among those fortunate enough to have discovered his work. Until recently, however, he seems to have been published halfheartedly. One reason may be that his novels are all set in northern Minnesota, branding him a ''regional'' writer. 
The conventional wisdom seems to have been that Mr. Hassler's novels were of ''specialized interest,'' a phrase used in the business to describe books that publishers don't know how to market. Often these are the best books - too imaginative and well written to fit genre formulas, too accessible to be seen as ''literary'' in the strict Henry James/William Faulkner sense. In fact, Mr. Hassler is one of those writers who make storytelling look so easy that the severe guardians of contemporary literature may be suspicious.
Part of Jon Hassler's brilliance has always been his ability to achieve the depth of real literature through such sure-handed, no-gimmicks, honest language that the result appears effortless. So perhaps it will not be surprising if ''North of Hope,'' his brooding, meditative new novel, is the one that makes him the household name he deserves to be. It's his longest and, in some respects, his most ambitious novel, but it's also a book that, for all its virtues, reveals its author's struggles. For once Mr. Hassler hasn't managed his customary illusion of effortlessness.
''North of Hope'' is a love story. In fact, its hero, Father Frank Healy, has two great loves - the Roman Catholic Church and Libby Girard, whom he first meets when both are in their teens. However, the resulting conflict involves not the easy, cliched duality of man's spiritual and earthly nature but rather a conflict between a rewarding faith that offers a way of living in the real world (not escaping from it) and a woman who heals Frank Healy's spirit even as she tempts his flesh. Indeed, the ''call'' Frank hears most clearly throughout the novel, the one he ignores so that he can become a priest, is the voice within that says, repeatedly, ''She's the one,'' a voice he can never dispel.
Like many of Mr. Hassler's protagonists, Frank Healy is a born teacher. But Frank is forced by the closing of his beloved Aquinas Academy (where he had acted as headmaster and baseball coach) into parish work, for which he is less ideally suited and which is driving him, literally, to drink. He finds himself serving not one but two parishes, the first an economically viable church in his hometown of Linden Falls, the second a virtually defunct church with an exploding stove and squirrels in its belfry on the Indian reservation across the lake.
Not surprisingly, Frank is drawn more strongly to the reservation church, which his bishop warns him is edging toward extinction. In an age of declining religious vocations, there just aren't enough priests to go around, and it seems a foregone conclusion that before long the few remaining faithful on the reservation will have to commute to the Linden Falls parish 19 miles away. Is this the same robust faith that dispatched the rugged missionary priests of earlier centuries across the frozen Minnesota lakes, sometimes to be martyred for their efforts? Much is made of the contrast.
Also residing on the reservation, in addition to the handful of Ojibwa faithful, is Libby Girard, Frank's boyhood love, who has married a drug-pushing physician named Tom Pearsall. Together they have been banished to the northern Minnesota Indian reservation to do community work after Tom has run afoul of the law in his Chicago practice. In such remote places and among such marginal fringes of the faithful, Mr. Hassler suggests, the most important battles of faith and love are waged. Libby wonders if, having been exiled so far from civilization, she and her husband and her emotionally damaged daughter, Verna, might be living north of hope - and, by extension, of grace. Frank wonders too. His own faith, purchased at the price of his happiness, is slowly leaking away, a fact he attempts to share with his startled Linden Falls parishioners when he informs them from the pulpit that ''God is elusive.''
Those who know Mr. Hassler's work will not be surprised to discover that faith, hope and love are the central themes of his new book. But in his other novels, these same serious themes have been counterbalanced by a dark, delightfully irreverent sense of humor. Mr. Hassler may believe that the living of life is serious business, but watching his characters muddle along is often hysterically funny, in part because of Mr. Hassler's Twain-like willingness to examine and expose, to great comic effect, the often selfish, always human motives of even those characters for whom he feels deep affection.
In ''North of Hope'' this fine balance is tilted. It may be that the author has chosen to confront a subject that is for him no joking matter, thereby cutting himself off from an essential part of his artistic personality. Frank Healy's sad life and the sad condition of the church he so dearly loves do not offer up many laughs. Nor should they, of course. But some readers may suspect that in much of the novel Mr. Hassler is suppressing his own inner voice, in much the same fashion that Frank Healy suppresses the voice that insists ''she's the one.''
This possibility is borne out when the novel leaves Frank's point of view to follow the adventures of the novel's vivid, exuberant minor characters, like the long-suffering Caesar Pipe, leader of the Basswood reservation Indians; Vernon Jessen, Libby's cruel and paranoid first husband; Adrian Lawrence, the sweet, generous, slow-witted monsignor (nicknamed ''Loving Kindness'' by cynical, unkind younger priests), who is troubled in his advanced old age by erotic dreams; and the meddling Eunice Pfeiffer, a frustrated spinster whose single desire in life, after losing her own opportunity for love, is to give God a priest. Indeed, the novel's most memorable seriocomic invention is the Dickensian midget Toad Majerus, whose profound fury in response to the continuing abuse he suffers is kept in check with willed good humor until the end of the novel.
Throughout most of the book, Mr. Hassler seems to follow Frank and Libby out of affection and duty; his minor characters he follows with joy and, we suspect, blessed relief. For this reason, ''North of Hope'' is unlikely to replace the flawless ''Grand Opening'' as Jon Hassler's masterpiece. But Mr. Hassler is a writer so good that he suffers only by comparison to his own best work.

CUBA
A Journey.
By Jacobo Timerman.
Translated by Toby Talbot.
125 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $18.95.
The Castro regime has finally started to get the reputation it deserves. But it has been a long time coming. Perhaps it is the continuing, unremitting hostility of the United States Government toward revolutionary Cuba (only during the first two years of the Carter Administration was a genuine dialogue even considered) that causes so many liberal Americans to keep extending the intellectual free pass that the Cuban Government has enjoyed since 1959. Even revelations that Cuba set up prison camps in the late 1960's for homosexuals, and the admission during last year's show trial of Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, the former commander of Cuba's expeditionary forces in Angola, that senior figures in the regime had been involved in drug trafficking, did little to shake the faith of Cuba's foreign sympathizers. 
It is still all too common, in places like Beverly Hills and the Upper West Side of Manhattan, to hear criticisms of Cuba either dismissed out of hand or attributed to the distorting effect of the American economic blockade. As the Argentine journalist Jacobo Timerman remarks with bitter scorn in his new book on Cuba, ''It would take more than a Freudian or Lacanian psychoanalyst to explain why non-Cuban Castroists accept the demythification of the Communist leaders of Eastern Europe and China but remain mesmerized by El Comandante.''
''Cuba: A Journey,'' Mr. Timerman's fierce, intelligent account of his visit to the island in the summer of 1987, should open the eyes of even the most purblind of fellow travelers. He saw the future, all right, and it is a shambles. The Cuba Mr. Timerman visited is a suffocating, demoralized country, where official boasts about the accomplishments of three decades of revolution sound increasingly desperate and hollow. What surprised him about the ordinary Cubans he met was less the lack of overt opposition to the regime than the way all but the bravest or most delinquent of spirits have retreated into a kind of sullen, infantile quiescence.
Not only does political power rest almost entirely with Mr. Castro, but Government propaganda presents him as personally responsible for all the revolution's achievements, from military strategy and the harvesting of sugar cane to street cleaning. Knowing that their lives depend on the decisions and opinions of a single individual, ordinary Cubans wait for the next of Mr. Castro's interminable speeches in much the way children would attend the most old-fashioned of patriarchs. Demoralized by all this, Mr. Timerman writes of Mr. Castro's effect on Cuban society: ''When you go from city to city, from group to group, from person to person, it becomes clear that his rhetoric has produced a vacuum in the conscience of the Cuban people, substituting a stifling collective paranoia. The rest - acceptance, vacillation, informing - is at the service of repression.''
This repression, and the fear and conformity it has induced, was the strongest impression Mr. Timerman carried away from his visit. And if anything, the situation has only gotten worse since he was there. In 1987, Cuba had not yet experienced cuts in aid from the Soviet Union and, more generally, had just begun to face the consequences of the failure of the Castro regime's economic plans. Were Mr. Timerman to make his trip today, he would find, as I did when I visited the island in July of this year, that discussions of personal freedom now take a back seat to the brute necessities of scrounging for fuel and waiting on endless lines for even the most basic provisions. As I write, the Cuban authorities are warning of further shortages, hinting that food rationing will give way to a system of Government-run cafeterias and announcing plans to buy 500,000 bicycles to save gasoline.
That said, Mr. Timerman's account, ably translated by Toby Talbot, is depressing enough. One of the most horrifying moments in his book comes when he reproduces a questionnaire that ordinary Cubans are encouraged to fill out about their neighbors and colleagues. The document is extraordinary. It includes such items as ''Information on the Individual Expressing an Opinion,'' where the subject of the report is not only categorized by age, occupation and sex, but must be summed up as either ''revolutionary'' or ''disaffected.'' As Mr. Timerman observes shrewdly, these questionnaires represent not just a way of obtaining information but ''a collective state of mind in which the Cuban is, simply, a member or friend, a brother or son, of the Revolution and its Comandante - or else, an enemy of all.''
If Mr. Timerman's book were the work of a well-known opponent of the regime, it might be possible to dismiss it. Even if it were the product of a writer who had once been a revolutionary sympathizer and had now changed sides, there would be more room for debate. But Mr. Timerman falls into neither category. In his prologue, he writes of what he calls the ''affirmative ambivalence'' he has always felt for the Cuban revolution. ''I have always supported,'' he insists, ''its right to defend itself from United States aggression - diplomatic, political, and economic - while I have at the same time criticized the violation of human rights and of freedom of expression that has characterized the Cuban regime.''
Such a will toward complexity is vintage Timerman. Much of the force of ''Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number,'' his noble memoir of his captivity and torture at the hands of the Argentine military in the 1970's, derived from the fact that he not only judged his captors but tried to make the imaginative leap - over an abyss, it must have seemed, given their vileness - of trying to understand them. If he is able to acknowledge his contradictory views about Cuba and yet report what he saw with pellucid honesty, it is precisely because, unlike most people who write about politics, he is not frightened by contradictions.
Mr. Timerman has concluded that whatever blame can be laid at the door of the United States for what happened in Cuba, the reality is that any humane outcome will only occur after Mr. Castro ceases to rule the island. Mr. Castro, who is a great friend of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, has come to resemble Aureliano Buendia in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' or any one of the aging tyrants who inhabit the Colombian novelist's best books. Whatever the Cuban revolution was at its beginning, it has now become little more than a murderous and repressive charade. And the sooner honest men and women forget the servile justifications offered by foreign sympathizers such as Mr. Garcia Marquez and start listening to the real news from Cuba, the better it will be for everyone. A good place to start is with Mr. Timerman's brave and compassionate act of witness.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas: Day for Night

BYLINE: By William Murray; William Murray's most recent novel is ''The Getaway Blues'' (Bantam).

 BODY:
EVER PLAYED CHICKEN-IN-THE-POT? NO? Tell you how it's done. You pay the man a dollar and he hands you a mallet with which you hit a spring that catapults a plucked rubber chicken toward a turntable of slowly revolving empty kettles. You get three tries and win a prize of a stuffed doll if you can get the chicken into the pot. Sound like fun? Some people think it is. These two middle-aged couples I ran across a few weeks ago at Circus Circus, a huge pink-and-white box of a casino on the Strip in Las Vegas, Nev., that features circus performers and carnival attractions, were thoroughly enjoying themselves. ''We was here last night and he hit three in a row,'' one of the women informed me, as her husband brought the mallet crashing down and propelled another bird into the air. She held up the latest prize her group had won, a small stuffed bear, and laughed. ''We're havin' a hell of a time.''
I told this story to a friend of mine named Howard Schwartz, who runs the Gamblers Book Club, a well-established local enterprise specializing in publications in and out of print on gambling and sports, and he said, ''Circus Circus is what the U.S. would have been like if Naples had won the war.'' I assumed he meant chaotic. ''Sure,'' he added, ''and fun.'' 
This seems to be the point about Las Vegas that most of its detractors miss. I have a number of serious-minded friends, mostly in the East, who can't understand why I like the place. They point to what they consider its hideous architecture, its commitment to an orgiastic misuse of neon, as evidence of an unredeemable vulgarity, and its reliance on gambling for its major source of revenue as proof of its basic immorality, especially because of the industry's well-documented past criminal connections. To them, Las Vegas, with its attitude of hedonistic self-indulgence, stands as a symbol of much that is wrong with the country, as if persuading suckers to shove quarters into a slot machine were as detrimental to the public weal as promoting the sale of junk bonds. Las Vegas may be difficult to defend on esthetic and narrowly moralistic grounds, but for me it's mostly a question of taste. Evil here is only sin deep.
Las Vegas is an open city in a country in which many of the pleasures offered to visitors, such as gambling and nude dancing, are considered crimes. That's one reason so many people flock to it with relief. The place has never pretended to be anything but what it is - a playground where the American middle class can indulge its fantasies, without having to risk breaking the law. And when a hood named Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel opened the Flamingo in 1946, the third big casino hotel to appear on the main highway to Los Angeles that soon became better known as the Strip, his presence on the scene provided a largely spurious sense of wickedness to the raucous goings-on. The respectable citizens at the gaming tables and in the showrooms and lounges had the added thrill of feeling that they had become players in a piquantly naughty drama starring the sort of gangsters glamorized in Hollywood movies. Siegel became a founding father; his arrival on the scene, during the boom years of the late 1940's, really put the city on the national map and began to shift the center of the action away from the downtown area's aptly nicknamed Glitter Gulch, the few blocks along Fremont Street lined by such older casinos as the Golden Nugget and Binion's Horseshoe, to the Strip, where most of the big hotels and newer resorts are now located.
The first time I spent the night in Las Vegas was in the late spring of 1966, when I was driving across the country with my two daughters, then aged 10 and 6, while moving from New York to California. We checked into the Flamingo, after a hard day of driving, and I still remember the thrill of feeling that I was actually staying in an underworld palazzo. From my window I could look out on the famous Champagne Tower, ablaze in neon bubbles and crowned by its famous pink-and-black sign. After I had put the girls to bed, I explained to them that Daddy was about to make a descent into the lobby for an hour or two to play a few harmless games of chance. As I opened the door to leave, Julia, my left-handed 6-year-old, sleepily suggested that I use only that particular hand. I went downstairs, wedged myself into a crowd around an active craps table and followed her instructions. I began by making five passes and couldn't lose for winning. Four and a half hours later, I tottered back to my room $1,400 richer, my cross-country trip paid for. It's the sort of small miracle Las Vegas can provide and tends to make converts out of those of us who believe in luck as a crucial element in human affairs.
Las Vegas can become addictive, and over the years I've developed a strategy for coping with it. I try always to have a specific, preferably working reason for being here, and I limit my stays to no more than two or three days. This technique has worked out well, enabling me to indulge in the sybaritic pleasures the town provides while feeling that I haven't compromised myself as a supposedly responsible chronicler of events. The truth is, of course, that I'd probably keep coming anyway, because I so thoroughly enjoy myself every time.
No one without a sense of humor and a capacity for childlike wonder can appreciate Las Vegas. From a distance, especially at night, it looks like an explosion in a fireworks factory, with great masses of multicolored rockets and showers of neon stars bursting and flashing into the sky. The Strip itself resembles an enormous carnival midway, with thousands of revelers swooping in and out of dozens of funhouse attractions through fields of electromagnetic radiation guaranteed to pop any gauss meter. Inside the casinos themselves, the action seems muted, except around a hot craps table or among the massed banks of slot machines, where the turning wheels and twinkling lights are accompanied by the metallic clang of falling coins.
For gamblers Las Vegas has always been a paradise, all the more so today because of the creation of the luxurious new sports books, where fans can sit from morning to night at long counters under soft reading lights, like clerks in a conservative investment house, or in comfortable padded seats facing banks of TV screens and wager on football, basketball, baseball and hockey, as well as contests at hippodromes across the country. ''This isn't a race track,'' a horseplaying friend of mine confided to me during a recent visit to the betting area at Caesars Palace, ''it's a feast.'' He had an 18-horse round robin going at four different tracks, in addition to exactas, doubles, triples and trifectas at various other Thoroughbred emporiums. He bombed out of his round robin early, but seemed undismayed. Hours later, I saw him, flushed with excitement, still hovering in front of his screens like a hummingbird before a massed array of succulent blossoms. The next morning, gaunt and red-eyed from his exquisite ordeal, he informed me that he had only lost $200, a pittance for the amount of action he had enjoyed.
It's quite possible to have a perfectly wonderful time in Las Vegas without going near the tables or risking so much as a nickel in a slot machine. People who enjoy night life, for instance, get all of it they can absorb, because in this town nothing succeeds like excess. The shows, in both the main theaters and lounges, are loud, garishly costumed and heavy on flash and feathers. My latest count of show-business doings listed 73 entertainments, ranging from spots featuring musical performers and dancing, strippers, variety acts and comedians to the extravaganzas populated by hordes of spectacular-looking young women and starring the sort of people who have become show-biz legends. In this latter category, talent is not an essential. Some of Las Vegas's favorite headliners are Frank Sinatra, Cher, Dean Martin, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, Paul Anka, Toni Tennille and Lou Rawls, performers whose longevity has outstripped their skills or who never had much to offer in the first place. Since the death of Liberace, the reigning king of the marquees here is Wayne Newton, an artist of such modest natural ability that it's inconceivable he could flourish in any other milieu.
What the Strip's favorite entertainers offer to their adoring public is nostalgia, a trip back to a fantasy world solidly rooted in the 1950's, the last decade of American innocence. Audiences in the showrooms, both along the Strip and downtown, are composed in good part of primly dressed citizens in their middle years, who can recall a gentler time before the upheavals of the 1960's, stagflation and the Vietnam War. They identify completely with their ancient idols and can be as fanatical in their devotion as teen-agers. When I went to see Elvis Presley, then a bloated parody of himself, a couple of years before his death, a platoon of middle-aged housewives quite literally stormed the stage during his act, and one woman ran right down the middle of the long ringside table I was sitting at to get close to him.
Liberace, who billed himself as Mr. Showmanship, was undoubtedly the quintessential Las Vegas personality. Attired in his fantastic costumes and jewelry, making entrances and exits in custom-built, rhinestone-encrusted automobiles, beamingly chatting away about his brother George and his Mom while tickling a little Chopin or a pop ballad out of one of his outrageously decorated grand pianos, he represented the ultimate triumph of style over content. He was also a genuinely nice man, whose act was designed to delight the older crowd and who, while lightly poking fun at himself, threatened no one. He left behind him a museum to enshrine his legacy. Set in a shopping mall, the buildings contain not only his costumes, jewelry, cars, furniture and other artifacts, but some magnificent musical instruments, including George Gershwin's baby grand. As many as 17,000 people a month have trooped through these rooms, while the late master himself can be seen and heard on a strategically placed video screen. It may not be the Uffizi or the Louvre, but the level of reverential admiration is just as high.
For me, however, the best entertainment value in Las Vegas is the magic on display. The city has become the capital of magic, because it provides so much work for its practitioners. I first discovered this when I was asked to write an article some years ago about the resurgence of interest in the form and inevitably found myself whisked to Las Vegas. A complete innocent about magic's mysteries and mores, I immediately became captivated by the incredible big illusions perpetrated by such masters of the genre as Doug Henning, who could make elephants disappear and cheerfully saw people in half, and Siegfried and Roy, a couple of sinewy Germans who work mainly with big cats and who perform miracles of levitation, transformation and transposition with lions, leopards and huge white tigers.
It was in Las Vegas, too, that I became enchanted with what I consider to be the highest form of magic, the prestidigitation performed by close-up artists, the magicians who work with their naked hands right under your nose. Whereas the big illusions are largely a matter of construction and mirrors, a great close-up magician relies entirely on his skills, acquired after thousands of hours of practice. The finest one I've ever seen is Michael Skinner, who has been working weeknights for 15 years at the Golden Nugget downtown. Now in his late 40's, Skinner has mastered about 2,000 moves and is always devising new ones. His favorites are with cards, which he defines as ''the poetry of magic,'' and he manipulates them with the dexterity of Perahia tackling Mozart. An hour in his company, or in that of any fine sleight-of-hand artist, provides more enchantment than the Brothers Grimm.
The best entertainment bargain in town is the informal get-together of the Darwinian Society, which meets around 10 o'clock every Wednesday night in a local Chinese restaurant off the Strip and is open to all. On some occasions, 50 or 60 magicians show up to talk, perform and enjoy each other's skills. ''Magic is the only human activity, besides sex, that two people can share intimately,'' Mike Skinner says. In Las Vegas, intimacy is a valuable commodity.
The look of the town is neither cozy nor particularly attractive, laid out in long rectangles that sprawl erratically across the bleak desert landscape like patches on a quilt. Still, it must be doing something right. About 4,000 people a month are moving into the area now, not to visit but to live. Along the straight, flat roads crisscrossing the Strip and the other main avenues leading to downtown's less expensive, tawdrier pleasure palaces, new condominiums and apartment complexes rise overnight, like mushrooms, from the desert sands.
The new arrivals, of all ages, have come to stay, attracted by the jobs the casinos provide, as well as by the warm, clear air, cheaper living (Nevada's gaming industry pays the tax bills) and the proximity of resort areas such as Lake Mead, with its 550 miles of shoreline and water sports. Many of the residents never go near the Strip, which on weekends becomes a sludge of vehicles and jostling pedestrians.
Nor is Las Vegas the cultural wasteland outsiders imagine it to be. The campus of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas shelters scholars as well as basketball players and sponsors a weekly radio program, ''Spotlight on the Arts,'' to inform listeners about what's going on in the way of lectures, concerts and theater. The arts calendar would not compare favorably with doings, say, in Florence or Athens, but at least there are some activities available to people indifferent to the clamor of the slot machines.
One of the reasons Las Vegas continues to be such a lure to outsiders is that it has learned to adapt to the changing needs and desires of the general public. ''The Vegas mystique used to rely on the mysterious and the mischievous,'' a spokesman for one of the big hotels informed me. ''Sin city was the concept.''
That began to change in the early 1980's, when a recession slowed the influx of visitors and several casinos faltered and went under and some of the brighter prime movers in town realized that the economy of the city could not continue to rely solely on the presence of high rollers at its gaming tables. The sudden proliferation of race tracks and state lotteries and the rebirth of Atlantic City meant too much competition for the gambling dollar.
With the opportunism for which it is justly famous, Las Vegas set out to attract the younger, affluent family crowd. The Mirage, which cost about $615 million to create and opened last November, is an outstanding example of the new approach. Vaguely Polynesian in concept, it bills itself as a resort rather than a hotel. Each day thousands of people wander through the atrium, with its lush tropical foliage, lagoons and waterfalls, and gather outside by the so-called live volcano that periodically spews steam and fire into the air opposite the main entrance. ''But this is extraordinary,'' I overheard a middle-aged Frenchman say to his wife, as he and his family observed the volcano doing its stuff, ''a veritable triumph of vulgarity.''
No matter what may bring me to Las Vegas in the future, however, I still intend to limit my stays to no more than three days. This is because, like most visitors, I always find it impossible to sleep there. Too much going on, too much to see and marvel at, too many laughs, too much sound and fury, too much hard action. ''My God,'' my wife exclaimed, as the airplane bearing us home after a recent trip soared up off the runway, ''it's like that old movie 'Lost Horizon.' I've just aged a thousand years.''

HEADLINE: Rupert Murdoch's Biggest Gamble

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen; Roger Cohen is a media reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch, who lives in New York but rides planes the way most New Yorkers ride the subway, has been in London for less than 48 hours. That's long enough to size up the situation at his five national newspapers, part of a $6.7 billion media empire that sprawls across three continents. A sharp advertising recession, the worst in two decades, is biting. He has summoned his two top British aides, Andrew Knight and August Fischer, and is telling them money is being wasted because presses are not being used efficiently, that his tabloid newspaper, The Sun, is not as good as it was, and that there are too many pages in the flagship Sunday Times.
''We have to get The Sunday Times down-paged,'' he says in his lazy Australian drawl. ''There is too much. This serialized novel - nobody reads that. The paper must be very firmly down-paged.''
The dapper Knight, who recently gave up the editorship of The Daily Telegraph to become executive chairman of News International, Murdoch's British subsidiary, assures his boss that he has pressed for a smaller paper. But the staff has been stalling. And, besides, Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, has been out of town. 
''Too damn bad; too damn bad,'' Murdoch retorts, his voice becoming loud and derisive, his body stiffening from its customary slouch. ''I can tell you how to get eight pages out of that paper in half an hour. I bet I can do it better than they can. Those extra pages are costing us money.'' However annoying, the eight pages are a mere trifle compared with some of the other pressures on Murdoch's finances these days. Sky Television, his nascent four-channel satellite service in Britain, has cost about $540 million since its inception in February 1989. After a heady period of expansion, News Corporation, Murdoch's international media conglomerate, has seen its debt rise from less than $1 billion in 1985 to about $8.7 billion today, or roughly half the foreign debt of Colombia.
This burden is taking its toll. On Aug. 23, News Corporation announced that its profits for the year ended June 30 plunged 46 percent, to $216 million, from the record $403 million earned in fiscal 1989. For a company that had achieved 34 percent annual growth in earnings per share over the previous eight years, this is a striking reversal. In the nervous market of the last three months, News Corporation's stock price has plummeted to about $11 from $19.
Thirty-seven years after he inherited two modest papers from his father in Adelaide, Australia, Murdoch appears to have entered the most intricate phase of his career. He is within sight of an extraordinary goal - ''the creation of the world's first global television, publishing and entertainment operation,'' as Glen Renfrew, managing director of Reuters, puts it.
News Corporation owns 10 magazines, seven television stations, the Fox television network and movie studio, two newspapers, and a book publishing house in the United States. In Britain, Murdoch has five national newspapers, eight magazines and the Sky TV venture. In Australia, he owns Ansett Airlines (the nation's largest domestic carrier), nine magazines and more than 100 newspapers accounting for nearly 60 percent of the country's press circulation. Yet Murdoch is stretched thinner than he's ever been, at a time when the world economy is jittery and heavily indebted companies, the fad of the 80's, have gone right out of fashion. ''For the game he's in,'' says Andrew Tuckey, a managing director of London's Baring Brothers, a merchant bank, ''Murdoch needs a long pocket and nerves of steel.''
While grappling with current difficulties, Murdoch still has his eye on the future - the industry's and his own. He is easing News Corporation away from newspapers, which he believes are in long-term decline, and toward electronic media. Newspapers still represent the single largest source of the company's revenues, but television and filmed entertainment are catching up fast.
At the same time, Murdoch, who will turn 60 next year, is trying to delegate authority, and to put more structure into a company that has always taken pride in its creative disorganization. He has, if only tentatively, chosen a successor - Andrew Knight. And he is preparing his wife and his children for major responsibilities.
None of this comes easily. Seated, before his trip to London, in his office at his Fox television and movie studios in Los Angeles, he says: ''I like to be where we're doing new things. If the head man in a company is not working 12 hours a day, doing things, taking risks, but also standing with his people in the trenches at the most difficult of times, then the company loses something. But we've become pretty spread out around the world. You can't be everywhere.''
He cites an example. When the Fox Broadcasting Company's television stations were bidding to become America's fourth network in 1986, Murdoch was simultaneously fighting Britain's labor unions as he moved his press operations eastward from Fleet Street to Wapping and introduced new printing technology. In the end, he won the battle of Wapping. The British labor movement was emasculated. Production costs plunged; a host of new newspapers appeared.
''But I should have been spending more time with the Fox start-up,'' Murdoch insists. ''It's no secret that I thought we should have been doing better earlier. But it's coming good now. One of the great things about television is'' - his voice, often no more than a murmur, suddenly surges - ''you must not look back. Bury your mistakes.''
Slouched on a sofa, in a plain gray suit, Murdoch looks an unlikely figure amid the gaudy chic of Hollywood. In a town of loud ties and sharp Italian suits, his preference is for solid British tailoring. There is no pretension about his language, either, which is down-to-earth Aussie. In the Murdoch world, what's bad is ''bloody awful''; what's good is ''a knockout.'' Although his tone is generally moderate, there is an occasional brusqueness to his manner, that speak of a man quickly dismissive of fools. ''That fellow could not lead a flock of homing pigeons'' is a favorite phrase. Colin Chapman, a former deputy editor of The Australian, used to play doubles tennis at Murdoch's Australian farm, Cavan. ''I would serve two double faults,'' he recalls, ''and he would turn around to me and glower.''
It was this glowering reputation that led to his frequent portrayal as a marauding media mogul - a 1977 Time magazine cover put his head on the body of King Kong striding over the rooftops of Manhattan. But he appears to have quieted down. Indeed, since he burst on the American scene in 1976 with his acquisition of New York magazine and The New York Post, he has become more private. The battles with New York newspaper unions, the public clashes with Clay Felker, former editor of New York magazine, and the political fallout from his close association with Edward Koch, the former Mayor of New York, are all in the past; and Murdoch says he tries now to spend more time with his family. ''He has not fulfilled the horror scenarios,'' said David Schneiderman, president of The Village Voice and its editor when Murdoch owned the paper. ''He is more accepted here now.''
Those scenarios were tied to Murdoch's reputation as the king of the sleazy tabloid, the man who bought Britain's ailing Sun newspaper in 1969 and, with a constant diet of bare breasts and scandal, turned it into the country's best-selling daily. It was The Sun that, during the 1982 Falklands War, trumpeted ''GOTCHA!'' across its front page after a British submarine sank an Argentine cruiser with the loss of 368 lives; and it was Sun-style journalism that prompted a recent Government report warning the press to restrain its invasion of people's privacy or face the creation of a tough regulatory body. In the United States, he created The Star, a crass supermarket publication to rival The National Enquirer, and took The New York Post down-market.
But there are signs of a shift. Murdoch has sold The Post and The Star; and in Britain, he recently appointed Simon Jenkins, a widely respected journalist, as editor of The Times. The move has been heralded as a commitment to restoring the understated authority of the paper, which many saw being undermined by a shrill commercialism over the last decade. At the same time, the quality of the news channel on Sky Television has earned respect. ''He is maneuvering his empire back toward central ground,'' says Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, a liberal daily. ''He now gets very angry when one of his tabloids goes over the top.''
Murdoch, it seems, is looking for balance, both in his editorial tone and in his business. Think of him as an inspired juggler, inventing tricks that the world had not imagined possible. Among the balls he now keeps in the air: Sky's pioneering attempt to diversify British television; the fledgling Fox television stations now growing rapidly on the back of ''The Simpsons''; a new international book business, based in New York, called HarperCollins; a quickly assembled stable of American publications ranging from Mirabella to New York magazine to Automobile; the 20th Century Fox movie studio; British papers that cover the full spectrum, from the up-market Times to the vulgar News of the World, and his Australian press holdings.
The balls are moving with increasing speed, ever more fantastic in their parabolas, across a world that technology is making smaller. In the last six years alone, News Corporation's revenue has more than tripled from $1.8 billion to $6.7 billion - a performance that makes other major communications companies look like slouches. And Murdoch drives the mighty machine: two days in Los Angeles, three in London, one in Budapest, an occasional foray to his native Australia, where his company is incorporated, and then back to New York, which he now calls home.
It's a grinding schedule, in pursuit of . . . what? Not the trappings of power, it would appear. Friends say Murdoch shuns ostentation: driving up to the Istanbul Hilton recently in a limousine provided by Turkish officials, he turned to his wife, Anna, and said, ''I hope the kids don't see us in this car.'' Nor does wealth seem to be the point, although Murdoch is a very wealthy man indeed. ''Hell, no,'' Murdoch says. ''Money is not the motivating force. It's nice to have money, but I don't live high. What I enjoy is running the business.''
 
The business is very big news corporation, which had revenues of less than $1 billion at the beginning of the 1980's, is now the world's second largest communications concern after Time Warner. No other company of its kind is so geared to bringing a package of news, entertainment and advertising to the global village.
Murdoch's share of News Corporation is 43 percent, making the company takeover-proof. But this insurance comes at a steep price. It is largely because Murdoch has always preferred to finance his acquisitions by borrowing, rather than dilute his holding in the company, that News's debt has risen so sharply.
''The desire to retain family control has significantly affected the company,'' says Lord Rees-Mogg, a former editor of The Times. ''If some of the debt were converted into equity, it would be very positive.''
Murdoch bridles at the suggestion that he should have sold some of his stock to raise money. ''Oh sure, sure, they always say that - too much debt, too little equity financing,'' he says. ''But the fact is that if our family had let our stake down to 20 percent, there would have been a bunch of investment managers who would have risen up and fired me when I started Fox Broadcasting in 1986 and again when I got into Sky in 1988. If you don't have a major, major shareholding, you can't take the same risks.''
But News Corporation's debt load, $2.4 billion of it short-term borrowing due within a year, is now too onerous even for Murdoch's taste. Over the last year, he has sold assets for nearly $1 billion. He vows that he will not buy anything major in the foreseeable future. Moreover, he concedes for the first time that ''it is arguable we may have paid $500 million too much'' for TV Guide, which he bought for $2.8 billion in 1988, adding heavily to News's debt. (The magazine's circulation has slipped slightly since it was bought.) ''My guess is that if News had $3 billion less debt and no TV Guide,'' says one banker, ''the stock would be a lot higher.''
Because of Murdoch's proven record as a businessman able to build the value of his assets, banks remain generally confident in him. Nevertheless, in a sign of some skittishness in financial markets, News Corporation's attempt last year to set up a new financing vehicle - a partnership managed by Murdoch - collapsed when the money for it could not be raised. Some minor banks have sought to call in their loans to the company.
Moreover, Australian accounting rules allow the company to present its situation in a rosier light. At the end of the 1989-90 fiscal year, for example, the company revalued its mastheads and television licenses by $2.2 billion. In effect, the company decided that what it owned was now worth more and wrote that into its books.
Murdoch himself seems to have few illusions about such accounting devices. He acknowledges his problems and vows he will grow out of them. He believes that by 1992, the company can make what he calls ''the big leap,'' bringing News to profit levels considerably above the record $403 million made in 1989. This, he argues, will be based on the success of his two big start-up projects of recent years - the Fox TV network and Sky TV in Britain. Despite persistent rumors, he insists no major asset sales are planned.
''I think we have seen the bottom,'' says Carla Tammenoms Bakker, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley who recently completed an extensive study of News Corporation, adding, however, that ''Murdoch has a terrible cash squeeze.'' Andrew Tuckey of Baring Brothers says: ''The market view is that Murdoch is not in great shape, but he will get through it.''
Up to now, Murdoch has certainly seemed comfortable with big financial risks. Like the Japanese, he is prepared to take the long view. The Australian, the country's first national daily, which he started in Canberra in 1964, lost money for years before it became a financial success. Fox was a laughingstock - and a money pit - for more than two years.
''He thinks in time spans that nobody else does in his field,'' says Lord George Weidenfeld, the British publisher. Barry Diller, chairman of Fox, adds: ''Murdoch is O.K. with risk. I've seen others - before you're able to prove it out, your money will be gone.''
The flip side of this long-term view is an impatience with convention that allows him to place big bets on change. An outsider even in Australia (he became an American citizen in 1985), Murdoch shuns the establishments of Hollywood, New York and even London, operating with a cultural detachment that gives him the freedom to tackle pioneering projects on a vast scale. Barry Wright, director of one of the companies installing Sky's satellite dishes, recalls that when, earlier this year, he asked Murdoch what market share he was aiming for, the reply was: ''We don't deal in market share. We create the market.''
On an industrial estate near Heathrow Airport outside London sits a rather tacky set of buildings, painted in bold green, yellow, red and blue. They look as if they have been put together in a hurry - and they were. The makeshift structures house Murdoch's four-channel Sky Television venture. What goes on here will be crucial to the success or failure of his peripatetic juggling act.
Sky is an enormous gamble, even for Murdoch. It consists of four new channels - Sky One (entertainment), Sky News (the only competition in Europe to Cable News Network), Sky Movies and Eurosport, which carries sporting events from all over the world. Murdoch has already invested more than half a billion dollars in Sky, certain that he can change the viewing habits of the British. Murdoch thinks that they are sick of the duopoly that has dominated British television - the state-owned BBC and independent ITV, each with two channels - and that, like Americans, they will pay for choice. Right now, he is losing more than $3 million a week on the venture.
The gamble is bigger because he is not alone. Closer to central London stands the Marcopolo Building, whose towering arched windows and atrium recall one of New York's monuments to corporate power. This is the headquarters of Sky's archrival and would-be nemesis, British Satellite Broadcasting, or BSB, which began its five-channel service in April, just over a year after Sky.
Backed principally by leading communications companies, including Pearson PLC (the publishers of The Financial Times), Reed International, Granada and Chargeur of France, BSB has a staggering $2.4 billion in capital - making it the largest consortium in Britain after the Channel Tunnel project. And it plans to use that money to blast Murdoch out of the sky.
The rivalry is intense, the stakes enormous. Each company is gambling that it can emerge the winner in what would be the biggest revolution in British consumer electronics since the introduction of the videocassette recorder. ''There are two of them and there should only be one,'' says Steven Rattner, head of the media department at Lazard Freres in New York. ''Sky and BSB are going to have a long, bloody slugging match.''
Anthony Simonds-Gooding, the flamboyant chief executive of BSB -his yellow socks clash dramatically with his dark blue Jaguar - says the company has done sweeps in its offices against Sky bugging devices. Sky, already on the air last year, dismissed BSB in an ad campaign as ''hot air''; BSB came back with a campaign portraying Murdoch as a sinister Citizen Kane. BSB is planning to spend $550 million on marketing alone over the next three years.
From the Sky buildings, programs for the four new channels are transmitted to a so-called teleport in the London docklands area. This consists of two enormous dishes that transmit (or ''uplink'') the programs to a satellite called Astra, hovering over the equator. Astra, owned by a consortium of Luxembourg companies, carries 16 transponders, or channels, 4 of them leased by Murdoch. Like a huge, magnifying mirror, it increases the power of the signals and beams them back to the small white Sky dishes now appearing on British homes.
BSB, meanwhile, owns two entire satellites, with a signal eight times as powerful as Sky's. Like Sky, it has movie, sports and entertainment channels, but no news channel. Instead it has rock music (''Power Station'') and a catch-all channel called ''NOW'' carrying everything from gardening shows to American business reports.
''Look, Murdoch's done newspapers; now he's excited about TV,'' says Simonds-Gooding, his tie emblazoned with a couple of Gauguin's Tahitian nudes. ''His attitude is: Who will not bow to me? But Sky is American-Australian, and people here are quite conservative. If they had to watch American TV, they'd be appalled.'' Murdoch counters: ''They are saying they are like the BBC, and people are saying, 'Jolly good for you, but we can get that already for nothing!' ''
Simonds-Gooding notes that the major shareholders of BSB have a combined capitalization five times greater than News Corporation's. ''This is the big game or no game,'' he says. ''It's like drilling for North Sea oil. Money goes out. Murdoch will have to carry the heat.''
But for how long? On the best estimate, which is Murdoch's own, Sky will not break even until somewhere between the end of 1991 and mid-1992. Carla Tammenoms Bakker of Morgan Stanley believes this will not happen until 1993. As for BSB, which has been plagued by technical problems and twice delayed its debut, Simonds-Gooding hopes it can stop losing money by 1993, and, after paying off its debts, be in the black by 1995. All analysts agree that if one service reaches break-even, the other's problems will mount.
For Murdoch, Sky is a deeply personal battle. Ever since he entered publishing in Britain, with his acquisition of The News of the World Sunday newspaper in 1968, he has been disgusted by what he sees as Britain's rigid class structure. He had observed it as a student at Oxford University 15 years earlier, and he still has little time for the British Establishment - a moneyed elite that he believes has hindered social mobility and promoted anticommercial attitudes.
''When I came to Britain in 1968, I found it was damn hard to get a day's work out of the people at the top of the social scale,'' he says. ''As an Australian, I only had to work 8 or 10 hours a day, 48 weeks of the year, and everything came to you, you could not fail. Your peers were in the Bahamas, or on weekends in Paris - very intelligent people, cleverer than I, but they were like guardians of the family heirlooms.''
Nowhere has Murdoch observed this elitism more than in television. He has criticized the endless dramatic programs dominated by ''strangulated English accents,'' played out in ''rigid, class-structured settings'' and marked by ''constant sneering at the new Britain'' of Margaret Thatcher.
The elitist attitude Murdoch questions is epitomized by George Walden, a Conservative member of Parliament, who describes American television as ''umpteen channels and nothing to watch.'' Sky, which uses much American programming, is a gamble that Walden is wrong.
One of Sky's converts is Alan Jayes, a wholesale meat worker who lives in a modest, state-subsidized house on Katherine Griffiths Court in central London. Virtually every home on the street - about a dozen of them - now has the Sky dish. ''I got mine about three months ago, and I was the first,'' Jayes says. ''But everyone always copies each other here.''
Jayes is renting the Sky service for about $45 a month, after responding to an advertisement in The Sun. He is very happy. Pointing to the American wrestling matches beaming in on Eurosport, he says: ''You get programs from America that are out of this world. My mum-in-law loves the wrestling.''
Jayes now prefers Sky to the BBC or ITV, and has told his five brothers and two sisters about the service. All of them have taken it. So too have some builders who were in his house a few days earlier, saw Sky, and signed up immediately. Asked about BSB, Jayes says: ''Never heard of it.''
It is clear that Sky has a head start. After a disastrous beginning, which left people mystified by the new equipment in electronics stores, Murdoch decided to sell the service door to door, with a rental package that includes free installation.
The new approach has been a dramatic success. Since September 1989, Sky has been installing about 50,000 dishes a month in British homes. More than 960,000 homes now have their own dishes, with 660,000 more taking the service through cable or large dishes placed on apartment buildings. About 980,000 customers are paying a supplementary fee of $18 a month for the movie channel. Sky officials say the service needs to be in at least two million homes, with two thirds of them paying for the movie channel, to be viable. The channels seem popular. An independent survey conducted in the summer found that Sky had 26.1 percent of viewers, ahead of BBC 1's 20.8 percent and BSB's 9.9 percent.
BSB, by contrast, still appears to be languishing. According to the company, its dishes, sold through retail stores for about $650, rather than rented, have been installed in about 90,000 homes. BSB says it can break even when it is in 3 million homes, if 2.4 million are paying for movies. But Bronwen Maddox, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, predicted in a recently published report that the consortium could lose $670 million this year alone.
Still, it is early in the fight, and BSB has enormous resources. Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, a BSB investor, says: ''Our partners are much less highly geared than News Corporation, and this is going to be a costly battle.'' Referring to Murdoch's British media holdings, he adds pointedly: ''I don't think anybody should be allowed five newspapers and four TV channels.''
This was the thrust of a vigorous, but unsuccessful, BSB campaign in Parliament last year aimed at forcing Murdoch to reduce his 100 percent holding in Sky. Current legislation allows newspaper proprietors a maximum stake of 20 percent in a British television franchise. But Murdoch has managed to circumvent this restriction by beaming his programs off a Luxembourg satellite. His action has angered the opposition Labor Party, which already hates Murdoch for his success in breaking the unions at Wapping.
''If Labor gets in,'' says Simonds-Gooding with some relish, ''they will hang Mr. Murdoch by his thumbs within days.''
Murdoch's massive investment in Sky reflects far-reaching changes throughout News Corporation. Last year, broadcasting and filmed entertainment accounted for 28 percent of the company's revenue; that figure will rise to an estimated 31 percent in 1991. While Murdoch's greatest passion remains newspapers, he is convinced that a gradual and inexorable shift away from print and toward electronic media is under way. ''The television screen in the home,'' he predicts, ''is going to be a bigger and bigger factor in all of our lives.''
With Fox and Sky and TV Guide, Murdoch has tried to position News Corporation for this shift. He knows it is coming, even if he does not know exactly what form it will take. Newspapers will not die overnight, he stresses. But in the United States, especially, the trend is downward; and advertising, he believes, will increasingly go elsewhere.
Convinced of the need to adapt, this year he created a new post of executive vice president for development, and gave it to John B. Evans, in charge of classified advertising at The Village Voice when Murdoch bought it in 1977 (Murdoch sold The Voice, which he never liked, in 1985). ''I am not a logical person; I think of myself as an artist,'' says Evans, who is British, by way of introduction. Murdoch calls him ''our lateral thinker.''
Evans envisions a world in which high-definition televisions will allow you to flood your house with a Mozart recording superior in quality to any compact disk; play chess with a friend at the other side of the world; order up your fishing show (which has already led you to drop your fishing magazine), and read the Yellow Pages, the news, a glossy magazine, or even your favorite novel. He is talking to telephone and even utility companies about the possibility of bringing movies or information down their cables to television sets. And he's overseeing News's participation in a project that could bring 108 television channels into American homes from a satellite. ''Look,'' he says, ''26 million American homes have Nintendo. These kids are not technophobic.''
Murdoch's own view is that the place to be in preparing for the future is the United States, which he now sees as the core of News's activities. In 1984, the company earned 27 percent of its revenue in the United States; today that figure has reached 56 percent.
''The future is all over the world, but this is the cutting edge,'' says Murdoch. ''Look, the whole world wants to modernize, and when you look to what they mean by modernizing, they mean Americanize. Would a modern Greek prefer to live in Orange County than Piraeus? Yes. Absolutely.'' This is an unconventional view. But then, News Corporation is a very unconventional company. Extremely lean (there are just 60 people in what is effectively the main office, in midtown Manhattan), virtually devoid of memos, and galvanized by Murdoch, it is, says Evans, ''an emotionally driven and bonded company, where executives don't spend time guarding territories, because nobody has one nailed down.'' He recalls once asking Murdoch if he should report to him or to Martin Singerman, the president of News America Publishing. The reply: ''Consider yourself in orbit around Singerman.''
Murdoch does not like ''yes'' men. In his executives, he says he looks for ''people ready and willing to fight their cause against me.'' At the same time, while allowing his executives free rein, Murdoch can clearly be very hands-on. He says, for example, that he himself made the crucial decision to switch ''The Simpsons'' from Sunday to Thursday for this season, where it now goes up against ''The Cosby Show'' - thus far, with a striking lack of success.
Every week, executives throughout News Corporation receive the Murdoch ''Flash'' - a brief summary of the operating results of the company's various units, showing the budget's target figures, actual figures and the previous year's figures for the current week and the year to date. This is core around which the company's flexibility is built. Says David Schneiderman, president of The Village Voice and its editor under Murdoch: ''You might get one call from Murdoch asking how come paper costs are so much higher than budgeted. He gives you one call a year and it keeps you on your toes for the next 365 days.''
Singerman, who has been with News since the company began its American expansion in 1974, says Murdoch works constantly at avoiding bureaucracy. ''If we're considering a new magazine,'' he says, '' 'Show me an editor.' He's not interested in market surveys.''
This gut-driven approach is pervasive. Rafael Pastor, installed last March as an executive vice president overseeing international development, says: ''Murdoch will say one or two words. You have to make the connections.'' There is, he continues, an ''almost intoxicating sense of latitude'' at the company; his own mission was defined simply as that of taking the company into areas where it is not. Already, this has led to the acquistion of two dailies in Hungary, the possible creation of a Berlin-based daily to be marketed in what used to be East Germany, and talks aimed at bringing a new TV station to Poland. ''The message is, put a lot of things together, and we will stumble onto something,'' says Pastor. Life, in other words, is too unpredictable for grand designs.
Still, one thing is predictable. As he prepares to turn 60 in March, Murdoch is confronting his own mortality. An old friend, the British publisher Paul Hamlyn, says that because Murdoch's father died young of a heart attack, ''Rupert always thought he might die young, so everything has to be done fast.'' Now he is trying to insure that his hectic accumulation of assets will be in safe hands, even without him. Already this year, Murdoch has increased the number of annual board meetings from one to four. Moreover, he has installed his wife, Anna, a novelist, as a board member. ''It's time for a little discipline,'' he says. ''I am nearly 60 and she is 13 years younger than me. And, if something happened to me, it would be a few years before any of the children who would be likely to want to come in would be ready for it. I guess it's a defensive thing to have a member of the family on the board.'' Murdoch has three children by Anna - Elisabeth, 22; Lachlan, 19, and James, 17. His eldest child, Prudence, by his first marriage, is not interested in executive responsibility at News.
At the same time, Murdoch is speaking openly about his successor: Andrew Knight. ''I don't intend to go under a bus tomorrow,'' Murdoch says, ''but if I did, probably Andrew Knight would become the chief executive. He is the most rounded, the most international, with the most journalist-based skills.''
Knight, now 50 and a former editor of The Economist and The Daily Telegraph, has been with News less than a year, but he has a reputation for toughness and shrewdness - he turned The Telegraph from a loss-maker to a major money-spinner. One person familiar with the company and close to Murdoch says: ''What he is doing is creating an insurance system. He wants to be able to sleep easily at night. But he believes he will go on for years, and one day, one of his children will take over.''
But what will his children find? It is possible to paint a very bleak scenario for News: a continuing worldwide advertising slump; higher interest rates, particularly in the United States, where News has most of its debt; a sudden success for BSB combined with problems for Sky; a Labor Party victory in Britain and an ensuing campaign against his cross-media holdings; an Australian recession; regulatory problems for Fox in its bid to be effectively a network while continuing to syndicate its own shows.
On the other hand, the outlines of a genuine global communications network are coming into focus. Fox has moved firmly into the black this year, and other American television executives are talking enviously of its young viewership, which is the most attractive to advertisers. Meanwhile, Sky is showing signs of life. Already, Murdoch can take a hit show like ''The Simpsons'' from Fox TV, put it in book form through HarperCollins, in movie form through 20th Century Fox, pass it along to Sky TV in Britain, and serialize it in newspapers and magazines throughout the world.
With the notable exception of The New York Post, and his 1983 purchase of the ''Hitler Diaries,'' which turned out to be fake, most of Murdoch's shots have been on target. The businesses he has acquired or started have grown enormously in value. For example, he bought The Village Voice and New York magazine for $17 million in 1977. In 1985, he sold The Voice for $55 million, and New York is now worth at least $200 million. As a result of such coups, News Corporation has a breakup value of more than $20 billion - useful insurance, especially with his annual interest payments running at $800 million.
But if the television operations really come good, Murdoch's juggling act could become less frenetic, less alarming to behold. News Corporation, with its properties in every medium all over the world, would then stand prepared - perhaps more than its cautious competitors - for the Golden Age of Information that Murdoch sees looming in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Flying Blind: An Unexpected Change of Airline

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
The airline name you see on your ticket may not mean you will be flying on a plane of that line, sometimes because of a practice the airline industry calls ''code sharing.'' Code sharing does not signify much to the average traveler. But like people with hotel reservations who are ''walked,'' or sent elsewhere because of overbooking, passengers quickly learn about code sharing when they end up on another airline.
Take Dr. Sandra K. C. Lim and her husband, Dr. Andrew C. K. Cheng. This spring the couple, who live on Long Island, decided to visit Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, where Dr. Lim was born and her family still lives.
Dr. Lim left 26 years ago, and it was to be her first trip back, so Dr. Cheng urged her to buy first-class tickets. She booked first class with Lufthansa, at a round-trip cost of $6,300 a ticket. 
They left Kennedy International Airport on Flight 405 on May 25. In Frankfurt they boarded the continuation of their flight, No. 6474, which turned out to be on an Air Mauritius 767 plane.
The first-class cabin was not clean, Dr. Lim said, adding that the cabin and service were ''below par.'' Worse, there were only two rows in first class, their row and the smoking row behind them, which meant a 12-hour flight in smoky air, to which Dr. Cheng is very sensitive. Their travel agent did not tell them that they were changing lines, Dr. Cheng said; their travel agent said later that she did not know. Practice Gains Acceptance The effects of code sharing, joint operations, leases and pooling agreements are becoming increasingly widespread: in a period of recession with virtually no domestic regulation, when the European Market countries are moving toward full internal competition, almost any passenger can end up on a plane with an unexpected name and crew.
In the case of the Long Island couple, they were expecting Lufthansa service at the $6,000 level and considered that they did not get full value. Code-sharing began in the 60's, when Allegheny Airlines began to use its code, AL, in front of the flight numbers for its connections on smaller regional airlines. In the early 80's, other big airlines followed suit. The ticket, for example, would show Delta as the carrier all the way to Albany, Ga., but the Atlanta-to-Albany leg would actually be on a 24-passenger plane operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines, ''the Delta connection.''
Opponents of this practice, which then included 12 independent regional lines, plus American and United, said it was deceptive, giving travelers the idea that they were making a connection on the same airline when they were actually changing lines.
In September 1984, a spokesman for United Airlines was quoted by the Official Airline Guide magazine Frequent Flyer as saying: ''It misrepresents two airlines with different levels of service which are indicated as one airline. We think it misleads the public. It's like buying an Oldsmobile with a Chevy engine.''
But at that time, it was easier for the traveler to find out whether there was a switch of airlines. One tipoff was that only commuter flights had four-digit numbers, so experienced travelers and travel agents would recognize that the trip would be aboard a hedge-hopper. ''Then we ran out of numbers,'' said Bill Jackman, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, and the four-digit designation came into use on non-commuter flights as well.
Code-sharing was accepted by the Federal regulators and the practice moved into the international field, with big lines coordinating arrival and departure times, and using each other's terminals. Sometimes one airline flies the outbound trip and the other the inbound. Airlines in Europe were then able to advertise that they served Houston as well as New York, and domestic airlines were able to offer cities they did not fly to. As a sales device, it was significant because two flights with a shared code may be handled in the computer as a direct flight, meaning a flight where you do not change planes although you may stop en route. Direct flights appear on the computer screen before connections, and this means that an agent would be more likely to pick this than a connecting flight.
The practice became widespread and American and United changed their minds. United began to share codes with regional lines in 1986. In January 1988 United worked out a code-sharing agreement with British Airways that allows British to offer flights to and from Seattle and other places in addition to Chicago, one of its ports of entry.
In fact, a Department of Transportation policy requires airlines ''in any direct oral communication'' to alert consumers as to what line they will fly. The policy does not refer to any travel agent's duty on this, although Hoyte B. Decker Jr. of the department's consumer affairs division says that in this context, a travel agent is acting as an agent for the airline and shares the obligation to inform the consumer. Sources May Be Confusing These days, travelers dealing with cheap-ticket offices, or even with full-service travel agencies, are almost always dealing with someone using a computer. An overworked agent is normally reluctant to pause and call an airline to get added information on a ticket that is virtually sold. And the giveaways on shared codes, joint operations and pooled flights vary among information sources: the printed edition of the prime reference work, the Official Airline Guide; the electronic version; the airlines' electronic timetables, and the airline computer reservation systems.
For a trip from Copenhagen to Houston, for example, the information is pretty clear. The O.A.G. Electronic Edition shows Scandinavian Airlines' Flight 911 connecting with Continental Flight 767 in Newark. Directly beneath it is a listing for Continental Flight 8911 from Copenhagen connecting in Newark with the same flight to Houston. A footnote says ''CO 8911 operated by S.A.S.'' In fact, 911 and 8911 are the same thing. In the O.A.G. book, Continental 8911 is marked with a star indicating ''dual designated carrier,'' and one can figure out the name of the carrier because the listing above, for 911, credits S.A.S. In the case of the Lufthansa-Air Mauritius flight, the printed O.A.G. lists both legs of the trip as Lufthansa flights; there is no indication that Lufthansa shares its code with another line. According to Lucille Hobshabjian, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa, the line's electronic timetable for the time the ticket was booked listed the flight twice, with the Frankfurt-Mauritius leg entered with the LH of Lufthansa and with the MK of Air Mauritius.
However, the Lim-Cheng tickets were sold from an electronic directory maintained by Sabre, one of the big four computerized airline reservations systems. There, the two entries for the flight were widely separated by other entries. The tickets were sold by the Flushing Travel Agency, a branch of Orient Clipper Travel of 217 Park Row in Manhattan, a consolidator, or agent for sale of deeply discounted tickets bought at wholesale from the airlines. Rudolph Den, the owner, said that the first-class Mauritius tickets were not discounted, but that the Long Islanders had been customers for some years and came to him for the tickets anyway. The tickets were issued by Lanny Wang, an assistant who said that on the basis of the Sabre data, she had assumed that the flight was Lufthansa all the way and did not learn differently until Dr. Cheng returned from the trip and complained. She said that she did not know that Lufthansa owned no 767's.
Inder Sethi, the manager for North America for Air Mauritius, said that the airline, which owns two planes, both 767's with 12 first-class seats in two rows, had many and varied agreements with other airlines serving his country. He ran through a list, and volunteered that the situation was confusing for the traveler.
As for telling the Lufthansa ticket-holders that they are going to arrive aboard Air Mauritius, he said: ''I doubt if the agents are aware.''
Once again, even with the Federal policy, the burden is on the traveler. If it matters, he or she should ask the travel agent to call and find out whose plane will be used.

HEADLINE: America's Best Weapon: Patience

 BODY:
The siege in the Persian Gulf is not yet 12 weeks old, but the patience of some Americans already seems exhausted.
First came the Hasty Hawks, certain that support for sanctions against Iraq would evaporate, and thus eager to ''take out'' Saddam Hussein with a ''surgical strike,'' oblivious to the cost in American lives now and Arab hostility forever. Enter now the Nervous Doves, their case urgently pressed by Jimmy Carter in Time magazine. 
Curiously, both schools of thought proceed from the same dubious premise - that Saddam Hussein has greater staying power than the awesome coalition arrayed against him. This flatters a dictator and devalues democracy.
Fortunately, President Bush's policy presumes otherwise, and assumes more of Americans. If the need to keep forces abroad for the long haul is presented clearly to the public, it will support a prolonged and costly commitment. It has done so for 40 years, for example, in Korea.
Mr. Carter raises familiar alarms. Oil prices are rising, Arab and Soviet support for global embargo of Iraq isn't solid and a world of short attention span is bound to turn to other matters. But whereas Hasty Hawks would initiate hostilities, he would initiate peace talks.
There's nothing wrong with taking soundings in Baghdad, or in encouraging any intermediaries, including King Hussein of Jordan, to talk with Saddam Hussein's emissaries. A senior Soviet official who recently traveled to Iraq may make plain to its leaders that there can be no partial solutions. What would be folly is to let Saddam Hussein believe he can engage in serious negotiations before unconditionally withdrawing from Kuwait. Any softening of that demand would undermine the whole purpose of this exemplary instance of collective action.
After only three months of embargo, Iraq is squirming. Gasoline, of all things, is about to be rationed. Baghdad, desperate for cash, is now offering to sell its oil for half price to anybody willing to violate the embargo. Food appears to abound in Baghdad, but as The Times's John Burns reports, shortages are crippling factories dependent on imported raw materials and spare parts. Disabled or idle equipment is a common sight. And hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have fled Iraq and Kuwait, taking with them their skills and their willingness to work at menial jobs.
No longer quite so defiant, Saddam Hussein now hints that his ''irreversible'' annexation of Kuwait might in fact be reversible - if the world rewarded him with access to the Persian Gulf and possession of disputed islands and oil fields. This sounds like the first squeak from a cornered bully. Even at this early moment, the siege seems to be starting to work; what a stunning miscalculation and waste it would be to weaken now.
Early fears about the allies' Desert Shield have proved unfounded. The coalition has held, with negligible wobbles. The rapid buildup in Saudi Arabia has gone forward without serious incident. Wisely and correctly, the Pentagon has informed Congress that the siege might last many months.
Opinion polls show some falling off in the initial overwhelming American approval for Mr. Bush's gulf strategy. This was inevitable. But now, as in Korea and Europe, most Americans understand that the presence of U.S. forces can keep the peace, protect economic lifelines and deter aggression. What the Siege of Iraq needs most is time to work.

HEADLINE: The Truth Behind the Mideast's 'Great Lie'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Israel has come under heavy criticism for the way in which Israeli police responded to a Palestinian attack on civilians praying at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. This criticism includes the charge that Israel could be responsible for a collapse of the Arab-American alliance against Saddam Hussein, as the Arab world joins with the Iraqi dictator in a holy war against the Zionist state and its imperialist United States ally.
This criticism of Israel exposes the ''great lie'' of the Middle East. The great lie is that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a border dispute between two rational, reasonable, peace-seeking groups of people: one of whom has been needlessly oppressing the other while preventing any restructuring of the borders so as to bring peace to the entire region. 
If only Israel would permit a Palestinian homeland in the West Bank and Gaza, the great lie reasons, Israel and its Arab neighbors would live in peace. Only Jewish paranoia (or better, the paranoia of the Israeli ''right,'' embodied in the Likud Government of Yitzhak Shamir, fueled by a religious dream of a Greater Biblical Israel) prevents this redrawing of the Middle East map and concomitant regional peace.
Now, however, the suggestion that an Israeli response to a Palestinian attack at the Western Wall could cause the collapse of the U.S.-Arab alliance against Saddam Hussein should shine the light of truth on the great lie. Neither the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in general, nor a specific incident between a Palestinian mob and Israeli police, has anything to do with Saddam Hussein's conquering of Kuwait, terrorizing its people and pillaging the entire country.
The United States, while clearly in Saudi Arabia to protect U.S. oil interests, is just as clearly protecting the interests of Saudia Arabia and other Arab states from Saddam Hussein. There is no other circumstance that would have prompted the Arab world to permit U.S. and other allied ground forces to establish a military presence on Persian Gulf soil.
Saddam Hussein has violated the mythology of Arab brotherhood and now poses an enormous threat to every Arab state. Yet, despite the fact that he has thrown the world into a turmoil over the price of oil that could destroy the world's economy, and despite the threat he poses to the ultimate existence of other Arab rulers, we are told that the Arab world would turn on the U.S. and realign itself with Saddam Hussein against Israel and its American ally over the response of Israeli police to a Palestinian attack at the Western Wall.
If the Arab world is capable of such an incredible realignment out of its hatred of Israel, is there anything Israel could ever do to appease that world? Israel is the enemy of the Arab world by virtue of its existence, not its policies. And though in a moment of crisis Saudi Arabia welcomed an American protector, both Israel and its infidel ally, the U.S., remain the eternal enemy of the Islamic fundamentalist Arab world.
It is not Israeli intransigence that blocks peace in the region. It is Israel's existence. No creativity with the Middle East map will cap the well of Arab hatred for Israel's existence.
The crux of the Middle East dilemma is that there are no rules by which Israel can play. Israel is not dealing with an adversary prepared to arrive at a rational, reasonable and peaceful solution to a border dispute. In such a context, a Western-oriented, rational, reasonable handling of or solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is virtually impossible at this time.
This should never excuse unbridled or unnecessary violence by Israel against Palestinians or any Arab population. But it should open American eyes - and, indeed, Jewish American eyes - to the extent to which Israel is in a no-win situation. Rather than criticism, Israel merits understanding, compassion and respect for the extent to which it has been able to cope in such an irrational and hostile environment.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Bush: No Mo Big Mo

BYLINE: Tom Wicker

 BODY:
No matter what kind of Federal budget finally comes out of the unseemly scramble that has so demeaned Congress and the White House in recent weeks, a long-suffering public is more likely to remember the process than the product. Seldom, if ever, has Washington looked more self-serving and less effective.
There's plenty of blame and ridicule to go around, but on first analysis, the big loser - certainly of what he once called Big Mo - seems to be George Bush. But the President has lost a good deal more than the political ''momentum'' he had earned from his adept mobilization of the collective-security effort against Saddam Hussein in the Middle East. 
Most obviously, Mr. Bush's overall approval rating dropped meteorically, from a nearly incredible 76 percent in August to 60 percent last week, in the continuing New York Times/CBS News Poll. That's still pretty good, but it was a new low for the Bush Presidency. Worse, on specific questions, the President got even lower marks - 52 percent disapproved of his handling of the economy, 58 percent opposed his conduct in the budget debacle and 46 percent criticized his savings-and-loan ''rescue.''
Less demonstrably but not less plausibly, the President's bob-and-weave performance in budget negotiations with the Democrats combined disastrously with his earlier abandonment of his ''no new taxes'' pledge. Together, they undermined the public belief that Republicans, and Mr. Bush personally, were more responsible and reliable than Democrats in fiscal matters.
The one point on which the President and his aides seemed most nearly adamant, moreover, was their resistance to an income-tax increase on the rich - even as the President kept insisting on a capital-gains tax break for the same rich. Mr. Bush was willing, however, to accept a gasoline tax and ''sin taxes'' on whisky, beer and cigarettes - all of which bear down hardest on the poor and middle class.
Never mind that Democratic negotiators accepted these levies, too. It was the President who was threatening to veto anything else, and it was the Democrats who were also demanding higher taxes on the wealthy - even pushing a bill explicitly designed for that purpose through the House. The net result may be that blue-collar and ethnic groups that voted Republican in the 80's - Ronald Reagan's greatest gift to his party - will come to the predictable conclusion of Ron Brown, the Democratic national chairman: ''The Republican Party favors the wealthy and the Democratic Party favors the average American.''
Beginning with his abandonment of the no-new-taxes pledge, and continuing through the ups and downs of the budget negotiations, Mr. Bush's performance also displeased the Republican right wing. The President failed either to take a hard-right ideological stand, or to provide tough leadership for whatever position he did take at any given moment - which was sometimes hard to tell without an interpreter of Bushspeak.
A modern Republican President can ill afford to offend his right wing, which dominates Republican national conventions and ideological debate within the party, and is seldom willing to lower its voice in the interests of party unity. At least in these precincts, Mr. Bush in the budget scramble might even have resurrected the wimp's reputation that he and Willie Horton, with the aid of bloodshed in Panama, had so nearly buried.
Even Mr. Bush's respect for the ''vision thing,'' never much in evidence, must have seemed to many onlookers less compelling than usual. A President presumably should have a sense of where he wants to take the country, in economic as well as other terms. Mr. Bush appeared, instead, to have no central conviction for which he was willing to fight (other than the capital-gains tax break), and to be more concerned about escaping blame than asserting leadership. As such caution often dictates, he managed neither.
The nation may be the winner in one respect. Polls also show declining approval of the U.S. military presence on the Saudi Arabian border. Either from second thoughts about Operation Desert Shield or declining confidence in Mr. Bush's general leadership, support for his handling of the Middle East crisis already has plunged from 76 to 57 percent.
This sharp drop suggests that there would be little support for an actual war in the desert, either to liberate Kuwait or to bring down Saddam Hussein. For that reason, Mr. Bush may think long and hard, and more than twice, about taking the nation into such a war - probably without allies in the region and with too little enthusiasm at home.

HEADLINE: The President: Read His Slips

BYLINE: By James Reston; James Reston is former Washington correspondent and former executive editor of The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Most Presidents run into unavoidable trouble by the time they reach midterm, but George Bush is different. Many of his troubles were not only avoidable but predictable, and this has hurt him because they raise questions about his judgment.
In a way, the criticism of his budget difficulties has been extreme if not unfair. Fights between Republicans and Democrats over how to raise and spend money are unavoidable. Put a few hundred billion on the table and they usually pounce on it like pit bulls. But the main thing is not that they disagreed about how to cut it up, but that they agreed to reduce the deficit by half a trillion dollars in the next five years. This may be the single most important economic decision of the last two years. 
George Bush is better at the big things than the little things. His objective on the budget was admirable but his handling of it was comical, and when he's mocked as weak or indecisive, he's unpredictable. We saw this in the campaign when he overcame his better qualities and followed John Sununu, Lee Atwater and James Baker down the low road.
After he won, he promised to nominate the best advisers available and told us we were living in an age of terror when life was fragile, and then picked Dan Quayle of Indiana for Vice President. This was clearly an avoidable blunder, and an injustice to both Mr. Quayle and the country, which fortunately can be corrected next time if his party thinks about it.
The odd thing about George Bush is that he plans his fumbles. He didn't have to promise not to raise taxes in a future he could not possibly foresee, or remind the country about his infamous wisecrack, by telling the reporters during the budget mess ''read my hips.'' They read his flips instead.
He has done some very good things. No President since the last great war has made a greater effort than George Bush to reach out to the opposition leaders for compromise and understanding. He has been on television almost as much as Dan Rather, and has held more press conferences in more strange places than any President since the inception of that jumping-jack institution. He has many other good qualities, but foresight isn't one of them.
When he ordered 200,000 men into the Arabian desert, he went on vacation and delivered his war communiques from the back of a golf cart, and was genuinely surprised that most people didn't think this showed ''grace under pressure.'' In the middle of the budget crisis when he was trying to get the support of the leaders of the Democratic Party, he took time off to campaign in North Carolina for the re-election of Senator Jesse Helms, of all people. He was determined at the start to ''hit the ground running,'' forgetting that this is what John Kennedy did when he ran into the Bay of Pigs, and Lyndon Johnson did when he ran into Vietnam.
These are the ''little things'' that trouble even many of his most loyal supporters, and some of them are not so little. One of his major foreign policy objectives was to persuade Mikhail Gorbachev not to use military force to achieve political objectives in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, but he invaded Panama against his treaty commitments to the United Nations in order to capture a two-bit dictator, and didn't know what to do with him when he caught him. Having defied the U.N. in Panama, he then relied on it in Iraq.
It wasn't enough for him to blockade Iraq and punish Saddam Hussein as ''another Hitler,'' but he insisted on sending the biggest U.S. Army since the last war into the desert, not wanting to use it, not knowing how to get it out and facing once more the taunts of the armchair warriors, who say he must not only restore the independence of Kuwait but also get rid of Saddam Hussein and the threat of Iraq's Army as well. This is a dangerous situation for a President dropping in the popularity polls and facing both a deficit crisis and a mid-term election.
In such a pickle, a little half-time skull practice wouldn't hurt, but sometimes he's all bones and no skull, and can't sit still and think. He's all over the lot - fighting for the rich, campaigning not only in North Carolina but in California, driving in from Camp David to conserve gas and letting his helicopter return empty, jogging in the morning and flying to the world series in Cincinnati at night, always on the move, always pleasant and even cheerful.
He is the first President in memory who has not been able to get the votes of a majority of the members of his own party for a major bill in the Congress, but he has even tolerated Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip in the House, who has not only defied the President on the budget but hasn't even had the decency to resign.
He may come smiling through and even be re-elected, but it will take him a while to recover from the planned fumbles of the first half.

HEADLINE: The World;
Arabs Ponder Ways To Fix Arab Problems

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan

 BODY:
While most of the world is trying just to muddle through the crisis in the Persian Gulf, a few Arab thinkers - some would say dreamers - have begun drafting proposals to meet the widespread yearning of poorer Arabs in this undemocratic and inegalitarian region for greater democracy and a more equitable distribution of wealth.
''I think that in the wake of this great crisis, this great shock to the region, there will be a sense of humiliation among the Arabs,'' said Boutros Ghali, the Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. ''So a consensus is growing that we will have to present some new ideas to help restore the Arab image and reignite a sense of confidence in the region and its future.''
In capitals whose governments have adopted radically different approaches toward getting Iraq out of Kuwait, specific and remarkably similar proposals are being crafted. Mr. Ghali, for example, has suggested the creation of an Arab parliament and an Arab ''petrobank,'' ideas he said he discussed with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d during a visit to the United States two weeks ago. 
Mr. Ghali asserts that a pan-Arab parliament - perhaps under the aegis of the 21-member Arab League - would be less threatening than domestic parliaments, a concept anathema to conservative gulf monarchies. A pan-Arab forum would give these states experience in a democratic institution, and might diminish suspicion of parliaments in their own states, he said.
But only a few Arab countries have functioning parliaments, almost none in the Western sense. While Egypt and Jordan have parliaments, power resides primarily with President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and with King Hussein and his court.
Ahmed Khatib, who helped lead the democratization movement in Kuwait before Iraq's invasion, noted that pressure from Saudi Arabia and other gulf states helped prompt the ruling al-Sabah family in Kuwait to dissolve its own obstreperous parliament in 1986. He said the gulf states were not likely to approve of an experiment in parliamentary democracy anytime soon.
Moreover, the meeting of Arab League foreign ministers in Tunis last week reflected the disarray in the most enduring Arab organization, which was created in 1945 to enhance cooperation and unity. The session, called to discuss Israel's bloody suppression of Palestinian rioting in Jerusalem, nearly collapsed when a dispute over the wording of a resolution condemning Israel, but not the United States, led half of the delegates to walk out for several hours.
''The Arab League is in shambles,'' said a senior Arab foreign minister. Given the turmoil in this oldest of Arab cooperation groups, it was not likely that the states would agree to a new pan-Arab assembly.
Yet the allure of such a forum remains. The re-establishment of a real parliament was discussed last weekend by some 700 Kuwaitis in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. And the need to restore Kuwait's quirky version of democracy was conceded in principle by Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, who pledged unspecified democratic reforms once the government is restored. Moreover, Jordanian officials credit their parliament, first freely elected last year and dominated by Islamic fundamentalists, with helping to defuse political tensions.
Mr. Ghali's suggestion that the Arabs establish a regional ''petrobank'' has had far greater Arab resonance, particularly among representatives of poor, non-oil producing states like Jordan. In an interview last week, King Hussein called for such a development fund ''to bridge the gap between haves and have nots'' in this region, where, the World Bank says, annual per capita income figures ranged in 1988 from $15,770 in the United Arab Emirates to $480 in Mauritania and the Sudan. ''We need such an institution,'' the King said, ''so that a million Sudanese will not die of hunger this year while millions are being wasted.''
The King's younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan, proposed several years ago what he called an oil stabilization and development fund consistent with the spirit of Mr. Ghali's petrobank proposal. Under Crown Prince Hassan's proposal, Arab oil states would put a designated percentage of oil revenues over a specified price per barrel into a joint fund. If the market price dipped below that level, the money would be used to compensate for the revenue losses. But if the market went above the marker, excess revenues would go to development projects in poorer Arab countries.
King Hussein knows first-hand the risks of the current system of distribution of oil wealth - based on the whim of fellow Arabs. Between 1978 and 1988, the Arab states pledged billions to Jordan. Qatar and Abu Dhabi stopped making payments in 1983, Algeria made only one payment, and Libya never paid at all, aides to the King said. By 1988, Jordan's $6 billion deficit - equal to the money pledged and spent but never paid - was jeopardizing the country's economic stability, so the King appealed to Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait.
The Emir was unsympathethic. ''His answer to me was: 'It's your fault. You're not a gulf state. You're not an oil-producing state,' '' King Hussein recounted. '' 'Why do you have these ambitious development plans, the universities and all that? You can't afford them.' ''
Jordan, the Sudan, and other poor Arab states have grown increasingly resentful of these humiliating appeals for handouts from fellow Arab ''oilogarchies,'' as one Jordanian called the oil-producing nations. While Kuwaiti officials have expressed an interest in an Arab petrobank, gulf states that have not been invaded have been silent, and few are likely to endorse the concept.
But Mr. Ghali says the mood has shifted. ''Everyone in the Arab world in the wake of this crisis now understands that things must change.''

Our Bad Dreams

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
 The salvation in the Great Depression, or so I'm told, was the sense that we were pulling together. For those in trouble in recent years, the poison has become the isolation, the sense of being the lone diminished American in the land of boffo birthday parties and leveraged buyouts. But even the lucky ones knew this time was coming. Like characters in an Ayn Rand novel, we felt it in the 80's, all the small awry things that gave a jerry-built feeling to the helium real estate boom and the feeding frenzy of the 27-year-old art collectors. Unlike an Ayn Rand novel, no hero has arrived, with mythic shoulders and a Gary Cooper profile.
 You can feel the bad times to come in the documentary Barbara Kopple has made about the meatpackers' strike that paralyzed Austin, Minn., in 1985. It's rare that I cry at documentaries, but "American Dream" is painful to watch, like looking at a train speeding down the track. Part of the pain is knowing that the train is going to run right into these decent people, all these hard-working women with trivets on their walls and dried flowers on their kitchen tables, all these hard-working men with plaid shirts and billed caps. Part of the pain is thinking the train is someday going to hit you. 
 The people at the Hormel plant believed in a certain kind of America. They went on strike because the company wanted to cut wages to stay competitive. "It's ridiculous,"' one man says at a meeting at the beginning of the film, clutching pay stubs that show his weekly gross has gone from $637 to $400 to $312 a week. Some of these were second-generation meatpackers, and from their earliest years thay had known certain truths: that the union was their strength, and that the company needed their labor as much as they needed the company's money.
 The truths were false.
 Five months after the strike began, when the sunshine and the esprit of August rallies had given way to snowbound picket lines illuminated by trash cans filled with blazing logs, the strikers stood and yelled "scab" as 2,000 people appllied for their jobs. Some of those who came had not worked for years, and any shame they might have once had about crossing a picket line had long since evaporated with their incomes.
 In one scene in the film, two workers go to the big white house of the chief executive officer. And from behind the opaque safety of the screen his wife harangues them about how many people would be happy to have their jobs, even at a cut rate.
 The hard thing about watching "American Dream" is that you know she is right. When 1,500 people went out on strike for a principle, a principle was just about what they got. Most of them were replaced. Their children lived on rice and kitchen-table speeches, and Spam kept rolling off those assembly lines. Some crossed the line and made lifelong enemies out of lifelong fiends. The union, wallowing in tactics, personalities and bravado, failed them. A grown man sits in front of Ms. Koppel's camera and says, tears running into the ruts of his face, "All I want to do is go to work."
 Meatpacker, meet red foulard tie.
I don't know how economists define a depression. I only know that I went to three board meetings last week, and they all began the same way: "The news is not good." Five years ago people at those meetings used to talk about the boom and say giddily, 'It can't last.'
 Even then, when every day there seemed to be more newly minted men made of money, people like the people in Austin, Minn., were learning there were hard times just around the corner. Every day those people are more worried about the delicate balance, that delicate balance between the paycheck and the bills, that balance that can be knocked out of whack by a bum muffler.
 Webster's says a depression is "a period of low economic activity marked esp. by unemployment" as well as "a state of feeling sad." That covers it, I think.

HEADLINE: Rezoning to Meet Silicon Valley's Housing Needs

BYLINE: By JOHN McCLOUD

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, CALIF.

 BODY:
 A quarter-century ago, San Jose designated 2,900 acres in the north end as an industrial zone, excluding all other uses save for existing farms and orchards that had not yet been converted to manufacturing, a few small retail areas providing services for local businesses and three mobile-home parks, which were considered temporary.
Twenty years later, with about half the acreage developed, problems were evident. Local freeways were jammed with rush-hour taffic as workers traveled from other communities to reach their jobs. Prices on what little nearby housing existed had skyrocketed. Companies began to consider relocating to escape the congestion and provide access to housing for their employees. 
At the prompting of a coalition of business leaders called the Santa Clara County Manufacturing Group, San Jose and five neighboring cities that faced similar situations formed what became known as the Golden Triangle Task Force to deal with the problem. The name came from the shape of the area formed by the intersections of the three principal freeways serving Silicon Valley -- Routes 880, 101 and 237.
In 1985, the task force issued a report delineating three major objectives for each city: developing a growth-management plan, implementing a transportation-management program and rezoning enough land to accommodate a six-city total of 15,000 new housing units above the number already targeted by the individual cities. In 1987, the housing goal was up to a total of 65,000 new units by the year 2000.
"Based on job projections, the actual number of housing units needed was about 125,000," said Mike Evanhoe, executive director for the Golden Triangle Task Force. "It was decided that half that amount was a reasonable goal, with the remainder having to come from adjoining communities."
To meet that goal, the task force reasoned that the cities would have to convert commercial and industrial lands to residential use.
"The approach makes sense from three perspectives," explained Tom MacRostie, a principal planner for this city. "Not only does this provide more land for housing development, but it also reduces the land given over to commercial development, dampening housing demands. At the same time, it allows people to live closer to their jobs so that they don't have to drive as much, reducing both congestion and pollution."
River Oaks is the largest single development to come out of the ground so far in response to the Golden Triangle report. Now under construction by A-M Homes of Sunnyvale and Shea Homes of San Jose, the project, which comprises 1,100 rental apartments and 900 for-sale town homes, occupies undeveloped agricultural land originally intended for an industrial park. The utility lines and roads have been in place for 16 years.
About three-quarters of a mile away, A-M Homes, in conjunction with the Gibson-Speeno Company of San Jose and New England Life Insurance Company of Boston, are planning Renaissance Village. The group bought the 56-acre site for $25 million in 1989 from the Campeau Corporation of Toronto.
That project, of 1,140 apartments and 420 town homes, is now moving through the approval process, with construction expected to begin early next year.
Last year, the city rezoned a third parcel in the area, a 93-acre farm, for additional housing.
"Our biggest problem," said Mr. MacRostie, "has been finding properties under individual ownership that are large enough to create a total residential neighborhood environment. Building a few hundred units here and there won't work because people won't want to live someplace where they feel surrounded by businesses and factories. The idea is to create somewhat self-contained villages within a few minutes of workplaces."
The site for Renaissance Village lies along Santa Clara County's new light-rail system, as does the recently redesignated 93-acre parcel. River Oaks is a half-mile from the light-rail line, but the project's developers are providing a free shuttle service to the nearest mass-transit station.
Renaissance Village and River Oaks will each have about 20,000 square feet of retail space to provide daily services. In addition, Renaissance Village is next door to a mixed-use project now under way in the adjoining city of Santa Clara that will include 2,100 residential units, a 150,000-square-foot shopping center and two office towers.
Because the other Golden Triangle cities -- Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Palo Alto (Santa Clara withdrew from the task force) -- are smaller than San Jose, they have had an even more difficult time finding previously undesignated sites on which to develop new housing.
"We have seen projects where warehouses or auto dealerships were converted to housing, but we have virtually no raw land," said Ken Alsman, economic development manager for the City of Mountain View. To compensate, that city is looking toward mixed-use projects that will make more intensive use of already developed areas. "There are a lot of tilt-up industrial buildings from 20 or 25 years ago that are already being replaced. We are just beginning to study the possibilities of using these sites."
Some potential sites present environmental problems. Steve Burkey, an associate planner for Milpitas, mentioned a 300 to 400-acre site in his city that is available for development but that has many environmental unknowns.
"We can't afford to conduct all the environmental studies that would be necessary before that land could be declared suitable for development," said Mr. Burkey. "If a developer wants to come in and do them, that's fine. But it will be at his risk." Another obstacle to meeting the housing goal is the reluctance of some developers to build as densely as the individual cities would prefer.
The reasoning, said Roger Menard, president of Kaufman & Broad South, developer of 910 single-family homes in Calfifrrnia Landing in Malpitas, is that surveys have shown that 90 percent of prospective buyers want single-family homes.
Mr. Burkey said the developer was entitled to 2,000 residential units as of right -- and as many as 4,000 could have been built under certain conditions.
Despite the obstacles, Mr. Evanhoe said that since the Golden Triangle Task Force report was issued, 15,000 units have been either permitted or built and sites for up to 30,000 more units are under study for rezoning at this moment.
"The program has been moderately successful," he said. "When the sites are available, developers have been coming in and developing. So we know the market is there."
Meanwhile, the first town homes at River Oaks are on the market, with prices running about $250,000 for 1,400 to 1,800-square-feet. Rents for the apartments, now under construction, will run from about $700 for a studio to $1,100 for two bedrooms.
Steve Delva, vice president of planning for A-M Holmes predicted the town homes would sell with little trouble, saying, "there's really been no new housing of any magnitude built anywhere in the region recently.
"Last year, only 2,200 residential building permits were issued in the whole city of San Jose," he said. "That's why there's been such a problem. People have been moving one and two hours away in order to find something that they could afford, creating terrible traffic and smog in the process. This program is filling a very real need."

A Chance to See The Remaking Of Hungary

BYLINE: BUDAPEST -

 BODY:
On their way to class here each morning, students from the University of California and the University of Wisconsin must pass an imposing life-size bronze statue of Karl Marx in the stately foyer of the Budapest University of Economics.
Marx, however, would hardly delight in what this group of students -including for the first time Americans and Eastern Europeans from outside Hungary - is learning, or the conditions the students are encountering at this university, which until recently bore his name.
These students ''are in the midst of a socioeconomic upheaval, and they are getting lectured by the people who are making it,'' said Robert Sarlos, the director of the two universities' joint Education Abroad Program.
The program's instructors, Professor Sarlos said, include ''people who are vitally involved in the remaking of Hungary.'' They include Istvan Rev, a sociology professor and a longtime critic of the Government, and Tomas Reti, an economics professor and active member of the Hungarian free trade union movement. 
Among those who have spoken to the group are Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, who discussed current foreign policy, and Karoly Soos, chairman of the Parliament's Committee on Budget, Taxation and Public Finance, who talked about the nation's current budget troubles.
 
A 'Painful' Transition
Now in its fifth year, the Hungary program is larger than ever, with 37 students from eight California campuses - 15 from the University of Wisconsin at Madison - and now, university students from Estonia, the Transylvania region of Romania and Poland.
Professor Sarlos, who left Hungary in 1956 at the age of 25 and who before his two-year appointment as program director taught theater history at the University of California at Davis, speaks excitedly of Hungary's ''painful'' yet ''momentous'' transition from a socialist to a market economy, or, as he puts it, ''back into the West.''
Many of the students, Americans and foreigners alike, say the political changes that swept the former Soviet bloc countries last year inspired them to study in Hungary, which is struggling to shake itself free from decades of central planning.
''In light of everything that was going on, I was interested in seeing how a country could make that jump to a market economy,'' said Megan Sheehan, a junior majoring in history from the University of Wisconsin.
In addition to an intensive course in the Hungarian language, the students must enroll in at least three other courses, which are taught in English by Hungarian professors. The courses focus on Central and Eastern European politics, economics, art, history and contemporary society.
But the students in the Education Abroad Program learn as much simply by living in Budapest as they do in the classroom. Ms. Sheehan, who grew up in Brooklyn, said she thought Budapest would be ''more different'' from her hometown. Yet one cafe reminded her of a restaurant in Coney Island.
 
As 'Fluent as Possible'
Catherine Davis, a junior from Carmichael, Calif., who is majoring in international relations at the university in Davis, said she hoped to become as ''fluent as possible'' in Hungarian before she leaves in June. ''I just want to be able to go to a Hungarian village and be able to talk to people without having to have someone translate,'' she said.
Iwo Bender, a junior at Catholic University of Lublin in Poland, said he enjoyed studying with the American students because he has found that they are ''open minded'' and ''not ashamed of expressing themselves.'' But Mr. Bender added that the American students seemed more competitive than Eastern and Central European university students.
''People are more laid back here as far as academics are concerned,'' he said. ''You don't get that feeling of nonstop competition.''

HEADLINE: Industry Prods Schools On Educating Students

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
GROWING concern that Long Island students are graduating from high school without the necessary skills to enter the work force is prompting educators and business leaders to look at what schools are doing and should be doing to better prepare their students, and how the schools and the business community can work together on the problem.
The workplace is dramatically changing the skills required for its work force, and schools are being asked to provide programs that will result in more-competent graduates, said Dr. Edward Milliken, Superintendent of Boces II in central Suffolk County. When the last generation graduated from high school, Long Island industry relied on agriculture and manufacturing, he said, adding:
''But now we are a very service-oriented economy. Industries are driven by technology, and there is a greater demand on the part of business to have people who are technologically prepared, who have higher verbal, communications and critical-thinking skills.'' 
If there are not skilled people to fill the jobs, employers will have to look elsewhere to find them, Dr. Milliken said.
 
Larocca Cites 'Growing Gap'
A perception exists that there is a growing gap between the needs of employers and high school graduates coming out of the system, said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association.
Unfortunately, he said, many people think that students, particularly those who are not college bound, are not leaving school with sufficient skills for the workplace. The skills include literature, communication, mathematics and reasoning.
''The concern intensifies as the economy slows,'' Mr. Larocca said, ''and we are now on the upside of the curve in the importance of addressing this issue.''
In a response to the concerns, the Bay Shore and East Islip School Districts are co-sponsoring a symposium on Tuesday on ''Education and the Economy.''
The conference, at the Bay Shore Middle School at 8 P.M., is to cover these questions:
* Are Long Island schools preparing young people to work?
* Will the probelm situation affect Long Island business?
* Will foreign-born workers fill the void?
 
Speaker, Panelists Listed
The keynoter will be Dr. Willard Daggett of the State Education Department. And the panelists will include Michael LoGrande, the former Suffok County Executive who is a management and planning consultant; Alexander Sheer, Chancellor of New York Institute of Technology, and Walter Dunne, vice president of the New York State United Teachers union.
Bay Shore and East Islip are pilot districts for the Excellence and Accountability Program of the State Education Department.
The conference was planned because a need was seen, said Dr. Robert Roelle, assistant superintendent for instruction for Bay Shore.
''Industry is changing so fast that it's hard to keep up,'' he said. ''The reading level of high-tech manuals has gone up dramatically and is comparable to beginning college textbooks.
''The need for skilled workers is increasing, while for unskilled workers it's decreasing. Kids today need to be critical thinkers and team players. If we can't provide skilled people to fill the jobs, employers will turn to immigrant workers.''
There is no longer a big difference between skills required for the work force and those required for college, said Mr. Dunne.
 
Look at Programs Urged
''We must take a look at our school programs and move expectations to a higher level for all students,'' he said. ''We've done an outstanding job based on the measurements we've used up to now, but we can't accept these measurements any more, not just for the Harvard-bound kids, but for all kids.
''A high school diploma is not enough; it no longer means that someone can go out and get a good job.''
There is agreement among educators and business leaders that it is critical for the schools and the business community to work together in a partnership.
Over the last few years, there has been a growing dialogue between the Island's educators and business leaders to help educators better understand the changes in the world of work and the changing required skills so that they can prepare their students accordingly, said Dr. Mary Barter, president of the Nassau County Council of Superintendents.
The council has been working with the Long Island Association to develop a business survey. The goal, Dr. Barter said, is to ascertain what expectations employers have for high school graduates entering the work force and what schools should be doing to prepare them.
 
Partnerships Developed
Over the last few years, more than 25 school-business partnerships have been developed under the sponsorship of School-Business Partnerships of Long Island, Mr. Larocca said.
The partnerships link high school students of a school district with a particular company. The concept is excellent, Mr. Larocca said, but the effectiveness of the partnership depends on how much energy the parties bring to it.
Part of the problem that exists is the illusion of being content, especially in the wealthier districts, Dr. Roelle said.
''The parents of the 'haves' think that everything is working, and it's hard to convince them that there is a problem,'' he said. ''But they're not seeing the larger picture for the future of Long Island. Compared to other countries we fall short, and it's not just the 'have-nots' that we're concerned with.
''The affluent school districts should be just as concerned. If their students are among the future employers of the Island, they will be depending on their peers to be their work force.''
Making changes in the schools will be a slow process, Dr. Roelle said, but the state has recognized the need and is encouraging local districts to experiment with different plans.
One of the biggest impediments is the lack of time, said Crescent Bellamore, the Bay Shore Superintendent of Schools.
''We're trying to do so much more than ever, but we haven't increased the number of hours in the school day,'' he said.
An extended school year has become more prevalent in several Western states, Mr. Bellamore said, adding:
''A 180-day school year goes back to our agricultural society, when youngsters had to go to work on the farms. But that no longer fits today. It's virtually impossible to follow the curriculum, prepare students for the Regents and teach the higher cognitive skills within the available time frame.
''The baby boomers will soon be leaving the work force, and kids who are in school now will be taking over by the year 2000. The bulge will be followed by a trickle, who will be expected to fill the shoes of the baby boomers. In that shrinking population are a higher number of poor, of minorities, of kids from single-parent homes.
''We have no choice but to prepare them for what they will have to deal with.''

Investments Flowing Out of U.S.

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Foreigners are not the only investors moving money out of American financial markets, some economists and portfolio managers say. Increasingly, domestic institutions as well as individual investors are looking at foreign bond markets as preferable alternatives to staying at home.
The trend to move offshore was clear in the first half of the year, when American purchases of foreign securities totaled $18 billion, more than double the amount bought in the first six months of 1989. 
 Evidence of where domestically based capital has moved since then is mostly anecdotal. But in light of what has, and has not, taken place in the Persian Gulf, Washington and the American financial system since the end of June, it is unlikely that the outflow has slowed.
"We can't quantify it, but we know that dollar-based capital continues to move offshore," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
 
Outflow Is Reported
 Barbara Kenworthy, senior portfolio manager of taxable fixed-income funds at the Dreyfus Corporation, said that over the last few months investments in dollar-based funds had actually risen a bit. But she added that colleagues elsewhere had reported an outflow.
"They don't know where it is going, but it is leaving the country," she said. Since early August, "more people are talking" about investing elsewhere, she added. "Whether they are acting on it remains to be seen."
Evidence of such an outflow may lie in the movement of the dollar, which despite its reputation as a safe-haven currency has plumbed new depths since early August. The decline, Mr. Hale noted, had the complete sanction of the Bush Administration.
"People have been aware that Treasury would be permissive of a fall in the dollar, but I think they are surprised by the extent of it," he said. "Given the banking crisis, there is no constituency in Washington to support the dollar through a rise in interest rates."
 
Financial Fragility Cited
 Bankers say that shoring up sagging foreign and domestic confidence by pushing up the value of the dollar through an increase in interest rates is not what the system currently needs. "There is real financial fragility out there right now," said one New York banker, who insisted on anonymity. "Many people are screaming, 'Where is the Fed, and why is it sitting on its hands at a time when it should be easing monetary policy?' "
Analysts said they remained convinced that the Federal Reserve Board would move to reduce short-term interest rates once a credible Federal budget package was enacted. But some portfolio managers said that additional steps would be necessary to reassure foreigners that American debt securities are worth the risk.
"A credible budget agreement would help," said David Boardman, an executive vice president with Rowe-Price Fleming in London and manager of a $375 million global bond fund. "But a commitment from the Administration of where the dollar should be is also necessary. Right now it looks like a policy of benign neglect."
Absent those two developments, Mr. Boardman said, "there is a real chance of investors cutting their losses and getting out of the United States bond market."
 
Strong Demand Expected
 With the Fed widely perceived to be on the verge of lowering short-term interest rates, demand for bills and notes should remain strong, analysts said. Demand for a $12.5 billion offering of 69-day cash management bills on Friday was surprisingly heavy, Ms. Kenworthy said. And investor response to today's planned auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills, as well as to a sale of two-year notes on Wednesday, should be good, market participants said.
Predicting demand at three auctions this week of Citicorp's money market preferred stock is much more problematic. Rates on the money market preferred, which resets every 49 days, have been rising steadily in recent months, reflecting a deterioration in confidence in the banking system generally, as well as in Citicorp.
Citicorp, which conducts such auctions weekly, sold reset money market preferred last Wednesday at a reset rate of 8.76 percent. At a reset auction in late August, the 49-day securities were sold at a rate of 6.53 percent, according to analysts at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, a research and credit rating agency.
The response among stock market investors to the downturn in the fortunes of major banks has been even more vicious than what has been seen in the debt market. Last week, the stock market capitalization of the nation's 10 largest banks, which collectively hold just under $1 trillion in assets, was $18 billion, Mr. Hale of Kemper Finanical said. The next 40 largest institutions, which hold assets in excess of $1 trillion, had a market capitalization of around $40 billion. "There is no precedent in the postwar period for this," Mr. Hale said.
 
Gloom on Fiscal Year's Data
 Market participants today will get a final accounting of how the Government fared in the recently ended 1990 fiscal year. Analysts say it does not promise to be an uplifting report.
In September the Government probably posted a deceptively large $20-odd billion surplus, said Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, compared with a $6.1 billion shortfall a year earlier.
For the full 1990 fiscal year, the deficit probably grew by almost half, she added, to $221 billion, roughly matching the previous high, set in 1986. A deficit of that size would represent a little more than 4 percent of the gross national product, below the peak reached in the last recession.
With the economy slowing and outlays rising, however, chances are real that a new record could be set in the current 1991 fiscal year.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Former German Front Line Seems Disoriented by Peace

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FULDA, Germany

 BODY:
The two watchtowers stand vacant and silent now, the fence between them ripped and the cracked concrete sprouting sharp-thorned hawthorn.
Their confrontation seems all the more obscure in the beauty of a golden autumn afternoon. The wind whistling through the broken panes brings snatches of a tractor chugging across a distant field or the bark of a dog from the tile-roofed village nestled in the hills. 
 Otherwise nothing moves. Like Shelley's "Ozymandias," whose "two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert," the watchtowers seem to rise from the forests and fields like monuments to forgotten rivalries and vanished empires.
A scant year ago, heavily-armed men stood in these towers day and night training sophisticated military optics at each other and reporting every move they saw. This was the front line of the cold war, the trip-wire of World War III, where the border between East and West crossed the fabled Fulda Gap, the ancient invasion corridor through which the Soviet Army would try to punch if Moscow chose to challenge the West.
On the western side, men of the United States Army's 11th Armored Cavalry stood at what they called the "frontier of freedom" with the latest in American armor and electronics.
 
'It Can Be Confusing'
 On the other, East German border guards sat watching and photographing the Americans, but even more their own countrymen, who occasionally tried to rush the formidable fortifications at the risk of their lives. Behind the hills to the east, the Soviet Eighth Guards Army manned the periphery of what was still the threatening Soviet bloc.
Master Sgt. Robert McCord still remembers the strange feeling when the "enemy" first came over. "It was unnerving to see an East German officer, whom I clearly recognized from the cameras, walking through Fulda," he said. "That was in December -- he'd been on border patrol in the morning, and came over to shop in the evening."
More recently, he said, Soviet officers have begun to come over, some in full uniform. "It can be confusing -- you develop the perception that this is the enemy, and suddenly he's in your back yard," he said.
Even more disorienting is that the East German soldiers are now allied German soldiers, and their Soviet-made equipment is now on the Western side. "All your life you train to defeat these tanks, and now they're yours," said Sergeant McCord.
The sergeant also remembered the first time he stepped over the border himself. Before the wall came down, the border was the front line, and to cross it was to violate everything the 11th Armored was trained to avoid.
 
Visits to the 'Other Side'
 "We always had strict exercises on not crossing the line. We practiced this, we showed this to our people -- here's the line, don't cross it," he said, drawing an imaginary line through the ground. "So when I did it the first time, I felt I was doing something immoral. It was a very strange feeling."
Sergeant McCord and his German-born wife now visit regularly on the "other side," and friends from there visit them. A newly paved road crosses the former line near Observation Post Alpha.
The 11th Armored is still here at full strength, but the patrols along the border stopped in February, and the officers have been careful since then to keep their tanks and radars "over the horizon" from the former border. The mission now is basically to stay as long as the Soviets stay, and that is likely to take four to five years.
The 11th Armored has had about 4,500 soldiers in Fulda, part of a 60,000 strong force in Hesse, the German federal state on whose territory the Fulda gap lies.
The Americans in Fulda face the 60,000 Soviet troops of the Eighth Guards Armor, stationed around Weimar in the former East Germany. The Soviet soldiers, unlike the Americans, never patrolled the inner-German border themselves, but left the patrolling to the East German border troops.
All in all, 250,000 American soldiers are stationed on former West German territory, 60,000 of whom are likely to be withdrawn over the next four or five years. The number of soldiers of the 11th Armored will not be cut.
 
A Tinge of Longing
 The Soviet troops in what was East Germany total 350,000. Under a German-Soviet agreement signed last week, the Soviet forces will have left Germany by the end of 1994.
The 11th Armored and its 10,000 soldiers and dependents are not among the Americans being withdrawn from Germany. "The 11th A.C.R. will probably be the one to turn out the lights if the United States leaves Germany," Sergeant McCord said.
Though no one says so openly, the reduced mission grates on the career soldiers, especially when many of their comrades are tasting front-line service in Saudi Arabia.
"There's no sense having a bulldog if you don't let it bite once in a while," said Command Sgt. Maj. Richard Morgan at regiment headquarters at Fulda with a tinge of longing.
But if the American troops seem a bit disoriented by the sudden disappearance of the border that used to define their mission, at least they can claim that the broken fence and empty towers are "evidence of mission accomplished," as the commanding officer here said in the unit's newspaper.
 
Stories of Officers' Wives
 On the eastern side, the evidence is of a mission abandoned. The Soviet soldiers are still there, to be sure, but the fearsome guardians of the empire now peddle their service hats, insignia, even their weapons. Officers scour the flea markets to stock up on bargains before they are shipped back, and their wives demonstrate to remain abroad.
In Gotha, a city with a large garrison of the Soviet Eighth Guards Army 55 miles northeast of Fulda, Germans eagerly share the latest rumors about the "Mushkote," as the Russians are popularly called.
At the "Moscow" restaurant in what used to be "Friendship House" near the Soviet barracks, a group of German teachers tells of Soviet officers' wives at a nearby garrison who have been leaving their husbands and looking for Germans to marry. They tell of an acquaintance who bought a Kalashnikov assault rifle for $460 and a pair of pistols for $175 each.
The information cannot be verified, but what is obvious is that the old awe of the Soviets has changed to disdain and pity.
"They're starving," declared one of the teachers, Rupert Kober, to nods from his colleagues. "If you come here in the morning, you'll see that they've ripped up their roof timbers and have burned their furniture because they have no more fuel."
"The Russians are not especially loved or hated here, but everybody's happy they're leaving," said Achim Bosel. "Except one man -- there's a farmer here who's been getting gasoline from the Russians by the tankload for decades and selling it cheap. I haven't had to use a gas station for years. Nobody could touch him, because they assumed higher officers were involved."
 
Withdrawl Would Be Welcomed
 The feelings are different over in Fulda. Here, the "Amis," as the Americans are known, are 10 percent of the population and account for a considerable chunk of the economy. Many live in homes rented from Germans, and about 500 local residents work for the United States Army. In all, the American military pumps about $8 billion annually into the German economy and creates jobs for about 170,000 Germans.
Still, a poll last April by the Allensbach Institute, a conservative polling organization, showed that the number of Western Germans who welcomed the American withdrawal was growing. As reported in the weekly newpaper Die Welt, 49 percent of those questioned welcomed the withdrawal. A year earlier, the figure was 38 percent. In 1982, it was 21 percent, and in 1962, 12 percent.
But then the presence of the "Amis" or the "Mushkoten" hardly means what it used to when the Germanys were the bristling focus of the East-West confrontation, when O. P. Alpha was a front-line enclave where American soldiers moved about in full combat gear and visitors came for a glimpse of the trenches. The gates have been padlocked for some eight months now, and mushrooms sprout at the cracked edges of the basketball court.
The birch cross outside the front where an East German died long ago trying to flee is still there. But there is also a new enclosure of posts and white canvas set up by an unidentified peace group. On it asign pledges to turn "this point of East-West confrontation" into an education center "for demilitarization, the preservation of the environment, social justice, a decrease of government and worldwide solidarity."
The heavy iron fence along the former border is now riddled with gaping holes. Beyond, massive concrete slabs still lie angled to prevent East Germans from crashing through the barrier in trucks or tractors. But hawthorn bushes have sprouted in the track that followed the border.
The old East German tower, 100 yards from O. P. Alpha, stands sprayed with graffiti. Tangles of wires hang from the walls, and the windows from the observation room at the top have been smashed. But the view of the broad scar that was the border zigzagging into the distance still inspires awe: how great was the effort, and how swift its undoing.
 
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

HEADLINE: Ghost of Reagan in Connecticut Race

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWTOWN, Conn., Oct. 18

 BODY:
When Toby Moffett moved here from the New Haven area last year to attempt a political comeback, Republicans called him a carpetbagger and predicted his long record of liberalism would doom him in the state's conservative, blue-collar Fifth Congressional District.
But the residency issue appears to be fading in Mr. Moffett's race against Gary A. Franks, a conservative three-term Waterbury alderman who is seeking to become the state's first black Congressman and the first black Republican to hold a voting seat in the House of Representatives since 1935. 
 As the Northeast's economy spirals downward, the contest has taken on the aspect of a referendum: Can liberal Democrats, reinvigorated by the current budget fight in Washington, regain the working-class support they lost to Republicans during the 1980's?
"It is dawning on people that Reagan was just on the side of the superwealthy," said the 46-year-old Mr. Moffett, who served four terms as a Representative in Congress before losing bids for the United States Senate in 1982 and for Governor in 1986.
Mr. Franks, who is 37 years old, a Yale graduate and an unsuccessful candidate for state comptroller in 1986, disagreed. He predicted that the district's voters would reject Mr. Moffett's unreconstructed liberalism.
"Toby Moffett is looking at the district with rose-colored glasses on," Mr. Franks said. "He's always believed people in Connecticut were all for Toby Moffett, but the truth is that they weren't in 1982, they weren't in 1986, and they won't be in 1990."
 
Celebrity Endorsements
 As one of only 29 House seats in the nation for which an incumbent is not seeking re-election, the Fifth Congressional District race has drawn national attention. President Bush, Barbara Bush and Marilyn Quayle plan to campaign for Mr. Franks this month. Mr. Moffett meanwhile has brought in the actor Robert Redford, who owns a home in Weston; Stephen Stills, the singer, and Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., the former Democratic House Speaker from Massachusetts.
The seat is being vacated by Representative John G. Rowland of Waterbury, a conservative who is the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate. He was carried into office on President Ronald Reagan's coattails in 1984, upsetting the incumbent Democrat, William R. Ratchford of Waterbury.
This year, whether Mr. Rowland will provide coattails is an important question in the race, which has been overshadowed somewhat by the state's unusual three-way gubernatorial battle in which Lowell P. Weicker, a liberal Republican and former three-term Senator running as an independent is the front-runner.
Although Mr. Weicker has maintained a large lead in statewide polls over Mr. Rowland and the Democratic candidate, Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden, Mr. Rowland is expected to carry his home district, which runs across the middle of the western half of the state, from Meriden west to Danbury, and includes wealthy towns like Weston and Wilton, as well as Waterbury and the old mill towns along the Naugatuck River.
Even so, Republican strength in the district may have waned. Democrats around the country have taken the offensive, encouraged by Democrats in Washington who have used the budget battle to attack the Republicans as the party of the rich.
"I don't think you can say this is an area that is Reagan Republican indefinitely," said Terry A. Baney, a professor of political science at Teikyo Post University in Waterbury. "Some of that feeling has abated."
 
Starkly Different Choices
 Mr. Moffett and Mr. Franks aggressively play up their philosophical differences. Mr. Franks calls Mr. Moffett a relic of Jimmy Carter's tax-and-spend liberalism; Mr. Moffett characterizes Mr. Franks as a Jesse Helms type of conservative who would deny aid to the underprivileged.
"I am fundamentally, solidly opposed to what Reagan tried to do in terms of government retreat from cities and from giving people opportunity," Mr. Moffett said. "I am running in part against the Reagan era."
Mr. Franks, one of three black Republicans in the nation running for Congress this year, supports a cut in the capital-gains tax and opposes raising the Federal income tax. He favors a constitutional amendment to prohibit burning the American flag and supports the death penalty for drug leaders.
Like Mr. Moffett, Mr. Franks supports abortion rights, but he criticizes such Government initiatives as family-leave legislation, which would force private employers to provide social services, and the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990, which he believes would promulgate a quota system. Mr. Moffett supports both bills.
 
Residence an Issue
 Mr. Franks, who was raised in Waterbury, also has continued to criticize Mr. Moffett's recent move to Newtown, a small Fairfield County town in the Fifth Congressional District near Danbury, after having lived for three years in Branford in the Third Congressional District. In his years in the House, from 1974 to 1982, Mr. Moffett lived in Litchfield in the Sixth Congressional District. There is no residency requirement for Congressional candidates.
"He is an opportunist," Mr. Franks said. "He's trying to use this district to go to Washington."
Mr. Moffett, who at one time worked with the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, is now self-employed as an environmental consultant. He has sharply criticized Mr. Franks, who owns his own real-estate company, for not releasing his Federal and state income-tax forms and for owning properties occupied by low-income residents that have been cited for minor building-code violations.
Mr. Franks's race has been dismissed as an issue by both candidates. Blacks make up only about 4 percent of the voters in the district, which is almost evenly divided among Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters.
In recent interviews, however, voters said that race was certainly a factor working against Mr. Franks, particularly in the mill towns in the Naugatuck Valley. "I think he'll lose a few votes," said J. D. Hicks, 32, a general remodeler from Seymour. "I don't think the valley is open-minded."
No public polls have been conducted on the race, but Mr. Franks's polls show a dead heat, and Mr. Moffett's polls give him a narrow lead.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Chemical Results Hurt Occidental

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THE fortunes of chemical producers typically rise and fall with the nation's economy. And in the stock market this year, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation has been aligned more with chemical makers that are hurt by surging oil prices than with the global oil producers that benefit from them.
Occidental's chemical unit contributed three-fourths of the company's 1989 profits, or more than $1 billion. With profits in a broad retreat in the chemical industry, investors have pummeled Occidental's shares. 
 The shares, which traded below $18 earlier this month for the first time in eight years, were at $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in midweek. They closed on Friday at $22.625, benefitting from the slide in crude oil prices late last week.
Occidental's market value is down 30 percent this year amid mounting worries of recession, lower demand for chemicals and rising costs for crude oil, a raw material for chemical production. But oil company stocks as a group have risen 10 percent this year despite a selloff in the last two weeks.
Many analysts say that Occidental's shares are now a bargain -- that investors have overlooked the prospect that the company can earn an extra $30 million to $50 million in a year, or 10 cents to 17 cents a share, for every $1 increase in crude prices. Several companies, including ARCO, Chevron, Texaco, Mobil and Exxon, achieve a gain of at least 30 cents a share for every $1 increase in crude oil, said Eugene L. Nowak, an oil analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Occidental's third-quarter earnings report, released Tuesday, underscored the view that it benefits over all from rising oil prices. Operating income in the quarter rose by 68 percent, to $111 million, from $66 million in the same period a year ago. Chemical profits slid 40 percent, to $152 million, but the oil and gas unit posted a fivefold increase, to $78 million. Natural-gas transmission, meatpacking and coal operations also improved. Net income rose slightly, to $109 million, from $108 million.
"Chemicals could be in the doldrums for a year, maybe longer," said Warren M. Shimmerlik, an independent oil analyst in New York. "But it isn't going to last forever. This is an efficient company that will benefit from higher profits in other businesses."
Dr. Armand Hammer, the 92-year-old chairman who maintains an iron grip on Occidental, has rejected any paring of the company's dividend, even though it seems certain that for the eighth time in nine years the payout will exceed income from Occidental's operations. Dr. Hammer owns 1.3 million of Occidental's 295 million common shares and was paid $3.3 million in dividends last year.
Occidental has relied on asset sales and new issues of debt and stock to maintain the dividend. The company needs $738 million this year to cover an annual payout of $2.50 a share. The dividend yields 12 percent and has attracted thousands of individual investors. Another $800 million is required to cover interest on $8 billion in long-term debt.
In an interview, Ray R. Irani, Occidental's president, took issue with recently expressed doubts on Wall Street about Occidental's ability to continuepaying the dividend and its high debt costs without curtailing its spending on oil prospects. The concerns arose after Occidental's debt rating was lowered after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August.
"There is no discussion by management and the board to cut the dividend," Mr. Irani said. "We can continue to serve the dividend from our normal operations."
A spokesman said that although Occidental was unable to pay the dividend from its operating income, a cash reserve for that purpose will increase by $300 million in the fourth quarter, to $2.9 billion by yearend.
Mr. Irani said Occidental's capital spending will decline to about $1.1 billion in 1991, from $1.4 billion this year. The company will scale back spending in chemical operations because industry growth has slowed, he said. Oil spending will decline somewhat because Occidental will soon complete reconstruction of its Piper Alpha platform in the North Sea, which was severely damaged by a 1988 fire.
"We are spending for oil and gas exploration at very high rates," Mr. Irani said. "We have not turned down any important new development." Occidental has a new exploration accord with Yemen.
Yet some analysts believe rising oil profits will not be adequate for Occidental to overcome its troubles in chemicals. "Their main business is getting worse and worse before their second-best business, oil, comes back to fighting strength," said Jim Murchie, oil analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "Oxy's toughest year will be, if not next year, then the year after." He estimated Occidental would earn 5 cents a share next year.
Many more analysts said Occidental's 1991 profits should reach $1.30 a share or more. George Baker of Merrill Lynch and Mr. Shimmerlik said the company would earn $1.25 a share this year and $1.35 a share in 1991. Mr. Nowak of Dean Witter said he raised his forecast to $1.30 for this year, from $1.10, after reviewing Occidental's third-quarter results. Several analysts put the company's asset values at about $38 a share.

HEADLINE: Report Outlines Signs of Success In City Schools

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Successful urban high schools have sharply defined academic and social goals for students and are strong organizations that solve their own problems, take initiatives and consider themselves more accountable to their community than to higher authorities, a new study has found.
In contrast, the study by the RAND Corporation said, less successful public schools have diffuse programs, allow their students and staff to define their own roles, maintain rigid internal divisions of labor and emphasize compliance with the regulations of central bureaucracies. 
 The study, which analyzed a group of parochial and special public high schools in New York City and Washington, and compared them to less-effective regular public schools, concluded that the features of the successful schools could be widely carried out in cities across the country and should be the core of reform in New York.
 
School-Based Management
 "School systems can make the key features of private and special public schools available for all," said a report on the study, which was made public yesterday. "Such schools can work for even the most disadvantaged."
James S. Vlasto, speaking for the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, said there was much merit in the RAND report. Many of its recommendations, he said, were already being carried out in the Chancellor's trademark program for school-based management, in which committees of teachers, parents and administrators now share authority for decisions at 82 schools.
The study, entitled "High Schools With Character: Alternatives to Bureaucracy," by Paul T. Hill, Gail E. Foster and Tamar Gendler, was conducted by RAND, a nonprofit organization that analyzes national security and domestic problems, at 13 schools serving largely minority and disadvantaged students.
 
50 Percent Graduated
 Included were Catholic schools, specialized vocational or academic public schools and neighborhood public schools. Their operations and organization were tracked, classes were observed and students, teachers, administrators and counselors were interviewed.
The schools were not identified in the report and it was unclear how they were selected. Wide differences separate many of New York City's public schools, educators say, and the study's results would have been different if a good school like Benjamin Cardozo in Queens, or a troubled school like Eastern District in Brooklyn, had been in cluded in the regular schools.
In the successful schools -- where 80 percent of students graduated and 85 percent of the seniors took college entrance tests and scored relatively well -- the study found a heavy focus on student achievement, a determination to mold attitudes and values and a basic curricula that all graduates completed.
In the regular schools -- where 50 percent of the students graduated and only 30 percent took college entrance tests and scored relatively poorly -- the study found an emphasis on program delivery and compliance with regulations, a willingness to let students and staff define their own roles and different curricula for students of different abilities.
The study said that the more effective schools "unhesitatingly place burdens on their low-achieving students," while less effective ones "agree not to demand too much in return for the students' agreement not to cause trouble."
The more effective schools were relatively independent, problem-solving organizations with a distinctive character and a primary commitment to students, parents, neighborhood and parish groups. The less effective ones were internally rigid and accountable mainly to authorities who dictated rules and audited performance.
"The regular urban public high schools are the most troubled of our educational institutions," the report said. "The recommendations we make in this study do not constitute a complete reform agenda. But they do show what each school must be allowed to do for itself, which is to define a clear mission and develop a social climate, curriculum and teaching strategy that are consistent with it."

Death and Hunter's Trial Pose Tough Questions

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGOR, Me., Oct. 18

 BODY:
In the wooded outskirts of Bangor, five black and orange "NO TRESPASSING" signs warn hunters and curious onlookers not to go near the house where Karen Ann Wood lived.
Two years ago, before the signs went up, the 37-year-old Mrs. Wood, who had recently moved to Maine from Iowa, walked into her backyard and was fatally shot by a local hunter. The hunter, Donald Rogerson, later said he mistook her white mittens for the tail of a deer. 
 The ensuing trial, in which a jury on Wednesday found Mr. Rogerson, a 47-year-old produce manager for a supermarket, not guilty of manslaughter, captured the nation's attention and polarized this small city.
While the verdict has troubled many residents who believe that Mr. Rogerson was hunting recklessly, the trial itself has exposed an even deeper issue: the struggle of a traditional hunting culture trying to survive in the face of increased modernization and anti-hunting sentiment -- values often brought into Maine by people from outside the state. Often those values come in the form of pressure for stricter gun control laws and quests for new housing developments.
"The problem is that your dyed-in-the-wool hunters just believe they have an inalienable right to hunt everywhere," said Michael Foster, a 27-year-old hydroelectric technician who is a Bangor native. "Local, indigenous native Mainers are slightly provincial anyway. To have outside people come in and shape policy, they really resent that."
With lush forests carpeting 90 percent of the state, hunting and fishing have long been a way of life here. Last year, the state, with a population of just over a million, issued about 216,476 hunting licenses, and 30,260 deer were killed. Deer hunting season lasts only a week or so in most other states, but here it is a month long. The sport also generates more than $150 million a year for the Maine economy, the state government says.
Many Maine residents, resenting the bad publicity that the Wood case brought the state, are reluctant to talk about it.
But some who do talk about the case say that while Mr. Rogerson should have been more careful Mrs. Wood failed to follow well-known precautions for the hunting season. Just a few months before the shooting, she had moved with her husband, Kevin, and two infant daughters to a tract of land in Hermon that once had been open to hunters. When she went out that November afternoon, she wore a dark coat and white mittens rather than the bright orange clothing that warns hunters away.
"I say, when in Rome do as the Romans do," said Marty L. Boehmer, a 31-year-old hunter. "The common knowledge around here is that you don't go into the woods during the fall without putting orange on."
A month after the shooting, when a grand jury decided not to indict Mr. Rogerson, Mr. Wood and others pushing for more accountability from hunters cried foul. More than a year later, after a television station reported irregularities in the first grand jury, a second one was convened and handed down a manslaughter charge. Now the verdict is in, and the case cannot be appealed.
Many Maine residents, as well as Mr. Wood, who now lives with his daughters in Bettendorf, Iowa, are bitter.
"I don't condemn the state of Maine in general," he said in a telephone interview. "I do condemn the provincialism that exists there, obviously in Bangor, that creates a bias where injustices like this occur."
Since the case began, many nonhunting residents have pushed for tougher hunting laws, regulations that only shotguns be used in built-up areas and more requirements for hunter education courses. And in some cases they have succeeded.
In Hermon, the town council's efforts to have the state pass stricter hunting laws failed, but town officials have made 750 signs to warn hunters that they are near houses.
Still, the debate between native and newcomer, hunter and nonhunter simmers.
"It used to be safe to hunt in these woods. Nope. No more," said Al Worster, a mechanic from Levant. He said he quit hunting 20 years ago when hunters from New York shot at him, thinking he was a moose.
"I don't mind more people here," Mr. Foster said, "but I truly resent their bringing their big city thinking and urban problems with them."

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: The 1990 Issues;
Candidates Seek Safe Havens In Storm Over Taxes in States

SERIES: Second article of a series: Taxes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Anyone who finds the politics of taxation complicated in Washington should come here to Illinois.
The tax issue has become so complicated that candidates here are emphasizing positions in ways that defy traditional party definitions. The Democratic candidate for governor and the Republican candidate for the Senate are running as tax cutters, while the Republican candidate for governor and the Democratic candidate for Senate say taxes are needed to pay for good things, particularly schools. 
 And that is just the begining of the mind-blurring complications as Illinois, and the nation, struggle with taxes and spending in the post-Reagan era.
The Democratic candidate for governor, Neil Hartigan, has built his campaign around a promise of a tax cut, even though every other major Democrat in the state, including the leaders of the Legislature and the Mayor of Chicago, have declined to join him.
The Republican candidate for governor, Jim Edgar, has rejected the tax cut and has depicted his stance as evidence of his candor and character. He has campaigned with President Bush, who is still trying to live down his inablity to live up to his "no new taxes" promise of the 1988 campaign.
 
Taxes and Politics
 All this is an object lesson in one of the most important realities of American politics these days. Since the tea was dumped in Boston Harbor more than 200 years ago, taxes have been a central political issue for Americans.
But they are far from a simple one. Unlike the situation at the time of Proposition 13 in California and Ronald Reagan's election when the demand for big tax cuts was at the heart of a voter rebellion, many Americans have shown a willingness to pay their current, or even higher, taxes, if they believe the money will be well spent.
The catch is they rarely believe that their government will spend the money wisely.
And for all the talk about taxes in Washington at the moment, the concern is clearly bubbling up from the local level, not trickling down from Washington.
Taxes and spending are the driving issues in dozens of elections across the country this year, from ballot propositions in Massachusetts, Nebraska and six other states to the governor's race here in the nation's sixth most populous state.
The message that politicians are hearing in the fall campaigns is subtle, mixed and difficult for government to cope with.
"What we're seeing in 1990 is that we're not going to be able to drastically decrease taxes, but the voters want a say in how the money is spent," said John Keast, who monitors ballot initiatives around the country.
 
Distrust of Government
 Talk of taxes and spending cannot be separated from the voters' distrust of government and politicians this volatile election year. "The big issue in this campaign is not the amount of money people are paying but what they are not getting in return," said Mr. Hartigan's pollster, Mike McKeon, explaining his candidate's central issue. "People are not interested in paying more taxes until they see better results for what they are already paying."
Here in Chicago, and particularly in the suburbs around it, people are not talking about the capital gains tax or the top tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, issues that fixate Washington. They are worried about soaring property taxes.
But the tax that Mr. Hartigan is actually attacking is a state income tax surcharge, due to expire next year. The money raised by the surcharge helps finance education and local government, which is why many traditionally Democratic voters are edgy about Mr. Hartigan's pledge to eliminate it. But he assures them that he can actually increase aid to education, even while eliminating the surcharge, by reducing other state spending by 2 percent.
Mr. Edgar, joined by many newspapers in the state, says Mr. Hartigan's plan is a sham. He proposes instead to keep the surcharge, but to curb the growth of property taxes.
 
Search for Middle Ground
 Both candidates are trying to maneuver themselves to a middle ground where they can sound fiscally conservative without promising too much. But they are also responding to the message from voters for government restraint.
Indeed, Mr. Hartigan and Mr. Edgar have promised not to sign any legislation increasing taxes that does not have two-thirds support in the Legislature. That pledge, they say, lives up to the spirit of a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds vote that the courts knocked off the ballot earlier this year.
In Oklahoma and Connecticut, the Democratic candidates for governor say they will submit any tax increase proposal to the voters.
In Nebraska, a ballot initiative would limit the growth of state and local spending to 2 percent annually. The Massachusetts measure would roll back recent big tax increases.
The Massachusetts and Nebraska measures have become important factors in contests for governor. Both candidates in Nebraska oppose the 2 percent plan. In Massachusetts, the Republican, William F. Weld, embraces the tax curb, while the Democrat, John R. Silber, has urged voters to elect him so that state government can be restrained "with a brain" instead of in the across-the-board manner of the ballot measure.
In California, several measures of the ballot actually call for tax increases, but they dedicate the money to specific purposes, as the income tax surcharge here is dedicated to education and local government. Voters in California approved a gasoline tax increase for transportation improvement in June and will be asked in November to approve higher liquor and sales taxes to fight drug and alcohol abuse.
"Citizens are becoming increasingly willing to sacrifice tax dollars for specfic services, but not for uncontrolled spending by the legislature," Mr. Keast said.
 
Images of Waste
 On the campaign trail, the debate over taxes is usually less an argument over proper public policy than it is an effort to invoke issues of character and images of waste.
Political consultants in both parties here say Mr. Hartigan's promise to eliminate the income tax surcharge has been less powerful in itself than as part of an effort to keep Mr. Edgar on the defensive and to paint him as a spender and the Republican Party's heir to Gov. James R. Thompson. In 14 years in office Governor Thompson has angered a considerable number of Illinoisans by raising taxes, after saying he would not.
In one of the campaign commercials Mr. Hartigan has used to attack Mr. Edgar, a bumblebee flits through a garden to the strains of "Flight of the Bumblebee" as the announcer asks voters if they knew that Mr. Edgar had spent $375,000 to build a rose garden for Governor Thompson's mansion.
"Haven't we been stung enough?" the announcer asks, as the visage of Mr. Hartigan, currently the Attorney General, appears and the announcer says Mr. Hartigan would rather use the money to expand the minds of Illinois children.
"Gross distortion," said Mr. Edgar's spokesman, Mike Lawrence. He explained that as Secretary of State, Mr. Edgar's office oversees state grounds. The rose garden was part of an external renovation of the governor's mansion approved by the Legislature and the Governor, he said.
 
Close Race
 The contest between Mr. Edgar and Mr. Hartigan has produced an unusual role reversal, with the Democratic candidate's staff making the case against taxes while Mr. Edgar's staff argues that their research shows that better education, safer streets and a cleaner environment are all ahead of taxes on the list of Illinois voters' priorities.
A recent poll illustrates the complex political dynamics tapped by this race. WBBM-TV and the Daily Southtown Economist asked 866 registered voters whether they thought Mr. Hartigan could eliminate the surcharge and still finance education. Two-thirds said that they did not think he could and that he would have to raise other taxes instead, something Mr. Hartigan has carefully avoided ruling out.
Even among those who said they supported Mr. Hartigan, half thought he would have to raise other taxes.
Asked directly whether they favored or opposed keeping the tax surcharge to finance education, 52 percent favored keeping it and 35 percent were for elimination. The survey was conducted Oct. 13-15 by telephone and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Yet even with the overwhelming skepticism and considerable opposition toward Mr. Hartigan's major campaign proposal, the race remains close. Mr. Edgar leads Mr. Hartigan 44 percent to 39 percent, with 17 percent saying they were undecided or declining to express an opinion.
Mr. McKeon, the Hartigan poll taker, said this seeming contradiction is an illustration of how the frustration and cynicism of voters is influencing elections. "Maybe they don't think he can do it," Mr. McKeon said. "But they'd like to see him try."
 
 
 
TAX PROPOSALS ON THE BALLOT IN 8 STATES

 
 
OREGON
 The proposal would reduce property taxes on homeowners to $15 for every $1,000 assessed. Property taxes currently vary, depending on the city or town, but go as high as $35 for every $1,000.
 
CALIFORNIA
 One measure would require that two-thirds of voters, rather than a simple majority, approve any new state special taxes and would limit the rate on new state personal property taxes. Another proposal would impose a new surtax on sales of alcoholic beverages.
 
NEVADA
 Citizens will vote on two sales tax exemptions, one for university textbooks and the other for certain medallions that are authorized to bear the state seal. They will also take the second of two required votes on a constitutional amendment to ban the personal income tax. In the first vite, in 1988, voters approved the amendment.
 
MONTANA
 One proposal would eliminate virtually all state taxes, including income and property taxes, and substitute a 1 percent finance charge on all financial transactions. The other would add 25 cents to the state's 18-cent cigarette tax, which at 43 cents would be the highest in the nation.
 
MASSACHUSETTS
 The proposal would roll back, to 1988 levels, a long list of tax increases and government fees that were imposed in 1989 and 1990.
 
NEBRASKA
 One proposal would limit increase in state or local spending to 2 percent over that of the previous fiscal year unless it is approved by four-fifths of the legislature or a majority of the voters. Another proposal would cancel a sales tax increase and income tax increases used for state aid to schools.
 
UTAH
 The initiative would repeal all sales taxes on food, which vary from 5 to 6 percent, depending on the municipality.
 
COLORADO
 The proposal would limit future increases on taxes and spending and require voter approval for certain state and local tax increases.

The True Roots Of U.S. Decline

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AS the United States struggles to retrieve its golden industrial past, Americans kick them selves for having dissipated the work ethic and the inventiveness that once made them kings in technology and manufacturing. And now along come some historians who say that the self-flagellation is not justified and the nation's troubles are not the result of a fall from grace.
What actually happened was more mundane, these experts in economic history explain. Americans in fact never lacked for ingenuity, farsightedness, hard work and good management. What set them apart and made the United States blossom as an industrial powerhouse was skill at exploiting abundant natural resources. This special advantage is gone today, through no one's fault, and so is the supremacy that it once bestowed. 
 Gavin Wright, an economics historian at Stanford University, develops this thesis in "The Origins of American Industrial Success, 1879-1940," the lead article in the latest issue of The American Economic Review, the profession's flagship journal. Economists do not often delve into history for explanations of the nation's woes, and Mr. Wright adds a fresh insight to the debate over the loss of status in manufacturing and technology.
"We tend to think that if we could just recapture entrepreneurial skill or improve education, then the United States would once again become the pre-eminent economic power," Mr. Wright said in an interview. "But that is misleading. It loses sight of the fact that a lot of our technological advantage stemmed from our abundant resources."
The Wright argument, shared by other historians, is this: Americans were never better thanothers at developing new technologies. The American advantage, until the 1950's, was in two areas. Nowhere else in the world was there so huge a national market: millions of consumers across a continent. And no other nation harnessed so abundant and varied a supply of inexpensive natural resources so early on.
Manufacturing, until the 1950's, essentially meant the conversion of resources into products. By rushing into the production of iron ore, coal, petroleum, copper, bauxite, zinc, phosphates, food and many other resources, the United States emerged as the superpower of the industrial world. And since the distinguishing American technologies were related to the all-important conversion of resources into products, the United States became the front-runner in technology, Mr. Wright argues.
No one matched the Americans in mining or in farm technology or in mass production techniques, starting with the mass production of weapons in Springfield, Mass., in the early 1800's. Like so many other breakthrough American inventions, the reaper and the combine, for example, helped tobring an abundant resource, in this case grain, to the growing mass of American consumers.
The canals and the nationwide railroads that emerged so rapidly in the United States in the 19th century served the goals of bringing resources to factories and products to marketplaces, says Paul David, another Stanford historian. The upshot was a dynamic economy, highly profitable for corporations, and all functioning prosperously within the nation's borders.
The American advantage disappeared by the 1960's. Mass markets that had developed in Europe and Asia became more prosperous than ever before. And other nations finally tapped their own resources, which then became part of a worldwide pool supplying a Japan or a France as easily and inexpensively as the United States.
Finally, manufacturing began to free itself from resources, particularly in the production of electronic products, which absorb little raw material. The technologies involved in their manufacture cross borders easily and cannot be captured for long as a source of income for a single country. "We are not going to get across-the-board technological leadership," Mr. David said. "It is an illusion that never really existed anyway for us or anyone else."
Other economists acknowledge that the Wright-David thesis offers a valuable insight, although some, like Kenneth Flamm of the Brookings Institution, argue that the American genius for invention is not so closely tied to natural resources. Whatever the truth, Mr. Wright's research suggests that capitalism does not have to be "one-country dominated," as Mr. Wright puts it.
Special circumstances gave Britain the dominant role and then the United States. "One view of capitalism, stemming from this history, is that it requires a world leader: the country with the most advanced technology," Mr. Wright said. "But capitalism can flourish in a world in which several nations function on an equal footing."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE
Behind the Dealing on Deficit Reduction, Deals That Could Swell the Deficit;
While Congress Trims the Budget, It Enlarges Programs (and Debt)

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Even as Congress trims some programs to reduce the Federal budget deficit, it is expanding other programs, and lawmakers acknowledge that savings achieved with great difficulty this year may soon be offset by added spending.
The new spending comes about because of old-fashioned pork-barrel projects, policy choices in favor of new or expanded programs and the deterioration of the economy, which is increasing demand for benefits like unemployment insurance and food stamps. 
 Whether any particular increase is good or bad is a political question with a subjective answer; what seems essential to one lawmaker or interest group may appear wasteful to others. But it is indisputable that Congress has quietly enacted appropriation laws that increase spending, often in districts represented by influential lawmakers, while they publicly proclaim the need for deficit reduction.
"The Federal debt is going from a quart to a gallon," said Gerald H. Miller, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, "but Congress and the President are taking out only a cup."
 
Protests Over Medicaid
 As part of the budget package being negotiated on Capitol Hill, Congress is expanding Medicaid, for example, over vehement protests from the nation's governors, who say they will be saddled with more costs. The expansion of Medicaid would cost the Federal Government at least $400 million a year.
In appropriation bills for the current fiscal year, Congress has approved a $2.3 billion increase in spending for Federal highway projects, to $14.5 billion a year, and is providing $20 billion in new money for specific park, land, energy and water projects.
"This session of Congress has decided to vote again and again for pork barrel, to fund projects that may or may not be better than other competitive projects, and to fund them only because of who one may know on the Appropriations Committee or the leadership," said Representative Steve Bartlett, a Texas Republican who is one of many members of Congress to make such criticisms.
Mr. Bartlett said the largess was bipartisan. "There are projects in here for members of both parties," he said of one bill, which increases housing appropriations by 22 percent, to $9.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, said one subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee recently received 2,800 written requests for park, land and water projects from various senators. "Those same senators then come in here with unctuous, pontificating statements about how, if we just freeze this or that, we could get the deficit under control," Mr. Bumpers said.
 
$5 Trillion Debt Limit
 To cover the increases in spending, Congress plans to raise the debt limit. Under budget plans adopted by the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Federal debt, which represents the accumulated total of all Federal borrowing, would soar to $5 trillion in 1995, from the current $3.2 trillion. When President Reagan took office in 1981, the debt was slighly less than $1 trillion.
A little-noticed provision of the deficit-reduction bill passed by the House would raise the statutory limit on the public debt to $5 trillion. If the higher limit is part of the final bill, Congress could avoid the annual ritual of increasing the debt ceiling. The ritual is politically embarrassing to lawmakers and occasionally brings the Government to the brink of default. When Congress fails to extend the debt limit, the Treasury must postpone new borrowing from the public, as it did last week.
There is virtually no way for the Government to reduce the debt unless it runs a budget surplus. A budget deficit in one year must be covered by further borrowing, which increases the debt and adds to interest costs in future years.
Net interest payments on the Federal debt were the fastest-growing major category of Federal spending in the 1980's. The increase in such payments, from $52.5 billion in 1980 to $169 billion in 1989, exceeded all the savings Mr. Reagan achieved in health, education, welfare and social service programs.
 
Dollars for Home Districts
 Representative Jamie L. Whitten, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, boasted that Congress had earmarked millions of dollars for water projects, highway construction and airport improvements in his Mississippi district.
Congress also earmarked $3.4 million for a highway demonstration project in Pittsfield, Mass., the home of Representative Silvio O. Conte, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee. There was also money for a veterans' hospital in Northampton, Mass., and for a solar heating plant at the University of Massachusetts campus in Amherst, both in Mr. Conte's district.
The appropriation bills also set aside money for West Virginia University and for more than 20 public works projects in West Virginia, the home of Robert C. Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings said that the new deficit-reduction package "guts the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law" by making it easier for Congress to avoid meeting the annual deficit targets in the law. Mr. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, was a co-author of the 1985 law.
As originally passed, the law stipulated that the budget should be balanced in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. The deficit, $221 billion in 1986, hovered in the range of $150 billion to $155 billion in the next three years, but shot up again in the fiscal year just ended. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the deficit was a record $231 billion in the fiscal year that ended three weeks ago.
 
Cutting Here, Adding There
 Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, ranking Republican on the Veterans Affairs Committee, said he saw a "great inconsistency" in Congress's schizophrenic instincts: cutting some veterans programs by $620 million a year while expanding others by almost exactly the same amount.
Speaking of a new plan to make World War II veterans eligible for "readjustment counseling," Senator Alan K. Simpson said, "It boggles the mind that veterans of World War II, the hideous war that ended 45 years ago, are still having trouble readjusting to civilian life after military service."
Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, observed that "we all say, 'Spend less,' but we have more ideas and we want more things." Here are a few examples:
*The deficit-reduction measures passed by both houses of Congress would expand Medicaid to cover children from poor families longer, through age 12 under the House bill and age 18 in the Senate bill. Under current law, states must cover poor children through age 5. Pediatricians and public health experts applaud the expansion. But states pay, on the average, 44 percent of Medicaid costs, and the National Governors' Association expressed alarm at the cost of an expansion.
*Under the House bill, the Federal Government would pay Medicare premiums for low-income elderly people, and the Senate bill would allow states to offer such protection with a combination of Federal and state funds.
*Congress has just approved an appropriation bill that permits $14.5 billion in highway spending this year, up from $12.2 billion last year. President Bush requested $12 billion.
*House and Senate negotiators agreed last week to provide more than $1.6 billion to help poor people pay home heating costs, as against $1.4 billion last year. Mr. Bush requested $1.05 billion. Mr. Conte said the increase was needed because home heating oil had become "outrageously expensive" as a result of turmoil in the Middle East.
*Senator Claiborne Pell, the chief patron of student aid programs in Congress, is pushing new legislation, the Middle-Income Student Assistance Act, to expand eligibility for Federal grants.
The purpose, he said, was to help middle-income families pay for college and to reverse cutbacks made under President Reagan, when "eligibility was tightened so that only the most needy qualified."

HEADLINE: Salvador Arms Aid: Will Congress's Tactic Work?

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The vote by the United States Congress to cut in half military aid to this country appears likely to cause political instability here. In the short run this may fortify hard-liners on both left and right, but in the long term it could also provide a lever to persuade the army to compromise with the rebels.
 Many labor unions and grass-roots organizations strongly support the decision to cut military aid as the only way to force the Government and army to accept sweeping political and military changes required to break a deadlock at the peace talks, which are to resume in Mexico by Nov. 4. 
 But many political leaders and military commanders here interpret the vote by the Senate on Friday, which followed a similar one by the House on June 27, less as a reaction to human rights abuses, like the slaying of six Jesuits last year, than a sign that Washington has given up on El Salvador and is seeking to end its involvement no matter the consequences.
"El Salvador is a headache that Washington feels it just has to get rid of," said one of the country's most senior military commanders. "Washington is preoccupied with Nicaragua, Panama and the Mideast."
The commander, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, noted that the Bush Administration had begun to talk privately about "Lebanizing" the conflict here, by which it means treating El Salvador like Lebanon: pulling out and waiting to see what happens.
In Washington, White House officials say the Administration is unhappy with the Senate move to cut the aid pending specific steps toward peace in El Salvador. They say that they will try to persuade lawmakers to change the legislation at a conference between the Senate and the House and that no decision on whether to veto it has been made.
 
Hard-Liners Gain Ground
 In El Salvador, military commanders and some Western diplomats say the Congressional vote could fortify hard-liners at both ends of the political spectrum. If the Congressional decision becomes law, they say, it might make the rebels more intransigent and unite military reformists and anti-American extremists, who feel that American aid is not worth the accompanying constraints, including those intended to reduce human rights violations.
The hard-liners on both left and right have appeared in the ascendancy in recent months. Negotiators for the insurgents, under intense pressure from troops in the field, have backed away from the first formal accord reached between the two sides, a human rights agreement signed three months ago. Since then, the insurgents' proposals have been less conciliatory, apparently intended primarily to aggravate divisions within the armed forces.
The new tactics of the rebels stem in large part from divisions within their movement. Once committed Marxists, the most senior commanders now describe themselves as social democrats fighting for pluralism, a mixed economy and a negotiated end to the civil war, which has killed more than 70,000 people. But field commanders and rank-and-file troops have been more hesitant to make the ideological switch. They are now generally more radical and more committed to military victory than the leaders, who spend most of their time outside the country.
 
'What's the Difference?'
 Troops in the field are also more likely to dismiss a Washington decision to slash aid as a meaningless publicity gesture. The rank and file and their commanders say it does not matter if the United States halves the weaponry it supplies if the army continues to use the ammunition to attack the civilian population from helicopter gunships. "One bullet or two -- what's the difference?" a field commander in the northern province of Chalatenango asked recently.
The immediate military effect of the $42.5 million aid cut would likely be small. Forewarned by the debate, the army has forearmed itself by stockpiling weapons, ammunition and spare parts. President Alfredo Cristiani, who already is facing an explosive economic crisis, will have extreme difficulty in fulfilling a pledge to make up the military's financial shortfall by cutting social programs. Military commanders say the army is likely to face material shortages within a year. That, diplomats say, may press it into accepting previously unacceptable guerrilla demands.
But the cut in American military aid, which currently pays for the entire Salvadoran defense budget except salaries, is likely to have an immediate psychological effect. At a recent six-hour staff meeting between the high command and second-level officers from around the country, there was no mention of the killing of the six Jesuit priests, the incident that led to the Congressional campaign to reduce military aid. Instead, members of the high command said, they were questioned about their plans to make up for the impending shortfall.
 
U.S. Accused of Appeasement
 The result already has been new influence for right-wing militants, who argue that the United States is pursuing a policy of appeasement toward the rebels. They are pushing the army to step up the war by cracking down on rebel sympathizers. In a sign of the radicals' increasing influence, a small but growing number of military officers are for the first time in years privately discussing plans to round up and kill leftist civilians. Some officers say they are only waiting for an expected guerrilla offensive to start the operation.
"The brake is coming off," a Western diplomat said. "As the U.S. role decreases, there is less and less reason for the radicals to take a back seat."
In recent months, military hard-liners and their civilian allies have picked up some support from so-called army reformers, who believe the high command is corrupt and inefficient. Convinced that Washington has run out of patience and wants to end the longest American-supported counterinsurgency campaign since the Vietnam War, they are scrambling to prepare for what is coming to be called the "post-gringo era."
The emerging coalition is a clear threat to a tightknit group of so-called pragmatic senior officers viewed by Washington as the key to a negotiated settlement. But so far at least President Cristiani's uncompromising support for the high command has undercut the right-wing extremists' repeated efforts to seize control of the armed forces.

HEADLINE: New York Banks See The Logic Of Merging

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Doubting their ability to prosper as independent companies, New York's largest banks are eyeing their neighbors, each wondering which of the others would make the best partner.
Faced with rising losses on commercial real estate loans, and prospects of even greater losses on loans of all kinds as the economy weakens, executives at several of New York's largest banks are well aware that big changes are needed. The logic of bank mergers seems irrefutable, offering the combined institutions the cost savings and greater financial strength they need to compete domestically and against more and more powerful foreign rivals. 
 "Mergers involving the New York banks have to happen," said Gary Parr, head of the banking group at Wasserstein, Perella & Company.
Bankers, industry analysts and Federal regulators agree that the first merger among large banks is increasingly becoming a matter of when it will occur, not if it will. Should the economy weaken further, they say, banks will be driven into each other's arms as the losses on loans mount.
 
Logic for Mergers
 For consumers, bank mergers would probably mean that some branches would be shut down, but that little would be changed for such services as credit cards and personal loans. And, in theory, a stronger and more efficient bank, the goal of any merger, should be a more stable and steady source of lending to individuals and small businesses.
Early signs of activity on the bank-merger front abound. Wall Street merger specialists, eager to earn multimillion-dollar fees for helping arrange a deal, have submitted dozens of proposals to their bank clients. Rumors of merger talks circulate almost daily among bankers; the three New York banks most often mentioned as likely merger candidates are the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation.
Leading bankers have acknowledged in recent months that mergers make sense. Walter V. Shipley, chairman of Chemical Bank, has called mergers of big banks "a natural development." Thomas S. Johnson, the president of Manufacturers Hanover, who was the No. 2 executive at Chemical Bank until last December, says the same thing. And Thomas Labrecque, the new chairman at Chase Manhattan, has declared, "The 1990's are going to be an era of consolidation."
 
Federal Reserve's Views
 For its part, the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates American banking, endorses the concept of bank mergers as a way to strengthen the banking system. But Fed officials deny that they are encouraging any specific deals.
The bankers themselves are tight-lipped. Echoing the response of most of his peers on the delicate subject of merger talks, Mr. Shipley of Chemical Bank said, "I won't speculate about hypothetical discussions."
But for all the apparent logic of big-bank mergers, formidable obstacles remain involving finances, tradition and even personalities.
One of the biggest problems, Mr. Parr and other analysts say, is that before a newly merged bank reaps the benefits of cost reductions, it must bear the large one-time expense of making severance payments to employees and closing duplicated offices. With financial conditions already weak, any merger would require deft financial engineering and perhaps also new capital from outside investors willing to help pay the costs of consolidating the merger banks in the hopes of profits later.
 
18 Months of Pain
 "It's a serious dilemma," Mr. Parr said. "Before you get the full savings in 18 to 24 months, you have to bear some pain."
Yet the benefits of a merger involving New York banks like Chase, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover could be substantial. Chase and Chemical earlier this month announced third-quarter losses of $623 million and $43.7 million, respectively, as well as steep cuts in their dividends.
Manufacturers Hanover has been profitable in recent quarters, but is a far smaller company since it sold its consumer-finance and mortgage finance units and 60 percent of its business-lending unit to raise the cash it needed to survive in the late 1980's.
Assuming that a merger of two banks in the same area would result in a 30 percent reduction on non-interest expenses at one of the banks, the savings could amount to $1.07 billion for Chase, $795 million for Chemical and $619 million for Manufacturers Hanover.
One of the most-often-rumored combinations involves Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover, in part because Mr. Johnson was at Chemical until last December, when he crossed the street to become the heir apparent to the top job at Manufacturers Hanover. Based on his insider's knowledge of both companies, analysts assume that Mr. Johnson could help forge a merger agreement without the cumbersome review of each other's financial health that total strangers would require.
 
Sure-Fire Profits
 In a city where it is not unusual to see two bank branches on one corner, mergers among banks are widely seen as a sure-fire way to increase profits. Besides eliminating duplicate branch offices, mergers would allow big cuts in overlapping administrative and operating costs like computer systems and highly paid executives.
The banking business is so fragmented in New York City that mergers would be not expected to create one institution that could dominate the area.
The job cuts, which would involve thousands of workers, would be a painful jolt for the New York City economy, which has already lost 11,000 banking jobs since 1987.
But for the banks involved, the money saved could be used to rebuild the financial strength needed to satisfy Federal regulators worried about the health of American banks and their ability to compete with big foreign banks.
If New York's banks were financially stronger, they could afford to acquire or merge with other banks. By diversifying their business, they would reduce their vulnerability to a downturn in the local economy.
That is clearly the unfolding strategy at the Bank of New York. J. Carter Bacot, chairman at the Bank of New York Company, has cut more than 3,000 jobs and reduced expenses by more than $150 million annually since acquiring the Irving Bank Corporation in 1988. But as the regional economy has soured, Mr. Bacot said he would prefer to look further afield for his next acquisition.
 
Dangers of Concentration
 "The experience of Texas and New England shows the danger of too much concentration in a single region," he noted.
When the mergers come, they are likely to be much different from the rough-and-tumble takeovers of the 1980's, when Wall Street deal makers could force mergers on unwilling corporations. Given the weakened financial condition of the country's largest banks, the coming mergers are likely to be exchanges of stock shaped by bankers in private meetings. Because Federal law prevents commercial concerns from controlling banks, the universe of potential buyers is limited to other banking companies.
Richard J. Barrett, an investment banker and head of the financial institutions group at Salomon Brothers, said recently: "We may not see some of the big banks move until their condition becomes so unpalatable that they don't have much other choice. The lack of capital to make their own acquisitions could force a lot of banks to seek partners as the best last recourse."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Paris Futures Market Starts New Contract

BYLINE: By JACQUES NEHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Seeking to expand its base overseas and to bolster its challenge to London as Europe's leading futures market, the futures and options market here began trading a contract last week that is linked to the European Currency Unit.
The futures market, the Marche a Terme International de France, or Matif, is banking on the new long-term bond contract to increase its international allure and give it an edge over London in a running battle to become Europe's main futures market. 
 French officials hope to make the contract available to American and Japanese institutional investors through Globex, the long-delayed off-hours electronic trading system that is expected to begin operation next year.
 
'Very Strategic Product'
 "This is a very strategic product for us," said Gerard Pfauwadel, president of Matif S.A. "It's a way for us to increase international attraction, not only for the Matif but for Paris as a financial center."
Some market professionals said the European Currency Unit contract might face hard going, pointing to the failure of a short-term currency unit futures contract begun by the London International Financial Futures Exchange last fall. That contract is barely alive, currently generating fewer than 100 contracts a day.
"I think it will take the Matif time to get this contract off the ground," said Michael Jenkins, the chief executive of the London exchange. "The ECU bond, whether short-term or long-term, has a very important future, but the big question is when that will be."
 
Enthusiasm vs. Indifference
 He added that while attitudes were changing, the currency unit was still backed by a "small group of vocal enthusiasts, while there's a much larger group who are indifferent."
Matif officials say the decision to introduce a currency unit contract reflects the heady growth experienced by the Matif since it opened in 1986 amid a wave of financial deregulation in France. The market has built its reputation on a long-term French bond contract, called the notional contract, which in recent years has been joined by other products linked to French interest rates and also a contract on the French stock market index.
On the currency unit contract's first two days of trading on Thursday and Friday, volume totaled about 6,400 lots, or contracts, and a Matif spokeswoman called that satisfying. Volume on the notional contract was much heavier, with more than 156,000 lots traded.
 
London Ahead Again
 The Matif established itself as a major rival to the London futures exchange, which was founded four years earlier, in 1982. Last year, Paris overtook London as the leading futures market in Europe with a volume of 25.6 million contracts, compared with 23.9 million in London. This year, London has moved back ahead of Paris.
Even with its essentially French product range, the Matif has been able to attract some foreign interest. Orders originating abroad account for more than 20 percent of the Matif's total volume, and of the exchange's 100 clearing members, 29 are foreign banks or brokers.
"We consider the Matif a leading market on a worldwide scale," said Eric Bertier, general manager of derivative products for Paine Webber France S.A. "If you want to be a player in capital markets, you can't afford not to be on the Matif."
Paine Webber earlier this year joined the Matif by absorbing a 35-member team from Drexel Burnham Lambert France S.A. after Drexel's liquidation.
 
Liquidity and Openness
 Mr. Bertier compared the market favorably with the much larger Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noting that the Matif offers ample liquidity and openness. "You know what's happening and why," he said. "It's a very pleasant market to work on."
Other clearing members of the Matif include J. P. Morgan; Shearson Lehman Hutton; Bankers Trust; Goldman, Sachs; Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
Volume at the Matif continues to be dominated by the long-term notional contract, which is representative of several French treasury bonds with a life of 7 to 10 years and a 10 percent coupon. In 1989, the notional contract accounted for volume of 15 million lots, or about 60,500 a day. An option on the notional contract generated an additional 7.1 million transactions. Together, the two products provided 86 percent of the Matif's volume.
A short-term interest rate contract, linked to the three-month Paris interbank offered rate, generated 2.3 million lots traded last year. An option on that contract was introduced in the spring.
 
Euromark Contract Failed
 The Matif's first attempt to move beyond French products, with a futures contract on the three-month Euromark, met with failure. In the first nine months, the contract generated volume of only 390,000 lots.
In beginning the European Currency Unit contract, the Matif is betting that the unit -- a weighted basket of the 12 European Community currencies currently valued at about $1.35 -- will expand in use and importance as a major world currency. A plan for monetary union, written by Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, the community's executive body, suggested that such a currency could be based on the currency unit. That proposal and other aspects of the discussion of European monetary union have led to heated debates among the member nations of the European Community.
 
More Issues Expected
 Even while the debate over monetary union continues, European governments are showing faith in the currency unit by issuing debt in the theoretical currency, and Mr. Pfauwadel expects these issues to expand greatly in the near future. In addition, the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, established to aid Eastern Europe, is to be capitalized with 10 billion European Currency Units, he noted.
Since 1981, bond issues denominated in the currency units have soared. By the end of 1989, the value of outstanding fixed-rate currency unit Eurobonds totaled 56.4 billion currency units, with 109 issues worth 10.9 billion units made last year alone.
For now, the new currency unit contract is based on two currency unit French treasury bonds. Within a few months, the Matif plans to reinforce the contract's foundation with two Italian currency unit treasury bonds and a currency unit bond issued by the European Investment Bank.
 
Banks Seen as Prime Market
 Matif officials hope European banks will be the primary market for the new contract because they are currently the major holders of bonds denominated in currency units. The contract would permit bondholders to hedge against interest rate fluctuations that could erode the value of the bonds.
It would also provide spread opportunities for traders seeking to take advantage of fluctuations in long-term interest rates on currency units, French francs or marks.
Dominique Depras, who manages Matif operations for J. P. Morgan, said he was "completely favorable to this project." He predicted that the contract would be attractive "in the early stages for professionals, but as liquidity appears, investors and institutions will come."

Turning to Gilbert and Sullivan for Salvation

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Over the last year, two of New York's small opera companies that specialize in the Gilbert and Sullivan repertory, the Light Opera of Manhattan and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, have fallen prey to financial stresses and curtailed their activities. Both hope to be reborn, and one hopes they will be.
In the meantime, fans of W. S. Gilbert's clever librettos and Sir Arthur Sullivan's witty, hummable music might want to urge the New York City Opera to expand its activities in this well-loved realm. The company does have its foot in the door: Its Lotfi Mansouri production of "The Mikado," which returned to the New York State Theater on Saturday afternoon, is the most enjoyable of the operetta stagings that Beverly Sills brought to the City Opera repertory.
 
 True Savoyards will note, of course, that the production does make some compromises with tradition. When the production opened in 1984, Mr. Mansouri persuaded the singers not to indulge in fake British accents, and he replaced some of the customary horseplay with Patricia Birch's elegantly amusing choreography. Those touches remain, and they seem sensible for a production in a large house. The staging's less controversial attractions are Thierry Bosquet's bright, fanciful costumes and appealingly minimal stage sets.
This season's first cast brings back several singers who have sung their roles from the start and adds a few voices new to their roles. It was an exceptionally even cast, with no real weak points, although one might quibble with aspects of this or that characterization.
For example, James Billings paced his portrayal of Ko-Ko with real mastery and never failed to get the laughs he sought. Vocally, too, he was in fine shape. But at times he seemed to be drawing his inspiration from far and wide without blending his influences into a consistent persona, as he has in previous seasons. A single speech might include plausible imitations of W. C. Fields, Oliver Hardy, Lou Costello, Bert Lahr and Truman Capote, with the seams showing.
The other singers who returned from past seasons included Joseph McKee, whose blend of pomposity and corruption makes for a wonderful portrayal of Pooh-Bah, the multiple-office-holding bureaucrat, and Richard McKee, who easily managed the balance of ferocity and mirth required in the title role.
The newcomers to the production bring greater vocal power and stability to their roles than some past singers and are therefore a welcome lot. Most striking was Carroll Freeman's Nanki-Poo. His sound was tightly focused, if occasionally slightly steely; but he shaped his lines with real sensitivity, and he acted the role with an easy naturalness. Lisa Saffer's sweet, well-supported soprano suited Yum-Yum's music nicely, and she played the role with a comic flair that made her a fine match for Mr. Freeman. And Josepha Gayer was an imperious but not unsympathetic Katisha.
The cast also included William Parcher as Pish-Tush, Bronwyn Thomas as Pitti-Sing and Michele McBride as Peep-Bo.
David Pfeiffer, the production's stage director, moved the singers around the stage economically much of the time, but with flamboyance where it seemed necessary. And the orchestra played with clarity and precision for Chris Nance, who took the score at a comfortably lively pace.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Stall on Farm Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 21

 BODY:
A four-year round of negotiations to liberalize world trade is threatened with collapse as a result of the European Community's failure to accept even a modest plan to reduce farm subsidies, officials from the United States and many other nations say.
These officials say the inability of the 12 community nations to agree even among themselves to put forward a modest proposal to cut farm subsidies is making it more and more difficult to complete global trade talks. The deadline for an agreement is less than seven weeks away. 
 "Until they can come forward with an offer, there is no basis for negotiations, and time is running out," said Julius Katz, the deputy United States trade representative. "I don't know at what point the situation becomes desperate, but we're getting there."
 
Complaints About Subsidies
 Officials of the United States, Canada, Argentina and many third world countries contend that the community's large subsidies for farmers have encouraged huge overproduction of agricultural products. Officials of these nations, who say their farmers produce at costs far lower than Europe's, complain that European farmers, helped by community export subsidies, dump their excess production on the world market at rock-bottom prices.
American officials say the European practices cost United States farmers billions of dollars in income each year by driving down world farm prices and closing off markets for American products.
President Bush has said that the talks, which involve agriculture and 14 other areas, are his highest trade priority. But he and officials from Canada, Argentina, Australia and several other nations have threatened not to sign a comprehensive trade pact unless they win substantial cuts in farm subsidies.
 
Resistance From Europe
 The European Community has steadfastly resisted large-scale cutbacks in agriculture-protection policies, which economists say cost industrial nations $250 billion a year through higher taxes and higher food prices.
The community's executive commission has proposed reducing subsidies by 30 percent over 10 years, but last Friday the community's badly divided farm ministers refused to back the commission's plan. The community thus missed the Oct. 15 deadline for making negotiating proposals on farm trade.
Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands supported the commission's plan, while the farm ministers of France and Germany led the opposition. They contend that a 30 percent cut in subsidies would imperil Europe's 10 million farmers -- a powerful bloc of voters.
 
A U.S. Proposal
 The French and German ministers suggested that it would be better to have no global trade agreement than one that goes too far to meet American demands to slash farm subsidies. Hurt by drought and plunging livestock prices, tens of thousands of French farmers have demonstrated this year, often violently, to complain that subsidies are already too low.
The farm minister of France, Louis Mermaz, said he did not think a collapse of the trade talks would be catastrophic "if the community doesn't want to sacrifice its agriculture sector."
The farm subsidy debate has created friction within the community's executive commission. Raymond MacSharry, the community's agricultural commissioner, is fighting to keep subsidies high and has clashed with Frans Andriessen, the community's trade commissioner, who wants to take a more flexible, less protectionist approach in dealing with Washington's demands.
On Monday, American trade negotiators made a proposal to slash farm export subsidies by 90 percent over 10 years and cut overall farm supports by 75 percent over that period.
 
Argentina's Threat
 At trade talks in Geneva last week, Argentina's farm minister, Felipe Sola, said his nation would walk out of the negotiations if the European Community did not make a broader offer to cut agricultural subsidies. Mr. Sola said one reason for the third world debt crisis was that developing nations had lost $35 billion a year in farm exports as a result of the industrial world's heavy export subsidies and other trade distortions.
Trade officials say Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other large food exporters might walk out with Argentina if the community remains intransigent on farm trade.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Katz, the deputy trade representative, said that in the farm negotiations, "the situation is a large part of the world versus the European Community."
 
Liberalized Trade Rules
 The current talks, known as the Uruguay Round because they began in Punta del Este in 1986, seek to liberalize some $1 trillion in trade not covered by international trade rules. If the talks succeed, trade in apparel, financial services, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals, as well as copyright rules, would for the first time be brought under liberal international trade rules.
The round of talks, which involves 105 nations, is scheduled to conclude in ministerial-level talks in Brussels from Dec. 3 to Dec. 7.
"It's a brave man who says we can pick up all the pieces in time for Brussels," said a trade official at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization under whose auspices the trade talks are being held. "We have reached agreement in a whole range of areas, but what's crucial right now is what happens in agriculture."
With the community's farm ministers failing to back a plan, European foreign ministers will seek to agree on a proposal for trade talks when they meet Monday in Luxembourg. If the foreign ministers fail, then the community's prime ministers will wrestle with the issue when they meet next weekend in Rome.
 
No Subsidy Reduction Target
 European officials say Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany recently called Jacques Delors, president of the executive commission, to say the commission's proposal to cut subsidies 30 percent was unacceptable, contending it was far too severe to farmers. Many officials say Mr. Kohl wants to strongly defend farmer interests in anticipation of the first all-German elections on Dec. 2.
The commission proposes no specific target on reducing export subsidies, but hints that such cuts would be discussed. Several European farm ministers said, however, that they were worried about cutting export subsidies, an area that American officials say particularly distorts trade flows.

HEADLINE: Strawberry's Next Steps?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 21

 BODY:
On the day after the World Series ended, the baseball marketplace opened to prospective free agents, and they included the most intriguing and maybe the most expensive member of this year's class, Darryl Strawberry of the Mets.
Close friends said that Strawberry had left his home on Long Island in recent days and once more had separated from his wife, Lisa. He was said to be staying in Los Angeles, where his mother and brother live and where he has maintained a home. 
 For months, he has wavered on whether he wanted to stay with the team. In June, when the Mets generated their best winning streak of the season, he said he would stay. In September, as they idled in second place, Strawberry intimated that he was leaving. When the season ended in early October, he said he would file for free agency but would listen to the Mets' offer.
 Officials in the Mets' front office reported they had not held serious talks yet with Strawberry or his agent, Eric Goldschmidt of Los Angeles, who did not return calls to his office.
 For the next 15 days, players with more than six years in the big leagues may file letters of intent to enter the free-agent market, if they are no longer under contract to their clubs. But during that time, they may negotiate contract terms only with their old club. Other teams may approach them in general terms, but not in economic terms. However, after 15 days, it's a free market.
A highly placed management official of the Los Angeles Dodgers was asked if the Dodgers would try to sign Strawberry, who has said that they were probably his first choice, if he did not stay with the Mets. "We're going to try," the official said.
Three players who did file for free agency today were the outfielder Rob Deer of the Milwaukee Brewers and the pitchers Joe Price of the Baltimore Orioles and Jeff Robinson of the Yankees.

HEADLINE: Bonn and Tokyo as Global Police

 BODY:
There's rising sentiment in Germany and Ja-
pan, the hated Axis of World War II, to send troops abroad again. But this time it's in the cause of peacekeeping. Should the two countries amend their Constitutions so they can help in situations like the Persian Gulf crisis? Short of that, should they enact laws permitting a non-combat role?
The answer is not easy. War memories linger. Few countries are eager to open doors for such powerful, competitive nations. Yet it's hard to imagine future collective security and peacekeeping operations without them. 
 To sustain such operations requires nations with worldwide interests, money and manpower, and there aren't many. The list always comes down to the U.S., Britain, and sometimes France and Italy, in conjunction with a regional state or two. It's only a matter of time before Americans tire of such a lonely and costly role -- and ask with rising impatience, When will Bonn and Tokyo start carrying their share?
In short, it's likely that future peace operations will depend on the participation of the Germans and Japanese. Many of their leaders understand that and are already calling for constitutional changes. Gerhard Stoltenberg, the German Defense Minister, says it's "unsatisfactory" for German forces to be restricted to the territory of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Prime Minister Kaifu of Japan has gone further. His Cabinet favors legislation that would permit thousands of soldiers to serve behind the lines in Saudi Arabia. But a divided Parliament has to approve a step many Japanese view as a slippery evasion of the Constitution.
The first issue for Bonn and Tokyo is how to participate. Mr. Kaifu proposes economic support plus a non-combat role. It goes without saying that countries as wealthy as Japan and Germany should contribute aid. And while non-combatant status might pass muster with their left-wing parties, it won't wash in the U.S. Genuine collective security has to mean that Tokyo and Bonn are prepared to fight as well as to finance.
The second issue is the constitutional basis for participation. Should they be able to dispatch forces unilaterally? Probably not. The right to unilateral action seems a step beyond what their own political constituencies desire and too much for their anxious neighbors to swallow all at once.
What about limiting themselves to sending forces only if specifically authorized by the United Nations? That's too restrictive. It would preclude sending German and Japanese forces to the Persian Gulf today, or in similar situations.
Perhaps the least troublesome approach would be constitutional changes permitting force deployments abroad only as part of collective security and peacekeeping operations. That would reduce the chances of unilateral action, or inaction. It would also integrate German and Japanese forces into a larger multilateral force.
Both nations have matured as democracies, and as responsible international citizens. They already play full and vital roles in virtually every sector except collective security. Now, in the post-cold war era, they are both needed to make collective security viable, and collective.

HEADLINE: Ancient Tribes Didn't Vanish, They Just Moved

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
Rejecting two generations of academic dogma, archeologists now believe that prehistoric Indian tribes of the Southwest pursued an unusual pattern of episodic settlement until the arrival of the Spanish. They constructed dizzying cliff dwellings or huge settlements in the arid flatlands every few generations, then abandoned them as a snake might shed its skin.
These conclusions, archeologists say, have wide ramifications for understanding how other civilizations evolved.
The early communities of the Anasazi, and the lesser-known Hohokam and Mogollon Indians, waxed and waned in irregular rhythms as their members trekked across a precarious landscape of sagebrush, pinon trees, rocks and sand, stopping every few generations to build towns, irrigate fields and plant and harvest corn and squash before moving on.
Archeologists have long been puzzled by this pattern of abandonment, so different from the lockstep evolutionary progression attributed to the great early civilizations of the Middle East and Europe: from hunting and foraging to farming, from farming to the construction of villages, and from the construction of villages to the rise of city-states and empires.
But George J. Gumerman of the Center for Archeological Investigations at Southern Illinois University said, "We now have the data to show that this was a way cultures evolved before civilization, before the city-states."
"What we're looking at," he went on, "are patterns in which people who had done dramatic building then reverted to simpler forms of existence and didn't have such a dramatic impact on the environment. We've got the data now to see these more ephemeral phases in prehistory."
Paul Fish, an archeologist with the Arizona State Museum in Tucson, said the areas from southern Colorado and Utah to the Mexican border "were like lights going on and off." He spoke at an unusual conference of Southwestern archaeologists at the Santa Fe Institute this month. The conference, like one a year ago at the School of American Research in Santa Fe, was an attempt to look more deeply into the pulsating patterns of development and retrenchment in Southwestern cultures. But the format of the recent conference was a deviation from normal academic patterns.
<> To stimulate experts to think differently about the conclusions they might draw from the burials, tools, pottery, dwellings and garbage they have unearthed, 18 archeologists and anthropologists were closeted for a week with physicists, computer scientists, a demographer, a molecular biologist and a businessman.
The result, Mr. Gumerman said, was "to help set the agenda" for Southwestern archeology for the next few years.
"This kind of thing helps us see things on a bigger scale," said Ben Nelson, an anthropologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo. "Every other conference I've been to is just populated with archeologists. There's been no programmatic attempt to put people from different disciplines together and force them to talk. This has been really spectacular."
Southwestern archeologists, he added, "used to associate early occupations with subsistence survival strategy, then went along a continuum, with the other end being more complex farming and larger groups." But he said careful study of the evidence shows a different pattern: episodic settlement.
The archeologists' conclusions, now working their way into graduate students' textbooks, have in part solved one of the central mysteries of Southwestern archeology: what happenned to the Anasazi (An-ah-SAH-zi)? The question has been posed by generations of scholars and laymen awed by the makers of the multi-storied cliff dwellings in Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico and the complex system of roads that radiated out to other smaller Anasazi sites.
The answer seems to be that they kept building communities and deserting them as long as the new European settlers allowed, but the names by which the Indians were known changed as the range of their wanderings decreased. Instead of "Anasazi," a word from the Athabascan language of the later-coming Navajo Indians which means "enemy old ones," the later generations were known by the names they still carry: Zuni, Hopi, Acoma.
<HD>Answers Provoke Questions
 Similarly, the Hohokam (Ho-ho-KAHM) cultures of prehistoric Arizona, which built huge ceremonial "ball courts" reminiscent of the ancient cultures of central Mexico, and intricate irrigation systems that supported complex agriculture, eventually were known as the Pima, the name some of their descendants carry today.
The resolution of these questions, however, has left a host of new ones still unanswered. In particular, archeologists and anthropologists want to know what factors influenced the episodic odyssey of the prehistoric Indians. Studies over the last decade have combined analysis of tree rings, which can determine annual rainfall, with analysis of water tables to see if the abandonments coincided with periods of drought.
But thus far the studies have proved inconclusive. Although there is ample evidence for a great drought in northern New Mexico and Arizona in the late 13th century, a time when some of the major settlements were abandoned, Linda Cordell, an anthropologist at the California Academy of Sciences, points out that some sites were being constructed in the dry areas at the peak of the drought.
 Other explanations have also proved imperfect. For much of this century, scholars theorized that the Anasazi had moved into the cliff dwellings for defensive purposes and that these Pueblo people were constantly at war, either with each other or with Athabascan and Ute interlopers from the north.
But Steve Lekson, an anthropologist with the Museum of New Mexico, said he believed there was not much evidence for "organized nastiness." In his view, the archeological sites have not turned up enough skeletons with arrowheads in their rib cages, axes in their skulls or other signs of violent battles and deaths to support a theory of abandonments in time of war.
 
Few Clues From Skeletons
 A third possibility explored at the seminar was that disease became more prevalent the longer a community stayed in one place. Deborah Martin, a physical anthropologist at Hampshire College, said at the conference that there were sketchy signs of tuberculosis in some skeletons which long predated the arrival of the Spanish. Overall, Dr. Martin and Dr. Nelson said, the amount of skeletal material from any one site at any one time is seldom adequate to draw any general conclusions about disease and death.
"The question is not 'Where did the Anasazi go?' " said Murray Gell-Mann, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and an avid student of Southwestern prehistory. "The question is, why would many of these complex cultural phenomena disappear and others survive? It happened in 1150, in 1300, in 1425, and curiously enough, the last is the one we know least about."
Chaco Canyon's cliff dwellings were abruptly abandoned in 1150, but the Mesa Verde settlements of the Anasazi on the plateaus of southern Colorado and Utah continued until 1300.Soon thereafter, however, there were only isolated, scattered settlements in this once-flourishing area, and new waves of construction had taken place along the Little Colorado River in northwestern Arizona and along the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico.
Over the next century, however, these central areas of settlement shrank dramatically. Other widely settled areas, like the Casas Grandes culture in the northwestern corner of Mexico, had virtually disappeared by 1450.
For the Santa Fe Institute, a six-year-old group of computer scientists, mathematicians and biologists who study complex systems, the questions raised by the new findings in Southwestern prehistory have parallels in fields as diverse as linguistics, biology and economics, raising common questions about why systems get more complex and why complex systems disintegrate.
"What I hope for in a conference like this," said Dr. Gell-Mann, "is that it would have some effect on stimulating people to think about complex systems broadly, whether human systems or biological systems or computer models. Another more modest objective is to come out with some ideas of what the archeologists should study next."

HEADLINE: How U.S. Can Pressure Beijing on Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal, in "The Price for Silence" (column, Sept. 28) wisely chides the Administration for failing to hold the Chinese Government accountable for its continued violations of human rights. Unless Beijing knows that we will not tolerate the executions, jailings and other abuses detailed -- and predicted -- in the new Asia Watch report, we are bound to see even greater repressions mainly at the hands of the newly reinvigorated People's Liberation Army.
After years of giving the military the lowest priority on its list of "four modernizations," Beijing has increased its military budget by a whopping 15.2 percent. With the cold war ended and the major powers agreeing to reduce their strategic and conventional forces, and with the Soviet and Vietnamese borders quiet, there are hardly any fresh external threats to warrant the increased emphasis on the military. The only plausible explanation is the post-Tiananmen preoccupation of Beijing's leaders with securing and maintaining control of the country, and their decision to make the army their chief instrument of control.
Until now, army loyalty to the political leadership was not a certainty: some commanders refused to use their troops against the pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen, and afterward there were murmurs of dissension in the ranks over the crackdown's brutality. This apparently led Deng Xiaoping, Li Peng and their colleagues to conclude that they must be assured of the army's absolute loyalty to be sure of maintaining power themselves. Accordingly, they recently placed new emphasis on political and ideological indoctrination: troops must now attend daily one-and-a-half-hour political sessions, and officers through the highest ranks must also attend appropriate classes. Through these measures, and the new infusion of funds to keep the commanders happy, Beijing's leaders expect to have at their command a loyal and powerful military whose main mission will be the suppression of dissent among the Chinese people.
We can do little to prevent the strengthening of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but we can do things to curb its use. For example, the greater budgetary allotment to the military means fewer allocations for economic development. We can therefore make trade, investments and other aspects of economic cooperation contingent upon the tolerance of dissent and the reduction, if not elimination of arbitrary arrests and executions. We can also stop behaving as if China did us a favor by siding with us in the Middle East crisis: it did so out of desire to better its overall relations with us, and because it did not want to jeopardize its growing ties with Saudi Arabia, which it recently wooed away diplomatically from Taiwan.
We have the ways to put pressure on the Chinese Government to make it observe basic norms of decent human conduct; what we need is the will.

HEADLINE: Study of Peace Corps Shows Big Demand but Short Supply

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Though its services have never been more in demand, the Peace Corps is hobbled by deficiencies in recruiting and training and is unable to retain its volunteers, according to an assessment by the staff of a Congressional committee made public today.
In an era when the cold war is winding down, fragile democracies are emerging and there is an international push for sustainable economic development, "the Peace Corps has entered an era of unparalleled opportunity for service," the report said. 
 Yet the corps has been reduced by budget cuts and weakened by a lack of administrative commitment over the last 20 years, said Representative John Conyers Jr., chairman of the House Committee on Government Operations, whose staff wrote the report.
"We think the Peace Corps has been seriously undervalued in the last 20 years," Mr. Conyers said.
Initiated by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, the Peace Corps caught the imagination of thousands of idealistic youth infused with more enthusiasm than experience. As volunteerism waned, the Peace Corps went out of fashion.
Today only 10,000 people apply each year for 6,300 places, barely a fifth of the volunteer applications that were received in 1964.
Based on a seven-country review conducted for the committee by the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, the Peace Corps can fill only 60 percent of the openings for those in scientific and technical fields.
The Peace Corps' record in attracting minority recruits fell far below acceptable levels, according to the report. "While the U.S. population was about 12 percent black in 1988, only 2 percent or about 120 or that year's 6,300 volunteers were black," the report said.
Of those who enter the corps, 30 percent do not finish the entire two years of duty.
Paul D. Coverdell, who was appointed director of the Peace Corps last year, acknowledged the shortcomings noted in the report but insisted that programs have been implemented to address those problems.
The agency mandated that 10 percent of volunteers be minorities in 1990, rising to 15 percent by 1993, Mr. Coverdell said. He said the corps surpassed its target last quarter; 19 percent of the nominees that recently accepted assignments were minorities.
To retain volunteers, efforts have been increased to ensure that the skills of volunteers match the positions they are placed in.
Hundreds of recruits have been sent to Central Europe this year, primarily to teach English. Mongolia, which has been visited by few Westerners, was the latest country to accept Peace Corps volunteers.
A copy of the report, No. 101-824, may be obtained at no cost by writing to the House Document Room Annex 2, the House of Representatives, Washington D.C. 20515.

HEADLINE: China, Reassessing Its Foes, Views Japan Warily

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Japanese proposals to send troops to the Persian Gulf and a territorial dispute about some uninhabited islands are stirring concern here that Japan could emerge in the coming years as China's primary military threat.
The old fears that the Soviet Union might invade China are easing, and few people cast the United States as a military threat. But Japan and China are longtime rivals, and the octogenarians who run China still have vivid memories of the brutal "War of Resistance Against Japan" from 1937 to 1945."Japan's dispatching of troops abroad is a very sensitive issue both in its own country and abroad," the official New China News Agency reported on Saturday, quoting an unidentified "leading official" of the Foreign Ministry. 
 The official asked Japan to consider these matters and act prudently, and added, "Otherwise, the feelings of the Asian people will be unavoidably hurt and it will eventually bring no good to Japan itself."
The Cabinet in Tokyo last week approved a plan to send troops to join the international force confronting Iraq in the first Japanese military forayabroad since the end of World War II. The measure, however, faces considerable opposition in the Japanese Parliament and its prospects are uncertain.
In a renewal of the territorial dispute, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Li Jinhua, last week criticized Japanese claims to a handful of disputed islands 120 miles northeast of Taiwan. Known in Chinese as the Diaoyu Islands and in Japan as the Senkaku Islands, they are claimed by Japan, Taiwan and China.
The spokeswoman was responding to reports that the Japanese Government might give official recognition to a lighthouse that has been constructed onone of the islands by Japanese nationalists. She condemned the building of the lighthouse.
Even before the dispute over the islands and the prospect of Japan's sending troops to the gulf, the Chinese leadership is said to have been re-examining its strategic concerns -- downgrading the Soviet threat and raising the Japanese threat a notch or two.
A well-informed Chinese official said that the military was pressing for additional funds in the five-year plan now being prepared, partly on the ground that China must counter Japan. And an analysis for top officials last year, in the classified publication Neican Xuanpian, portrayed China as an essential force to check Japan militarily and economically in the Pacific.
Chinese officials seem much more suspicious than Americans about Japanese ambitions in the region, and sometimes appear to regard Americans as a bit naive about Tokyo.
While many Chinese are clearly genuinely concerned about Japan, some also believe that the military hopes to make use of such alarm to bolster its influence and budget.
For all the apprehensions here about Japanese militarism, the relationship with Japan is in some respects closer, though perhaps not warmer, than with any other industrialized country. Japanese tourists travel widely in China and Japanese students study at Chinese universities.
Japanese companies have been wary of investing in China, but have established much broader sales networks in China than have European or American companies.

HEADLINE: For Senator Bradley in New Jersey

 BODY:
For a champion of campaign finance reform, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey is setting a prodigal example. He is spending more than $10 million on his bid for re-election. It is true that this is a year in which incumbents elsewhere have been knocked off. And it is true that his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, is an appealing and worthy challenger.
On the other hand, Senator Bradley enjoys an overwhelming lead in opinion polls -- and he deserves it. On the basis of his conscientious 12-year record in the Senate, Mr. Bradley has earned re-election to a third term. 
 The hottest issue in New Jersey this year is state taxes. Republican candidates are teeing off on the unpopular but needed increases that the new Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, got the Legislature to approve. While state budgets aren't the responsibility of U.S. senators, Mrs. Whitman has successfully tagged Senator Bradley with evasiveness; he refuses to say what he thinks of the Florio taxes.
Mrs. Whitman comes from a well-to-do political family, with a creditable record of her own. In elective office she has served as a county freeholder; by appointment, she was president of the state's public utilities board in the final years of the Kean administration. She is chairman of the executive committee of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. A self-styled "fiscal conservative," she puts spending cuts ahead of tax increases but wisely says she "would never say never" to raising taxes. Less wisely, she advocates line-item veto power for the President and a reduction in the tax on capital gains.
Senator Bradley's original popularity as a basketball star led to more political popularity. That's true in New Jersey, where he won 65 percent of the vote in his last election, and in the Democratic Party, where he is often thought of as Presidential timber -- though he says he expects to serve a full Senate term if re-elected.
While he has conducted a dull, play-it-safe campaign, his record as a responsible public servant is hard to fault. He more than anyone deserves credit for launching the tax reforms enacted in 1986. He has fought effectively for sensible energy and environmental legislation and has studiously carved out a role in international economic policy.
Mrs. Whitman might make a good senator but in Bill Bradley New Jersey already has an excellent Senator. We endorse his re-election.

HEADLINE: Rail Freight Can Ease Traffic Congestion

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With the New York metropolitan area facing monumental traffic jams because of bridge and highway repairs (news article, Sept. 24), there is a proven method to alleviate congestion: rail freight transportation.
Every rail car bringing goods in or out of New York eliminates the movement of up to four trucks on public roads and bridges. Trains are vastly more fuel efficient than trucks (railroads can haul nearly three times more freight per gallon than trucks) and are therefore less polluting.
Unlike the highway, the region's rail freight network has the capacity to handle additional volume and is in good physical condition. While highways are maintained with public money (the taxes trucks pay do not match the heavy damage they inflict on roads and bridges), private-sector freight railroads like Conrail invest their own funds to maintain rail infrastructure, in addition to paying local and state taxes.
The freight rail renaissance has started in the region. Backed by renewed interest from shippers of recyclable materials, solid waste, bulk commodities, food products, manufactured goods, building products and paper, Conrail is working with several parties, including the newly formed Harlem River Yard Ventures corporation in the Bronx and state and local government to restore unused and underutilized rail freight facilities in the region.
As these efforts by Conrail, connecting railroads (including the Long Island), shippers, independent entrepreneurs and government succeed in moving freight off the highways and onto the tracks, the region will benefit with fewer trucks clogging roads and bridges, more efficient use of fuel for freight transportation, and reduced air pollution.

Down on the Farm, Things Are Looking Up

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MENDON, Mo.

 BODY:
When Shorty Glad bach looks back, 1985 still seems too close for comfort. In that year of national farm crisis, his struggles paralleled those of many young farmers, caught in the clutches of enormous debt and depressed farm prices.
But he also acknowledges that in the five years since then, he and his family have come a long way on their grain, cattle and hog farm in this small farming town in north-central Missouri. 
 Indeed, the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently reported that a broad middle group of farmers have overcome the setbacks of the early 1980's and have now caught up with urban residents in family income.
Hardly anyone, of course, matches national averages, but the experiences of the Gladbach family in large measure typify this group of farmers.
"We went through some pretty tough times, and a lot of people in the same situation we were in didn't make it," Mr. Gladbach said the other day while resting a bit after harvesting a bountiful crop from one of his best fields. "But I feel like we've got a little more control of our own situation now. We're not so tied up in making payments on debts that were really higher than the bankers said our land was worth. It just isn't as stressful."
Lawrence Gladbach, a man of medium height who is now 36 years old but who has been known as Shorty since he was a toddler, was first encountered by a reporter in early 1985. It was a time of deep soul-searching, and he and his wife, Geraldine, acknowledged many a sleepless night of wondering whether to continue the struggle.
They had four children: Johnny, who then 4; Becky, 8; Katie, 9, and Jesse, 10, who was already helping with farm work even though his feet barely reached the pedals of the tractors he operated.
Like many young farm families, the Gladbachs had already traveled a bumpy course. They were married in 1973, when the average farm family income was 47 percent higher than the average for all the nation's families. In the next seven years the Gladbachs built an operation centered on the 100-year-old farmhouse and 200 acres they acquired from Mr. Gladbach's father. In 1980 things looked bright.
But since then theirs has been a story that paralleled the experiences of American agriculture in general, as seen through the study reported in September by Kenneth Deavers and Thomas Carlin of the Economic Research Service.
In three of the next five years they were plagued by poor growing weather, and when prices were high, they had little grain to sell. Instead, they had to buy expensive corn to feed their cattle and hogs.
Like most other farmers the Gladbachs tightened their belts, cut living expenses and paid off debts as fast as they could bring in cash.
By 1986, things were better, and in 1987 better still, with cash returns exceeding outlays on the farm by $66,070. Then came the drought of 1988, which stunted crops across most of the Corn Belt. And last year was not much better, but good prices for cattle and hogs have helped families like the Gladbachs keep going.
Now, after a shaky start when wet fields delayed planting, 1990 is turning out to be another good year. Crops have been good and livestock prices excellent.
Historically, the income of farm families have lagged far behind American households in general. In 1960, for example, they averaged about 60 percent of the incomes of urban residents, according to the Deavers-Carlin study. But they improved steadily until, in the boom year of 1973, farm incomes were about one and a half times the national average. And they were on a par with urban family incomes through the late 1970's.
The farm crisis of the early 1980's knocked them down again, to a level about 20 percent below the average for all American families. But in 1985 they almost reached parity with other Americans, and in 1986 they surged ahead. Finally, in 1988, the last year for which comparative figures are available, the average income for farm families reached $41,558, compared with $34,017 for Americans in general.
Still, things are better now on the nation's farms than they have been in years, and the Gladbach family reflects this improvement.
Jesse, now a high school junior and nearly as tall as his father, has a car and drives himself and Katie to school. Katie is a sophomore, and Mr. Gladbach says he may need to buy yet another car just to keep the peace.
Both Jesse and Katie are looking toward college, a prospect that Mr. Gladbach says he faces with a feeling of assurance.
"We've got equity enough in the farm now," he said. "We can feel pretty sure now, with the student loans they can get to help out, that all of them can go on and get a college education."

HEADLINE: Soviet Lawmen vs. the Black Market

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The leaders of Soviet law enforcement described today how harried and ill equipped they are to deal with the current explosion of black-market crime as the nation drifts uncertainly between Communism and the free market.
"We never expected this scale of organized crime," Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, the chief of the K.G.B., said at a news conference in which officials acknowledged their problems in fighting the rampant growth of illicit entrepreneurship that some day would be legalized, if the nation ever adopts the promised market economy. 
 Justice Minister Veniamin Yakovlev said: "Our American colleagues ask us why we fight speculation, a normal phenomenon in a normal economy. But right now, our criminal code stipulates as illegal things that are normal in a market economy."
Emphasizing the need for new laws and guidance, Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin joined his two colleagues in portraying a frayed criminal justice system trying to manage the transition from a police state to the current freewheeling, non-stop crisis atmosphere of attempted national reform.
The officials plaintively described a kaleidoscopic array of challenges that range from a 30 percent rise in crimes against foreigners with hard currency to the separatist pressures for rival police and military forces in the republics; from the destruction of Lenin monuments across the nation to insurgent governments' dismissal of teachers for simply being Communists; from the republics' growing refusal to submit their young men to the national military draft to the police agencies' own dark histories of repression.
On the latter point, Mr. Kryuchkov insisted that the K.G.B. was moving to correct its past. Mr. Yakovlev said the issue of prosecuting abusive police agents in past decades of terror should be considered. But Mr. Kryuchkov said several already had been prosecuted, while many others had died, and the remainder "can be counted on the fingers of one hand."
Mr. Kryuchkov said a development that was particularly alarming was the ascendancy of "rather stable gangs with access to the black market that even have their own investment funds."
"They have the opportunity to accumulate power," he said, adding that more than 900 such groups have been identified. Many have been in operation for more than a year and are seeking ties with organized crime overseas, officials warned.
Mr. Kryuchkov insisted that, unlike organized crime in the United States and elsewhere, what the Soviets loosely call the "mafia" has not reached the level of constituting "a state within a state," although its methods increasingly employ "extraordinarily sadistic" violence.
"We are importing some negative things now, too," he said of the nation's attempt to adapt to the free-market conditions of the outside world.
 
Measure Before Parliament
 The news conference was timed to build support for a bill pending in the national Parliament to tighten penalties on black marketeering. Parliament voted preliminary approval of the bill after considerable criticism that the measure was vague and directed against "actions that in the civilized world are taken as enterprise," as one critic complained.
The Government's supporters countered that black market speculation was affecting basic food supplies at a time when, according to the latest statistical measurements in the stores, only 20 basic goods on a list of 1,100 commodities can be regularly found on the shelves.
The bill's proposed penalties of up to three years in jail plus a fine would be directed against the growing phenomenon of speculators who accumulate subsidized, low-price goods from state stores and resell them for profit in the black market, where desperate consumers are turning more often.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Cutting Pay for Officials And for Himself

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Trying to show that the highest levels of his administration were willing to share the pain of fiscal belt-tightening, Mayor David N. Dinkins imposed a 5 percent pay cut on himself and nearly 700 other senior administration officials yesterday and froze salaries for 3,800 managerial employees.
But the move, meant to save about $4.5 million in the current fiscal year, was immediately denounced by the heads of two major municipal labor unions, who called it a public-relations gimmick meant to tilt tense contract negotiations to the city's favor. 
 "This is an administration out of control," said Barry Feinstein, president of the 12,000-member Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
 
'A Cheap Shot'
 Mr. Feinstein and Stanley Hill, executive director of the 140,000-member District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, are embroiled in contract negotiations that have been severely complicated by a 5.5 percent wage increase granted to the teachers union and subsequent criticism that it was far too generous.
"We think the pay cut is a cheap shot that is meant to impact on the bargaining table," Mr. Feinstein said. "Stanley and I have insisted on a level playing field, and this is an attempt to skew it to one side. Clearly, it's bargaining in bad faith and we're not going to have any of that. We think this is most unfortunate, an improper turn of events."
Senior administration officials have been aware since Friday of the planned cuts for officials and staff members whose pay falls under the Mayor's control. The announcement appeared to have two immediate purposes: to strengthen the city's position in the labor negotiations and to send a clear signal that the Mayor was willing to take the tough steps to address the city's budget problems.
It also appeared to be intended to put pressure on city officials not under the Democratic Mayor's control -- like borough presidents and district attorneys -- to take similar tough measures.
Some of these officials complained privately that Mr. Dinkins had not solicited their support beforehand.
"I think this really is more of an attempt at public relations than at proving real financial help to our city," said Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, a Republican. "It's insignificant in terms of the fiscal problems facing our city. He cannot realistically give a 5.5 percent raise to the teachers and then try to deflect the furor by suggesting he and his staff take pay cuts."
 
'In No Way Theatrics'
 Albert Scardino, the Mayor's press secretary, denied that the pay cuts were meant as a bargaining tool with municipal unions. "He's sending a signal to labor, to management, to taxpayers, to bondholders, to everyone, that we intend to have a balanced budget." he said. "This is in no way theatrics intended to impress labor negotiations."
Some officials quickly agreed with the Mayor's plea to "share the pain" and announced their own pay cuts and cuts in employees' salaries.
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, who agreed to take a 5 percent cut for herself and her top staff, said every little bit helped. "Even though it has a slight budgetary impact, if it's the first step to demonstrate that we all have to share the pain, then it's an important first step," she said.
The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said yesterday that he and five top members of his staff were voluntarily taking a 5 percent pay cut and that the rest of the Council staff salaries would be frozen. Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, saying he applauded the Mayor's decision, said he would take a 5 percent pay cut and extend a managerial salary freeze put into effect last July.
Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President, said he too was taking a 5 percent cut and reducing his office's personnel budget by 2 percent. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan said that she was taking a 5 percent pay cut and that her office was reviewing the entire budget problem.
The Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, declined to comment on his plans. The Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, said she was still considering her options.
City officials have already slashed the capital budget of some agencies by more than 30 percent, and last week they told city agencies to prepare to cut more than $1 billion in programs and services from their operating budgets over the next 21 months.
The 5 percent wage cut applies to 44 senior-level managers in City Hall, including the Mayor, the five deputy mayors, the city's corporation counsel, the Mayor's counsel and press secretary, the directors of mayoral offices and all other mayoral managerial employees earning at least $70,000 a year.
The cuts also apply to 60 commissioners and 140 deputy commissioners in mayoral agencies and 202 assistant commissioners in those agencies who earn at least $70,000. Also affected are about 250 mayoral agency staff members who hold exempt or noncompetitive management titles and earn at least $70,000 a year. The changes would not apply to employees coverered by collective-bargaining agreements.
The Mayor also ordered a change in salary policy for all managerial employees, starting in the 1992 fiscal year. The change would tie raises to professional performance rather than to the rate of inflation or increases granted to other city employees.
 
Changed His Mind
 Mr. Dinkins said times were so bad that he was initially prepared to order 10 percent cuts. He said he changed his mind because of the likelihood that the Federal Government would impose sharp increases in payroll taxes for many city employees through extension of the Social Security system.
Phil Tacktill, a spokesman for the New York City Managerial Employees Association, representing 2,200 managers in the city, reacted angrily to the Mayor's decision. "The phone has been jumping off the hook with people complaining that is outrageous," he said.

SAUDI PRINCE HINTS AT DEAL WITH IRAQ FOR KUWAITI PORT

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister, the country's third-ranking official, has raised the possibility of allowing Iraq to have some Kuwaiti territory as an outlet on the Persian Gulf and has urged Arabs to seek a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis "through all means."
In comments to Arab journalists on Sunday that were widely reported today, the Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, said in an apparent reference to Iraq's claims against Kuwait that "if a sister Arab nation has rights, we all agree these rights can be had, but not by force." 
 Asked about Iraq's demands for an outlet on the Persian Gulf, Prince Sultan, replied, "Saudi Arabia has said, and says now, that giving rights, including territorial brotherly concessions -- given willingly -- is a matter of pride for the Arab nation."
 
Talks of Past 'Brotherhood'
 Prince Sultan, a brother of King Fahd, said: "We in Saudi Arabia have given parts of our land and parts of our territorial waters willingly. But this came through good will, noble manners, and brotherhood" -- a reference to territorial settlements concluded in the past between Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.
The comments by the Prince, considered the official wielding the most influence with King Fahd even though he is second in line to the throne, marked the first time since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 that a ranking Saudi leader has so much as hinted at a territorial compromise with Iraq.
 
Oil Prices Plunge
 The remarks, which helped push oil prices down $5 a barrel, prompted the Saudi authorities to rush today to assure the United States and others that there was no change in the Saudi view that Iraq must heed the United Nations Security Council's demand for a complete withdrawal from Kuwait.
Similarly, the Kuwaiti government in exile rushed to reaffirm its opposition to any compromise with Iraq.
Saudi television, which broadcast Prince Sultan's remarks in full tonight, said the Prince had been "misinterpreted."
Further complicating the situation was the sudden and unexpected arrival here tonight of the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, whose country is closely allied with Saudi Arabia and who has consistently advocated the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait.
 
Wider Access to Gulf
 While Egyptian officials said Mr. Mubarak was here to visit Egyptian troops, some diplomats said he may have come to seek clarification of Saudi positions. In a speech at Jidda airport welcoming Mr. Mubarak, King Fahd reportedly reiterated his demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, saying that President Saddam Hussein would not lose face if he rectified his "blunder."
Mr. Mubarak's concern may have been prompted by Arab and other news reports quoting officials of the Soviet Union, Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization as saying that Iraq would be willing to pull its forces from Kuwait provided it could retain Bubiyan and Warbah Islands as outlets on the Persian Gulf.
Bubiyan and Warbah Islands would give Iraq a much wider and much more protected access to the Persian Gulf. Before the invasion, Iraq's access to the gulf went through a narrow canal that passed by the two islands. Iraq had repeatedly and frequently asked Kuwait to lease the two islands for 99 years for the use of its navy.
The strong accent on conciliation and peaceful settlement adopted by Prince Sultan amplified the already existing impression that he is a leading "dove", in the words of an Arab diplomat, among the Saudi leadership.
In the past, Prince Sultan had stated that "no attacks" will be launched from Saudi Arabia against Iraq except in self-defense.
 
'What I Meant to Say'
 Aware of the concerns generated by the reports of Prince Sultan's remarks, the Saudi authorities not only replayed the full text of his comments, but also broadcast a commentary in which Prince Sultan was quoted as saying that Saudi Arabia still insisted on the full withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
A Saudi commentator reported that Prince Sultan said, "What I meant to say is that Saudi Arabia was able through good will and good intentions to settle land disputes with Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. However when it comes to aggression on Kuwait, the Saudi Arabian kingdom insists on the reinstitution of the legitimate Kuwaiti authority under the leadership of the Emir of Kuwait and the full withdrawal of Iraqi troops."
In his comments to Arab journalists, Prince Sultan also said that the "law of the jungle" had no place in negotiating border settlements and other disputes.
He also stressed that "the invasion of an Arab country of another Arab country is a deep wound to the Arab nation."
Prince Sultan stressed that Saudi Arabia's opposition to Iraq's conquest of Kuwait is a matter "of principle, and we will never change it no matter what.
"We would adopt the same stand with Iraq if it were subjected to aggression."
 
Full Brother of the King
 Nevertheless, the general tone of the Prince's remarks might appeal to Iraq. Saudi television said that the comments had led to "wrong interpretations" among the Arab reporters. The Prince's conciliatory tone was highlighted by Arab press agencies and news reports.
Among the royal Al Saud family, King Fahd is the supreme ruler, Commander in Chief of the Army and Prime Minister.
Prince Abdullah, the king's half brother, is the Crown Prince and second in line to the throne. He commands the national guard force of about 35,000 and has the title of First Deputy Prime Minister, putting him in charge of running cabinet sessions in the absence of the King.
Prince Sultan, a full brother of the King, is Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Aviation. As a full brother of the King he is believed to be closer to him than Crown Prince Abdullah. He carries enormous influence because of his position overseeing the military establishment.
Since the beginning of the gulf crisis, Prince Sultan has had the responsibility of overseeing the deployment of foreign troops here, coordinating their activities, furninshing logistical support and reviewing any battle plans and field coordination with American and other army commanders.
 
A Most Unusual Episode
 Earlier in the day, as the remarks became an issue and oil prices began to fall, Saudi officials rushed to explain that the Prince's comments should be viewed in the context of a "brotherly chat among Arabs." Later, Saudi television news reports tonight said that the remarks of Prince Sultan were being broadcast in full "to clear up any confusion" they may have caused. The Saudi news media did not publish the earlier, conciliatory accounts.
The whole episode was highly unusual in a country that is intent on projecting an image of steady, calm and controlled decision-making in all its public pronouncements.
Indeed, the Prince's remarks appeared to have raised significant concern within the circles of the Kuwaiti government in exile, illiciting a strong reaction from an unidentified spokesman in Taif, in western Saudi Arabia.
The official Kuwaiti news agency, KUNA, which continues to represent the views of the Kuwaiti government in exile, said today in a dispatch from London that Kuwait will not accept "any territorial compromise" as a pre-condition for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from occupied Kuwait.
There has been a palpable trend among many senior Saudi officials and notable members of the Saudi business and media establishment. Over the past few days they have expressed a strong aversion to war and a preference for the use of the economic and military embargo imposed on Iraq as the way to deal with the gulf crisis.
 
Purpose of the Embargo
 Even when it came to the embargo, Prince Sultan attempted to signal Iraq that Saudi Arabia was anxious to see it come to an end, noting that the principal purpose behind it was to avert a damaging war and the shedding of Arab blood at Arab hands.
"It hurts us greately that the Iraqi people are under such containment or that any Arab or Islamic country should suffer through such an embargo," he said. "But the purpose of it is to avert bloodshed. All we desire is for the Iraqi people and the great Iraqi army to assert its Arab identity by withdrawing from Arab territory."
Addressing other concerns raised by the journalists, Prince Sultan denied the existence of any differences over the command structure of the estimated 300,000 allied troops gathered in Saudi Arabia to face Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
He said that elaborate measures and agreements have been worked out between all the heads of states of the joint forces to control the decision-making process if things came to war. "But, clearly, once the order to go to battle is given, it is the commanders in the field that will be totally in charge." Responding to a question, he strongly denied Saudi Arabia's intention of "entering into any alliances with a non-Arab country."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about remarks by the Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, suggesting a territorial compromise with Iraq, misstated Crown Prince Abdullah's standing in the line of succession tothe throne. He is first in line, not second.

HEADLINE: White House and Congress on Verge of Tax Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The White House and Congressional leaders seemed today to be within an eyelash of reaching the tax compromise crucial to a new budget.
They have tentatively agreed on a 31 percent top tax rate, up from the current 28 percent. These other elements are more or less locked up: a limit on deductions that could be claimed by people with total incomes above $100,000, a modest rise in the gasoline tax, cuts in Medicare payments, a steep increase in the amount of wages subject to the Medicare payroll tax, luxury taxes on expensive cars, boats, private planes, furs and jewelry, and higher taxes on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages.
 
Real Numbers Not Released
 
 The actual numbers -- for instance the exact size of the gasoline tax -- were being held in abeyance until computer tabulations showed how much money would be raised and exactly who would pay it.
The negotiators, who met until just before midnight, were working to reconcile bills approved last week by the House and Senate.
After waiting all day for computer runs and for the party whips to poll lawmakers on how various proposals under consideration would affect their votes on the entire package, the top negotiators began meeting at 8 o'clock tonight to discuss a new Democratic offer.
 
'We're So Close'
 "Numberwise, we're so close," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee. "But everybody has given so much on both sides that they think, 'I'm not going to go that last mile.' "
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the problem was making final adjustments so the package would be acceptable to the House, which is dominated by Democrats, and the Senate, which is much more conservative.
"What we can pass, they can't; what they can pass, we can't," he said.
The last remaining disagreement on a matter of principle was over, not whether to levy an additional tax on people with incomes of $1 million, but over what form it should take.
Only about 60,000 tax returns are filed each year showing total incomes of more than $1 million. This is not enough people to fill Giants Stadium, much less for their tax payments to have any meaningful effect on total revenues or on the economy.
But these people have become political symbols barely two weeks before the Congressional elections.
Democrats want to show in a way that is easily understood by voters that they are no friends of the Donald Trumps, Leona Helmsleys and Michael Milkens. The Democratic plan is to place a surtax, perhaps 7.5 percent, on all income over $1 million.
Republicans maintain that would be bad policy because the very wealthy would be encouraged to maximize their deductions to keep their taxable incomes down.
Instead, the Republicans advocate placing a stiff limit on the deductions they could claim in a proposal that would raise approximately the same amount of revenue as the Democratic plan and that would have about the same effect on those taxpayers. But what the Republicans do not want is to give to the Democrats the political satisfaction of passing a surtax.
Both plans would have the effect of raising the actual tax rate on incomes above $1 million. For example, with a 7.5 percent surtax on top of a 31 percent top rate and a 4 percent interest limitation, as proposed at one point by the Democrats, the actual tax rate on million-dollar incomes would be 34.66 percent. With no surtax, but an 8 percent cut in deductions, as offered once by Republicans, the rate would be 33.48 percent.
One effect of the plans to raise the top tax rate to 31 percent would be to eliminate the anomaly known as the bubbe. No taxpayers now pay more than 28 percent of their total income in taxes, but families with taxable incomes between about $80,000 and $200,000 pay 33 percent on the income within that range.
 
Effect of 31% Rate
 Depending on how other provisions are worked out, the 31 percent rate could have the effect of raising the taxes of families with incomes above $200,000 but of lowering somewhat the taxes of people whose incomes fall between $80,000 and $200,000.
The tax proposals are designed to raise about $145 billion over five years, an important component of the negotiators' goal of $500 billion over five years. How much of the $40 billion in deficit reduction this year would consist of increased taxes could not be determined until the final plan was presented.
After an outburst against Democrats from President Bush's top advisers on Sunday afternoon, the negotiators made up today. But they spent all day waiting for staff analysts to run the various tax proposals through computers to determine as precisely as possible what the effects would be.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, stomped out of the Capitol on Sunday, accompanied by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, and asserted that the Democrats were not negotiating in good faith.
But this morning, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, played down the blow-up and said the officials simply "left to come back to the White House to give the President a briefing on where things stood."
 
'Back on Track'
 The officials were back in the Capitol this morning. On arriving, Mr. Darman said that they had been "disappointed" Sunday but that "we're back on track."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said, "We got it out of our system last night."
After Mr. Sununu and the others left Sunday, the top lawmakers from both parties returned to the bargaining table and worked until nearly midnight.
They did the kind of work they do well together without the White House looking over their shoulders, reviewing lists of lawmakers and figuring out who would vote which way depending on what the various aspects of the tax package turned out to be.
A Republican vote-counter said today that whatever the nature of the final compromise, no more than 50 of the 176 Republicans in the House would vote for it.
That gave the Democrats considerable political strength in the negotiations, since their votes are the ones needed to pass a compromise in the House.
 
Minding Realities
 On the other hand, the negotiators were mindful of the need to fashion a plan that could pass the more conservative Senate and that could be approved by the White House.
One illustration of how the balance could be upset came tonight when Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, sought to amend a foreign aid bill with a proposal to prohibit any increase this year in the gasoline tax.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader, considered it such a contentious issue that he temporarily withdrew the foreign aid bill from consideration. In 1982, Senator Helms led a filibuster against a higher gasoline tax that kept Congress in session until just before Christmas.
Each day, there have been further indications of bad blood between the White House officials and Congressional leaders. At one point today, for example, Mr. Darman was left cooling his heels in a corridor while Mr. Dole and Mr. Rostenkowski met in one office in the Capitol and Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic majority leader, and Leon E. Panetta of California, the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee, met in another.
The House measure would raise the top tax rate to 33 percent, impose a 10 percent surtax on people with incomes above $1 million and increase the alternative minimum tax that is paid by wealthy taxpayers with extremely large deductions.
More than two-thirds of the additional taxes would be paid by taxpayers with total incomes over $100,000.
The Senate version, by contrast, would not change tax rates and would more than double the gasoline tax, meaning that barely 40 percent of the new tax bite would be borne by those with total incomes above $100,000.

The Bankers Trust New York Corporation said yesterday that it earned $170 million, or $1.98 a share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $1.42 billion in the comparable 1989 period, when the company recorded a $1.6 billion addition to reserves to cover possible losses on loans to third-world nations.
Without the added reserves, quarterly earnings would have declined 5.6 percent, from $180 million, or $2.18 a share, a year ago. 
 Bankers Trust said that despite the general economic slowdown, it had strengthened its ratio of capital to debt, exceeding Federal Reserve requirements. With the sale of $250 million in preferred stock in May 1990, the company raised its risk-adjusted capital ratio to 5.1 percent, well above a 4 percent minimum that takes effect in 1992.
 
 $1.04 Billion in Troubled Loans
 Analysts said earnings were quite strong, with the exception of a rise in nonperforming loans in highly leveraged corporate transactions like buyouts or restructurings. The company said it had stopped accruing interest on $264 million in troubled loans in the quarter, of which $249 million were for highly leveraged transactions and $31 million were secured by real estate. That put total troubled loans in the United States and other industrial countries at $1.04 billion, of which $470 million resulted from highly leveraged deals and $250 million from real estate loans.
The company said holdings of renegotiated bonds declined by $53 million, because of sales to third parties of Mexican Government par bonds.
Bankers Trust said reserves for losses on loans as of Sept. 30 was $2.2 billion, or 11 percent of loans outstanding.
Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said that the increase in troubled highly leveraged loans was "the biggest element of disappointment."
Chris Kotowski at Oppenheimer & Company agreed, noting that those loans increased by 29 percent, but added that "otherwise it was a fine quarter."
Bankers Trust stock rose 37.5 cents, to $34 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: American Express Gains Despite Shearson

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The American Express Company reported a slight increase in third-quarter earnings yesterday. But the company's profits were dampened by a continued poor performance from Shearson Lehman Brothers.
American Express reported that its net income rose 3.6 percent, to $343.8 million, or 74 cents a share, from $331.8 million, or 77 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1989. Revenues fell 6.8 percent, to $6.06 billion from $6.5 billion. The earnings per share were higher in 1989 because of a smaller number of shares outstanding. 
 At Shearson, earnings were hurt by a drop in investment banking, commission, trading and investment advisory activity. The brokerage subsidiary reported third-quarter profits of $13 million, an 80.3 percent decline from the 1989 third quarter, when it earned $66 million. The figure a year ago for Shearson included a one-time gain of $37 million. Revenues for the period declined 24.2 percent, to $2.5 billion from $3.3 billion.
 
 Shearson a Net Loss
 Still, Shearson represented a net loss to American Express, which did not own 100 percent of the brokerage until August 1990. After accounting for dividends paid to the Nippon Life Insurance Company and other minority shareholders, American Express recorded a $5.4 million loss for the period from Shearson.
Shearson reported a $50 million drop in investment banking revenues, a $130 million drop in commission revenues and a $21 million decline in trading and merchant banking revenues. It did not report profits for these businesses individually.
James D. Robinson 3d, the chief executive of American Express, said that the "strengths of our products and services and our diverse revenue streams enabled our businesses to continue to perform well despite the difficult economic environment."
Record third-quarter earnings were reported at three business units: Travel Related Services gained 15 percent, to $277 million; IDS Financial Services 18 percent, to $56 million, and Information Services 24 percent, to $27 million.
American Express's share price rose $1 yesterday, to $19.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Record Fall Puts Oil Below $30

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil tumbled below $30 a barrel in a record drop yesterday, as traders discerned more peace overtures from the Middle East. They ranged from statements by the Saudi Defense Minister to reports of a dream in which the Prophet Mohammed appeared to President Saddam Hussein.
A report by a Kuwaiti newspaper in Saudi Arabia that Mohammed had told Mr. Hussein in a dream, "I see your rockets deployed wrongly," found a rapt audience on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where traders interpreted the report as an attempt to prepare the Iraqi people for giving up Kuwait. 
 The market took the same message from a statement on Sunday by the Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, that his country was willing to grant Iraq "all its rights."
 
 Technical Factors Cited
 Some analysts said technical factors also played a role.
On the trading floor of the mercantile exchange, crude closed at $28.38, down $5.41, or 16 percent, the biggest one-day drop since trading of the crude oil contract began in 1983. The November contract expired yesterday, so speculators who did not actually want to take delivery of the crude had to sell, and some analysts said that accelerated the decline, but others disagreed. Prices for delivery in later months fell by the limit allowed, $3 a barrel.
In a trend that has fed on itself in recent days, oil prices have fallen 27 percent in the last four trading days, and the November contract was within a few cents of giving up half of its post-crisis gain when it expired.
 
Small Impact on Gasoline
 If the price holds, consumers should see a difference soon in heating oil and other oil products, although the impact on gasoline prices would be small, experts say, because prices at the pump have not risen nearly as rapidly as crude oil prices.
Higher prices for crude oil contributed to large increases in third-quarter profits reported by ARCO and Phillips Petroleum yesterday, despite what they said was their restraining of prices at the pump. Ashland Oil, the nation's largest independent refiner, said its refining profits rose nearly threefold. [Page D14.]
Bigger than the technical factors, market participants agreed, was the market's belief that oil production had reached pre-crisis levels even without Kuwait and Iraq, and its current assessment that a war was unlikely.
Many traders in New York focused on the report yesterday in Al Seyassah, the Kuwaiti newspaper now printed in exile in Saudi Arabia, which was flashed to traders by several different news services. In its Sunday issue, the paper said the dream story was being spread by Iraqi intelligence agents in Baghdad to prepare Iraqis for the idea of a pullout from Kuwait, although the implication of the wrongly deployed rockets is that the enemy is not Saudi Arabia but Israel.
 
View of Saudi Prince
 The statement by Prince Sultan, the Saudi Defense Minister, was also taken by the market to mean that the Saudis would like a territorial compromise by Kuwait. He raised the possibility of allowing Iraq to keep some Kuwaiti territory as an outlet on the Persian Gulf and has urged Arabs to seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis "through all means."
Similarly, in one version of the dream, the Prophet told Mr. Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, except from some coastal islands, which provide Iraq with access to the gulf. "It's convenient that Mohammed told him he could keep the islands," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an oil analyst at Pegasus Econometric Services of Hoboken, N.J.
"Right now the market is oriented toward an end to the whole crisis," said John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "It may turn out to be wrong, but that's the market orientation at the moment."
 
'Most Unlikely Scenario'
 At Merrill Lynch, Nauman Barakat, a trader, said, "Two weeks ago war seemed to be the most likely scenario, but at this stage war seems to be the most unlikely scenario."
With the "war premium" coming out of the price, the market will now focus on the suppy and demand for oil, he added, and on that basis, "it's difficult to make a case as to why the market should not be somewhere in the low- to mid-$20's."
Others disagreed, and some cautioned that a return to bellicose rhetoric could push prices back up again.
But if a settlement is reached and the embargo ends, "what happens if Iraq and Kuwait's production comes back on," said Robinson West of the Petroleum Finance Company. "Then the world is flooded with oil."
Consumers, meanwhile, should feel the impact soon, although the gasoline fall may be modest because gasoline never rose high enough to reflect peak crude prices.
In trading for delivery next month, wholsale unleaded gasoline fell 11.41 cents a gallon yesterday, to 76.5 cents, and heating oil dropped 12.42 cents, to 75.98 cents.
 
Slowness in Cuts Seen
 Mr. Lichtblau, of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said that gasoline never rose above a level consistent with $30-a-barrel oil, and that as a result, refiners and distributors had been operating unprofitably in recent weeks. If yesterday's price holds, he said, gasoline prices should fall about 3 cents a gallon, but he predicted that refiners and distributors would be slow to cut prices, in an effort to recoup past losses.
But "unbranded" stations that buy at a price pegged to the mercantile exchange price will once again be able to undercut branded outlets, he added.
Heating oil, which had risen higher, will fall in coming weeks as the peak heating season approaches, Mr. Lichtblau said.
In the meantime, the move downward in crude has meant large losses for anyone who bought at the peak. For the November contract the peak close was $40.40, on Oct. 9. Some companies that use oil buy futures contracts to assure themselves of supplies at a set price.
 
Velocity Increased
 But the desire to limit risk also increases the velocity with which prices change, some experts say. Robert Boslego, an oil analyst in Winchester, Mass., said that a company that had gone "long," buying a contract obligating it to take delivery of 10,000 barrels at $40 a barrel, would watch nervously as the price went to $30.
So the company might try to go "short," by taking out a contract in which it promises to deliver 10,000 barrels at $30, partly canceling out its original contract. Now, said Mr. Boslego, the company's risk is limited. If the price falls to $20, it could buy oil on the open market to meet the obligations of the new contract, and make a profit, so it has no risk of loss beyond the $10.
But the rush of companies trying to limit their risk that way creates a crowd of participants who want to sell oil cheaply, and that helps push prices down, Mr. Boslego added.

HEADLINE: Japanese Markets Rise With the Yen

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Japan's financial markets, battered in recent months by rising interest rates and the leap in oil prices, have received a lift from an unlikely source: a sharp appreciation in the value of the yen.
The rosier sentiment here in reaction to the resurgent yen indicates how much the Japanese have altered their economy since 1985, when the leading industrial nations began a conscious effort to push the dollar lower to ease America's yawning trade deficit. At that time, Japanese companies complained loudly as the yen soared and their products became more expensive overseas, reducing the exports on which the economy thrived.
But today, the markets have focused not on the negative impact a rising yen might have on exports, but on two big benefits: It has reduced Japan's bill for imported oil, which must be paid in dollars, providing considerable relief from soaring world energy prices in the wake of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, and it has permitted interest rates here to fall after a damaging yearlong surge.
 
 Bond Yield Drops
 The dollar has declined from 150 yen in mid-July to as low as 124.40 last Thursday in New York, a 17 percent tumble. Buffeted by fears of a recession and the budget crisis in Washington, the dollar, although up slightly the last two days to close at 126.02 today in New York, is edging toward its record low of 120.45, reached in January 1988.
The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year Government bond, meanwhile, has plummeted from 8.7 percent a month ago to 7.75 percent today, as the stronger yen has slightly reduced concerns about inflation. There is talk now that commercial banks may reduce their key long-term prime lending rate after steep increases in recent months.
That has revived the deeply troubled stock market, which has been through a severe slide, largely because of the higher cost of borrowing. The Nikkei stock average closed today at 25,070.86, up 2.4 percent, or 589.37 points. That still represents a 36 percent tumble from the beginning of the year, but it is also a steep increase from its low last month of nearly 20,000.
"You don't hear Japanese companies crying out the way they did when the dollar fell before," added Yoshihisa Kitai, aneconomist at the Long Term Credit Bank. "Japanese companies have already restructured their businesses to deal with this, and now you are seeing the result."
Until a few years ago, the weak yen had been a big source of economic strength for Japan, encouraging foreign buyers to purchase Japanese goods.
 
 Concern About the Dollar
 For the last few years, though, the Government has encouraged industries to cultivate the domestic market and invest heavily to increase productivity and to move more plants overseas.
Japanese Government officials are thus sanguine about the yen's strength, worrying only that it might rise too fast and disrupt the markets. "It is very interesting and telling that we hear very few complaints about the exchange rate," said a senior Government economic official. "It reflects the fact that companies have adapted."
Government and industry officials in Japan are more worried by the what the falling dollar signals about the United States. Many people blame the battle in Washington over the Federal budget and fears of a looming recession for an erosion of confidence in the American economy and American policy makers.
The message is that these officials have fewer concerns about their home market. Manufacturers have moved a significant portion of their factories overseas to avoid the impact of currency swings. Toyota, for instance, announced it was building a second auto plant in the United States, just one in a wave of such moves.
The Government has also shown some success in waking up the Japanese consumer and creating a boom at home that has eased further the reliance on exports. Retail sales have been expanding at a nearly double-digit rate this year, for instance. And a record level of capital investment by Japanese companies is providing a big impetus for economic growth.
On top of that, the dollar's tumble has offset part of the huge increase in crude oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
"If the dollar falls to 110 yen, then you could begin to see some problems, but most companies have already achieved the ability to deal well with the dollar at 120 yen," said Susumu Kato, the chief economist for Goldman Sachs (Japan).

HEADLINE: Connecticut Democrat Fights to Gather Voters

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRITAIN, Conn., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Over the blare of a country-and-western band at the Sergeant Sakowicz post of the Polish Legion of American Veterans, Representative Bruce A. Morrison shouted out a short history of Federal immigration law. Too short, as it turns out.
Pulled away by an aide for a dash back to the car and a race to the next campaign appearance, Mr. Morrison left his questioner, Thomas A. Bozek, unsatisfied with a partial answer on a topic about which Mr. Morrison is an acknowledged expert in Congress. 
 "He communicates face-to-face, he eyeballs you, he has command of an issue," Mr. Bozek said about his first encounter with Mr. Morrison, the Democratic nominee for governor. "But he's under pressure, obviously. I think he's crossed the 11th hour."
With only two weeks before the election, Mr. Morrison -- running third in a three-way race, according to opinion polls -- urgently needs to win over longtime Democrats like Mr. Bozek, a New Britain alderman and member of the party's Town Committee who remains uncommitted despite months of appeals.
And while a 10-minute appearance at a party of graying veterans maynot decide the election, neither did it succeed in enlisting the support of Mr. Bozek or his influence in this industrial suburb of Hartford. State party officials concede that such glancing blows have marked the Morrison campaign from the beginning.
"If I could figure out what it was, I would put my finger on it and change it," said the chairman of the party's State Central Committee, John F. Droney Jr. "There's just not as a strong an impression as should be made."
Party leaders insist that Mr. Morrison's message of economic revival and social responsibility, including a universal health-insurance plan that could be the first of its kind in the nation, is appealing to voters once they get a feel for it. The task for the final weeks, they say, is not to find a salable message, but to identify where the message can be driven home.
 
No Drawn-Out Discourse
 Some fault the breakneck pace of the Morrison campaign, which allows little time for dawdling or drawn-out discourse. Mr. Bozek, for example, drove to the next Morrison event to try and continue his discussion, but he was too late.
Mr. Droney said that the campaign's 30-second television spots have also yet to capture "the real Bruce." Mr. Droney said that television -- the crucible of today's campaigns -- may simply not be Mr. Morrison's best medium. The candidate is really "a lot warmer and a lot more likable and impressive," in real life, Mr. Droney said.
Mr. Morrison disputes any suggestion that his own campaign techniques may have done him an injustice by failing to get across his closely reasoned liberal critique of the state's economy and services. That critique differs dramatically from the generally conservative, hands-off approach of the Republican, Representative John G. Rowland, or the broadly stated themes of duty and responsibility that have marked the campaign of former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican who is running under the Connecticut Party banner.
Mr. Morrison argues, for example, that greater social involvement by the state -- especially on health care -- is one of the best ways to retain private employment because it would reduce the costs of doing business. He also favors restrictions on the authority of local communities to act independently of each other, especially on such issues as affordable housing, because he argues, integrated housing is the only way to integrate the schools.
"I had a different picture of him from TV, what I've read and from his own press releases," said George L. Geers, editor of The Chronicle, a small daily in Willimantic that Mr. Morrison visited on Monday to meet the editors and seek the paper's endorsement.
"I felt that there would be more of a formality, and with formality a sense of professional tension, but I didn't feel that," Mr. Geers said. "He was relaxed."
 
An Unaffiliated Voter
 In the Democratic party scenario for victory, people like Roger Gelinas loom large. Mr. Gelinas, a 50-year-old cemetary caretaker from Waterbury, stepped up to Mr. Morrison at the Polish Legion party and said he changed his mind and would vote for Mr. Morrison after all.
"I wasn't for you in the beginning -- I was for Weicker all the way," Mr. Gelinas said. "But Weicker is not opening his mouth about what he's going to do."
Mr. Gelinas, an unaffiliated voter since 1961, said later that he really didn't like some of Mr. Morrison's ideas at all -- especially the one about having a statewide referendum on the question of a personal income tax -- but that the other candidates were worse.
Mr. Morrison distressed some of his longtime liberal enthusiasts earlier this year when he said that an income-tax on wages -- for years a key plank in the progressive agenda -- would not be imposed by his administration unless voters approved a specific plan first. But Mr. Rowland vowed to veto any income-tax plan, as did Mr. Weicker, at least while the economy is in recession.
 
The Core Supporters
 Some other Democrats however, especially among the moderates who were the core supporters of Gov. William A. O'Neill, say that Mr. Morrison has not bowed to the center enough to win those voters to his side.
"We want a sharing, a balance between both ends of our party, liberal and conservative," Mr. Bozek said.
Other politicians say, however, that New Britain, with its strong union membership, political clubs and ethnic enclaves, is not really like much of the rest of the state. People here decide their votes on things other than television, said State Representative Dave Pudlin, a Democrat who represents the city in the General Assembly. Mr. Pudlin's example is that New Britain's voters went overwhelmingly for Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee for president in 1988.
"If you have to rely on those 15-second commercials, it must drive you nuts," he said. "I've never seen Bruce as an electronic candidate."

HEADLINE: A.T.&T. to Raise Weekend and Night Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
A.T.&T. said yesterday that it would raise its rates for night and weekend long-distance telephone calls, which are mostly made by residential customers.
The 2.2 percent price rise is scheduled to take effect on Nov. 2, and follows another small increase in night and weekend rates on Nov. 29 of last year. Together, the increases represent a reversal of a six-year pattern of falling prices for the cheapest long-distance calls, and some experts predict further rises. 
 Average long-distance rates have fallen steadily since the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984, and continue to do so in the highly competitive market for services offered to large business customers.
But residential customers have proved more reluctant than businesses to change long-distance carriers to save money, making it possible for the carriers to shift onto consumers slightly more of the cost of maintaining their equipment.
A.T.&T.'s night and weekend rate is in effect from 11 P.M. to 8 A.M. Sunday through Friday and on weekends until 5 P.M. on Sunday.
The Federal Communications Commission will review the planned rate increase, but approval is virtually automatic under new regulations adopted 15 months ago.
Yesterday's announcement drew immediate criticism from consumer groups, who have said the discount for night and weekend calls should be larger.
"It's being wiped out because A.T.&T. refuses to pass along its savings and the F.C.C. refuses to regulate a market that's not competitive," said Gene Kimmelman, the legislative director and telephone industry analyst at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington. "So we're stuck."
With the price increase scheduled for Nov. 2, the night and weekend rate discount from daytime prices will fall to 45 percent, from 60 percent in the years before and immediately after the breakup. A.T.&T.'s overall costs of providing service are dropping because new technologies have been developed, like fiber-optic cables, which use lasers to transmit many calls simultaneously through hair-thin strands of glass.
 
 60's Rates Held Too Low
 But some industry consultants say that the shrinking discount is justified, and that further increases in night and weekend rates are likely. A.T.&T. set the rates too low in the 1960's, to try to spread telephone traffic evenly between day and night, and has never raised them enough to cover costs fully, said William J. Baumol, a professor of economics at Princeton University and New York University who also does some consulting work for A.T.&T.
Before the breakup, it cost A.T.&T. almost nothing to handle extra calls in the evening and at night because it owned all the telephone network equipment and had few extra operating costs. But now, A.T.&T. must pay a fixed rate to local telephone companies for beginning and completing long-distance calls, and this rate does not vary with the time of day.
Merrill R. Tutton, A.T.&T.'s vice president for consumer services, said of the planned increase, "The change is necessary to bring prices in line with costs."
Mr. Tutton and other A.T.&T. marketing executives declined to discuss the price increase further. James D. Kowalski, a vice president for Federal regulatory affairs at A.T.&T., said the increase was consistent with a competitive marketplace.
 
 Reaching Federal Limit
 A.T.&T. will now be charging consumers the maximum allowed by Federal regulators for long-distance service. By comparison, the company's rates for inbound business calls, which mostly consist of toll-free 800 numbers that corporations rent, are 98.3 percent of the maximum, while outbound business calls are 97.8 percent of the limit, said Robert S. Nersesian, a spokesman.
The MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, which are A.T.&T.'s biggest long-distance rivals, are not subject to price regulation. The companies said they would study A.T.&T.'s move before responding, a process that U S Sprint said would take a week.
 
 5 Cents on a $16 Bill
 The A.T.&T. price rise will increase the company's annual revenues by $39.4 million, and add about 5 cents to the average $16 monthly long-distance telephone bill. But for a college student or other lower-income consumer who waits until after 11 P.M. on weekdays or calls on weekends and has a $50 monthly bill, the difference would be $1.10 a month, or $13.20 a year.
In a report to Congress last week, the F.C.C. defended its system of regulating A.T.&T.'s revenues from several large groups of services instead of regulating the price of each service. The study said that while the rates for some consumer services might have risen, such as weekend and night rates, the average residential consumer's cost of service had dropped 4.4 percent under the new rules.

HEADLINE: Negotiator's Quiet Style Elicits Loud Protest

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In negotiating his first city labor contract amid the city's worst financial troubles in years, Eric J. Schmertz, New York City's new chief negotiator, placed a premium on avoiding even a hint of incivility. But now Mr. Schmertz, an impartial mediator and arbitrator by training, finds that his nonconfrontational approach has offended just about everyone outside the municipal work force.
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch found the first settlement, with the teachers union, grounds for a personal attack. Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said it produced a contract the city could not afford and should repudiate. Even some administration officials say Mr. Schmertz gave away too much too soon and never forced the union to grapple with the city's yawning budget gap.
 
'Quiet Diplomat'
 
 Some of his critics question whether he has made the transition to partisan negotiator. For his part, Mr. Schmertz said he has no intention of changing his style or strategy. A dignified, soft-spoken man -- friends and doubters alike say descriptions like "quiet diplomat," "civilized" and "quietly cerebral," suit him as well as his tailored clothes and mane of white hair -- he said his unruffled bargaining approach is grounded in history and experience.
"I believe in working with the unions asproblem-solving partners," he said in an interview as he puzzled over the harsh reaction to the teachers' contract, which resulted in wage increases of 5.5 percent. "I don't believe in confrontational or devious bargaining, or sharp bargaining. I believe in honesty and openness. I am not going to radically change my persona."
A former dean of Hofstra University Law School on Long Island and one of the top labor arbitrators in the country, Mr. Schmertz honed his approach while solving more than 8,000 labor disputes.
"His history is essentially as a third-party arbitrator, a fact finder," said Raymond D. Horton, a business professor at Columbia University and research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by the business community. "Whether he has successfully made the transition to management representative: that is the question. The job of the labor negotiator is to represent the Mayor."
According to this view, rather than forcing the lowest cost settlement in a time of fiscal austerity, Mr. Schmertz cast himself as an intermediary. Operating with considerable independence, he set the tone for bargaining, decided what was fair and affordable and convinced Mayor David N. Dinkins to support an agreement over the objections of the city budget director. He said he listened to the unions and the administration voices and tried to find common ground.
"He's the only one in the administration I trust," said Barry Feinstein, the president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In the uproar following the teachers' settlement, Mr. Feinstein complained that the administration repeatedly repudiated settlement figures mentioned by Mr. Schmertz in informal talks.
 
Saw Koch as Confrontational
 Malcolm D. MacDonald, chairman of the New York City Board of Collective Bargaining and a friend, said: "He has a genius for finding the deal."
But his approach also bore the marks of what prompted an earlier brush with city government. Eight years ago, Mayor Koch stripped him of several prestigious and lucrative arbitration posts and blackballed him from appointments for ruling against the city in several high-profile cases.
After that, Mr. Schmertz became increasing uneasy with what he saw as Mr. Koch's confrontational style. When he became chief negotiator, he said, he vowed to do things differently.
Concluding that the city's budget director had too much say in negotiations in the Koch administration, Mr. Schmertz set out to limit that role. One budget official, who for years had sat in on talks, costing out proposals and occasionally raising technical objections, was banned from the table this year by Mr. Schmertz.
 
Within Days, Talk of Layoffs
 "Certainly the negotiator and the Mayor need to know what things cost and what affects the budget," Mr. Schmertz said. "But I don't think the budget director should be the arbiter of how the city bargains, or what the city is ultimately prepared to do."
The deal with the United Federation of Teachers, in the view of many critics, accommodated the narrow concerns of each side but not the broader concerns about the city's fiscal health.
The settlement was reached in late-night bargaining after Sandra Feldman, the teachers union president, set a strike deadline and threatened to shut down the schools.
Asked if the threat was the kind of confrontational bargaining he abhors, Mr. Schmertz said: "Well, it may have been confrontational on her part."
Within days, Mayor Dinkins began discussing layoffs in public, bond-rating agencies sounded alarms, editorials called on the administration to rescind the increase in wages and benefits and Mr. Koch began attacking.
 
Thanks 'for the Schmertz'
 "I have now turned Schmertz into a verb and a noun," the former Mayor said. "If you have been abused, we say you have been Schmertzed. If you get an unwarranted and undeserved payment from the City of New York, you say, 'Thank you Mr. Mayor, for the Schmertz.' "
All this astounded Mr. Schmertz, who believed the settlement had neatly skirted budget concerns. He agreed to increases larger than the 1.5 percent called for in the city budget only if they were financed by other savings.
But the city's outside fiscal monitors said other savings ought to be used to reduce the city's budget gap.
"Maybe we did not do a good public-relations job in its portrayal," Mr. Schmertz said. "If you focus on the expenditure of money from the city budget, this is the least expensive settlement in the history of labor settlements in New York City."
 
Private and Public Unions
 On the budget gap, he said that while he knew the city was in trouble, "I was not completely up to speed on the timing of it."
Mr. Schmertz believes there is a fundamental difference between public and private unions. In the private sector, where strikes are lawful and costs can be passed to consumers, he said, "the economic struggle is part of the bargaining." But in city government, where strikes are prohibited, unions should be seen as the city's partners.
Other experts disagree. "I think the process is the same," said Edward Silver, a labor lawyer and member of the Board of Collective Bargaining.
Mr. Schmertz, who is 64 years old, took on the job as the city's $110,000-a-year Labor Relations Commissioner at a time many other people consider retirement. He had traveled across the country, commanded fees of $600 a day and earned upward of $500,000 a year.
 
Maybe a Diplomat or a Ballplayer
 His return to New York City was a kind of vindication, a return from "suburban exile" at Hofstra, he said.
A founding member of the three-member New York City Board of Collective Bargaining, which was set up in 1967 to oversee contract disputes and impasses, Mr. Schmertz served on the board for 15 years, until Mr. Koch refused to reappoint him. Once, while arbitrating a dispute with the firefighters, Mr. Schmertz worked on a fire truck to better understand their concerns.
Mr. Koch said he forced Mr. Schmertz out because he favored the unions over the city. Mr. Schmertz said he was punished for following his conscience, the law and contract language.
Born in New York City and reared in the suburbs, Mr. Schmertz's first ambition was to be a diplomat, though he might have been an infielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who offered him a contract after watching him play at New Rochelle High School.
 
A Different Process
 Instead, after serving in the Navy in World War II, he worked for several unions as a labor relations director for a subsidiary of the General Cable Corporation, went to law school and in 1962 went into private practice as an arbitrator and mediator.
While most of his experience has been as an arbitrator, Mr. Schmertz said he has conducted some negotiations, though never on the vast scale of New York City's collective bargaining.
Despite the outcry over the teachers' settlement, he said, he does not plan to change his approach in continuing talks with two other municipal unions representing workers ranging from cooks to engineers. Before the uproar, Mr. Schmertz had discussed settlements with the other unions only slightly lower than the deal with teachers.
But the process may be different. Mayor Dinkins has assigned the budget director, Philip R. Michael, to sit with Mr. Schmertz as an equal partner at the bargaining table.
"I don't believe the city is going to make an offer without Michael and Schmertz agreeing to it," said Albert Scardino, the Mayor's press secretary.

Cost Trade-Offs On Medical Care

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
PARTICIPANTS in the struggle with balloon ing health-care costs are under pressure to accept some kind of change. Congress is tightening regulation on physicians and considering new controls on private health insurance for the elderly. Many employers who provide health benefits for workers favor special taxes on businesses that do not do so. Advocates of publicly financed health insurance, meanwhile, blame the medical profession and private insurers for the system's problems.
Trying to shape the debate, and perhaps deflect some criticism along the way, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is sponsoring a survey of employers, union executives, health professionals, insurers and Government regulators. Representatives of each group were asked if they would be willing to make sacrifices "as part of a total plan in which everyone made some concessions." 
 The survey, conducted by Louis Harris & Associates, asked doctors, for example, if they would accept lower incomes if there could be less regulation and second-guessing by insurers, and limits on malpractice lawsuits. Unions were asked if they would trade a portion of workers' health benefits for higher wages. Employers were asked if they would accept Government requirements and controls in a national health insurance system.
Hospital executives were asked if they would trade lower revenues for assurances of fewer empty beds. Insurers were asked if they would accept the costs of restoring affordable coverage for uninsured workers and people with pre-existing health conditions. Everyone in the survey was asked about attitudes toward rationing of health care and/or arrangements that limit a patient's choice of doctors, which insurers call managed care. Spokesmen for some of the interested parties generally welcomed the concept of trade-offs and concessions. But perhaps not surprisingly, they had widely varying opinions about who should be asked to make which concessions.
"I see value in the idea of feeling out the major sectors of our society," said John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Workers International Union and chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. national health-care committee. "It is a measure of the momentum that is being created for reform of the health-care system." He added: "We know that employers are going to have a different view than the labor movement. We are not going to give up a basic right that all Americans have to health care."
Sharon Canner, an assistant vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that most employers opposed Government mandates. But she added: "Looking at economic trade-offs is a very worthwhile and realistic approach. We've been saying that everyone is going to have to give."
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, said that many doctors would willingly "trade less money for more automony" and reduced regulation by Government and private insurers. If there were less paperwork, he added, doctors would need fewer office assistants and could thus reduce their fees. He said health costs were often inflated when doctors provide care for "extraneous reasons" like concerns about lawsuits, decisions by courts and pressure by special-interest groups.
Edward J. Connors, a former chairman of the American Hospital Association and president of Mercy Health Services in Farmington Hills, Mich., said priority should be given to "access to affordable care for all who need it." Access should take precedence over "other needs and demands or biases of the provider system," he added.
Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris, said the survey was trying "to explore how a consensus might build" on causes and solutions for health-care problems. "If the solution was painless, we wouldn't need a consensus," he added.
"We are going to see some insurance reform, in the small-employer market," said John D. Moynihan, an executive vice president at Metropolitan Life, which paid $500,000 for the survey. "There is a great deal that private employers, unions, doctors have to do. The Government will have to share the load." He said Medicaid for the indigent "is in a shambles."
Ms. Canner of the manufacturers association noted that the survey asked employers, among other things, if they would accept managed care. "Metropolitan is obviously selling managed care," she said. Mr. Moynihan acknowledged that results of the survey, which are due early next year, will have business uses. "The survey might say the American public won't stand for managed care," he said. "If so, we need to know that."
"Everybody seems to agree that the health-care system needs to be fixed," Mr. Moynihan said. "As important and complex as the national health system is, we get nervous when we hear strident voices shrieking for instant reform in Congress. We want to get at the issues and fix them, but not in a crisis mode."

Retainer Fees for Management Recruiters

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
MANY management recruiting firms have been developing a new way to stabilize their revenues, by encouraging client companies to pay retainer fees.
The firms have been doing this quietly in recent years for competitive reasons, but with recession concerns deepening, it is becoming more and more prevalent. 
 Management recruiters want to refashion themselves along the lines of law firms that collect retainer fees from their clients, promoting a close and enduring relationship.
Accountants also work on this principle, with long-term relations helping to produce auditing and tax advisory income on a regular basis. Public relations consultants also rely on retainers.
David M. Richardson, executive vice president of DHR International Inc., a sizable management recruiting firm based in Chicago, with half a dozen offices around the country, calls this growing trend in his business "partnering."
"It amounts to getting some capital and solidifying relationships in these difficult times," he said. "For the client, it can mean putting together a package with lower fees. It brings both closer together." It also can help the client company through more flexible manpower planning.
He named Scientific-Atlanta Inc., an electronics company, as a client with which his firm has had a retainer relationship in the past, as well as Nabisco Brands Inc., the big food unit of RJR Nabisco Inc.
David R. Peasback, president and chief executive officer of Canny, Bowen Inc., a major management recruiter based in New York City that specializes in searches for senior-level executives, confirmed that his firm also had such arrangements, calling the practice a "very good idea" and a growing trend.
Mr. Richardson traces "partnering" as a basic management concept back at least to the early 1980's, when companies with "specific needs for goods or services" tried to make long-term deals about prices and delivery with their suppliers.
However, it probably goes back much earlier, perhaps more than 50 years, to the Sears, Roebuck-type of tradition of contracting to take a large part or all of the production of appliance makers for products to be sold under the Sears label.
Buyers of goods or services, Mr. Richardson said, want long-term price or fee stability, along with guaranteed quality and flexibility as to delivery as well as a better understanding of their continuing needs. Sellers, or providers of services, want longer-term assurance of how much they can sell or how much service they will supply, as well as an awareness of the delivery needs of customers.
Mr. Richardson explained how the approach works in management recruiting: a company might pay an annual retainer of $100,000 to a management recruiting firm for a year's service. For this, the management recruiting firm would not only fill the specific requests from the client firm for executives needed, but also provide additional advisory services, as well as keeping in mind the type of people that would fit well into that organization. To do this, Mr. Richardson said, the recruiter would also be expected to learn as much as possible about the client's overall organization, which can be a significant fact-finding process in this period of downsizings, acquisitions and decentralization.
For example, Mr. Richardson said, a recruiter for a bank might know that even though the bank had no current opening for a certain position, it wanted officers with a particular personality, public image, educational background and experience. In other words, it was interested in meeting potential candidates who would fit into the bank's corporate culture.
When such a candidate appeared or was discovered during a routine search by the firm, the recruiter might suggest that an interview would be useful for both the bank, with the idea that this is "your type person," and for the candidate, with the thought that "this is your type of company." Obviously, this widens the market for some middle managers seeking job changes.
Meantime, the $100,000 would be in the recruiter's bank account assuring the recruiting firm that it could count on that much business from a particular client company during a year.
As searches were completed, the amount on hand would be reduced by the usual fee due for that job Since the fees of recruiters run about 33 percent of salaries received, the $100,000 would cover about three searches a year for managers placed in jobs earning about $100,000, unless special lower fee arrangements were made.
Lester B. Korn, the chairman of Korn/Ferry International, the nation's largest management recruiting firm, talked about the concept of retainers recently at a meeting of consultants, saying that "sophisticated" human resource executives nowadays seek long-term relationships with management recruiters.
He agrees that one reason is to promote "in-depth knowledge" of a client's operation and its particular culture. The retainer idea also ties in neatly with the desire of many recruiting firms to expand into consulting services regarding compensation levels and job fitness.
However, there may be some drawbacks to the idea of retainer fees. For example, large recruiting firms like Korn/Ferry probably can persuade large client companies to pay retainers, but the small, more localized management recruiters probably cannot extract retainers from clients as easily. Often the small firms handle one-shot assignments for smaller companies in their area.

Just when you thought the Reagan years were over, deregulation has reared its avaricious head. The friendly folks from Gulf and Western, or whatever that corporation is calling itself these days, are raising prices right through the renovated rafters.
The management of Madison Square Garden is planning to tell loyal Rangers fans and loyal Knicks fans, who have not been rewarded with a championship since 1940 and 1973, respectively, that their services are no longer required, at least not at anything approaching the current rates. 
 The plan for the 1991-92 season is to sell as many as 2,200 courtside or rinkside seats for as much as $70 per game. This means that "Missed Foul Shots" will soon soar beyond the price range of "Miss Saigon."
Taking a cue from the Left Coast, the Garden may also sell a few front-row "celebrity" seats for $300 apiece to those who like to display their cellular phones and gold watches and designer girlfriends in front of millions.
But let us not conjure up a populist diatribe about real fans being driven out by bloodless richies. Instead, let us envision Jack Nicholson, the Joker, all decked out in yellows and purples and the latest hipster shades, cavorting at courtside at the Forum, which is in the state of Los Angeles. Jack knows the game. And he pays $450 a pop for the right to interact with Magic Johnson.
"Nice socks," Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once told Nicholson in the middle of a roaring fast break.
Nicholson figures he has been worth a game or two over the years, by distracting rabbit-ear coaches like Dick Motta and flashing his malevolent smile, or worse, on the likes of Larry Bird.
In recent years, the Garden has been trying to imitate the celebrity row of the Forum, with a short row of seats that Richard Evans has monitored with the intensity of Jimmy Carter peering out the White House window to see who was using the tennis court.
It is always exciting to see the latest hot singer or the latest boxing contender preening in the front row, and it is fascinating to wonder what Spike Lee and Tom Brokaw would have said if they had spoken while sitting next to each other. ("Love your work." "Oh, no, love your work.")
But the Garden got it wrong. It gave away the celebrity seats. (The lunkheads who misrun the United States Open got it even more wrong. Charismatic Wilt Chamberlain stuck his long body in the front row and the nabobs ran him off.) Still, there is a principle involved here: People do not value what they get for free. If you make 'em pay for it, there's a $300 customer born every minute.
It used to be that big money drove out the good fans. Back when life was normal and the World Series used to be held in the hazy sunshine of Yankee Stadium every October, well-connected gents in camel's hair jackets with pomade lathered on their heads used to frequent the Stadium for the first and only time that season.
They were heavy hitters, but they did not know much about heavy hitting, and would often ooh when they should have ahhed, or sometimes leave in the seventh inning of Don Larsen's perfect game to beat the traffic.
But in this television age, sports have become ever more important. One of the little-known facts about the Garden is that many of the people, if I may generalize, in the upper deck are actually chief executive officers of major corporations.
It's true. They have taken to the blue seats, in raffish camaraderie, chanting vicious diatribes at Denis Potvin (who hasn't played in years, but you never know) and occasionally breaking up the furniture and throwing live fish onto the ice. The anonymity of the blue seats enables these c.e.o.'s to behave as aggressively at the arena as they do in the board room.
Now, however, these big-timers are faced with a serious decision. Even with a recession coming on, it is going to be a matter of prestige to come up with the 300 smackers for the privilege of having Patrick Ewing come hurtling right at them in pursuit of a loose ball. (The danger is not as strong from some of the other Knicks.)
After all, somebody has got to pay for the $200 million renovations at the Garden, which the friendly folks mandated rather than build a threatened new Garden out on the Far West Side, last decade's bad idea.
Unfortunately, the price hike will force many of the humble current $45 patrons to join that legendary recipient of the bad freebies, Bob Uecker, in the upper deck.
There is a positive side to this shakeout. If the Rangers should level off, or one Ewing ankle sprain should turn the Knicks into the Charlotte Hornets, the biggies will not want to be intimately associated with a loser.
At that point, the worldly ushers of our town, as they do at the United States Open and Shea Stadium, will be glad to help you out if you help them out. Back in Odessa, they call it a second economy. In the coming hard times, we may need all the economy we can get.

Are Auto Payouts Likely to Be Cut?

BYLINE: Doron P. Levin

 BODY:
THE depressed state of the Big Three auto makers' shares is sparking a debate among analysts over whether investors now have an opportunity to reap unusually attractive dividends.
The bullish perspective focuses on the relatively strong financial positions and liquidity of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler as evidence that auto makers will be able to pay dividends, despite prolonged softness in vehicle sales. 
 The bears argue that historical trends pertaining to recessions make dividend cuts inevitable. Indeed, current low share prices suggest that many investors already see dividends as vulnerable.
Late last month, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. polled 22 analysts about their assessment of dividend cuts by the auto makers. The analysts rated the probability of G.M.'s cutting the dividend at an average of 20 percent; the average odds of a Ford cut were 23 percent. At Chrysler, the weakest of the three, the average odds were 55 percent.
All three stocks are trading just above their year's lows and well under their highs. Ford closed yesterday at 32, compared with a range for the year of 29 3/8 to 49 1/8; G.M. at 38 3/4, compared with 35 to 50 1/2, and Chrysler at 11 5/8, compared with 9 1/8 to 20 3/8. At those prices, G.M.'s yield is 7.9 percent, Ford's is 9.6 percent and Chrysler's is a whopping 10.8 percent. Those yields compare with the 8.75 percent yield on 30-year Treasury bonds and 7.2 percent on short-term Treasury securities.
Analysts agree that a long and fierce Persian Gulf war would have negative consequences for the economy, for energy supplies and, thus, for auto sales, which far outweigh military contractsfor all three companies. The question, insofar as dividends are concerned, is how quickly managements would act to conserve cash.
"In the event of a serious military outbreak, dividends would have to be called into question," said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco. "But there won't be many places to hide in the stock market if that happens."
There is general agreement that G.M., as the biggest and financially strongest auto maker, would be the last to cut a dividend. David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, rates G.M. stock a buy, partly because its yield compares with the yields of Government securities while offering substantial opportunity for growth. He said he believes dividends are safe unless an economic downturn endures for two years. But he also conceded that investors would face less risk by investing in Treasury bonds.
Analysts agree that Chrysler's stock presents the biggest risk. While adequately financed for the next 18 months, Chrysler's bonds and commercial paper ratings have dropped, making the auto maker potentially more reliant on bank financing in the future. Mr. Glantz said bankers could suggest cutting the dividend as a condition for extending credit lines.
Charles Brady, automotive analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, argued that Chrysler could make a case for keeping its dividend at almost any cost. "The effect on the financial community would be minimal, but the unsophisticated consumermay view this as Chrysler going out of business and not buy a car," he said. "The company could lose 35,000 sales, costing more than it saves if it cuts the dividend."
Ford's dividend should be safe, Mr. Brady added, if the company abides by its own preachings. He said, "A few years ago people were knocking Ford because they weren't paying out more of their earnings, but Ford said, 'We set our dividend policy based on sustainability -- good times, bad times, come what may.' "
Mr. Glantz also contended that Ford's dividend was secure. He pointed out that Ford had reduced the dividend only three times since it became a public company in 1956, each time when its net cash balance -- cash and marketable securities minus debt -- was lower than his forecast for the end of 1991.
But Ann Knight, automotive analyst for Paine Webber, predicted that a recession lasting more than six months would result in a dividend cut at all three auto makers. "Managements are more committed to maintaining dividends, but things aren't so substantially different than they were in the past," she said. She is not recommending any of the Big Three stocks as a buy.
An important clue to a company's dividend policy is the chief executive's latest statement on the subject.
Harold A. (Red) Poling, Ford's chairman, said on Sept. 28: "I would not characterize our dividend as vulnerable. Should a dramatic change happen that we can't foresee today, there might need to be an adjustment."
Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said in late August that "all good companies go through periods where they don't earn enough to cover the dividend and keep paying it anyway." On May 17, he said Chrysler would maintain the dividend "short of a nuclear disaster."
G.M. declined comment.

Moody's Lowers Its Ratings On American Air and Delta

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Ratings have been lowered on about $6 billion of outstanding debt issued by the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines Inc., Moody's Investors Service announced yesterday.
Among the reasons cited by Moody's were higher costs of jet fuel, softer travel demand and heavy investment in modernization and expansion. 
 The lowering of AMR's ratings affects about $3.5 billion in long- and short-term securities. Moody's cited "the expectation for reduced financial flexibility in light of the outlook for lower earnings during a period of very substantial capital spending by the airline subsidiary."
Moody's said that a reduced cash flow would result in a deterioration in the company's credit quality and higher risk for creditors as borrowings and off-balance-sheet lease obligations increase and the coverage of interest rates payments and fixed charges diminish.
 
 Large Investments for Hubs
 Despite the present concern, the rating agency expects American to retain its strong competitive position in the mid-1990's and beyond. In recent years the carrier has invested heavily in establishing domestic hubs for both domestic and international traffic.
AMR's industrial revenue bond rating was lowered to A-3 from A-2 and senior unsecured debt to Baa-1 from A-3. The rating on American Airlines' pass-through certificates, secured equipment certificates and industrial revenue bonds was lowered to A-2 from A-1, while the subordinated debenture rating was reduced to Baa-1 from A-3 and the commercial paper rating to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
The rating change on Delta debt is the result of a deteriorating outlook for earnings caused by higher jet fuel prices, a drop in domestic air travel, and the airline's spending plans to expand in the United States and overseas, the rating agency said.
It expects the airline's expenditures for modernization, fleet expansion and the addition of Asian and European cities to its international routes to place a strain on the debt protection for creditors.
Delta's secured equipment trust certificates and those secured equipment trust certificates that are filed under Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Commission, requiring less information, were lowered to A-2 from A-1, while the senior unsecured debt and industrial revenue bond ratings were dropped to A-3 from A-2. The commercial paper rating was also reduced, to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
Despite the downgrading, Moody's analysts said Delta was positioning itself to become a global competitor in the mid-1990's and had allied itself in the last year with other operators like Swissair and Singapore Airlines through a mutual purchase of stock.

HEADLINE: Net Off 39% at Tribune Co.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Tribune Company said today that its third-quarter net income declined 39 percent because of operating losses at its Canadian paper mills and The Daily News in New York.
The company said net income fell to $38.2 million, or 52 cents a share, from $62.7 million, or 81 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Revenues slipped five-tenths of 1 percent, to $588 million, from $590.7 million a year earlier.
Newspaper operating profit fell 15 percent in the quarter, to $48.4 million, from $56.7 million last year, because of losses at The Daily News. The company attributed the losses at The Daily News to weak economic conditions in the New York market and a "burdensome cost structure" that is the subject of labor negotiations.
Profits for the rest of the newspaper group, which includes The Chicago Tribune and The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel, were down slightly, the company said.
For the third quarter, the company's Quebec and Ontario Paper Company reported a loss of $8.3 million, compared with a profit of $15.2 million last year. Strikes by paper workers shut down the Quebec newsprint mill for 31 days and the Ontario mill for 47 days.
Beside its newspapers and newsprint operations, the Chicago-based company is engaged in broadcasting and entertainment production. The Tribune Company's stock gained 75 cents today, to $35.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: 'Anti-Incumbent Fever' Threatens Oregon Senator

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 22

 BODY:
Nowhere in the country is the nation's sour political mood being tested more directly this year than in Oregon.
Voters here are struggling to decide whether they are so angry at Washington that they want to throw out of office a Senator they have known and elected for a very long time.
Mark O. Hatfield, who after 24 years in the Senate is the body's second-ranking Republican, is in danger of losing his seat to a businessman named Harry Lonsdale, a newcomer to politics who in this year of political discontent is running the quintessential example of an outsider campaign. 
 With the mild manners of Mr. Smith before he went to Washington and the us-versus-them language of Huey Long, Mr. Lonsdale has used a sophisticated advertising campaign against Mr. Hatfield, describing the Senator as a tool of the timber industry and a defender of dumpers of toxic waste and other special interests who fill his coffers with campaign contributions.
"The rich and powerful are robbing us blind, and the politicians in Washington are not doing a thing to stop them," Mr. Lonsdale says in a television advertisement. "They've taken too many special interest dollars for too long. I'm running for the Senate because it's time for new blood and fresh thinking. It's time someone said no to special interests and fought for the rest of us."
 
'Sound Bites to Survive'
 Mr. Lonsdale's success with this appeal has forced Mr. Hatfield, a 68-year-old bookish iconoclast who had clung to the belief that town meetings were more effective than poll takers and negative advertisements, to do something he never thought he would do: run an aggressive television campaign with commercials attacking Mr. Lonsdale.
"Now, apparently, we have to talk in 30-second sound bites to survive," he told his advertising man, Ron Schmidt, after a screening of Mr. Lonsdale's advertisements a few days ago.
"This is the first major election in anybody's memory in which the virus of negative campaigning that we've seen in other areas has invaded Oregon," Mr. Hatfield said. "It's a new experience for me."
 
Not the First Troubles
 Mr. Hatfield has had troubles before, but has always risen above them. In the midst of his 1984 campaign newspapers disclosed his wife had received a real estate fee from a client with interests before the Senate. But the charge, which might have brought down many other politicians, turned into nothing more than a minor embarrassment after Mr. Hatfield and his wife came to Oregon and apologized.
A number of prominent Oregon Democrats, including Representative Ron Wyden, looked closely a year ago at possibility of challenging Mr. Hatfield and decided they could not beat him. That opened the way for Mr. Lonsdale to take the party's nomination.
An accumulation of criticisms, including one that Mr. Hatfield has not been in the state enough and another that his chief of staff took junkets on tax money, would surely have weakened him this year. But Tim Hibbitts, an Oregon poll taker, said Mr. Hatfield was not really in any danger of losing until he got caught up in the rising anger against Washington in just the last few weeks.
"The fundamental problem is we have got an anti-incumbent fever sweeping the state," he said.
 
Lonsdale Leading in Poll
 Mr. Hatfield said polls by his campaign showed his support had been shored up after he began responding to Mr. Lonsdale's advertisements. But a poll taken by Mr. Hibbitts and broadcast tonight by KATU-TV of Portland found Mr. Lonsdale ahead for the first time, 50 percent to 44 percent.
In that poll, 608 likely voters were surveyed by telephone over the weekend. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points. More than half of those surveyed said they thought Mr. Hatfield should be replaced, but not because they really favored Mr. Lonsdale. Forty-two percent said they still had no clear opinion of Mr. Lonsdale.
By all accounts, Mr. Hatfield, who is widely remembered as an early opponent of the Vietnam War and is still the closest thing mainstream American politics has to a pacifist, was slow to realize how much trouble he was in, or, at least, slow to respond.
"The wake-up call," as a spokesman for Mr. Hatfield called it, came when The Oregonian, the state's largest newspaper, published a poll that was taken after a wave of Lonsdale commercials and showed that Mr. Lonsdale had closed to within a few points of Mr. Hatfield.
 
'From 1965 to 1990'
 Suddenly, one of the institutions of the Senate, the former chairman of the appropriations committee and now its ranking Republican, was faced with the toughest fight of his career.
Mr. Hatfield, who has never spent more than a few thousand dollars on television before, authorized a full-scale counterattack, taking his campaign "from 1965 to 1990 in the space of three weeks," as one member of his political staf described it.
The most compelling illustration of this shift involved some former employees of Mr. Lonsdale's company, Bend Research, a small scientific products company. They had tried to give Mr. Hatfield's office derogatory information about Mr. Lonsdale's company months ago but were turned away. Two weeks ago they were called back by the altered Hatfield campaign and their allegation that the company dumped waste water with toxic chemicals has now been used in a commercial.
While he had been active in an environmental group that sought to preserve the forests, a group Mr. Hatfield's campaign describes as "radical," Mr. Lonsdale was unknown to most state residents six months ago, before his television campaign.
 
Support From Establishment
 The state's political establishment has rallied around Mr. Hatfield. The former chief of staff to Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt moved into the Hatfield headquarters to run the campaign. Bob Packwood, the state's other Republican Senator, sent his chief of staff to help out, too.
This blurring of partisan lines is less remarkable here than it might be in an eastern state where party divisions run deeper. But it is also a testament to the sense that this state's business and political communities have of Mr. Hatfield and his seniority in Washington as an important state resource. Still, this closing of ranks could play into Mr. Lonsdale's hands and Mr. Hatfield acknowledged that his opponent has touched a nerve with that appeal.
In many places around America, this anger at Washington is more an abstraction, something voters can use to vent their anger without really doing anything. But here in Oregon they are being forced to measure their disenchantment against a real person.
Denis Long, a Republican and president of the Kiwanis in North Bend, a timber port on the Oregon coast, said he had known Mark Hatfield since the 1960's, but was sympathetic now to Mr. Lonsdale's criticism of him.
"I've got a big problem with the fact that these guys are back there and it's like a good-old-boys society," said Mr. Long. "You vote yourself a pay raise. You don't really solve problems; you just kind of shuffle it onto some of the junior people that are in your committee. 'Let's have a study and after we're done studying that, let's study the study.' "
 
Abortion and Timber
 But two other issues are also complicating Mr. Hatfield's campaign. One is abortion, which he opposes, although he tries to place his opposition in a broader context of support for family planning, contraception and counseling. Mr. Lonsdale supports access to abortion, clearly the more popular position in the state.
The other issue is timber. Asked why he got into the race, Mr. Lonsdale replies, "The trees." He says he never expected to win, but hoped he could force Mr. Hatfield to embrace much tougher restrictions on logging in the old, mature forests.
Mr. Hatfield has long sought a middle ground that would keep the timber industry in business while calming environmentalists.
But while timber remains a crucial industry here, the number of people directly employed in it has shrunk as high technology industry in the Portland suburbs has boomed.
"The growth has been among people who look at a clear cut and don't see jobs," explained David Sarasohn, associate editor of The Oregonian. That means growing numbers of voters are attracted to Mr. Lonsdale's policy of curbing logging.
 
Anger Not Seen Before
 While timber and abortion are important, this race is turning on the voters' anger. "I've been in the political arena here for 20 years and I've not seen anything like it at all," said Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Hatfield's advertising consultant.
Workers with Mr. Hatfield's campaign said they believed they were in trouble if the choice was, as Mr. Lonsdale presented it, between someone from Washington and someone who is not from Washington. But they said they could win if they could focus the voters on a choice between Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Lonsdale.
So the Hatfield campaign is trying to sow as many doubts about Mr. Lonsdale as quickly as it can. One television commercial cites a series of apparent uncertainties by Mr. Lonsdale about issues and asks, "Could Harry be over his head?" Another quotes the charges from former employees that Mr. Lonsdale's company dumped toxic wastes. In the meantime, Mr. Hatfield says he is philosophical about his struggle to regain the faith of a state he has represented for so long.
"I have to recognize this is a unique period of time with the fear about possible recession, the potential of war hanging over our heads, the demonstration of such paralysis in the Congress," he said. "I'm not going to overreact, to feel the people of Oregon have abandoned me or been seduced by the media."

Small Budget, Small Star, Big Hit

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22

 BODY:
In a year that has been unkind to action movies with big names and big budgets, one movie with neither, "Marked for Death," seems marked for success. Made for a mere $12 million by two independent producers, this violent tale of vengeance has earned $29 million since its release on Oct. 5, including an opening weekend at the box office that was the second best ever for a fall film release.
As a movie, "Marked for Death"is little more than a cavalcade of shooting, stabbing, beheading and bone-cracking. Starring Steven Seagal, a martial arts expert with meager acting experience, the movie has received largely negative reviews. But as a commodity and an exercise in successful formula film making, the movie has quickly earned the admiration and the envy of studio executives here, all of whom are acutely aware they could not possibly have made the movie for the same price. 
 Producers say it costs $25 million on average to make a movie in Hollywood these days. But elaborate special effects and salaries of more than $10 million a picture for proven stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone have driven the cost of the big action-adventure films of 1990, like "Total Recall" and "Robo Cop 2," beyond $40 million and, in some cases, even $60 million.
The big film studios "went crazy this summer," said Martin Baum, a longtime agent at the Creative Artists Agency. "They made a decision that the more you spend, the more business you do, and in all probability, they were wrong," he said. Mr. Baum represents Mark Victor and Michael Grais, the independent producers who wrote and made "Marked for Death" with their company, Victor & Grais Productions.
The strong initial box-office performance of "Marked for Death," Mr. Baum added, teaches that "you don't always have to spend more money to do the business. You can do the same business at a lesser cost factor if you provide the audience with the basic elements it looks for: fun, escapism, likability of the character and killing that is not wanton and gratuitous."
In "Marked for Death," Mr. Seagal, in his trademark ponytail, plays a Federal drug agent who returns to the peace and quiet of his small hometown. Needless to say, it doesn't stay that way for long. A gang of Jamaican crack dealers turns up to sell their wares, much to the hero's annoyance. The movie is rated R. The producers say Mr. Seagal adds a bonus in that he also appeals to women.
 
 Large Risks Taken
 Of course there were considerable risks in building "Marked for Death" around Mr. Seagal, a former martial arts instructor whose students include the chairman of the Creative Artists Agency, Michael Ovitz. Mr. Seagal had acted in only two movies. When Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais met him, Mr. Seagal had only recently put aside the aikido self-defense academy he owns here to make his film debut in "Above the Law," which did only modest business in theaters.
But Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais, who wrote the 1982 hit "Poltergeist" and wrote and produced "Poltergeist II," said they decided to "go for the gold" after seeing "Above the Law" in 1988 and concluding that Mr. Seagal had all the qualities to be a major action-adventure star.
Once it was clear that Mr. Seagal was available for about $1 million -- double his previous fee but a pittance by studio standards -- and a percentage of the film's gross, the producers were confident they could make "Marked for Death" at half the standard cost.
"We don't want to make this movie for $20 million because if we do, I'm never going to see any money in my own pocket," Mr. Victor said. "Beyond that, we only had $10 million, and I didn't want to get another private investor to put up $5 million more, because then I have an owner and another boss involved in the game."
Mr. Victor said he and Mr. Grais, who are both 42 years old and have been friends since their grade school days together in Highland Park, Ill., initially shopped the "Marked for Death" script around to several studios. At least one indicated it would be interested in someone other than Mr. Seagal in the lead role. But most of the established stars of action-adventure movies want big money up front in salary and a guaranteed share of the gross revenues. They are reluctant to accept "back end" profit-sharing deals with smaller independent producers.
"The difficult part is getting access to major stars, because everything is catered to and handled by the studio and the comfort levels are exceedingly high," Mr. Victor said. "When you are having those huge numbers flashed at you it's hard to sit back and say, 'O.K., I'm going to let somebody go and put it together a different way.' "
The same is true of established directors, who can also command huge fees and a percentage off the top. With that in mind, Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais turned to Dwight H. Little, who had directed the low-budget "Halloween 4" and was hoping to advance his career and land something more ambitious.
"A director of stature can go in knowing he can get $3 million to $5 million for his services with a gross deal that kicks in from the first dollar," Mr. Baum said. "He's going to say: 'Why should I gamble? I'm a proven commodity, and there's no reason for me to do this for nothing.' "
 
Impressed by First Film
 With Mr. Seagal under contract, 20th Century Fox proved willing to supply a $10 million advance on foreign theatrical and domestic video rights. Fox executives were impressed that Mr. Seagal's first effort had sold more than 200,000 copies in video, which they saw as proof he had a potential mass audience.
"It was a gut feeling that the marketplace was thirsty for a hero, that it was looking for someone to fill the Arnold Schwarzenegger gap," said Tom Sherak, head of marketing at the studio. "Arnold is the king of that genre, but he is going on to other things, and the audience is looking for a new hero. We had a feeling Steven Seagal was that hero."
Still, Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais were determined to limit formal studio involvement in "Marked For Death," for reasons of both creative and economic control. Their previous experience in making films in a studio setting, with all the featherbedding and profligacy that implies, had convinced them there was an easier and cheaper way to do things.
 
A Deal With the Unions
 "If you're not tied to studio overhead, you save 15 percent right there," Mr. Baum said. Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais "also worked out a deal with the unions that couldn't have been done under the studio aegis," he said.
When Mr. Seagal's second movie, "Hard to Kill," which co-starred his wife, Kelly LeBrock, opened earlier this year, it performed better than his first effort. That immediately made him a more financially attractive leading man. By that time, Mr. Victor said, 20th Century Fox had already asked to put up about $6 million to cover the costs of prints and advertising, in return for which it was to receive a share of box-office receipts. But the studio also agreed to pay a share of an additional $2 million that the producers decided to add directly to the filming.
"We decided after seeing his movie and what worked and what didn't that there were a couple of areas worth spending a little more money in, and that's what moved the budget up to $12 million," Mr. Victor said. "We wanted to beef up hand-to-hand fight sequences, we put more money into the car chase, and we put more money into sound than we had anticipated at the time. All these were things we thought would really appeal to the audience."
 
Moving Out of Reach
 Despite their success, it seems highly unlikely that Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais will soon team up again with Mr. Seagal for a sequel. Mr. Seagal is irritated because the Writers Guild of America rejected his claim for a share of authorship of the screenplay.
"You couldn't remake this movie today at the price we did it," Mr. Victor said. "First of all, Seagal would be making four or five million. You won't see a budget for him under $20 million again."
Nevertheless, the rise in Mr. Seagal's value does not necessarily prevent Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais from trying "to do this again with someone like Seagal," as they put it. "It has to be someone who is not getting his share of the pie but is on the brink of becoming a star," Mr. Baum said. "Or it can be someone in decline but who says: 'There's still life in me and let me prove it.' "
If they should try again, Mr. Victor and Mr. Grais have the assurance that the market for movie mayhem is always there and hungry for new faces. "As Seagal gets bigger and broadens his horizons, there will be a need to fill that void," Mr. Sherak said. "Someone will come along to be the next Steven Seagal."

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Reach an Accord On Reduction of Air Pollution

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Settling years of regional political disputes, House and Senate negotiators reached final agreement today on changes in clean air legislation that are intended to strengthen and broaden the Government's authority to reduce air pollution. The amendments are the first in 13 years.
 Lawmakers hailed what they characterized as a breakthrough in setting stricter standards and in establishing new timetables for sharply cutting chemical contamination in the air. But many also agreed with environmental leaders that the problem is so vast and the required improvements so expensive that the nation is not likely to breathe much cleaner air until the first decade of the 21st century. 

 
Cost for Industry
 The agreement puts costly new burdens on industry, the Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and consumers. New equipment would be required for automobiles, possibly adding $500 to the cost of a new car. And the costs of dry cleaning, paint, steel and electricity could also increase.
 Some economists have estimated that compliance could cost $25 billion to $35 billion a year. But environmentalists contend that without the changes, the toll on public health and the environment would result in even greater costs.
 Leading industrial groups, including a coalition of companies and industries that has played an influential role in shaping the present form of the legislation and warding off tougher provisions, said they supported the new amendments.
 
Bush's Approval Expected
 The bill now goes to the House and Senate, which are both expected to approve it later this week. President Bush is expected to approve final legislation.
 Stephen Hart, a spokesman for the White House, said, "We are encouraged by the progress in the conference and we're waiting the see the final language."
 Important provisions include stopping over the next 10 years the production of chemicals that destroy the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, tighter restrictions on the pollution that causes urban smog, stricter regulations on automobile exhausts starting in the model year 1994, new limits on emissions of cancer-causing compounds by factories and chemical plants by 2003, and new limits on coal-burning power plants that will nearly cut in half emissions of the chemical compounds sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which cause acid rain.
 The negotiators also established a $250 million program to compensate workers who may lose their jobs over the next five years as companies begin to comply with the legislation. Members of the House had proposed the program to aid coal miners, chemical workers and others.
 
'Comprehensive and Sweeping'
 "The agreement is without doubt one of the most comprehensive and sweeping environmental laws that Congress has passed in this century," said Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who was chairman of the House-Senate conference committee. "It will end a long and bitter 10-year battle over Federal clean air policy."
 Originally approved in 1970, the Clean Air Act has been one of the foundations of state and Federal programs to control pollution. Since 1977, when it was last amended, attempts to revise and strengthen the law were repeatedly foiled by rancorous regional disputes over the costs of new regulations, the number of jobs that might be lost in industries that would be affected and the extent of damage to public health and the environment caused by dirty air.
 At a news conference today, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate Republican whip and one of the negotiators, said: "It's a good piece of work. The President will sign it. I'm positive."
 Led by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader who first proposed legislation to control acid rain nine years ago, the Senate passed its version of the clean air legislation on April 3. In the House, Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, both Democrats, pushed a differing version of the legislation. The House vote of approval came on May 23.
 Negotiators began meeting to resolve the differences between the two bills on July 13.
 
Accord Reached Before Dawn
 The final agreement was reached before dawn today and celebrated by the negotiators and their staffs with champagne. The negotiators today credited President Bush with breaking the impasse last year by proposing a package of new amendments, including one reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.
 "You should have been there," Senator Simpson said of the negotiations. "It was rich, profane, embittered. I learned that Henry Waxman is tougher than a boiled owl."
 The final agreement will push the Environmental Protection Agency to the limits of its technical and managerial abilities. The agency will be charged with writing and enforcing hundreds of new standards, regulations and rules.
 Three offices at the agency's headquarters in Washington, employing about 640 people, will handle all the work the legislation calls for, including setting new limits on toxic chemical emissions from industrial plants and new standards for automobile emissions and reviewing the quality of plans by cities to reduce urban smog.
 In addition, state environmental agencies will also need to prepare new studies of pollution in cities and regions to meet the requirements of the legislation.
 The Bush Administration requested an increase of $52 million in the 1991 fiscal year to enable the Federal environmental agency to hire 190 more technical experts for the Clean Air program, and $38 million for grants to help state and city environmental agencies meet the new requirements.
 "By and large the air doesn't get clean by passing this law," said David D. Doniger, a senior lawyer in Washington for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York. "It gets clean by the E.P.A. and states carrying out the new law."
 
Weak Record Noted
 Representative Waxman was one of several lawmakers who noted today the Federal environmental agency's weak record in managing complex programs over the last 10 to 15 years. Programs to regulate unsafe pesticides and to clean up hazardous waste dumps have been marred by delays. Mr. Waxman said the negotiators sought to avoid unnecessary delays in implementing the new clean air amendments by establishing specific limits in the legislation for the worst pollutants.
 The rules for controlling acid rain, for instance, which are intended to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide 12 million to 14 million tons annually by the end of the decade, call for 111 individual plants in 22 states to reduce emissions to specific levels by Jan. 1, 1995, and all utilities to meet an even stricter standard by the year 2000.
 "The air is going to be significantly cleaner 10 years from now than it is today, thanks to this bill," said Daniel Weiss, director of the Sierra Club's environmental quality program in Washington. "Some provisions may be delayed longer than we would like to see, but there is no question this is a major step forward."
New York City's environmental officials said they were dissatisfied with the motor vehicle provisions that emerged from the conference committee.
 "New York City's worst air problem is caused by automobiles and the bottom line of the Clean Air Act is: automobiles, one; clean air, nothing," said Albert F. Appleton, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner.
 Mr. Appleton said Congress did not go far enough in restricting tailpipe emissions and in allowing New York to participate in a California program that requires cleaner-burning fuels. He also said he was concerned about the delays in tightening emissions standards for urban buses and delays in forcing fleets of trucks to use cleaner-burning fuels.
 Thomas C. Jorling, New York State's Environmental Conservation Commissioner, said that the Clean Air Act had been improved "across the board," but that he also felt the negotiators did not go far enough.
 
Effect on Du Pont
 Perhaps no company in the United States will be more affected by the new legislation than E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the nation's largest chemical company based in Wilmington, Del. Du Pont, which had revenues last year of $35 billion, is a major producer of chlorofluorocarbons, the refrigerant and cleaning solvent that destroys the ozone shield that protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Chlorofluorcarbons would be phased out in the 1990's and banned in 2000.
 The company also owns Consolidation Coal in Pittsburgh, an important producer of coal that contains high levels of sulfur. The new rules for reducing sulfur emissions from utilities could reduce orders for that kind of coal. Many utilities may switch to cleaner burning coal mined in the West. To soften the blow, provisions in the new bill provide economic incentives for utilities to install scrubbers that would enable them to burn coal with high concentrations of sulfur.
 All of Du Pont's chemical plants would be affected by new rules requiring permits for all sources of atmospheric pollution and by regulations to reduce emissions of 189 chemicals that the Government says cause cancer, birth defects and other medical problems.
 Du Pont's oil company, Conoco Inc., is also likely to be an important supplier of new types of gasoline that burn more cleanly.
 
'Something We Can Live With'
 Mark Nelson, the company's director of legislative affairs in Washington, said Du Pont supports the bill. He said the company has not yet determined the cost of meeting the new requirements.
 "This looks like a tough bill, but it's something we can live with," Mr. Nelson said.
 A representative from the automobile industry said auto makers also supported the amendments.
 "We're part of the problem; we want to be part of the solution," said Timothy C. MacCarthy, director of the Federal liaison department at the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association in Washington. "Only time will tell whether the significant costs match up with the benefits of this bill."

Long-Term Interest Rates Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates rose and Treasury bond prices fell in light trading yesterday, as dealers sold longer-dated issues after statements by various Congressional leaders made it apparent that further delays in passing a new Federal budget were likely.
Dealers chose to sell bonds after Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters in separate interviews they lacked enough votes to pass a budget pact.
Differences were cited on a number of issues, including proposed increases in gasoline taxes and how best to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, as the latest reasons for the delay.
 
'Steam Out of the Market'
 Bond prices, which had been up earlier in the session in the wake of a further decline in oil prices, quickly slipped after the budget news flashed across trading screens. "Domenici took all the steam out of the market," said Joseph Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc.
Traders said the budget news was bad because the longer the process was delayed, the less time the Government would have to sell an avalanche of new securities. "The auction calendar is going to be compressed into a frighteningly short period of time," Mr. Liro said.
"As things now stand, roughly $95 billion worth of securities will have to be sold between now and the first full week in November, and the longer the Congress delays the shorter the period to pre-sell those issues becomes," he added. "The Government could end up paying for the delay in a big way."
 
Rise in Yields Forecast
 Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International, said that "once a budget pact is announced, the Street will rush to sell securities as a way of preparing for the new supply. I think that yields are going to have to go back up quite severely in order for the markets to take on these new securities."
The Government has enough money to honor its obligations until next Wednesday, but the continued delay in passing a new budget as well as authorizing another increase in the Federal debt ceiling makes it highly unlikely that an auction of new two-year Treasury notes will be held today, dealers said.
Next Wednesday the Treasury is expected to announce the size and timing of its quarterly refunding auctions, which are now expected to take place during the first full week of November.
 
Long-Term Selling Pressure
 Most of the selling pressure in the secondary market for Treasury securities was seen in long-term bonds and notes. Prices of short-term bills and notes were little changed.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 15/32, down 17/32, to yield 8.79 percent, compared with 8.75 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 19/32 in late trading, down 10/32, to yield 8.65 percent. But the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes showed a rise of 1/32, to a late offered price of 100 17/32, to yield 7.81 percent.
 
Bill Rates Down a Bit
 Short-term Treasury bill rates dipped slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.21 percent, down one basis point, or a hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 7.16 percent.
In the market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of longer-term Citicorp issues swung wildly yesterday. "The shorter-term stuff is hanging in there," one trader said. "But bids on the longer stuff are all over the place, and no trades are taking place."
Citicorp bonds have been pounded in recent months as worries about the health of major American banks has risen. Confidence in the nation's largest bank holding company took another beating on Monday when a Dutch auction of its money market preferred stock came close to failing. Another auction of Citicorp's 49-day money market preferred is expected to be held today.
Dealers said that prices of most investment-grade corporate issues dipped by about a quarter of a point in very light trading.
 
Backed by Japanese Credit
 In the tax-exempt municipal market, Dean Witter Reynolds acted as lead manager for a negotiated sale of $200 million worth of bonds for the Georgia World Congress Center Authority. The issue, which is backed by a letter of credit from the Industrial Bank of Japan, consists of serial and term bonds.
The bulk of the securities are in term bonds maturing in 2010 and 2020 and carry coupons of 7.80 percent and 7 7/8 percent, respectively.
The issue is rated triple A by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

Saudis' Quandary: Carrot or the Stick for Iraqis?

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The Saudi Defense Minister's conciliatory-sounding remarks addressed to Iraq this week were the latest sign that Saudi strategists and military officials are trying their best to offer President Saddam Hussein more of a carrot and less of a stick to persuade him to pull his 350,000 troops out of Kuwait.
 This approach stems in part from the deep cracks in the Arab world from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and some second thoughts here about the confrontational attitude that Saudi Arabia has adopted toward Jordan, Yemen, the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Arab supporters of Iraq. 
 Over the last few weeks, Saudi Arabia has cut off oil supplies to Jordan and all financial aid to Yemen, Jordan and the P.L.O. in retaliation for their support of Iraq.
It has adopted measures that may force a million Yemeni expatriate workers -- a quarter of the foreign labor force here -- to leave this country, deeply unhappy after decades of making a comfortable living here. And it has virtually severed its relations with the leadership of the P.L.O.
 
Preference for Consensus
 On the one hand, the Saudis have been uncharacteristically tough in talking of war and in saying that President Hussein has to be destroyed. But more recently, the Saudis -- as underscored by the remarks of the Defense Minister, Prince Sultan -- seem to be looking for a more traditional consensus approach that might avoid war.
The latter approach is more in keeping with the methods of a country that for the last 50 years has tried not to burn bridges even to its enemies.
But the Saudis' preference for low-key politics clashes with their decision in the last two and a half months to say openly that their interest lies with the West, most particularly the United States, ending decades of trying to keep that special relationship something of an illicit affair.
Enough Saudis have become sufficiently alarmed about all these developments to begin searching for a way to return to a lower profile.
"This car is going too fast," said a wealthy Saudi merchant and businessman who supports the view that somehow President Hussein must be gotten rid of but that "this creeping confrontation towards war may not be a way to do it."
 
Impact of Egyptian Support
 While Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, has given the Saudis strong and unhesitating support, Cairo is burdened with $50 billion in debts and is no match for Iraq's enormous and well-equipped army.
Of equal importance is concern here that as the weeks go by while allied troops prepare for what could be a very costly battle, the fickle ways of Western democracies and their moody public may shift the ground beneath President Bush's Administration, weakening its resolve as well as that of other Western powers and Arab allies to make the decision to go to war.
"Many of the forces deployed against Saddam are not Arabs," a senior Saudi official said today in a briefing to a few reporters about the disposition of Iraqi troops and the allied forces facing them in this country. "There are Westerners whose societies are undergoing a debate that may affect the situation and reflect on the performances of their forces."
Saudi Government officials maintain that comments by Prince Sultan, widely reported on Sunday and Monday, to the effect that the border dispute with Kuwait can be settled in a way that satisfies at least some Iraqi demands for access to the Persian Gulf are not as new as they may sound.
 
Omelette of Unbroken Eggs
 "We have always maintained a conciliatory policy from the start," the Saudi official, who is a senior decision maker in the Saudi royal hierarchy and who insisted that he not be identified, said today.
"The King has always urged Saddam Hussein to minimize bloodshed," the official said. "If that is conciliatory, then it has been consistent. But we also have said we will use whatever force that is necessary."
Indeed, most Saudis seem to believe that the most decisive way to restore stability to this region is not only to liberate Kuwait, but to do away with President Hussein and his entire Baathist Government -- a goal that can only be accomplished by a decisive military blow to Iraq.
But the heady atmosphere that prevailed during much of August, with most Saudis adopting a let's-go-get-them attitude, has evaporated. "I think we are slipping back to the old attitude of wanting the omelette without breaking the eggs," said one prominent Saudi businessman.
On the popular level, there is a palpable anxiety that even if the allied forces prevail over Iraq, they will do so at a cost that will deeply upset the serenity and prosperity that Saudi society has come to accept as a way of life.
 
Unease at Foreigners' Presence
 Although the Saudi Government has done its best to insulate its citizens from the influence and impact of some 300,000 American and other troops that have poured in since August, there is undeniably a fair amount of unease at the presence of so many foreigners. In addition, many Saudis worry that the Americans have come here to defend their oil supplies and that despite repeated assertions that they will leave as soon as the crisis is over, they are planning to stay for a long while.
Finally, there is a conviction that at least some of the things President Hussein are saying are true. Despite assertions by pro-Western Arab governments that Israel's occupation of Arab territories and its perceived denial of Palestinian rights cannot be compared to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, what has become known as linkage is alive and well in many a Saudi mind.
Even Saudis who represent the heart of the conservative and pro-Western business community say they are distressed by the enthusiasm the West has demonstrated in rushing to the defense of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- both of which are oil-producing countries and major economic partners for Westerns industrialized democracies -- compared with the apathy they feel the West has shown for what virtually all Arabs agree is a minimum of legitimate rights for the Palestinians under Israeli occupation.
One Yemini intellectual, a Muslim fundamentalist who has lived here for 17 years, expressed this sentiment in a way echoed by many Saudis, in a conversation about Saudi Arabia's decision to withdraw privileges accorded to the Yemini community over the last 40 years, forcing them to leave.
Speaking of Mr. Hussein's threats against Israel and his denunciation of American support for the Israelis, the Yemini intellectual said: "What Saddam Hussein says is logical and reasonable. The only problem is that it comes from him."
All this leaves the Saudis in a quandary about what to do. "Very few Arabs would accept the principle of going into Iraq with armed force," said the senior Saudi official. "The shedding of Arab blood by Arabs is repugnant. But in the process of liberating Kuwait, you can't enter into a boxing match with one hand tied behind your back."

HEADLINE: Schools to Cut Hundreds of Jobs To Save New York $94 Million

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
To satisfy new budget cuts of $94 million demanded by City Hall, the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, is drawing up plans to eliminate hundreds of jobs, including many through layoffs.
He also is strongly considering selling Board of Education television and radio stations valued at a minimum of $15 million.
Mr. Fernandez and Stanley S. Litow, the deputy chancellor for operations, met over the weekend with city budget officials and were told to find ways of slashing this fiscal year's budget by 2 percent, or $94 million, and cutting the budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 by $245 million. Along with other city agencies they are to present their budget-cutting plan to City Hall today.
 
Big Gaps in the City Budget
 Their presentations come about a week after Mayor David N. Dinkins told city agencies to prepare cuts of more than $1 billion from their operating budgets to help close projected city budget gaps of at least $300 million for this fiscal year and $1.4 billion for next year. Most agencies were told to prepare cuts equal to 4 percent of their budgets for the current fiscal year, but the school system was asked to trim about half that amount.
"Obviously there will have to be some cuts in personnel," Mr. Fernandez said yesterday when asked about what reductions he was planning. But he added, "The classroom is the last place we want to hit."
Instead of teacher layoffs, he suggestedthat other job categories would be likelier targets. The Board of Education, school officials said, has already made plans to trim the central board by 350 employees -- about 10 percent of the staff.
Mr. Fernandez derided a report in The Daily News that quoted unnamed sources who said that 2,000 teachers might have to be laid off in January and another 2,000 in September. He called it a leak by someone at City Hall whose "motive is to tie the teachers' contract to this story."
Some city officials and such fiscal monitors as Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, have denounced the contract's 5.5 percent pay increase as far too generous at a time of citywide economic anguish. They are pressing for its abrogation, and Mr. Fernandez suggested that their case would be strengthened by the specter of teacher layoffs.
While substantial savings were achieved last year by letting jobs of departed or retired employees go unfilled, officials in the Chancellor's office said they could not meet all of the new cuts through a hiring freeze alone and would have to consider layoffs. However, laying off teachers after raising teachers' salaries would present a particularly prickly public relations problem for Mr. Fernandez.
Bert Shanas, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers, said "the Chancellor's office assures us there are no teacher layoffs in their plans.
"This kind of game-playing goes to the heart of why the City Hall budget people have no credibility with us," he added. Mr. Fernandez, following an example set by Mayor David N. Dinkins, said he also planned to talk to a regular meeting of the seven-member Board of Education today about the possibility of cutting his $195,000 salary and the salaries of his top aides by 5 percent.
 
Problems With Stations
 The contemplated sale of the television and radio stations -- WNYE-TV and WNYE-FM -- would eliminate only 30 jobs, but the Federal Communications Commission licenses and the stations' studio equipment would be regarded as attractive properties on the auction block.
The Board of Education established the radio station in 1940 and the television station, a UHF outlet transmitted on Channel 25, in 1967. During school hours the stations broadcast educational programs with titles like "Newton's Rainbow," "Meet Barney Bookworm" and "The World of Myths and Legends." At other hours they lease time to foreign-language broadcasters and community groups.
The stations have been plagued with serious problems. The television transmitter in downtown Brooklyn has a weak signal that reaches less than half of the city's schools. High schools also find it difficult to mesh class schedules with the station's programs.
Mr. Fernandez made his comments on the budget issues as he waited impatiently to testify at a State Assembly Education Committee hearing in Lower Manhattan on a bill that would give him a greater role in the selection of community school superintendents. The chairman of the committee, Angelo Del Toro, was 45 minutes late for the hearing, saying he had been stalled in traffic.
 
Screening Power Sought
 The bill would require the 32 local boards to submit to the Chancellor evaluations of the top three to five candidiates for a superintendent's position. Mr. Fernandez could disqualify candidates whose records he deemed inferior, forcing the boards to make their selection from the remaining candidiates.
Mr. Fernandez said he wanted to make sure that local boards hired their chief administrators for their educational talents and not out of concern "about what political club they belong to and what kind of patronage they provide." Still, as an apparent inducement to a committee whose members are in some cases politically entangled with the local school boards, Mr. Fernandez said he was exploring the possibility of allowing more local districts to have "co-ownership" in the running of high schools.
Generally local boards govern only elementary and junior high schools, but a handful of high schools, like Truman High in the Bronx, are run jointly by the Board of Education and the local school board.
Mr. Fernandez found himself in a near donnybrook with Edward Griffith, a Democratic Assemblyman from Brooklyn. The Chancellor had urged that the Legislature approve the bill without further studies about decentralization since, he said, most studies end up on shelves.
 
A Sharp Exchange
 Bristling, Mr. Griffith said the initial studies that led to decentralization did not end up on a shelf. He then chided Mr. Fernandez for taking credit for the elimination of the Board of Examiners when Democratic legislators had fought for its abolition for years.
"If there was a fight, I never saw you in it," Mr. Fernandez retorted.
Speakers at the hearing took different positions on the hiring bill. Jeanne Frankl, executive director of the Public Education Association, called it a publicity trick since, she argued, the Chancellor could achieve the same aims with powers he now has. But Msgr. John Powis, co-chairman of East Brooklyn Churches, a coalition of churches that has fought for improvements in education and housing, said the bill was necessary.
Monsignor Powis, an early warrior in the battles that led to decentralization in 1970, argued that too many boards had proved themselves "unaccountable pockets of contracts, favors and employment."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Campaigning for the G.O.P., Bush Discovers He's an Issue

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 23

 BODY:
It was to have been a routine day of campaigning. Instead, George Bush got an object lesson today in how the budget crisis has disrupted the Republican Party, and how quickly loyalties can shift when a Presidency is weakened and defiance of the White House becomes a political plus.
Stumping through New England on a trip that had been postponed by the budget crisis, Mr. Bush was introduced at a fund-raising event in Vermont by a Republican candidate who made a point of opposing the President's veto Monday of a job-discrimination bill. 
 The candidate, Representative Peter Smith, then tried to solve his campaign problems at the President's expense. He broke with the President on taxes by saying he supported higher rates on the wealthy. At the same time, he reminded his audience that Mr. Bush abandoned the no-new-taxes pledge on which he ran in 1988.
This was clearly not what the White House had expected when John H. Sununu, the President's chief of staff, warned recalcitrant Republicans that Mr. Bush might visit their districts to chastise them for not supporting the President's budget proposals.
 
'Talking About His Pledge'
 Mr. Bush looked grim, wiping the juice of a Vermont apple from his chin and toying with the remnants of his hotcakes-and-maple-syrup breakfast as Mr. Smith went on: "Ask yourselves, why did this President, last May, decide that the issue he had run on and won on now had to be laid on the table as a point of negotiations? We're talking about his pledge on taxes. He did it because he understood that the good of this country had to come first."
The President, who was not warned of Mr. Smith's planned remarks but did not seem surprised, tried to laugh them off before the friendly crowd. "Like all Vermonters, he is a man of independent mind," Mr. Bush said. "I just wish he'd stop reminding me that we do have a few differences out there."
Then, in Manchester, N.H., Mr. Bush had a different problem. He appeared on behalf of another Republican lawmaker, who had stayed in Washington while the President raised money for him.
It is not just in New England that Republican divisions over taxes and other issues have given Mr. Bush's efforts to promote his party's candidates something of the tension between a divorced couple who suddenly find themselves at the same dinner party.
A few months ago, Republican candidates were lining up to become one of the 100 or so Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates who got videotaped endorsements from Mr. Bush. But some of the candidates have been slow to put the advertisements on the air.
 
Fighting Back Gamely
 Mr. Bush gamely fought back today, defending his shifts on taxes and the budget as a necessary evil to gain an acceptable compromise. And he tried to coat himself with some of Ronald Reagan's political Teflon, recalling that his predecessor accepted higher taxes in 1982. "President Reagan had to swallow hard back then," he said. "I had to swallow hard. But the long-term health of the United States of America, of our economy, had to come before self-interest."
But it was a long and difficult day for Mr. Bush. The President stumbled through his speeches, mistakenly declaring at one point that he "favors" the budget deficit. He had to foresake his Marine Corps helicopter at the Westchester County airport because of foul weather and drive 75 minutes through the rain to Waterbury and Stamford.
In Connecticut, at least, Mr. Bush got an enthusiastic welcome. He went there to campaign for Representative John G. Rowland, who is running for Governor against Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden, a Democrat, and Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Greenwich, a former Republican senator who is campaigning as an independent and has held wide leads in all public polls.
Mr. Rowland represents Connecticut's Fifth Congressional District and lives in Waterbury, but the fund-raising event for him was held in the Republican-rich Fourth Congressional District, considered vital territory.

 
Couldn't Get Home
 Mr. Bush went to Connecticut from New Hampshire, where he raised money for Representative Robert C. Smith's re-election campaign. Mr. Smith did not appear at the event, his wife, Mary Jo, said, because he had to cast "very key" votes in Washington. The lawmaker's office said today that he was casting a ballot on a spending bill for the Commerce, State and Justice Departments.
Mr. Bush began the day in Burlington, Vt., where Representative Peter Smith attended what should have been a pro-forma fund-raising event.
Not this time. Not only has the Vermont Congressman taken a beating over his support for the bipartisan budget agreement that went sour in early October, but he became one of only 10 House Republicans who voted for a Democratic package that would raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
Mr. Smith started his remarks today by saying he opposed the President's veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990. Then he said, "Mr. President, I believe the people of Vermont are ready and willing to support higher tax brackets on the wealthy as an important part of any package to get this country out of deficit spending."
The President recalled how much trouble Mr. Smith's vote on the bipartisan budget deal had caused him. "It wasn't an easy vote," Mr. Bush said. "But he did what he felt he had to do.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Focus Shifts to Rules on Cleaner Air For Car, Chemical and Steel Makers

BYLINE: The following article was reported and written by Barnaby J. Feder, Doron
 P. Levin and Jonathan P. Hicks.

 BODY:
No consumer's wallet will go untouched by the Clean Air Act amendments expected to be enacted within days following compromises in the Senate and House.
Much of the burden will fall initially on several industries that have long expected tighter controls on air pollution, including auto makers, steel producers, the chemical industry and public utilities. How quickly consumers pay for the changes these industries will be asked to make will depend in part on the state of the economy. If the nation tumbles into a recession, as some economists expect, business will have a harder time passing on the costs. 
 In the long run, the bill could cost consumers as much as $50 billion, said David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "It will begin to add to the inflation rate in a small way as early as next year," he added.
 
 Worst-Case Scenarios
 Industry executives have tried to envision worst-case scenarios for the impact of the new amendments. Indeed, such theorizing was used to lobby against some of the far-reaching proposals favored by environmental groups. Now that the first round of the battle is over, the conflict will shift to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is charged with drafting regulations putting into effect most of the changes. In the meantime, many executives say, it is hard to make really useful projections without knowing what the E.P.A. intends to do.
But some things are already clear. Coal-burning utilities will bear the brunt of the changes aimed at curbing acid rain. It is widely assumed that the state public utility boards, which set electricity rates, will have no objection to passing the costs for scrubbing equipment on to consumers as soon as it is installed, especially in states like Ohio and Kentucky, where the equipment will allow utilities to continue to use locally mined coal. Utility executives say that the companies with the most work to do might have to seek rate increases of more than 15 percent to cover their costs.
 
 Technical Incapability Feared
 The goals set for auto makers are equally clear, but industry spokesmen are not as sure that their companies are technically capable of meeting those scheduled to take effect in the late 1990's. The steel industry asserts that it, too, may bump up against technology limits.
There is one crucial difference between the two industries that leaves steelmakers feeling especially burdened. The laws about cars will be incorporated in the product, affecting all auto makers at home and abroad that hope to sell vehicles in the United States. The laws affecting steel relate to the steelmaking process, which will add to the cost of American steel but have no impact on foreign companies that export steel to the United States.
Steelmakers might use this difference to argue for tariff barriers, import quotas or other protection from foreign competition in order to make it easier to pass on to consumers the costs of meeting the air pollution laws.
Chemical makers point out that the big industries affected by the new amendments, including their own, tend to be heavy users of electricity. Thus, they will pay both for the costs of new controls on their toxic products and for the higher cost of energy from utilities that pay for scrubbers and other equipment to reduce acid rain.
Following is a closer look at how three major industries are reacting to the new amendments:
 
 Autos
 The provisions affecting auto makers are among the most specific in the clean air agreement. They identify key pollutants emitted at the tailpipe and set targets for reducing them.
The first round of reductions begins in 1994 and, according to the Chrysler Corporation, will cost several hundred dollars a car. They include a requirement that non-methane hydrocarbon emissions be reduced in phases by 1997 to 0.25 gram a mile from 0.41 gram and nitrogen oxide emissions be cut to 0.4 gram from one gram.
The targets will be halved again between the turn of the century and 2004. Auto makers say that meeting those goals, or even those for 1997, may be more than they can cope with technologically at a reasonable price. "We don't know how to meet the provisions that begin in the late 1990's," said a Chrysler spokesman.
The General Motors Corporation also served notice that it had doubts about the technological feasibility of the longer-range requirements.
 
 Challenge for Toyota
 The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest car maker, said that meeting the requirements would be a challenge and might be possible only by building cars that got poorer gasoline mileage. The Ford Motor Company said that one positive side of the compromise was that it took into account some of the industry's worries about the timetables set for various changes.
The changes should not only lower tailpipe emissions but lead to more durable pollution control equipment on cars. Auto makers will be required to certify that the equipment will be effective for 10 years or 100,000 miles, double the current standards.
Auto makers also would be compelled to build 150,000 vehicles annually starting in 1996 for an experimental fleet that will operate under stricter California clean air guidelines. That number would rise to 300,000 in 1998.
Starting in 1994, auto makers would be required to install dashboard gauges that tell whether emission control equipment is working properly.
"In rough numbers, cars at the end of this process will pollute one-sixth as much as they do now," said Robert Liberatore, Chrysler's executive director of government policy, summing up the overall impact.
 
 Chemicals
 Chemical manufacturers and trade groups that represent them said yesterday that the compromise clean air legislation offered little relief from requirements they consider expensive and difficult to put into effect.
"It will lead to continued progress in cleaning our nation's air," said Robert A. Roland, president of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, a Washington-based trade group. "The bad news is that this continued progress won't come without a very high price. In fact, the price Americans will pay will be far more than it should be."
Some chemical executives harbor concerns that the requirements that companies use the best available control technology will not be flexible enough to accommodate the wide range of chemicals and processes for dealing with them.
 
 Six-Year Extension Hailed
 Still, some chemical companies hailed provisions in the compromise legislation that would give chemical manufacturers six more years to comply with new emission standards if they reduced their toxic emissions by 90 percent from their 1987 level ahead of the 1994 deadline. (Even a reduction of 90 percent would not meet the new standards.)
Mr. Roland said the cost of putting the legislation into effect would be "somewhere around $40 billion to $50 billion a year, and that will be on top of the $32 billion a year we already spend as a nation on cleaning our air."
 
 Steel
 The American steel industry, which found previous versions of the clean air legislation unpalatable, has been far more amenable to the amendments as completed by the House and Senate conference committee.
Steelmakers were disturbed by a requirement, in earlier versions, that they eliminate virtually all emissions from coke ovens by the year 2020 and in the meantime adopt the best available emissions reduction technology by 1995. Coke ovens are the furnaces that convert coal to coke in making steel.
Steel industry officials contended that meeting the 1995 deadline would cost the industry about $5 billion, which they said they could ill afford.
Under the House and Senate compromise measure, the industry does not have to adopt the best available technology to reduce emissions leakage in coke ovens until 2020 and in the meantime must reduce emissions gradually under guidelines to be formulated by the E.P.A.
 
 More Stringent Standards
 The industry will have to meet progressively more stringent standards in 1993, 1995, 1998 and 2010. But the compromise no longer mandates that virtually all emissions be eliminated by 2020.
David M. Anderson, general manager of environmental affairs at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, said yesterday that the extension until 2020 was crucial to the American steel industry's competitive position. "Without the extension, the legislation could have shut down two-thirds of domestic coke ovens by 2003," he added.
But Milton Deaner, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, the industry trade group, complained that the clean air compromise still created far more stringent requirements for the steel industry than for other industrial groups.

HEADLINE: New York City Seeks to Revoke Licenses of 40 Garbage Haulers

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
New York City moved yesterday to revoke the licenses of almost 10 percent of the private haulers that pick up commercial garbage, in what a Dinkins administration official described as the first step toward cleaning up a corrupt business.
Mark Green, the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, said he would seek to revoke the licenses and impose up to $3.2 million in fines on 40 haulers who have refused to disclose financial information required by the city. 
 The city requires haulers to disclose who has corporate control of their companies, the names of shareholders, the number of customers, the amount and type of waste collected and where it is dumped.
Mr. Green said the information was needed to determine a new maximum rate that haulers could charge the city's 250,000 businesses for garbage pickup.
Businesses pay 475 private haulers more than a $1 billion a year to collect their trash, which accounts for about 40 percent of the garbage generated in the city. The City Sanitation Department collects from residences.
 
Bidding for Routes Studied
 In coming months, Mr. Green said, he would explore ways to bring more competition into a "closed industry" that he said routinely overcharged businesses. Such steps might include a system under which haulers would have to bid for route franchises.
"It is a cartel," Mr. Green said. "Territories are divided up by agreement among carters. Outsiders are afraid to come in and bid for routes because of intimidation.
"Carters are to garbage what OPEC is to oil," he continued. "Each knows not to bid against each other. I don't know if it's done by winks, meetings or codes."
The Department of Consumer Affairs licenses private haulers and sets the maximum rate they can charge, which is currently $14.70 a cubic yard. Mr. Green said he expected to set a new rate next month. An average greengrocer in the city pays $15,000 a year for garbage pickup, while Macy's pays $59,661 a month, he said.
 
'Setting a Fair Rate'
 "If they are overpaying, especially as we are in a recession, it really hurts the economy of the city," he said. "I'm very keen on setting a fair rate."
The haulers now facing license revocation must appear before a department hearing officer, who will determine the amount of the fine and whether the license will be revoked.
Richard C. Laskey, first assistant to the director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, said the commercial garbage collection industry in New York City was influenced by organized crime, resulting in stifled competition, poorer service and overpayments.
 
Mob Control Denied
 A lawyer for the haulers, Salvatore Spinelli, said that organized crime did not control the business and that there was competition for routes. Because many people in the industry are of Italian descent, he said, the industry was unfairly portrayed as being controlled by organized crime.
"I find it personally offensive," Mr. Spinelli said.
Mr. Green declined to say whether he thought the commercial garbage collection was controlled by organized crime, stating, "I am a regulator, not a prosecutor."
He also said that 90 percent of the private haulers had complied with the disclosure requirements. Mr. Spinelli, who represents the Council of Trade Waste Associations, said some companies that did not provide the information had gone out of business. The council, he said, had encouraged all members to disclose the required data.

HEADLINE: Wang Has a Profit; 2 Others Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wang said yesterday that it returned to profitability in its latest quarter, but two other computer makers, Control Data and Tandy, said their earnings slipped. 
 Following are the details on the earnings of the three companies:
 
Wang

 Wang Laboratories Inc. said it earned $2.6 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $62.1 million in the quarter last year. Revenue in the period, which is Wang's first fiscal quarter, totaled $571.5 million, down from $604.8 million a year earlier.
The Lowell, Mass., company said it had elimitated its debt to its bank group in the quarter. "This debt was $575 million in August 1989, and it is zero today," said Richard W. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer.
Wang's share price rose 25 cents yesterday, to $3.25, in trading on the American Stock Exchange.
 
Control Data
 The Control Data Corporation said it earned $8.5 million, or 20 cents a share, in the third quarter, down 13.2 percent from $9.8 million, or 23 cents a share, in 1989's third quarter. Revenue fell 43 percent, to $434.1 million, from $763 million.
Last year's third-quarter results included revenue and earnings from Imprimis, a disk drive subsidiary that has been sold, and a pretax restructuring gain of $8.5 million, the Bloomington, Minn., company said.
A spokeswoman said the energy management division and the automated wagering unit could experience "substantial" problems in the next quarter that could hurt earnings.
Control Data's share price rose 37.5 cents yesterday, to $9.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Tandy
 The Tandy Corporation said it earned $52.2 million, or 65 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, down 16.9 percent from $62.8 million, or 73 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Revenue at the Fort Worth, Tex., company totaled $1.09 billion, up 11 percent from $986 million in the period last year, which is Tandy's first fiscal quarter.
Tandy blamed the lower earnings on price cuts of its products. It said it had cleared its Radio Shack retail store inventories of certain discontinued items and computer models prior to the holiday selling season.
The company's share price fell $1.25 yesterday, to $24.75, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: EARNINGS;
Unexpectedly Low Earnings at Sun

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems Inc., the leading vendor of computer-engineering workstations, unnerved Wall Street today by reporting financial results that were below expectations. It attributed the shortfall to a weaker economy and internal factors.
The results, announced after the close of the stock market, were almost certain to hurt Sun's stock in trading Wednesday and could renew Wall Street's nervousness over high-technology stocks after confidence had been beginning to build again. 
 "We're all a little bit shell-shocked," said Peter Rogers, an analyst with Robertson Stephens & Company in San Francisco.
 
Analysts' Expectations
 Sun reported net income for its first fiscal quarter ended Sept. 28 of $26.1 million, or 26 cents a share, five times the $5.2 million, or 7 cents a share, recorded a year earlier, when the company was recovering from its first loss. But the earnings per share were well below the 40 cents that both the company and Wall Street analysts had been expecting.
Revenues grew to $677 million, from $538.5 million a year earlier, a gain of 26 percent. But the company and analysts had expected revenues of $700 million to $725 million.
William J. Raduchel, the chief financial officer, said there were several disruptions in the quarter, including a reorganization of the domestic sales force and late shipments because of component shortages and the opening of a new warehouse.
In addition, he said, customers might have postponed purchases in anticipation of new products. On Nov. 5, the Mountain View, Calif., company is expected to introduce its Sparcstation 2, a work station more powerful than its existing machines.
 
Strength Anticipated
 Mr. Raduchel said the company could not determine how much of the earnings shortfall resulted from these factors and how much was because of the weak economy. The sales force still thinks demand is strong for Sun's products, he said.
As previously reported, Sun is cutting costs and has frozen hiring. It is projecting revenue growth of 20 to 30 percent for the rest of the fiscal year, down from 30 to 35 percent last year.
Sun's uncertainty in assessing its future is likely to contribute to weakness in its stock, said Mr. Rogers, the Robertson Stephens analyst. Sun shares fell $2.75 each today, to $20.125, with more than two million shares changing hands in over-the-counter trading.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the first-quarter earnings of Sun Microsystems Inc. referred incorrectly to the company's recent projections for revenue growth. Sun forecasts growth of 20 to 30 percent for this fiscal year, down from a previous projection, not last year's growth, of 30 to 35 percent. Sun revenues grew 39 percent in its last fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Continental Bankruptcy Study Seen

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
Stung by unexpected losses and sharply higher fuel costs, the parent of Continental Airlines prepared to file for bankruptcy protection over the weekend but decided against the move -- at least for now -- at the last minute, a lawyer familiar with the situation said yesterday.
Amid the turmoil, Continental said its president and four top executives would leave the company. The company attributed the move to cost-cutting, but people close to Continental said that its new chairman, Hollis H. Harris, wanted to remove executives who were allied with Frank Lorenzo, who recently stepped down as chairman, or who disagreed with the direction of the airline. 
 The lawyer, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said a team of lawyers worked through the weekend, day and night, to prepare bankruptcy papers to be filed on Monday by the company, Continental Airlines Holdings. Art Kent, a spokesman for Continental, denied the reports. "The company has no intention of filing for bankruptcy protection," he said.
 
Impact of Gulf Crisis
 Continental, which had nearly $500 million in cash reserves in June, reportedly suffered unexpected losses this summer -- normally the industry's most prosperous season -- and has been hit hard by fuel prices that have more than doubled since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. What is more, Continental paid the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation, a Federal agency, $80.5 million last month as part of a settlement that will cost the airline about $600 million over several years.
Continental Airlines Holdings, which was called the Texas Air Corporation before last June, operates Eastern Airlines as well as Continental.
More than a dozen lawyers from Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, the New York law firm, worked on the Continental case over the weekend. "They were running flat out," said the lawyer familiar with the situation. "By late Sunday night they were ready to go." He said Continental was still considering a bankruptcy filing along with other options.
The company's board is reportedly split on what to do about the airline's financial crisis. Mr. Lorenzo, who is still a board member, has strongly opposed filing for bankruptcy protection. In August, Mr. Lorenzo left as chairman with $30.5 million, largely from the sale of his stock to the company. Mr. Lorenzo is reportedly concerned that he might lose that money should Continental file for bankruptcy protection. Yesterday, Continental's headquarters in Houston did not return a request for comment by Mr. Lorenzo.
Jan Carlzon, chairman of Scandinavian Airlines System, which now owns 16.8 percent of Continental stock, also opposes filing for bankruptcy, the lawyer said, because the value of S.A.S.'s investment would drop sharply. Continental is also considering widespread layoffs as a means to stem its losses, people familiar with the airline said.
It was not clear which Continental executives or board members favored filing for bankruptcy protection.
 
'Extremely Weak'
 Continental lost $8.7 million in the first half of this year, compared with a loss of $365 million a year earlier. But the company's financial pulse may be weaker than those figures indicate. For instance, the 1990 losses are partly diluted by $61 million in extraordinary credits, and last year's losses reflect liabilities from Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since March 1989. What is more, Continental had total liabilities of $1.65 billion as of June.
"Their balance sheet is extremely weak," said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read. "And they're going into the weak winter season." Mr. Neidl said he expects Continental to report a "marginal" loss for the third quarter.
Continental is no stranger to bankruptcy. Under Mr. Lorenzo, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982. Using lower-cost nonunion labor, Mr. Lornezo rebuilt the airline.
Among the management changes announced yesterday at Continental: Mr. Harris, the company's recently appointed chairman and chief executive, will replace the current president, Mickey Foret, taking on the additional title. Among the other executives leaving the airline are Clark H. Onstad, a senior vice president for properties and government; Neal Meehan, senior vice president for customer services; Jim Arpey, senior vice president for aircraft programs, and Elliot Seiden, associate general counsel.
 Continental said the executives were leaving as part of a cost-cutting campaign. Mr. Harris cited "radically higher fuel costs" as the reason for the streamlining. The airline's fuel costs were $81 million higher in October than in June.
 But others said the executives were leaving because of their connections with Mr. Lorenzo and because of disagreements over airline strategy.

HEADLINE: Pueblo Parents Feel Generation Gap: Where Shall Children Be Educated?

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FELIPE, N.M.

 BODY:
By the standards of New Mexico's vast, angular landscape, the distance between the elementary school on the San Felipe Indian Reservation and the one in the town of Algodones is trivial, a mere six miles. But for the elders of the reservation, what matters is not miles but millennia.
One school has ties to the Pueblo Indian traditions and the rhythms of a society that was old when the Spaniards came. The other is part of the world outside. 
 But despite a decade of efforts to improve the school for the Indian children at San Felipe, Indian parents are deserting it in droves. As a result, the Tribal Council -- a sovereign government with broad rights to control its land and its members, according to the laws and the treaties of the United States -- is pressuring parents to keep their children on the reservation. The rebellious parents respond that they will send their children to any school they wish.
"We want our kids to learn to adapt to the world out there, rather than the world in here," said Bonnie Candelaria, whose 5-year-old daughter, Valyn, started kindergarten at Algodones this fall, becoming one of 64 San Felipe children in a school with an enrollment of 138.
Tribal Council members, in a recent meeting, accused Ms. Candelaria and the other parents of disloyalty and disrespect, she reported. "They were yelling, 'You don't care for your kids, that's why you send them to Algodones,' " she said.
 
Traditions Are Defied
 Council members have rebuked "disobedient" and "disloyal" parents, and they persuaded the reservation school to adopt a policy that makes transfer of a child's records difficult without approval of the tribal governor. Two council members have told outsiders that the council recently passed a resolution urging all San Felipe parents to keep their children in the reservation school through sixth grade.
A Supreme Court ruling in the late 1970's gave tribes broad authority to determine their own membership, but it is not clear if a tribal government has unlimited power to impose obligations on its members, like dictating what school their children must attend.
For all the bitterness, the Tribal Council's actions may seem mild to an outsider. But such pressures have strong resonance in the context of Pueblo life. On a practical level, the parents now defying the council may one day have to petition it for land or a building permit or a job with the tribal government. On a deeper level, to defy the council is to flout traditions that have kept the community intact through centuries of droughts, wars, interlopers and displacement.
The conflict has echoes all over the state and the Southwest. Islands of ancient culture, trying to keep collective control of their children and their future, are finding themselves challenged by members who assert individual rights.
In New Mexico, schools are the forum for these challenges. Two of the most conservative and isolated groups, the San Felipe Pueblo and the Santo Domingo Pueblo, are pressuring parents to keep their children in primary schools on the reservation. Students in high school and in some cases junior high have gone to school off the reservation for a decade, though this year the tribal governor of the Santo Domingo Pueblo has sought to keep his tribe's students out of the Bernalillo Middle School, not far from Algodones.
 
Reverting to First Language
 But by the time a Pueblo student has completed elementary school on the reservation, he may be seriously handicapped linguistically, said teachers and aides at the Algodones school. Although the language of the classrooms on the reservation is English, the language of the corridors is Keres, a Pueblo language preserved largely by the isolation of the 2,500-member tribe.
"What you get when you put Keres speakers with Keres speakers is Keres speakers," said Sharon Alt, who has been principal at Algodones Elementary for three years.
"Some San Felipe kids come here with pre-primer reading skills in fifth and sixth grade," said one San Felipe parent who works as a teacher's aide at Algodones. Like many involved in the dispute, she requested anonymity, but said that her own daughter had had to repeat third grade after coming to Algodones. "Now she's O.K. I think the integration helped her. What I'm doing is best for my child."
"I want my daughter to be ready to go out in the world on her own," said Ms. Candelaria. A single mother with two children younger than Valyn, she works as a police dispatcher in nearby Bernalillo.
 
A Precarious Economy
 As much as the Keres language and the community traditions link the San Felipe tribe to the past, wire fences, pickup trucks and television radar dishes link it to an economically precarious present. Agriculture, crafts and cattle, mainstays of the tribal economy, are not always a sufficient economic underpinning for the 19 Pueblo tribes sprinkled along the Rio Grande from Taos, near Colorado, to the desert south of Albuquerque.
For a generation or more, some San Felipe tribal members have earned their living off the reservation. But most young children were educated on the reservation. Not until the mid-1980's did large number of families living on the reservation began to move their children to Algodones.
Since she arrived as Algodones principal in 1987, Ms. Alt said, she has sought several meetings with tribal officials to see if the two schools can work together. She was granted only one audience, and the participating tribal officials made no comment on her requests.
Lawrence Trancosa, a tribal spokesman, would not comment on any aspect of the dispute, saying it was an internal tribal matter. But the effects of disobedience have already been felt by some parents.
"They call you Anglo if you do" send your children to Algodones, said the teacher's aide. "They put a label on you. The older people look down on you." She said one woman who came to baby-sit had asked what the family ate and what the house was like, as if dwelling and diet would be radically different from others in the tribe.
 
Money Is at Stake
 Legally, the tribes' authority is circumscribed by the 1968 Indian Civil Rights Act. But, lawyers say, a court decision in the 1970's ceded to the tribes the authority to enforce the that act. In many cases, according to lawyers familiar with Indian issues, Tribal Council members making the laws are the same people called on to judge their constitutionality.
Choices between schools have direct financial consequences for the winning and losing institutions. State and Federal education funding is based on enrollment. Each defection drains $2,500 from San Felipe Elementary, Ed Dolan, principal of the San Felipe School, said.
Eight years ago, there were no San Felipe children at Algodones, and enrollment at San Felipe was more than 350. Now, Mr. Dolan said, defections have cost $150,000 for this school year, 15 percent of his $1 million budget. With barely 300 children remaining, he is cutting art, music and sports programs.
"Some people are waking up and saying perhaps we have to be more aggressive about protecting our way of life," said Sam Montoya, a Pueblo Indian who directs the Southern Puebloes Agency, a subsidiary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. "We have existed here for hundreds of years, taking care of ourselves, maintaining our values and our infrastructure. There's an awareness now that, yes, there is a challenge to these values.
"I'm not trying to say that any tribe is trying to shut out the outside world. They're trying to strike a balance betweeen what they feel is a way of life that is unique as compared to taking advantage of the new technology and the new opportunities provided by the other world."
But Sharon Alt, the Algodones principal, said: "My feeling is that no one has the right to coerce anyone. Parents should have supreme power over their kids' education."
The dissident families seem to want the best of the two worlds.
"My father's been very supportive," Bonnie Candelaria said. "My parents say, 'Your kids come first.' My father teaches them the Indian way at home. At school they'll get the English way. They can go by both."

GRAPHIC: Photos: "We want our kids to learn to adapt to the world out there, rather than the world in here," said Bonnie Candelaria, who registered her daughter, Valyn, left,at the public school in Algodones, N.M., rather than the school on the Pueblo Indian reservation. With them were Valyn's 2-year-old sister, Jovita.; Almost half the pupils at the Algodones school are from the Pueblo reservation, to the great dismay of tribal leaders.

HEADLINE: Strong Words For Bankers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 23

 BODY:
In a break with the dogged optimism of the American Bankers Association convention here, the Comptroller of the Currency, Robert L. Clarke, chastised the industry today for bringing upon itself a decline in public confidence.
Mr. Clarke, the nation's top bank regulator, told the convention that the industry's reputation was at its lowest level in 50 years.
The meeting is taking place as the industry grapples with a slumping economy, anxiety over loan losses and political fallout from the savings and loan crisis. But banking leaders have maintained that the industry over all is strong.
Mr. Clarke suggested that the industry would have further difficulties if it did not shore up its standing with the general public and legislators.
He said many bankers had lost sight of such basics as sound lending practices and diversification of risks.
"Recent experience has again brought home the lesson that there is no substitute for following the fundamentals," he said. "But, as banking's current reputation proves, profound damage occurs from the failure to follow it."

HEADLINE: Holtzman Cuts Estimate Of the City's Budget Gap

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman released a report yesterday revising her estimate of New York City's budget gap to $2 billion, from $2.6 billion, for the fiscal year that starts next July, but she warned that the city faced losing from 31,000 to 51,600 workers through layoffs and attrition.
The release of the report was the second time this month that Ms. Holtzman's office had publicly disputed figures put out by Mayor David N. Dinkins's office, but her new estimate comes closer to the Mayor's predictions. On the day Ms. Holtzman made her original estimate, Mr. Dinkins's office estimated the budget gap at about $1.5 billion. His budget director has warned that the work force might have to be cut by 15,000. 
 Ms. Holtzman's first estimate raised questions about the severity of the city's financial problems and the administration's ability to deal with them. It dealt only with the budget gap and not with estimates of job losses.
The new, less-pessimistic estimate is based on the assumption that no wage increases will be granted to municipal unions this year. The earlier estimate assumed that all municipal unions would receive a 5.5 percent wage increase in the current fiscal year, matching the one awarded the teachers' union, and a 5 percent increase in fiscal 1992. It also assumed increases in benefits of 0.3 percent.
 
Criticized as Overly Pessimistic
 Ms. Holtzman warned, however, that if the city kept its pledge to give the teachers a 5.5 percent raise and settled with the other unions at 4.5 percent, it might mean a reduction of 51,583 jobs through a combination of layoffs and attrition. Even if the city reversed the agreement with the teachers and froze all other wages, it would still have to reduce its work force by 30,926, the report said.
The Mayor's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said Ms. Holtzman's latest report was overly pessimistic. He said it was too early to make predictions about budget gaps and job reductions beyond his warning that the city might have to cut its work force by 15,000.
The report was dismissed by Barry L. Feinstein, the president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is in contract negotiations with the city. The teamsters and the municipal unions have demanded a raise equal to the 5.5 percent given to city teachers.
 
Four Possibilities Cited
 "Liz Holtzman is a fumbling economic forecaster," Mr. Feinstein said. "Two weeks ago, she predicted a budget deficit of $2.6 billion, and today, $2 billion. Maybe next week it will be $1.5 billion, and eventually it will get down to the point where we can reach an agreement. She has lost crediblity in this arena with this kind of behavior."
Ms. Holtzman said her new estimates were conservative, noting that she did not take into consideration the possibilities of cutbacks in Federal and state aid or a further downturn in the local economy.
The report lays out four possibilities that include everything from a wage increase of 4.5 percent for city employees to a wage freeze and a rollback of the teachers' 5.5 percent raise.
Whatever the differences between the new report and the Mayor's forecasts, Mr. Michael conceded that the city's fiscal future was grim. "I believe there is a high likelihood of significant numbers of layoffs," he said.

HEADLINE: Disney Turns to Japanese For Future Film Financing

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said today that it would finance most of its future films through a new partnership with Japanese investors and banks.
The deal marks the largest investment yet by the Japanese in American films, aside from the Sony Corporation's $3.5 billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures. 
 The new partnership, which includes Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's largest investment firms, and a consortium including several large Japanese banks, will initially raise $600 million for Disney, enough to finance at least 30 movies, or more than a year's production. The partnership is expected to raise more money in the future.
The deal is the second in a month to bring Japanese money into Disney. In September, Disney formed a joint venture with Interscope Communications, the production company that made "Three Men and a Baby," and a group that includes Nomura Securities of Japan. Under that arrangement, Japanese investors will provide at least $50 million for Interscope to make a number of films for Disney.
The partnership announced today will replace Disney's film-financing arrangement with Silver Screen Partners, an investment group that has raised more than $1 billion for Disney movies in recent years. Unlike other big studios, Disney has chosen to finance films through outside investors, sharing the rewards when it has a hit but spreading the risk for the flops. Such arrangements allow Disney access to financing without having to put the debt on its own books.
Disney executives said the deal provided significantly better terms for the studio than anything Silver Screen could offer. The Japanese partnership, called Touchwood Pacific Partners I, will provide the financing at a considerably lower interest rate than Silver Screen could offer, taking advantage of the relatively low interest rates in Japan.
The new partnership also agreed not to demand any guarantees of minimum financial performance from Disney films. Under the arrangements with Silver Screen, Disney agreed to guarantee that investors would at least get their principal back if its slate of films performed poorly.
In essence, the deal is a bet by Yamaichi and the other investors that Disney will maintain its consistent success in film making. While the company has had its share of flops, its overall slate of films has ranked at or near the top of the box-office charts for the last five years.
 
'Shared Risk and Reward'
 "The concept of shared risk and reward in our overall movie slate is a very healthy business strategy," said Jeffrey Katzenberg, the head of Disney's film operations. "This is a very, very attractive deal for us and a very attractive deal for them."
Of the initial $600 million to be raised for Disney by Touchwood, $180 million is to come from the sale of limited partnerships in Japan by Yamaichi.
The remaining $420 million will come from loans to Touchwood by Fuji Bank Ltd., the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., and other international banks including Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Stage Rally As Recession Fears Ease

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of copper futures surged yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange in a powerful rally ignited by fading recession fears and fanned by computer-generated buying.
Copper futures settled 3.55 cents to 5.2 cents higher, with the contract for spot delivery at $1.322 a pound. 
 The rally marked copper's fourth straight daily advance after the spot price touched a three-month low of $1.2315 last Wednesday.
Analysts said the recent decline reflected pessimism about the economy and perceptions that industrial demand for copper would slacken in a recession.
But recession fears have eased as oil prices have fallen, and many speculators who sold copper futures in anticipation of a further decline bought back those contracts yesterday after signs appeared that industrial users were buying copper, analysts said.
"People started thinking the slowdown might not be as bad as formerly thought and demand for copper might not be as adversely impacted," said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
Analysts said buying interest was also fueled by the London Metal Exchange's weekly report on warehouse stocks of copper, which showed an unexpectedly large decline of 5,075 metric tons, to 192,424.
The rise in prices prompted large-scale buying by speculative funds whose trading decisions are based on computerized analysis of price charts and other market information, analysts said.
Platinum futures rose sharply for the fifth straight day on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Like copper, prices of platinum, an industrial metal, fell dramatically when recession fears were on the rise.
In addition to a letup in recession worries, "some people are thinking that with oil prices breaking like they have recently, we could see some moderation of interest rates, which might be supportive," said William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch.
Platinum settled $9.90 to $10.10 higher, with October at $422.40 an ounce.
Soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late technical rally that helped raise corn prices. Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 1/2 cent higher.
Strong cash markets took precedence over Monday's bearish Government cattle-on-feed report to lift most cattle futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Journal;
Planners Offer Vision In Area Without Dream

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 23

 BODY:
To most out-of-towners, North Philadelphia is a decrepit Amtrak station, a whistle-stop where conductors openly worry about the safety of the few who disembark. To the people who live there, many of them black, North Philadelphia is a place without a dream.
That was the assessment of a group of urban experts, assembled last weekend from around the country by the American Institute of Architects to evaluate the section and to suggest solutions to its problems. The 11 volunteers slipped into town last Thursday night, and like a SWAT team searching for suspects, they swept through the area, held meetings, took tours and talked to community leaders. 
 The exercise was part of a 23-year-old voluntary program of the institute, Regional/Urban Design Assistance Teams. The institute sifts through applications from local organizations, choosing sites that seem to hold the most promise for change. It then recruits team members from whatever discipline seems appropriate for each project. On average, the institute sends out four teams a year, on projects from public land use in Vancouver, Wash., to growth management in Kansas City, Mo.
"The purpose of Rudat is to get a fresh perspective on a problem from a group of outside professionals who wouldn't be influenced by the local power structure," said Peter C. McCall, an institute spokesman. "The team's recommendations are intended to serve as a catalyst for community action, and we have a successful track record in that regard."
North Philadelphia, once the heart of the city's manufacturing industry, is just north of the city's downtown and sprawls east toward the Delaware River and west toward the Schuylkill. About 17 percent of the city's population, or about 275,000 people, live there; 69 percent of them are black and 15 percent Hispanic.
The area's most important institution is Temple University. Connie Mack Stadium, where the Athletics played baseball until they moved to Kansas City in 1954 and where the Phillies played until they moved to Veterans Stadium in South Philadelphia in 1970, was gutted by fire and demolished in 1976.
"North Philadelphia is the city's largest area of physical decay along with having the most concentrated poverty in the city," said Barbara J. Kaplan, executive director of the City Planning Commission. "But despite all the poverty, it has a significant percentage of homeownership, ranging from about 38 to 60 percent in different areas, and that is a real strength."
Enter the experts. Led by Clifford Graves, a San Diego city planner, team members included Roosevelt Grier, the former Los Angeles Rams lineman who is now a specialist in youth programs; Dale Menkhaus, an assistant police chief of Cincinnati, and Gus Newport, a former Mayor of Berkeley, Calif. The team also included architects, urban planners, a sociologist, an economist and a transportation specialist.
By Monday afternoon the team had finished a detailed report with recommendations for improving many services in the area, including housing, day care, education and transportation. The experts noted that the neighborhood had no fewer than 900 separate assistance programs operating independently.
The report did not offer any instant solutions for financing the reconstruction of North Philadelphia. It did, however, suggest that existing resources could be put to better use.
On Monday night, the team held a town meeting and dreamed aloud about a utopian North Philadelphia, a place with a Crystal Palace for a train station, a glass-sided School for the Creative and Performing Arts and a Grand Civic Plaza.
"The children will have the opportunity to perform in the Grand Civic Plaza," said M. David Lee, an urban designer from Boston and a team member, "at which time there will be food and vegetables and produce and products of the hands and minds of North Philadelphians to sell to each other and to the people from outside who just have to come and find out what all this is about."
In response, the audience of several hundred stood up in the Stanton Elementary School auditorium and began clapping and chanting:
 
We're going to build!
We're going to build North Phila delphia!
We're going to do it ourselves!
We tore it down and we're going to build it back! Amen!

HEADLINE: Prices of Oil Viewed as Stabilized

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices stabilized yesterday after a record drop the day before took futures prices below $30 a barrel.
Crude for December delivery settled at $29.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $1.04 from the previous day's December bid.
But that price was about $1 higher than the mark set by the expired November contract, which plummeted a record $5.41, to $28.38, on its last day of trading on Monday.
 
Limits Imposed by Exchange
 December contracts did not fall as far as November on Monday because of daily limits imposed by the exchange on contracts beyond the near month. The December contract was pressed lower yesterday to narrow that gap, but analysts were not sure whether to characterize the move as an increase or a decrease.
"It's tricky," said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "Stabilization is the best word."
January and February crude contracts fell along with December, but later contract months were higher.
"We're having a little bit of confusion," said Thomas Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "They're not exactly sure where they want to take the market."
 
Peace Called More Likely
 Those analysts following crude prices said the market was definitely viewing peace in the Persian Gulf as more likely than war.
Crude's record fall on Monday occurred as traders responded to reports of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq having a dream in which a prophet told him his rockets were pointed in the wrong direction.
Prices also had fallen on statements from a ranking Saudi official that were construed as indicating Iraq might be able to keep some Kuwaiti territory in a negotiated settlement of the crisis.
 
Some Ground Recovered
 Refined petroleum products recovered some ground from Monday's plunge, moving higher for next-month delivery, with later months mixed.
Home heating oil was 5.08 cents higher at 81.06 cents a gallon for November delivery. Contracts for subsequent months were mixed.
Unleaded gasoline was 3.40 cents higher at 79.90 cents a gallon for November delivery, with later months trading mostly lower.
Natural gas prices were higher yesterday, rising 1.5 cents, to $2.52 for 1,000 cubic feet for December delivery. Other contract months moved up as well.
