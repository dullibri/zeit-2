HEADLINE: Banks Lost $744 Million in Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The nation's banks lost $744 million from July to September after earning record profits in the first half of the year, Government regulators said today.
The quarterly loss, the first in more than two years, occurred mainly because large banks added to their reserves against losses from troubled loans to developing countries.
Although adding to their reserves cut their third-quarter profits, the moves should put the banks in a stronger position to negotiate with debtor countries, regulatory officials have said. 
 
Risks in Real Estate
But another source of problems for banks has emerged: risky real estate lending. The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, L. William Seidman, said he was concerned that souring real estate loans posed a serious threat to the industry.
As head of the agency that insures deposits in banks, Mr. Seidman urged the nation's 12,824 banks, which have stepped up their real estate lending recently, to be careful. ''The caution light is flashing,'' he said.
''We hope that banks will take a hard look at the real estate lending that is causing the problems,'' Mr. Seidman said.
The problems are concentrated in loans for development and commercial real estate rather than single-family home loans, he said.
 
A Rapidly Growing Sector
Regulators are particularly concerned by the rapid rise in real estate lending. Mr. Seidman said real estate loans, which accounted for 25 percent of all commercial bank loans in 1983, now make up 35 percent of the total.
The banks' problems are reminiscent of the savings and loan industry's woes, which led Congress to approve a $159 billion bailout of the industry earlier this year.
A number of savings and loan institutions in the Southwest became insolvent as real estate loans turned sour, but experts say real estate problems are less severe in other regions where economies are stronger.
The states with banks showing the highest proportion of bad real estate loans are Arizona, Texas and Alaska, Mr. Seidman said. As for commercial real estate, Connecticut has the highest vacancy rate, he said.
The banking industry's poor results in the third quarter contrast with record profits of $7.3 billion in the first quarter and $7 billion in the second quarter. Banks earned a record profit of $25.2 billion last year.
 
A Previous Loss
The industry's quarterly loss was the first since the second quarter of 1987, when banks lost $10.6 billion, again because they raised their loss reserves for loans to third world countries.
Some of the nation's largest banks again took write-downs in the third quarter on their loans to developing countries. J. P. Morgan & Company increased its loss reserves by $2 billion; the Chase Manhattan Corporation, by $1.3 billion, and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corporation, by $950 million.
Mr. Seidman said the most recent decisions to raise reserves were appropriate, and he predicted profits in the fourth quarter would be back around the levels of the first half, although, he said, the deterioration in real estate loans will probably continue.
He said next year should be better because the current number of problem banks, 1,134, has fallen from 1,394 at the start of the year.
So far this year, 192 banks have failed. The total is likely to surpass 200 before the year is out but should be under last year's total of 220, Mr. Seidman said.

HEADLINE: Output Up By 2.5% in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
American workers made modest productivity gains in the third quarter, but the lackluster manufacturing sector posted its lowest output gain in three years and continued to slow the overall economy.
And for the first time this year, the quarter-to-quarter hourly wage gains made by workers outpaced the growth in consumer inflation, the Labor Department said today.
The department said overall productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy increased at a revised annual rate of 2.5 percent in the July-to-September period. This was moderately better than the 2.1 percent gain reported in preliminary data and more than double the anemic 1.1 percent annualized gain in the second quarter. 
But in manufacturing, a sector weakened by slumping automobile sales and other problems, productivity increased at a revised annual rate of just 1 percent after improving at a rate of 3.7 percent in the April-to-June period.
 
Slack Demand for Goods
The poor manufacturing performance came as output rose at a rate of just 1.2 percent and the number of hours worked increased at a rate of two-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting slackened demand for goods. The increase in output was the smallest since a slight decline in the second quarter of 1986.
Because of the poor productivity gain in manufacturing and a significant increase in wages, unit labor costs, a key determinant of future inflation, rose at at an annual rate of 4.9 percent after decreasing by 1 percent in the second quarter. It was the largest increase in unit labor costs since the 1982 recession, the department said.
Analysts said that increase would probably translate into either higher prices for consumers or lower profits for producers, or both. They also said such wage increases made it more difficult for American manufacturers to compete in overseas markets.
The overall 2.5 percent annualized productivity gain in the non-farm sector came as output rose at a rate of 3.7 percent in the third quarter while hours worked grew at a much slower annual rate of 1.3 percent.
For the overall non-farm sector, the data on unit labor costs were more encouraging. Costs for each good produced rose at a revised annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter after rising at a rapid 4.5 percent rate in the previous quarter.

HEADLINE: Fed Says It Sold Dollars in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve actively sold dollars from August through October in an effort to prevent further appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, the central bank reported yesterday.
The heavy sales in the August-through-October period, totaling $5.8 billion, followed a record $11.9 billion of dollar sales by the Fed in the previous three months. Despite the intervention by the Fed and other central banks, analysts attributed the stabilization of the dollar since mid-October to changes in interest rates and economic conditions. 
The report by Sam Y. Cross, executive vice president of the Fed, said that the sharp decline in American stock prices on Oct. 13 caused concerns about a pullback in the heavy foreign investment that had been helping push the dollar higher. While the flow of Japanese capital to dollar investments continues to keep the dollar strong relative to the yen, he said that conditions in West Germany had caused the dollar to decline sharply against the mark recently.
 
Little Intervention Lately
Since the end of October, analysts said, there has been little intervention by the Fed and other central banks and the dollar is down from the late-summer levels that had caused economic policy makers in the Group of Seven industrialized countries to issue a statement on Sept. 23 warning that the dollar's rise was undesirable and further increases would hurt world economic growth.
''There is no longer any voice from the United States claiming that the dollar needs to be pushed down,'' said Mieczyslaw Karczmar, a New York economic adviser to the Deutsche Bank of West Germany. He said the dollar had weakened significantly against the mark in recent weeks because the West German economy was booming and the country's central bank had raised short-term interest rates. Prospects for more commerce with East Germany and Eastern Europe are likely to sustain the strength of the West German economy.
The dollar traded late yesterday at about 1.765 West German marks, down from slightly more than 2 marks on Sept. 15 and 1.84 marks at the end of October.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The New Lure Of 'Junk Bonds'

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
WHILE their numbers are small, a few professional money managers are beginning to edge back into the ''junk bond'' market, attracted by the flea-market philosophy that almost anything can be sold if the price is low enough.
Today's junk bond prices are certainly low, driven down by fears that a recession will make deadbeats of many of the heavily indebted companies that have issued the bonds. Junk bonds, which are corporate debt securities deemed too risky to qualify as ''investment grade,'' began weakening in September and fell sharply during the stock market selloff of Oct. 13. They have weakened even further since then. 
Moreover, skeptics point out, the market must still weather the publicity that will attend the coming criminal trial of Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert's former junk bond specialist. Also, there is a likelihood of one or more major corporate defaults in the next six months.
None of that alarms Frank Cappiello Jr., a partner of the investment firm of McCullough, Andrews & Cappiello in Baltimore and a frequent panelist on the public television program ''Wall Street Week.''
''I've been watching this market over the past two years, and the prices are so low now that there's really minimal risk,'' Mr. Cappiello said. ''We're looking at a washed-out group.'' Mr. Cappiello is sufficiently confident of the profits to be found in the junk market that he has signed on to manage the Diversified High Income Series, a new junk bond fund first offered for sale last Thursday. The new fund is one of four new open-end mutual funds being managed by Mr. Cappiello and the Carnegie Capital Management Company, which is based in Cleveland. The fund will be marketed through regional brokerage houses under the Carnegie-Capiello Trust label.
Mr. Cappiello does not have a lot of company in his mutual-fund foray into junk bonds. But he is not entirely alone. According to Elizabeth Johns, editor of the mutual fund newsletter published by the research firm of Charles E. Simon & Company in Washington, nine other junk bond funds were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission this year. But only four have actually been offered on the market.
''We tend to see high-yield bond funds sitting in registration longer than other funds, as their managers wait for an opportune moment to bring them out,'' Ms. Johns said. Of the four new funds being sold, only the Franklin Multi-Income Trust made its debut after the stock market sold off heavily on Oct. 13.
The Franklin product, first offered on Oct. 23, is a closed-end fund, representing a fixed portfolio of bonds. The fund trades in the market like a common stock. Because investors sell their closed-end shares on the market, rather than selling them back to the fund, closed-end portfolio managers are not forced to sell bonds into an already declining market just to raise cash for redemptions.
That is a big asset for junk bond funds these days, given the bumpy road ahead, said John J. McElroy, a partner and chief investment strategist for 1838 Partners Investment Advisers in Philadelphia, a pension fund management company that broke off from Drexel Burnham Lambert two years ago. ''It will take a year, maybe more, for confidence to fully return to the market,'' Mr. McElroy said. ''The trouble with an open-end fund is that the very time you shouldn't be selling is when you have to sell.''
Still, Mr. McElroy is among the small band of investment managers who are looking over the junk bond market. ''It is something we are interested in,'' he said. ''My professional assessment has always been that the time to buy something is when nobody wants it. I think that fresh money coming in will be able to get a good bargain, so long as you are a long-term investor.''
One sign of improving demand for junk bonds came yesterday as Morgan Stanley & Company went to market with an $850 million junk bond offering for a new entity jointly owned by Morgan and Jefferson Smurfit. Unlike some previous junk deals, which have been postponed or restructured, yesterday's deal went smoothly, with institutional money mangers lining up to buy the bonds. The new entity will use the money to acquire and recapitalize Jefferson Smurfit and the Container Corporation of America.
No one is saying that the junk bond market is not still very risky. ''You will continue to have periodic problem credits that go sour in a very public way,'' said Gail Silberman, a vice president at Jefferies & Company in New York.
But the yields on junk bonds today exceed the yield on Treasury bonds by almost as much as the equivalent corporate bonds did during the Depression.''At those levels, you are being adequately paid to take the risk,'' Ms. Silberman said. ''In fact, I'm investing some of my personal funds in junk bonds.''
Some investment managers noted that some junk bond issuers have been entering the market in recent weeks to repurchase some of their own bonds at today's substantial discounts. ''They're not buying big,'' one portfolio manager said. ''But they are buying, which means that their bankers are giving them permission to use their excess cash or lines of credit for the purchases. This market still has a lot of potholes ahead, but that is a group of buyers that could add some stability.''

HEADLINE: Dow Retreats by 4.91 Points, to 2,736.77

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices tracked a weak bond market to lower ground yesterday, as the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.91 points, to 2,736.77.
Declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances, 767 to 714, and volume contracted to 145.9 million shares, from 154.6 million on Tuesday.
''The Dow's close was within 55 points of its all-time high of 2,791.41 and it has appreciated 26 percent so far in 1989.'' said Harold A. Mackinney, head of the investment policy committee at the Fleet/Northstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I. ''Investors are reluctant to take the market to new highs in the face of obvious current weakness in corporate profits.'' 
He said that as the end of the year approaches, portfolio managers will be eager to show clients that they have a fairly full position in equities, thus limitng their downside potentential.
Some traders said investors appeared to be marking time until unemployment and non-farm payroll figures for November are released tomorrow. Current estimates are that unemployment will be in a range of 5.3 to 5.4 percent and non-farm payrolls at about 180 million.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that productivity in the non-farm sector had improved at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, while hours worked increased at a slower 1.3 percent, a sign of weakening demand for goods.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock dropped 1.03 points, to 348.55, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.37, to 192.82.
 
Bank Stocks Weaken
Bank stocks weakened after a Government report found that the nation's commercial banks lost $744 million in the third quarter, partly because of rising real estate loan problems.
Wells Fargo dropped 2 5/8, to 71 3/8, after Adam Starr, an analyst with the First Manhattan Corporation, downgraded the company's stock to ''sell'' from ''hold,'' citing problems with real estate and leveraged buyout portfolios.
At the same time, First Interstate Bancorp fell 1 1/4, to 52, while it was the most active issue on a volume of 3.6 million shares.
McGraw-Hill fell 2 points, to 61 1/2, after the company announced that it would cut jobs and take other steps that will adversely affect 1989 earnings by a larger amount than Wall Street had expected, analysts said.
I.B.M., which on Tuesday announced that it would reduce its work force by more than 10,000 and take a $2.3 billion charge against fourth-quarter earnings, dropped 1, to 98 5/8.
Chevron rose 1 1/4, to 72. The company said it had sold 14.1 million shares of newly issued common stock to the employee stock ownership plan formed last week at a price of $70.75 cents a share, for a total of about $1 billion.
Active blue chips included General Electric, unchanged at 63 3/8; Philip Morris, off 1/2, to 42 1/4; BankAmerica, off 1 3/8, to 26, and Ford Motor, unchanged at 45 1/4.

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
Defaults by Bond Issuers May Be Highest of Decade

 BODY:
Defaults by bond issuers are likely to reach the highest levels of the decade this year, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said yesterday.
The rating agency issued a statement predicting that about 40 companies would default on bond debt in 1989, up from 33 in 1986, the record until this year. It said the rise in defaults, including unrated bond defaults mainly by smaller companies, would continue into 1990.
''We foresee a likely further increase in corporate defaults, especially among highly leveraged speculative-grade credits; possibly as much as twice the current level,'' said Christopher L. Baldwin, director of Moody's energy, technology, and communications rating unit. Mr. Baldwin made his comments earlier in the week at a gathering of corporate investors in New York.
He cited four factors likely to fuel defaults next year: a slowing economy; excessive debt burdens of industrial companies coupled with overly optimistic predictions for sales and profit growth; the disarray in the ''junk bond'' market, and a tightening of bank lending standards for leveraged buyouts.
The negative outlook is supported by both the current pace of downgrades and the magnitude of credit ratings now under review by Moody's, he said. For the first 10 months of 1989, he said, 134 junk bond issues were downgraded to lower ratings within the speculative-grade categories of Ba-1 to C.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines as Traders Remain Focused on Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most primary foreign currencies in worldwide trading yesterday as dealers kept their buying interest focused on West German marks.
Gold prices edged slightly higher in the United States after turning in a mixed performance overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery ended at $404.90 an ounce, up $1.40 from late Tuesday. 
Currency dealers received an incentive to sell dollars from reports that a United States Treasury official said the dollar's recent decline against the mark was not alarming, said Thomas J. Palladino, an assistant vice president in the New York office of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank.
The remark, attributed to David C. Mulford, Treasury Under Secretary, was interpreted to mean that Washington would not intervene aggressively in foreign exchange markets to stem the dollar's slide against the mark.
''It seems everybody is looking for a lower dollar,'' Mr. Palladino said. ''It's more of a mark driven market than a dollar-driven market.''
Some dealers said the strength of the West German economy justified the rise in the mark's value.
The demand for marks has surged as the borders between East and West Germany have crumbled. The assumption is that liberalizations in East Germany and elsewhere in Eastern Europe could make the West German economy boom, possibly leading to higher interest rates there.
Higher interest rates in West Germany would tend to increase returns on mark-denominated investments.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 144.02 yen, up from 143.79 yen late on Tuesday. And the pound rose to $1.5765, from $1.5700.
Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.7772 West German marks, down from 1.7775; 1.5890 Swiss francs, down from 1.5915; 6.0690 French francs, down from 6.0670; 1,303.25 Italian lire, down from 1,309.50, and 1.16115 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1633.
The prices for precious metals were mixed, and gold lost ground on several world markets as dealers sold to collect profits amassed during the recent surge in gold prices.
Gold bullion prices dropped in London, a critical market, but were higher in Zurich, at $400 to $405 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Harland Bartholomew, 100, Dean of City Planners

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Harland Bartholomew, the dean of comprehensive city planning in the United States, died Saturday at his home in Clayton, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. He was 100 years old.
Mr. Bartholomew, a consulting engineer, was appointed to Federal planning committees by three Presidents, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
In 1941 President Roosevelt appointed Mr. Bartholomew to a committee to recommend a limited system of national highways. He also helped plan the Metro subway system in Washington, and he represented the Rockefeller interests in the restoration of historic Williamsburg, Va.
President Eisenhower appointed Mr. Bartholomew chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission a position he held for seven years, A City Planner in Newark Mr. Bartholomew became the nation's first full-time city planner in 1914, when he went to work for the city of Newark. Two years later he went to St. Louis as a city engineer, and he later opened a consulting firm, Harland Bartholomew & Associates, which now has its headquarters in Memphis. He retired in 1965. His firm prepared comprehensive plans for more than 500 cities and counties, including Bal Horbour, Fla., St. Croix, V.I., and Grand Bahama Island in the Bahamas. Mr. Bartholomew also prepared plans for the reconstruction of the resort community of Bar Harbor, Me., after two-thirds of it was destroyed by a forest fire in 1947.
His firm also assisted in the preparation of many zoning ordinances. including a statewide ordinance for Hawaii.
He was an early advocate of slum clearance and city planning, and served on the national Slum Clearance Advisory Committee. His ideas helped shape the Housing Act of 1937 and the Housing Act of 1949.
Mr. Bartholomew was born in Stoneham, Mass., and received his civil engineering training at Rutgers University. He taught civic design at the University of Illinois from 1918 to 1956.
Mr. Bartholomew, who was widowed three times, is survived by five stepchildren: George Ball of Travers City, Mich., Barbara Cosden of Manhattan, Dorothy Friestedt of Washington and Georganne Pollnow and R. F. Funston Jr., both of St. Louis. He is also survived by three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Union Wonders if It Can Trust Owners

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 6

 BODY:
Mistrust of owners and treatment of younger players were the most widely discussed topics today at a meeting of the Major League Baseball Players Association's executive board.
The union representatives discussed those matters as they began to develop their proposals for a new collective-bargaining agreement. They will continue working on proposals at their session Thursday. 
Don Mattingly, the Yankees' player representative, appeared at a news briefing with Donald Fehr, the association's executive director, and summarized the concerns the players expressed during the meeting.
''There's a major distrust in the basic agreement we signed in 1985,'' Mattingly said. ''We basically look at it as having no meaning. Directly after that, collusion came about. There's a lot of problems believing we can trust that things we talk about and put in the basic agreement are going to be followed through.''
 
Younger Players Speak Up
The younger players on the executive board, Mattingly added, demonstrated a ''very strong interest in making sure that we take care of'' the younger players, those in their first three years in the major leagues.
''They felt they were left out of and taken advantage of in the last agreement,'' Mattingly said. ''There was a major discussion about taking care of these guys and making sure we do some things about the way they're treated in the first three years.''
In the 1985 negotiations, the union agreed to change the eligibility requirement for salary arbitration from two years in the majors to three years, thus forcing players to wait an extra year to gain the bargaining leverage of arbitration.
''The only reason the salary arbitration change was ever made,'' Fehr said, ''was in response to owners' claims of financial distress. Whatever merits those ever had - I don't think it had any - even the owners now concede that there is no merit to those arguments.''
The owners have acknowledged the players' concerns in the areas of trust and younger players. At the start of negotiations last week, they said they wanted to improve relations with the players and gain their trust. They also said their proposal for a new salary system would remedy any problems experienced by players in their first three years.
Under the system, salaries for players who have been in the majors from one year through five years would be determined by a pay-for-performance scale. The plan would eliminate salary arbitration, but, the owners say, it would increase the salaries for the younger players. ----Owners Call for 'Partnership' NASHVILLE, Dec. 6 - The major leagues closed their business meetings today with a call for an economic partnership with the players but with a pointed reminder that the club owners would press for a labor agreement to avoid a strike or lockout in spring training.
''We want an agreement in place to protect the season,'' said Charles O'Connor, the owners' new labor negotiator. ''And that includes spring training.''
Commissioner Fay Vincent said the labor issue had occupied the owners for the major part of their joint meeting today. They were briefed for nearly two hours by O'Connor, the lawyer who became their chief negotiator when Barry Rona was forced to resign the day before the clubs opened negotiations with the Players Association on a new basic agreement, or industry code.
Both Vincent and O'Connor were vague in reporting on the meeting. But O'Connor repeated the recent emphasis on conciliation, at least in tone, and said:
''We talked about achieving a better relationship on labor relations. We must forge an economic partnership for the future.''

HEADLINE: Mexican Politicians Look North of Border

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The migration of millions of Mexican workers into the United States in search of jobs has brought a new influx: Mexican politicians and leaders in search of their influence, money and votes.
While such contacts have always existed, dramatic changes in Mexico in recent months have stirred new interest in the nearly 20 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans living north of the border. The attention is focused mainly on the greater Los Angeles area, which now has the largest concentration of people of Mexican origin, about three million, anywhere outside Mexico City.
With Mexican politics suddenly competitive, representatives of Mexico's three main political parties have visited Southern California recently. And more are expected soon, including the new President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. All sides have begun to see the potential for enlisting Mexicans and Mexican-Americans here to influence both Washington's stance toward Mexico and Mexican domestic policy, much the way American Jews do with Israel. 
 
Some Contradictory Emotions
''There is an awakening on their part, a recognition of their brothers and sisters on this side of the border, a real interest in developing ties,'' said Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a civil rights group.
But all of this has evinced complex and contradictory emotions among Mexican-Americans, who have spent years trying to gain acceptance and power in the American political system. The new approaches from Mexico are not universally welcomed; there is concern that they will aggravate American fears that the loyalty of this linguistic minority may be uncertain.
Representing the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI for its initials in Spanish, Mexico's new Foreign Minister, Fernando Solana, capped a visit to Los Angeles last Friday night with a speech at a black-tie awards dinner held by the Mexican-American civil rights group. Addressing more than 1,000 people at the dinner, he said their community was ''an ideal vehicle'' for better communication with the United States.
 
Visit From Opposition Leader
His visit followed a barnstorming tour last month by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leader of the left-leaning Revolutionary Democratic Party, who lost to Mr. Salinas in the July 1988 Presidential election despite a vigorous challenge to the PRI's 60-year monopoly on power. Hoping to gain support from disaffected Mexicans forced to emigrate because of economic decline at home, he gave many speeches, raised $31,000 and visited leading California liberals like Jane Fonda, Stanley K. Sheinbaum, who is a wealthy patron of liberal causes, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. Earlier this year there was a visit from Manuel Clouthier, leader of the rightist National Action Party, who died in an automobile accident on Oct. 1.
''I receive every week Mexican politicians who come here to do politics,'' said Sergio Munoz, executive editor of La Opinion, the largest Spanish-language newspaper here.
Mr. Cardenas has proposed that Mexico allow emigres to vote by absentee ballot. Even without absentee voting, Mexican politicians have begun to grasp the political importance of the two-way flow of people, money, technology and ideas across the porous border. Mexicans working in the United States are Mexico's largest source of foreign exchange after tourism. They are concentrated in Texas, Illinois and California. Of the three million people of Mexican descent in the Los Angeles area, about one-third are believed to be Mexican nationals, here legally or illegally.
 
Dissatisfaction in Mexico
''The U.S. is still a foreign culture to Mexicans,'' said Richard Maullin, a political consultant in Los Angeles with extensive Mexican ties. ''They do not come flocking because they love it here, but to make a living and go back rich. If you were a Cardenas raising complaints about the way Mexico is run, there would be votes here. At the same time, the PRI has to be sensitive to the dissatisfaction.''
''People live here for a while and go back,'' agreed Mr. Munoz. ''If you leave your country you have resentment at the situation that makes that necessary. That dictates a strategy of PRI to win back support.''
The backdrop for this are powerful changes in Mexico. The 1988 Mexican election, the most closely contested in its history, brought Mr. Salinas to power with a vow to modernize Mexico and to integrate it into the world economy. Mr. Salinas, a 41-year-old Harvard-educated economist, lowered nationalistic oratory and brought in a new breed of intellectuals to help him, including Mr. Solana.
This left an opening for the more nationalistic message of Mr. Cardenas, whose father was Lazaro Cardenas, a founder of the PRI in the 1920's and one of Mexico's most beloved Presidents. The younger Mr. Cardenas bolted his father's party, saying it had corrupted his father's legacy. He won 31 percent of the vote against Mr. Salinas's 50 percent, but some say an honest count would have made Mr. Cardenas the President. He is revered among Mexicans here; many of them came from his home state of Michoacan.
 
Attacks on Both Governments
He is widely expected to run again in 1994, and that was what brought him to Los Angeles last month. He met with local editorial writers, did radio interviews, was given a reception at City Hall, held fund-raising events, spoke at California State University, the University of Southern California and other schools and made the keynote speech at the banquet of the Mexican-American Political Association.
He brought a strident message, denouncing both the Bush and Salinas governments for their handling of the drug trade, economic ties, Central American policy, the foreign debt and migration. And he openly appealed to Mexican workers here, calling on the Mexican Government to do more to protect them.
''Most Mexicans that migrate permanently, temporarily or cyclically to the U.S. become in fact citizens of a second class in both countries,'' he said. He urged his Government to use whatever ''leverage'' it could to help them and demanded that they be allowed to cast absentee ballots in Mexican elections.
''Cardenas considers these people as important to bring about democratic change in Mexico,'' said one of his leading backers, Raul Ruiz, a professor of Chicano studies at California State University in Northridge. ''Most here had to come as a result of economic problems. The PRI recognizes that these millions would not necessarily turn into a friendly vote for them.''
 
A Bid to Influence Congress
Mr. Cardenas called on Mexican-Americans to form lobbying groups to influence Congress and the President on behalf of Mexico. ''We are following what the Jews do for Israel,'' said Joe Sanchez, a Los Angeles grocery distributor who backs Mr. Cardenas. ''Mexico cannot change from within.'' The visit of Mr. Solana, the Foreign Minister, was less explicitly political. But he, too, met with opinion makers and gave interviews. And in his speech to the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund he appeared to be responding to Mr. Cardenas's criticisms, saying his Government was protecting the migrants. In a more muted way, he also called on Mexican-Americans to help Mexico's cause.
''Within the context of its new relationship with the United States, the Mexican Government wishes to establish closer ties with the Mexican-American community,'' he said. ''Because of our shared language, beliefs and values, we see the Mexican-American community as an ideal vehicle for better and more effective communication with the United States.''
A key dividing issue is the Cardenas call for an absentee vote for the migrants. The PRI strongly opposes it, and many Mexican-American leaders are also dubious even though they are American citizens and vote in American elections.
 
'A Degree of Skepticism'
''The quandary is that we have a strong civil rights movement in the Mexican-American community,'' said one of its leaders, Prof. Juan Gomez-Quinones of the University of California at Los Angeles, a historian of Mexican-United States relations. ''So along comes somebody who rings a bell and says, 'How about the old country?' It's seen with a degree of skepticism by many Mexican-Americans. But it does resonate with newer immigrants.''
Among those uneasy about the vote was Ms. Hernandez, the civil rights leader. ''We are trying to make a place in this dynamic American society,'' she said, adding that giving the Mexican vote to newer immigrants might feed American stereotypes that all Mexicans are foreigners. ''It's going to make our advancement more difficult.''
Professor Ruiz said he was ''indignant'' that a civil rights leader like Ms. Hernandez would oppose voting rights, regardless of the country in which they are exercised.''It has no negative impact on American citizens of Mexican ancestry,'' he added.
To Mr. Munoz, the newspaper editor, who has worked here for 14 years but remains a Mexican national, this debate is yet another manifestation of Mexico's long and difficult relationship with the United States. ''This reflects the deep contradictions that some Mexicans who live here have not solved yet: how to deal with the country of their ancestors.''

HEADLINE: WESTERN EUROPE MOVES TO EXPAND FREE-TRADE LINKS

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Western European governments plan to announce an agreement later this month to establish a free-trade zone that includes the 12 nations of the European Community and 6 others, diplomats and community officials said in recent days.
The officials said the six nations in the European Free Trade Association - Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - had forged a joint pact with the community to ease the movement of goods, services, capital and people between the two groups.
 
'European Economic Space'
The proposed agreement, expected to be signed on Dec. 19 at a Brussels meeting of foreign and trade ministers from the 18 nations, will give the six smaller countries a special relationship with the community, creating what has been termed a ''European economic space.'' 
The tentative framework for expanding a European common market is a result of the rapid economic and political changes unfolding in both Western and Eastern Europe. In a European Community meeting that begins on Friday, President Francois Mitterrand of France is expected to push for a firm new commitment to rapid economic integration within the community to cope with those changes. [Page D5.] With the 12-member European Community moving to establish a single, barrier-free market by 1992, the small but prosperous nations of the European Free Trade Association are fearful of being excluded. With a total population of just 32 million, the six countries represent the European Community's largest trading partner, buying and selling far more with the community than the United States or Japan.
 
Compromise With Neighbors
For the community, a closer linkage with its nearest neighbors gives its drive to a single market in 1992 greater weight. In addition, it allows the community to offer the nations on its periphery the compromise of economic enfranchisement without membership, thus forestalling a potentially nettlesome issue for the integration of the community.
In Washington, United States trade officials said today that the proposal could make Europe a better trading partner by making it stronger economically.
''This is a further extension of free trade; it is a natural evolution,'' said the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills.
Franklin J. Vargo, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Europe, said the United States was counting on liberal trade and investment decisions to emerge from any new agreements.
With the proposed agreement, the community has presumably set aside for years the issue of taking new members. Austria, for instance, has applied for membership in the community, and there are pressures in other association nations to apply as well.
The tentative agreement for the economic integration of the two Western European groups is also seen as a model for eventually integrating the more politically and economically liberal East bloc nations. Moreover, the recent political developments in Eastern Europe and the warmer tone in East-West relations have made it easier for several association nations, which are committed to neutrality, to form closer links with the community, which is a linchpin of the Western alliance.
Details remain to be negotiated in talks that should begin early next year and take about a year, officials of both groups said. But under the framework drafted in a series of high-level working meetings in recent months, remaining tariffs and quotas would be abolished. Industrial and product standards would be harmonized, and government construction and telecommunications projects opened to outside companies.
Moreover, there is even discussion of setting up some new supranational institutions, like a special court to settle disputes between the groups of nations and a forum to give the association an opportunity to help shape some community decisions. There would also be increased cooperation in areas like education, the environment and research and development.
Foreign and agricultural policy are not covered by the proposed agreement. And the community would still handle its own negotiations on external trade matters, like disputes over dumping or trade barriers, with little reference to the association.
In many ways, the new economic zone would be a happy compromise between the association and the community, whose members are West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece.
 
A Leading Advocate
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, the community's executive branch, has been a leading advocate of creating the envisioned European economic space.
Already, individual association countries already have free-trade agreements with community members for many products, but that level of integration falls far short of the proposed agreement.
About 55 percent of association's exports go to the community, and 27 percent of community exports go to association nations. Last year trade between the groups totaled $220 billion, or $56 billion more than trade between the community and the United States. The association countries have a population roughly a tenth the community's 325 million.
''Each is the other's most important trade partner by a long way,'' said Helen S. Wallace, director of the Western European program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. ''This is important because it is creating a bigger common market, a bigger economic entity.''
 
No 'Fortress Europe' Danger
But Dr. Wallace said the proposed agreement does not seem to carry the danger of a larger but protectionist bloc, the ''Fortress Europe'' feared by many American and Japanese business executives. ''At the moment, there is not an indication that there will be a common policy vis-a-vis the United States or Japan.''
The association members view the proposed agreement as a sensible response to Europe's new economic realities. ''It is a necessity for E.F.T.A. companies to have access to the E.C. market, to be able to compete on an equal basis,'' said Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, Iceland's Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade, who is also chairman of the European Free Trade Association's Council of Ministers.
The European Community has been worried about association nations applying for community membership. Many in the community say they already face enough challenges in creating a single, borderless market by 1992 without taking on more members.
Another obstacle to community membership is the neutrality of several association nations. Norway and Iceland belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as do most of the community nations. But Sweden, Austria and Switzerland are neutral. So is Finland, but it is careful not to antagonize the Soviet Union, with which it shares an 800-mile border, extensive trade relations and a mutual defense agreement.
 
Little Strategic Importance
The community now has one neutral member: Ireland. But it is relatively small and has little strategic importance. Austria, which applied for community membership last summer, was mentioned by some community officials as most troubling to them.
There has been mounting pressure from business leaders in Sweden and Norway to apply to the European Community. Companies in the association nations have been greatly increasing investments in the community. Last year, for the first time, investment by Swedish companies outside Sweden exceeded domestic investment.
Business executives and some opposition parties in the neutral nations are even saying that with East-West tensions subsiding, their countries should re-examine the importance of maintaining their neutrality.
''Most managers believe Sweden sooner or later will be a member of the Common Market,'' said Christer Zetterberg, president of PKbanken, the state-controlled Swedish bank who next spring will become president of AB Volvo, the car maker. The issue of neutrality as an obstacle ''is undergoing a dramatic change'' because of improved East-West relations, he added.
 
Finns Encouraged by Gorbachev
The Finns, who are reluctant to irritate their powerful neighbor to the east, were greatly encouraged by an October visit from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, whose comments they interpreted as giving Helsinki tacit permission to form closer ties with Western Europe by becoming part of the European economic space.
To the Finns' delight, Mr. Gorbachev said he recognized Finland's neutrality and right to set its own social and political policies. ''The message was that we could choose our own way,'' a Finnish diplomat said.
The association and the community also believe the European economic space approach is especially important given the events in Eastern Europe. The developments ''give an added sense of urgency,'' said Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's chief negotatior with the community.
Association leaders have worried that the issue of their nations forging closer ties with the community would become a second priority in the community because of the changes in Eastern Europe.
Many in the community and the association also believe closer, formal ties will enable Western Europe to act with greater unity in helping Eastern Europe move toward democracy and overcome its economic problems. ''The 18 countries will be in a better position to coordinate policies and to pool resources on a scale to be of real assistance to these countries,'' Mr. Hannibalsson said.
 
Integrating the East
In addition, the European economic space approach could serve as a way to integrate Eastern European countries one day with those of Western Europe. The economic zone should not be exclusive to the 18 nations of the community and the association, Frans Andriessen, the community's External Affairs Commissioner, stressed last month.
Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia have expressed interest in joining the community or the association. But for many reasons community officials say it is better to have them or other Eastern European nations become part of the European economic space.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
Quayle Gets Free Rein To Criticize Gorbachev

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The White House, concerned about conservative dissatisfaction with President Bush's warm praise for Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Malta summit, has given Vice President Dan Quayle free rein to criticize the Soviet President and his policies, Administration officials said today.
In a televised interview Wednesday night on the ''Larry King Live'' program on Cable News Network, Mr. Quayle suggested that Mr. Gorbachev probably enjoys more popularity abroad than at home and warned against ''getting caught up in the magnetic personality of Chairman Gorbachev.''
In an interview published by The Washington Post on Tuesday, Mr. Quayle said the Soviet Union had a ''totalitarian system'' that sought ''to create instability in areas like Central America.'' The next day he told editors and reporters of Knight-Ridder newspapers that he should have called the Soviet Union authoritarian rather than totalitarian, but repeated the negative tone of his earlier remarks. 
Mr. Quayle said today in an interview with reporters from the Soviet Government newspaper Izvestia that the Soviet domestic economic problems had not prevented Moscow from giving $7 billion a year in aid to Cuba and $1 billion to Nicaragua. Mr. Quayle said he wondered if the Soviet people knew how much food, shelter and other assistance that money would buy.
On the face of it, the comments seem at odds with Mr. Bush's remarks that Mr. Gorbachev's handling of changes in Eastern Europe ''absolutely mandates new thinking'' in the West's approach to Moscow.
On Wednesday, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, described Mr. Quayle's comments as ''strange,'' and likened him to a character in Russian literature who stubbornly resisted change. ''Like Kozma Prutkov, this noble knight is in the same position, sitting on a stone while the world is changing,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. Speaking in a Different Voice But Mr. Quayle's statements, according to White House officials, Quayle aides and Republican political analysts, do not reflect differences in American policy, but rather a willingness to let the Vice President speak in a different voice about Mr. Gorbachev partly to reassure conservatives.
One top Administration official described the process as an attempt to tailor the optimism of Malta to the skepticism of some of the NATO allies in Brussels and to the criticism in some circles back in Washington.
''We got back here and noticed that while the summit was getting high marks, the euphoria, if there was any, had worn off,'' the official said. ''In fact, with some hard-headed looking around at the actual issues to be negotiated and the possibility of crackdowns, there wasn't any euphoria. At that point White House officials decided that we might have gotten a little bit far out in embracing Gorbachev on the ship and that the Vice President saying what he believed was kind of helpful to the President.''
The Administration's strategy is aimed in part at appealing to and reassuring the Republican Party's right wing. It also allows Mr. Quayle to say things that Mr. Bush or Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d believe but would feel uncomfortable articulating.
 
'Difference in Tonal Quality'
''What the Vice President is doing is articulating a part of U.S. policy: differences with the Soviet Union,'' said David Beckwith, Mr. Quayle's spokesman. ''You can call it a difference in tonal quality. We're all singing from the same songbook but there are different parts. Some people are singing bass, some alto.''
Another White House official put it more bluntly. ''It doesn't hurt to give some reassurance to those people within the party who may have doubts about the Administration's goals and objectives,'' he said.
Among those who expressed skepticism of Mr. Bush's performance at Malta was the former arms control negotiator Paul H. Nitze. At a breakfast interview with reporters this week, Mr. Nitze criticized Mr. Bush's promise to speed up three sets of arms control negotiations and warned against the mood of ''euphoria'' emerging from the summit. ''I don't think Mr. Gorbachev has become a democrat,'' Mr. Nitze said, adding that he ''continues to be a Communist.''
 
A Less Sanguine View
In private briefings since the summit meeting, Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle have reportedly taken a less sanguine view of Mr. Gorbachev's prospects. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., president of the Hudson Institute and a Republican political strategist close to Mr. Quayle, described a meeting at the White House on Wednesday for American foreign policy leaders, including Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former chief American representative at the United Nations, and Zbigniew Bzrezinski, the former national security adviser, as ''a great deal more cautious and prudent'' than some of Mr. Bush's more enthusiastic remarks.
Mr. Daniels added, ''We heard a very sophisticated, realistic attitude about the depth of the problem and the lack of understanding of market economics on part of the Soviets.''
Similarly, at a briefing by Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle for the Congressional leadership today, the difficulty of change in the Soviet Union and lack of agreement between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev on Central America ''were prominent,'' according to one White House official. #2 Different Effects Mr. Quayle's remarks have had the effect of mollifying some conservative Republicans and insulting others.
Paul M. Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, sees Mr. Quayle's approach as ''part of a greater Administration strategy.'' He said, ''It is very useful to have a Vice President say certain things which you want said but you do not want to say for policy reasons.''
L. Brent Bozell, a conservative organizer, on the other hand, described himself as ''offended'' by Mr. Quayle's comments if they reflect a White House strategy to deal with the right. ''What they are saying then is that Bush will state policy and Quayle will throw the bones to the rabid right to keep us at bay,'' Mr. Bozell added. ''We don't have any use for that.''

HEADLINE: Aid to Poland Sets Off a Fight Over Shipping

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
American ships carrying food aid began arriving in Poland last week. But they will deliver less food than they could, critics say, with correspondingly fewer benefits to American farmers, because of a law that results in higher shipping costs.
The cargo preference law, which requires that 75 percent of humanitarian food aid be shipped on United States merchant ships, rather than cheaper foreign vessels, has frustrated agricultural groups. They argue that the extra transportation costs could reduce grain shipments by as much as 40 percent. 
The application of the law to food shipments to Poland was challenged this year by members of Congress. They contended that every dollar of the $125 million in food aid was needed to bolster the shaky economy of Poland and help that country make the transition from a Communist to a more market-driven system.
Representative Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa, who spoke in favor of an amendment in October to suspend the law for Poland, argued that the cost differential between American and foreign ships prevented Poland from getting the most out of the aid. The amendment failed by 178 to 228.
In the House debate, Mr. Grandy cited the example of an American ship that left for Poland with 11,500 tons of grain sorghum at a shipping rate of $84.95 a ton. A Polish ship carrying an identical cargo charged $26 a ton.
 
Shipments Will Be Less
The cost of grain and the cost to transport cargo fluctuate constantly, making it difficult for even the Congressional Budget Office, the budgetary arm of Congress, to estimate the amount of food Poland will receive. But both sides concede that under the cargo preference law the shipments will be less than they would be without it.
''It begs the question of whether food aid helps the Poles or the U.S. shipping industry,'' said George Berg Jr., an assistant director at the American Farm Bureau Federation in Washington.
Congress approved the law in 1953 as a way to subsidize privately owned American ships to insure that the United States would have a cargo fleet ready in the event of war. It was also seen as a way to preserve jobs for union workers. Because of higher labor costs, American ships have difficulty competing with foreign ships.
Lewis Paine, director of market development at the United States Maritime Administration, said that American merchant ships are more expensive but that it is ''fiction'' to say that farmers are substantially affected. Since the foreign assistance programs were enacted, the agencies responsible for providing food aid have factored the extra costs into their budgets, he said.
 
A Bitter Debate in Congress
Though efforts to overturn the law are made in Congress every year, the debate this year was unusually bitter, with farm states and maritime interests charging that the other side was exploiting the food aid package for its own benefit.
''We made a real issue about it on the floor of the House,'' said Representative Virginia Smith, Republican of Nebraska. ''It's not fair to the Polish people when we want to send food to them we have to send the food on more expensive American ships. We would rather send them the grain.''
Mrs. Smith suggested that if the fleet is needed for defense, the Department of Defense should finance its costs. ''This is really subsidizing the maritime industry on the backs of farmers,'' she said.
But members from industrial states argued that agriculture, as the most highly subsidized sector of the American economy, should bear some of the burden. Pro-labor members are also involved in the debate, arguing that suspending cargo preference in the case of Poland would be an insult to union workers who have supported Polish workers since 1980.
Supporters of the law also suggest that if the primary concern of opponents is to get the most food for the money, the United States should buy grain abroad, where it is cheaper.

HEADLINE: Ex-Klan Leader Facing First Test in Senate Bid

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
To almost everyone in Louisiana politics, he is the most overpublicized man in American politics, a freshman state legislator without a substantive achievement who has nevertheless become a national figure.
But when Louisiana Republicans meet in party caucuses Saturday, all eyes will again be on David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, who announced earlier this week that he planned to run for the United States Senate seat held by J. Bennett Johnston Jr., a three-term Democrat.
Political analysts give Mr. Duke virtually no chance of winning the seat, but the caucuses Saturday could help indicate whether the 38-year-old legislator is a serious candidate for higher office or just an extremist with a genius for garnering publicity and the contributions that come with it.
At the least, Louisiana's quirky political history, its unusual electoral framework and Mr. Duke's knack for serving as a lightning rod could allow him to play a role that is out of proportion with his chances of success. 
 
'The Ability to Polarize'
''I don't think he can win, but I think he has the ability to polarize and poison our politics in a way that's very unhealthy,'' said Lawrence N. Powell, a history professor at Tulane University.
Mr. Duke's conventional credentials for higher office are slim. He was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in February in a race that gained national attention because of Mr. Duke's longtime ties with far-right groups and causes.
But the district where he ran is 99 percent white, and he narrowly defeated his opponent, John Treen, who was widely viewed as unpopular.
Skeptics say Mr. Duke clearly taps into widespread economic and racial frustrations, but they also contend that his notoriety says more about what garners the attention of the news media than it does about politics.
 
'He's a Celebrity'
''I don't think he's really that strong in Louisiana; he's best at capturing attention from outsiders and raising funds from it,'' said Wayne Parent, a political science professor at Louisiana State University. ''He's a celebrity, a Jimmy Swaggart, a Zsa Zsa Gabor, who's very good at playing to the media.''
Mr. Duke says he has been underestimated before. ''They said the same thing about my House race,'' he said. ''I'm the only Republican who can attract a sizable number of the blue-collar, Ronald Reagan, George Wallace voters you need to win.''
The first test of Mr. Duke's appeal since his election to the Legislature will come Saturday when the Republicans meet in caucuses at 14 sites to pick delegates for the state Republican convention on Jan 13. The delegates will then select a nominee for the October 1990 Senate race.
Mr. Duke is one of three active candidates for the nomination. The others are Ben Bagert, a State Senator, and Fox McKeithen, the Louisiana Secretary of State.
 
'Silent Support' Cited
Top Republican officials say Mr. Duke will not be a major factor in the caucuses.
''There's no chance he will win enough delegates to be the endorsed candidate of the Republican Party,'' said William Nungesser, the state Republican chairman. ''With his past, why should we choose someone like him to lead us?''
But others note that Mr. Duke's followers are more likely to be motivated than those of the other candidates, and think he could make a strong showing.
''I think he'll surprise people; he has a lot of silent support,'' said Elizabeth Rickey, a frequent critic of Mr. Duke and a member of the 140-member state Republican Central Committee. ''His supporters are very comitted. The supporters of the others are not.''
He would probably need half the delegates to win the nomination, which even Ms. Rickey sees as unlikely.
 
Runoff With Johnston Sought
But in Louisiana, losing the nomination does not mean a candidate is out of the race. The state has an open primary in which Senator Johnston, the Republican nominee and other candidates will run against each other, and there is a runoff if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote.
Mr. Duke says he will stay in the race if he does not get the nomination, and hopes to get in a runoff with Mr. Johnston.
Mr. Duke, who heads a group called the National Association for the Advancement of White People, has said he regrets some of his previous stands. He bills himself as a candidate who is pro-white rather than anti-black and has pushed for legislation to change welfare programs to curb the growth of what he calls the ''rising welfare underclass.''
But critics say Mr. Duke's appeal remains thinly veiled racism. A group called the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism today released a interview with a former Tulane University student in which Mr. Duke said the United States should not have fought II against the Nazis in World War II and was quoted as saying: ''There's only one country anymore that's all-white, and that's Iceland. And Iceland's not enough.''
 
A Lonely Political Figure
Mr. Duke says a victory in the Senate race would inspire a torrent of similar candidacies, but political analysts say he remains a lonely figure in electoral politics because overt racial politics are difficult to make work in states where blacks are a sizable electoral block. Blacks make up about 25 percent of Louisiana's voters.
''These kind of candidacies made sense only when blacks didn't vote,'' said Merle Black, a professor of politics and government at Emory University in Atlanta. ''I think what he represents is alarming, but I don't think there's much of a market for it.''
But in Louisiana, a state whose most successful politicans were former Governors Huey P. Long and Edwin Edwards, the unexpected sometimes seems routine.
And even those who are skeptical of Mr. Duke's chances in a Senate race acknowledge that he serves as a social barometer and is a potential divisive force in Republican politics because of his racial stands.
''He makes explicit what the others leave unstated,'' Dr. Black said. ''He goes into the water and pulls the fish out.''

HEADLINE: San Francisco Journal;
Grimaces Over a Dab Of Glitz In Skyline

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7

 BODY:
In this city where glitter and glitz are dirty words, residents are trying to sort out how redevelopment has lit up their skyline with a hotel only Liberace could love.
The new 1,500-room San Francisco Marriott, which features giant fan-shaped windows of reflective blue glass, can be seen from virtually every part of the city. Viewed from the south, its 40-story tower tipped in gleaming glass reminds many of a thermometer. From other angles, its protruding half circles of glistening windows recall a jukebox, leading some to dub it ''the Wurlitzer.'' 
Garishness as a theme is carried to the interior as well, where the lobby features a chandelier the approximate shape and size of a city bus.
For San Franciscans who like to think of their city as some charming Mediterranean village, looking up from their morning cafe au lait to see the Marriott is as jolting as going to bed in Nice and waking up in Las Vegas. Some believe the hotel is simply in the wrong city and suggest alternative sites as though it could be moved. Some locals have taken to referring to it as the hotel designed for Cher.
''It is glitzy,'' said the hotel's designer, Tony Lumsden of the Los Angeles architecture firm of DMJM. ''The glass is more reflective than was proposed. It's not a mistake on my part,'' he continued. ''It was not the intention. It was not the agreed glass.'' Mr. Lumsden said the Marriott Corporation did not wish him to discuss the matter further.
The hotel stands as an example of the complex set of trade-offs cities make in trying to find the best use for public land. While Federal officials envisioned urban redevelopment in the 1950's as replacing dilapidated inner-city tenements with modern affordable housing, more often it has cleared blighted areas to build shopping malls, office buildings and condominiums. In exchange, revenue generated from leasing or selling the land or assessing fees, and tax laws allowing the higher taxes on new construction to flow directly to local redevelopment agencies, provide money for public projects.
Here, the new Marriott hotel is the cash cow, as such private projects are called by redevelopment agencies, that will finance the operating costs of the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens. That 22-acre project will include a performing arts theater, landscaped open space and a visual arts center designed by the Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki. Similarly, Olympia and York, a Canadian developer, purchased publicly owned land in the same area for office buildings and is donating some of that land for the new home of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to be designed by the Swiss Modernist Mario Botta.
But in exchange for the revenue, the city gave up the right to require that building designs be subject to review by the Planning Department and its commission. Officials for those agencies said the Marriott's design could never have passed. But Edward Helfeld, the executive director of the Redevelopment Agency, defends the Marriott. ''It's a building that's fun,'' he said. ''We don't have many of these. It's not austere or overly dignified.''
Attempts by Marriott to show that its heart is in the right place, even if its building is not, have been rebuffed by local critics. Last month, for instance, some architects boycotted the annual Beaux Arts Ball, a charity fund raiser of the San Francisco chapter of the American Institue of Architects, when it was moved from its usual location in the rotunda of City Hall to the new hotel after Marriott offered to underwrite the expenses.
The hotel, in the area south of Market Street that surrounds the Moscone Convention Center, is hardly the first controversial building in the city. When the Transamerica Corporation built its now famous pyramid-shaped headquarters in the financial district here, it met with howls of disapproval. Today it is viewed by many as one of the few buildings that make this city's skyline distinctive.
Some believe the hotel has been unfairly singled out. ''It's kind of pretty at sunset,'' said John Elberling, the director of a nonprofit housing corporation that has provided apartments for senior citizens in the Yerba Buena area. And after viewing the model of the 400-foot office tower planned by Olympia and York, he has taken a you-ain't-seen-nothing-yet attitude.
''They're going to build an equally tall office building with a metal sculpture that looks like a giant harp on top,'' Mr. Elberling said. ''That building is wild and crazy. Who knows what the public will think?''

HEADLINE: Head of Air Force Says Cuts In Spending May Delay B-2

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Donald B. Rice, the Secretary of the Air Force, said today that he was considering a slowdown in production of the B-2 Stealth bomber as military spending declines.
Mr. Rice also left open the possibility that the Air Force might eventually decide to buy fewer than the 132 B-2's it had wanted through the mid-1990's.
The Secretary spoke to reporters as Pentagon officials disclosed new details about President Bush's decision on the 1991 Pentagon budget. Officials said on Wednesday that the President had decided to budget about $295 billion for the Pentagon in the fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990. This would lower the Pentagon's purchasing power by about 3 percent once inflation is taken into account. 
The figure is being derived from a $292.1 billion limit on actual outlays set by the President. The budget authority for a given year reflects money that will be spent over a period of years; the Federal deficit is measured in terms of outlays for that year alone. #1991: A 'Transition Year'
In his meeting with reporters, Mr. Rice said 1991 might be an important ''transition year'' as the Pentagon adjusts to lower military budgets.
Asked about the B-2 program, he said the Air Force was ''looking at the option of procuring it over a longer period of time.'' The Air Force had initially planned particularly heavy spending for the B-2 from 1992 through 1994: $7.8 billion in 1992, $8.4 billion in 1993 and $7.7 billion in 1994. An Air Force spokesman said the service had hoped to have 76 of its 132 planes by 1995.
But Pentagon officials are expecting much tighter restraints on spending in those years. And the B-2, whose cost was initially projected at $500 million apiece, has come under heavy criticism in Congress, though the lawmakers have approved billions in spending for it.
Mr. Rice did not say how such a slowdown might affect the eventual deployment of B-2's. The deployment schedule is classified secret and has not been disclosed.
But one Pentagon official said a slowdown would be likely to delay fielding of a force of B-2's from the mid-1990's until the late 1990's. This official said a slowdown was envisioned in the Air Force's proposals for cutting the 1992-94 budgets, which it submitted to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last month.
 
Effect on Costs
One big question is whether a production slowdown would increase costs. In presentations to Congress, Air Force officials have argued that it would, but Mr. Rice said the Air Force was studying ways to avoid that problem. ''We're interested in doing that only if it can still be done efficiently,'' he added.
Asked whether the Air Force might buy fewer than 132 planes, the Secretary replied, ''I think 132 is a good number, and if it were to be questioned, it is something that doesn't need to be decided for quite a few years to come.''

HEADLINE: JUDGE BACKS RULE ON WORK AT HOME

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
In a defeat for organized labor, a Federal district judge today upheld a Labor Department regulation that allows people to work at home in five apparel-related industries.
The ruling by Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rescinded a ban on working at home in the five industries. He said the regulation represented a ''reasoned'' approach requiring companies seeking to institute home work to come forward and seek certification from the Government. They would also be subject to monitoring by department inspectors. 
The International Ladies Garment Workers' union and two other unions sued the Secretary of Labor in January, saying that tens of thousands of workers, mostly immigrant women, would be exploited by the rule and that the working standards of other workers would be threatened.
The five industries affected by the rule are those making gloves and mittens, handkerchiefs, buttons and buckles, some types of jewelry and embroidery. The department held several public hearings this year on its proposed rule and has yet to issue a final version.
 
Possibility of Exploitation
Judge Gesell said the concerns of labor unions about the exploitation of home workers ''are no doubt valid.'' A ban on home work in seven industries, including the five affected by the department rule, was adopted by the Labor Department in the early 1940's. Home workers in those industries are normally paid by a piece rate rather than hourly wages.
''The evidence is strong that the conditions present in the 1940's regarding the exploitation of home workers have not disappeared,'' Judge Gesell said.
But he said the sole issue before the court was whether the Labor Department provided ''a reasoned basis'' for concluding that a certification system is a better means of enforcing Federal labor law than a total ban on work at home. He said the department drew up the rule after nearly a decade of analysis.
Lorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said the 14.1-million-member federation was ''deeply disappointed'' by the court decision. ''Removing the ban on home work opens up new doors to exploitation of workers, doors that were closed over 40 years ago because abuse ran rampant,'' she said.
The labor unions contend that the rule lacks adequate safeguards to prevent violations of laws governing minimum wage, child labor, maximum work hours, workplace safety and other issues.
Judge Gesell said states that disagreed with the department's conclusion were still free to ban home work in those industries.
Judge Gesell questioned the possible motives of both sides, saying that the department's decision to lift the ban might be motivated by ''its sympathy for certain constituences or a certain political philosophy.'' He said the unions might be motivated by concerns of their members about the ''threat of economic competition from home workers and firms employing them.''
But Judge Gesell said his role was ''not to referee this dispute or to speculate on how it has shaded'' the debate between the unions and the Government.

HEADLINE: Governors and Presidential Aides Hear Advice on Education Goals

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
In the first public follow-up to the national ''education summit'' in September, a committee of governors and White House aides heard advice today about what the United States should expect from its schools and decided to focus for now on goals, not on how to achieve them or pay for them.
More than 200 educators and business leaders either appeared before the committee today or submitted their ideas in writing.
Even among those speakers who disagreed on strategies, several common themes emerged: the need to help young children get ready for school, both physically and intellectually; the crucial role of parents in helping children learn; the need to help all children reach higher standards, not just a select few and the potential harm to American competitiveness if schools do not improve. Some of the goals were broadly outlined at the September meeting between President Bush and 49 governors. 
Committee members said their most urgent task was first to set goals that appeal not only to educators, but to the public as a whole. Once this decision is in place, they said, they will talk about strategies.
 
Difficulty of Task
''We've been too conscious in education how we do something, not whether we do it,'' said Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., a South Carolina Republican who is co-chairman of the Governors' Task Force on Education. Testimony today suggested just how difficult the task would be. Speaker after speaker said the country has no adequate way to measure whether any goals set are achieved, because standardized tests do not adequately measure what children learn. Several warned against defining the goals so narrowly that states or local districts could not devise their own ways to meet them or so broadly that expectations would be lost in platitudes.
''People have to feel a sense of passion,'' said Richard Mills, Vermont's Commissioner of Education. ''Someone has to say, this is what we want for our children. Follow-through is everything. This is the work of a decade.'' The speakers offered a range of specific proposals. Several urged the Government to provide enough money for Head Start preschool program for the disadvantage to reach all eligible children, instead of the current 20 percent. Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, said goals should not overlook inculcating such things as creativity, self-confidence and international understanding. Many educators urged greater attention to the effects of poverty on school performance and asked that the Federal Government play a larger role.
Lauro F. Cavazos, the Secretary of Education, and Roger Porter, Assistant to the President for Economic and Domestic Affairs, played down any suggestion that the Federal role in education would change dramatically. Mr. Cavazos said the Government would not impose ideas, but would hold up successful models, disseminate research and significantly increase investment in measuring educational progress.
 
Defining Education Aims
The committee emerged from a nearly two-hour private meeting this afternoon leading toward defining the goals as they were laid out at the September meeting of President Bush and the governors, according to Mr. Porter and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Those goals included improving literacy, reducing dropout rates, finding more qualified teachers, improving nutrition and education programs for preschool children and assuring safe, disciplined and drug-free schools.
Over the next several weeks, committee members will sift through the proposals they received today. They plan to have the substance of their findings ready in time for President Bush to include them in his State of the Union Messsage in late January , and to publish their goals in final form by Feb. 27.
After that, Governor Clinton said, the committee will embark on what looks to be the more difficult political task: agreeing on ways to achieve the goals.

HEADLINE: Who Can Predict Our Life in the Greenhouse?;
Dueling Computers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For the most part, your article on the costs of curing the greenhouse effect (front page, Nov. 19) is balanced and circumspect. However, you should reconsider your reliance on computer simulation models to draw conclusions far into the future. 
The limitations of even the most intricate econometric models to predict the performance of the United States economy even one year ahead are well recognized by anyone who follows economic matters. Variations of 1 or 2 percent from year-ahead forecasts of gross national product are not uncommon. Weather forecasting also relies heavily on computer modeling, and no meteorologist takes seriously any forecast of more than 30 days in the future.
In forecasting the impact of the greenhouse effect, several computer simulation models are used and cited in the article (and in most serious articles on the subject). It is far more difficult to simulate something as complex as the world environment 50 years from now than the U.S. economy or next summer's weather. Yet this and other articles blithely accept conclusions drawn from the model that was based on 1 percent alterations in the assumptions.
There is general agreement in the scientific community that the theory of the greenhouse effect is valid. There is considerable divergence of opinion on how real a threat it poses. Nonetheless, the threat is sufficient to require thoughtful (not precipitate) action now to prevent disaster later.
My quarrel is with the evidence you use. A 50-year computer simulation tells us nothing about what will really happen. The last thing we need is to see this high-stakes matter driven by warring computer models that can easily be skewed by slight changes in the assumptions used to show enormous variations in long-term results.

Just One More Flop

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The Federal Government's decision to abandon its current development of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Depository in Nevada, and to start again on a new plan for the same site, repeats an old, discouraging story: a ballyhooed ''solution'' to the radioactive waste problem that turns out to be just one more flop.
After 30 years of failure, this latest fiasco - two years of effort and $500 million down the drain - involves more than another American technological failure. It suggests again that the disposal of dangerous nuclear waste is a political question almost as difficult to solve as the technological problem.
Because the redesigned Yucca Flats depository cannot be opened before the year 2010, even if both technological and political difficulties are overcome, the use of nuclear reactors to generate electricity will be even more constrained in the United States. Already, California law sensibly prevents new reactor construction before a solution to the waste problem is demonstrated. 
Because the further generation of electricity by nuclear means has been set back for decades and perhaps for much longer, economic growth and expanding population will bring increasing pressures for the use of fossil fuels. But excessive burning of coal, oil and wood already causes heavy environmental damage to the planet.
Thus the Yucca Flats failure puts higher priority on energy conservation and renewable energy sources. To what extent industry and the general population can be educated or might be lured or should be forced into adopting those alternatives are questions yet to be answered.
As pointed out by Matthew Wald in The New York Times, moreover, the question now has to be asked whether a solution will ever be found to the safe disposal of vast quantities of wastes that will remain dangerous to all life for literally thousands of years.
Mr. Wald raised the question in a scientific context. The U.S. already has tried and failed to find the answer in salt caves in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi; engineers have talked fruitlessly of firing the wastes into space or into the sun, or of burying them under the polar ice caps; ''reprocessing'' the stuff to make it less hazardous is costly, could facilitate the proliferation of nuclear weapons and still leaves the problem of safely storing the reprocessed wastes for thousands of years; above-ground storage in special casks offers a solution only into the next century. But the question also has to be asked politically. Popular resistance in the states affected was not the least reason salt-cave storage had to be abandoned; it was perhaps the primary reason granite repositories in New Hampshire, Michigan and Maine were ruled out; and even the desert storage at Yucca Flats that once was considered so promising produced tenacious opposition in Nevada.
In the last case, the Government's faulty plans no doubt increased local resistance. But such resistance inevitably will arise wherever a repository is planned, and no wonder. Just ask yourself if you want highly radioactive material, that will remain so virtually forever, stored in your vicinity; and even if you are willing, ask yourself if, after 30 years of failure, inept management and deception (remember when nuclear power was going to be ''too cheap to meter''?), you could believe the assurances of either government or industry that the problem finally has been solved.
No doubt dedicated opponents of nuclear power - they are numerous, on both environmental and safety grounds - will consider the Yucca Flats decision one more reason why nuclear power should be abandoned altogether. I am among those not yet convinced either that a safe nuclear-power program cannot be developed or that such a program can be made superfluous by conservation and alternative energy sources.
But even if nuclear power production were to be entirely halted and the existing plants scrapped - even if nuclear weapons production were halted for good measure - the baffling problem of waste disposal would remain; in the short run it actually would be exacerbated by the greatly increased amounts of waste to be stored.
Either way, therefore, whether nuclear power is abandoned or continued, much less extended, the lethal waste disposal problem, both technological and political, will remain -humbling evidence of the arrogance of a course confidently embarked upon before anyone knew where it would lead.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Realities Of the Revolution

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
What world are they living in, our elected leaders in Washington, our bureaucrats and so many of our academics and journalists?
They actually tell us the new Europe coming alive because of the anti-Communist revolution will be taken over and shaped by a handful of Western politicians and financiers working cozily with the one important Communist apparatus that so far has managed to avoid destruction - the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
They tell us the West and the Soviet Union share one great enemy, political instability. They cluck nervously at the passion for freedom of the people of Eastern and Central Europe, whose very captivity was unfashionable to mention for many years. 
They talk busily about plans for future relations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, maybe some kind of nice club, all together.
That is their world. In the world of Eastern and Central Europe there are different goals, standards, political morals and reality.
There it is understood, deep in blood and bone after decades of suffering, that the one great creator of instability since the end of World War II has been the imposition of Communism by the Soviet Union.
The goal of the revolutionaries is the end of Communist rule. They shout it out - with such wrath that every day Communist leaders disappear into shame and Communist governments crumble into dust.
In the streets of Prague, Warsaw, Budapest and Leipzig, there are no banners crying for the preservation of the Warsaw Pact. The nations in revolt were forced to join the organization for their own enslavement.
One day they will tell all Soviet troops to get out and will renounce that contract of captivity, just as soon as they can do so without Soviet punishment or selfish Western pressure.
To compare the Warsaw Pact, as the big thinkers in Washington now do, to the voluntary association of NATO is a moral and political obscenity. The goal of the revolution is not Communism with a human face or reformed Communism or any other such ridiculous contradiction in terms but the end, the absolute end of Communist domination.
In the Soviet Union itself, every day that goal becomes more obvious. There is a majority among those deputies in the Supreme Soviet who were really elected, not appointed by the Government, for the repeal of Article 6 of the Constitution. That article enthrones the Communists as the sole party and voice of the people.
In Kiev demonstrators march against Article 6, and in Moscow Andrei Sakharov organizes a strike to force a real debate. In Lithuania the parliament demands elimination of Communist one-party rule. Estonia prepares to do the same.
Time and again Mikhail Gorbachev has said he will fight that step and those who propose it. He has powerful weapons - millions who owe their jobs to the party, the huge police apparatus he never reduces and the Red Army.
Some day as the price of civil peace he may give in to the swelling demand to eliminate the Communist political dominion. But at Malta the United States helped him put off that day by lining up politically and economically with Mr. Gorbachev - with Gorbachev, not the Soviet people and their right to decide how they want to live.
How long can he put the day off, what will he decide, how harsh will his repression be when trouble grows in Soviet streets? We do not know; President Bush was too polite to ask him those questions.
That must have astonished Mr. Gorbachev almost as much as it hurt and disappointed the Soviet Union's liberal and radical fighters for political freedom.
But our leaders and bureaucrats go on talking and planning as if the revolution against the Communist Party were not flooding across Eastern Europe into the Soviet Union, as if the Soviet people's desire for full freedom, with or without Mr. Gorbachev, did not exist.
How sad it is that so often our leaders cannot understand the strength of the passion for freedom of political choice. They did not understand it in South Korea or the Philippines and looked on stunned when the young people of Beijing almost brought down their Government. All those people had seemed so faceless in the West before they rose in rebellion.
Now our leaders and advisers do not understand that neither we nor Mr. Gorbachev have the power any longer to decide what is best for the Soviet people. We can delay their time of choice, as we are. But we cannot talk or plan it out of existence or ignore their faces, not in the real world of the revolution.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Acts to Save a Pygmy Forest of Pine and Oak

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WOODLAND TOWNSHIP, N.J.

 BODY:
Sections of southern New Jersey's pygmy forest, where decades-old pitch pines and blackjack oaks reach only four to six feet in height, have been owned by the state for years, but environmentalists feared they still were not adequately protected.
So this fall the State Department of Environmental Protection designated 3,800 acres of stunted trees in the west pine plains here, about 40 miles east of Camden, as New Jersey's 42d Natural Area. That means the land where the rare trees grow must remain forever wild.
As a natural area, the pygmy forest becomes one of the most closely guarded lands in this populous state. The designation also means the state will manage the area so it retains its present features. That may mean allowing wildfires to burn. 
 
Reversals by the State
But does state control insure that this land in Burlington County will be permanently protected?
''This might be heresy coming from me,'' said Thomas Hampton, administrator of the Office of Natural Lands Management in the Department of Environmental Protection, ''but state ownership and state acquisition doesn't necesarily mean you're going to accomplish preservation or protection of habitat.''
Several times in the past, state parkland that many thought was safe ended up being damaged by inappropriate uses or sold to private interests.
In the late 1960's, Sunfish Pond in the Worthington State Forest in Warren County was sold to Jersey Central Power & Light for use as a pump-storage hydroelectric generating station. Under intense criticism and pressure, the utility eventually dropped the project and returned the land to the state, but the controversy led to creation of the natural lands program through legislation sponsored by then Assemblyman Thomas H. Kean.
Spread throughout the state, the natural areas cover 29,800 acres, including Bearfort Mountain in Wawayanda State Park, Bull's Island in Hunterdon County and a 36-acre tidal salt marsh at Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
In more recent examples of publicly owned land being sold or abused, the state agreed in 1986 to sell over a thousand acres of Hamburg Mountain in Vernon Township to a ski resort operator. Now there is a golf course on what used to be a wildlife management area.
When the state needed a place for thousands of barrels of radon-contaminated soil dug up in Montclair and West Orange a few years ago, it planned to use the Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area until it bowed to public opposition.
Most recently the state approved a swap of 58 acres in the Stephen Section of Allamuchy Mountain State Park in Morris County for 68 acres of wetlands in the Mount Olive Foreign Trade Zone in the same county. The state land will become part of the site of the 500,000-to-600,000-square-foot North American headquarters of the BASF Corporation.
''All you have to do is take a look around,'' said David F. Moore, executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, a nonprofit organization involved in preserving open space, ''and you'll see that the process that the state uses to divest itself of some of its property acquired with public funds does not exactly happen under glass.''
The pygmy forest is not under pressure by potential developers, and it is regulated in part by the State Pinelands Commission. But even in this rural area, there are plans to exploit nature.
 
Bombing Range in the Area
There are more than 13,000 acres of pygmy forest in the area. The largest tract is owned by the Air Force and used as a bombing practice range. The Federal Government recently proposed erecting 16 radio transmission towers in the pygmy forest for use in the event of a nuclear war.
The state owns 3,800 acres in the natural area, as well as other scattered sites. The remaining plains are in private hands, and they include an automobile junkyard and an illegal toxic waste dump.
The pygmy pines natural area borders Route 72 in Woodland Township, and from the highway it is possible to see the tract extending to the horizon. The area includes the rare Broom Crowberry plant, a low shrub, and a dozen rare species of moths.
There are stunted trees like these on Long Island and near Albany, but in far smaller tracts, ecologists said.
Scientists from all over the world have studied these trees. They are not sure what caused them to stop growing, but they have theories. One hundred years ago it was believed the weak sandy soil did not provide sufficient nutrition. But a mile from here pitch pine trees in essentially the same soil grow to 30 to 60 feet.
Robert J. Cartica, a plant ecologist with the Office of Natural Lands Management, said more recent theories had focused on the cycle of natural wildfires that routinely sweep through southern New Jersey's 1.1-million acre pinelands region but occur in the pygmy forest about twice as often as in other areas.
 
Wildfires May Be a Benefit
The pitch pines seem to have adapted to the fires: their seed cones open under tremendous heat, and the trees themselves send up new shoots from the base of their trunks even if the rest of the tree has been killed in a fire. In one section of the natural area that was destroyed by fire last March, new shoots one and a half to two feet long are now flourishing.
Designation as a natural area minimizes human influence - there will be no dirt bikes or campgrounds, for example - but it does not mean the land will be left untended.
To preserve the area, the state is considering, whenever feasible, to let wildfires burn to roads or existing fire breaks, in order to duplicate the cycles of destruction and regeneration that created the stunted woods hundreds of years ago.
 
Role of Fires to Be Studied
''What we're doing is preserving the natural diversity of the area,'' Mr. Cartica said.
For generations now, fires in the pygmy forest have been surpressed, and while there is no scientific evidence yet showing that this has caused the trees to grow, photographs indicate that 30 years ago sections of the forest were only about two to four feet high rather than the four to six feet that now appears most commonly.
Mr. Thompson, the head of the natural lands office, acknowledged that simulating such volatile conditions as a wildfire, while insuring public safety, was a delicate task. He said the state had to do research and planning before such practices could be included in the permanent management plan for the natural area.
The prospect of more forest fires is not especially frightening for the 2,280 residents scattered throughout this 96-square-mile township, Mayor John Bowker said. They have learned not only to live with the fires, but also to rely on them, he said.
''Every once in a while you need wildfires,'' Mayor Bowker said, ''or the whole place turns into jungle.''

HEADLINE: Board Drops 1876 Building As Landmark

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins, joined by almost every other member of the New York City Board of Estimate, voted yesterday to overturn the landmark status of a 113-year-old building on the Avenue of the Americas that was designated in October as ''a forerunner of the skyscraper type.''
It was only the third time in 15 years that the board overturned a designation of a Manhattan structure by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Mayor Edward I. Koch was alone in supporting landmark status for the six-story Coogan Building on the northeast corner of 26th Street.
An aide to Mr. Dinkins, Alicia Glen, read a statement from the Manhattan Borough President before she cast his vote against designation. 
 
'A Close Call'
''Permanent protection of the structure is a close call,'' she said. ''The economic realities make it unlikely that an owner would invest the capital dollars that a historic restoration would require. Nor do we believe that the Coogan Building has a major design impact on its surroundings.''
But Mr. Dinkins's statement also mentioned his ''strong commitment to an effective landmark preservation policy'' and said he respected the ''thoughtfulness'' of the designation and the ''architectural qualities'' cited.
Mr. Dinkins later joined in the unanimous approval of a proposal by Rockefeller University to build a 15-story biomedical laboratory directly over Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. The project was overwhelmingly opposed by the Upper East Side community board.
The Board of Estimate also approved leasing city-owned properties to the prospective buyers of two concrete companies whose previous owner, Edward J. (Biff) Halloran), was convicted of racketeering in 1988. One of the buyers, John Quadrozzi, has ''acknowledged associating with organized crime figures,'' according to Robert Abrams, the New York State Attorney General.
The purchase of the concrete companies by Mr. Quadrozzi and Michael DiBenedetto has been approved by the office of Otto G. Obermaier, the United States Attorney for the Southern District. The buyers have agreed to operate for seven years under the scrutiny of a federally appointed monitor.
Before discussing the concrete companies, the board voted to withdraw landmark status from a property for the first time since 1985, when it overturned the designation of the Ambassador Theater at 215 West 49th Street.
 
Monumental Arched Windows
The Coogan Building, whose facade is distinguished by monumental arched windows, was designed by Alfred H. Thorp and completed in 1876 for use by the Racquet Court Club, predecessor to the modern Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue. It now houses stores and several residents.
It sits in the middle of a three-block site assembled by a real-estate developer, Leonard Adell, who envisions a major commercial and residential project along the Avenue of the Americas, between 25th and 28th Streets, with as many as 1,000 new apartments. This project depends on a rezoning of the area that has been proposed by the City Planning Department.
''We're obviously delighted with the outcome,'' said Samuel H. Lindenbaum of Rosenman & Colin, a lawyer for Mr. Adell. ''It opens up an opportunity to go forward with the proposal to rezone Sixth Avenue. The Coogan site will be the first to be redeveloped.''
''I don't think this necessarily has any great precedent,'' he said of the board's denial of landmark status. ''It was a statement by the Mayor-elect that the building was not worthy of designation. He balanced the issue of landmark preservation and development policy.''
Of the Coogan Building, David F. M. Todd, the landmarks commission chairman, said: ''It was a very interesting old building, but not a flashy one. I just wish there had been an opportunity to work this into the fabric of what the new zoning may bring into that stretch of the city.''
 
A Laboratory Building
The Rockefeller University proposal involves a laboratory building that would fill the air space over Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, between 64th and 65th Streets, supported by two large V-shaped columns rising from the East River esplanade. It was approved unanimously in October by the City Planning Commission.
Community leaders worry that the building will intensify traffic and air pollution, compromise the esplanade, create a visual obstruction of the waterfront, throw unwanted shadows and increase the amount of hazardous waste produced as a result of the medical research to be done there.
But in a statement read by Ms. Glen, Mr. Dinkins said he was voting for the laboratory, ''given the fact that this particular project does not create significant negative impacts and that it will allow the construction of a valued facility dedicated to students and research.''
However, Mr. Dinkins also said, ''We do not welcome the construction of buildings over streets and we dislike a precedent that may be set in this case.''
The concrete plant sites in Manhattan and the Bronx are owned by the city and used by the Certified Concrete Company and the Transit Mix Concrete Corporation, which used to be controlled by Mr. Halloran and are now administered by David M. Brodsky, the court-appointed trustee for the concrete companies.
 
To Transfer Leases
Under the proposal before the board, the leases would be transferred to Mr. Brodsky and, through him, to Mr. Quadrozzi and Mr. DiBenedetto, who would then buy the concrete companies. That purchase is subject to a consent order that would, among other things, ''mandate that the principals not associate with organized-crime members or convicted felons and not violate labor and antitrust laws,'' as described in a letter to the Mayor's office from Mr. Obermaier.
''We are satisfied that there will be no recurrence of illegal conduct,'' Mr. Obermaier said yesterday after testifying before the board.

HEADLINE: Law;
A boy's paleontologic prize is now an ancient legal dispute.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
The fossil, along with other lizard specimens, is kept in a cabinet in the American Museum of Natural History. But to the man who found it - and has gone to court to retrieve it - the relic is scarcely more accessible now than it was for 175 million years, nestled in a hill in what was to become North Bergen, N.J.
Nearly 30 years ago, 15-year-old Alfred Siefker and two buddies discovered the remains of a prehistoric gliding reptile in a quarry. Paleontologically it was a first, the oldest airborne vertebrate known to man, and Mr. Siefker briefly achieved 1960's-style celebrity, appearing on ''To Tell the Truth'' and in Life Magazine. The previously unknown critter went into the books as ''Icarosaurus Siefkeri.'' 
Like Icarus, the creature's other namesake, Mr. Siefker quickly fell back to earth. His dreams of professional paleontology abandoned, he has shined shoes, sold fruit, painted signs, driven a truck, and is now unemployed. As he has made his rocky way, the fossil has acquired a significance more talismanic than scientific. Embedded in a modest block of shale is not just his name and his fame but, he believes, his fortune and future.
For the better part of two decades, he has tried to reclaim the relic, to prove legally that the deal he struck with the museum was a loan rather than a gift. As one might expect from a dispute involving fossils, his progress has been glacial. Mr. Siefker has gone through half a dozen lawyers, each thinking that with a little bit of work that he, too, could claim a piece of that magical rock. Each, in turn, gave up.
Now, Mr. Siefker and his latest lawyer, a Paterson, N.J., solo practitioner named Kashif Molamusa, are taking the museum to another rock pile: the United States District Court in Manhattan. His pleadings can only be described as skeletal but his demand is clear: $15 million for the fossil, $45 million more in damages.
To Mr. Siefker, it is a matter of righting an old wrong. To his adversaries, it is a holdup. ''This is not a case of some barefoot kid on summer vacation versus some big, bad, nasty museum,'' said Andrew Connick of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, the institution's longtime counsel.
The law may have its fair share of dinosaurs, but the world they roamed is one lawyers rarely encounter. The prehistoric exhibit at issue here measures only 7 1/2 inches across. But in it, one can clearly discern the skull, neck, pelvis, tail and elongated ribs of a primitive lizard, one which jumped off trees, glided through the air, and, at least once, missed its target, falling into the lake that once covered New Jersey's Meadowlands and getting buried under millenia of mud.
Fossils were young Siefker's passion; five or six times each week, even in winters when his hands turned numb, he scoured for specimens. ''My mother would scream and the garbage men would hate me,'' he recalled. ''They couldn't lift up the bags.''
Actually, a friend first spotted the icarosaurus. But Mr. Siefker promptly bought it from him for a telescope, a book, several other fossils and $30 in cash. The boys brought it to Edwin H. Colbert, then the chairman and curator of the museum's vetebrate paleontology department. It was Dr. Colbert, now emeritus curator at the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, who analyzed it, described it and gave it its name.
The discovery was announced with great fanfare by the museum. ''They tried to butter me up, by letting me work in their lab, by sending me to Colorado on an expedition, by giving me a lifetime subscription to Natural History magazine which they discontinued once I went into the Army,'' Mr. Siefker said. ''But once they found out I was not going to donate it to them their attitude was no longer friendly.''
In fact, several press accounts at the time stated explicitly that Mr. Siefker still owned the skeleton. This the museum has repeatedly denied -''Our records clearly show that he did not have and does not have now any legal rights of ownership,'' its director, Thomas D. Nicholson, wrote two years ago - and a succession of lawyers representing of Mr. Siefker has negotiated with a succession of lawyers representing the museum, including Louis Auchincloss, lawyer and novelist.
At one point, Mr. Siefker claims, he was offered $200,000 to settle. The creature's current custodians at the museum, Richard Tedford and Eugene Gaffney of the department of vertebrate paleontology, think it is not worth nearly that much. In seeking to retain it, they say, their primary object is precedential: to safeguard the museum's holdings and investment in scientific research.
Mr. Siefker's case remains in its early stages. Meantime, he plans a return to the site of his triumph, even though, with the construction of a K-Mart and Pathmark nearby, whatever secrets it still contained have been obliterated. ''There's still a bit of the hill left,'' he said. ''Enough to make more discoveries.''

HEADLINE: Soviet Lawyers in Odyssey Through U.S. Law

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
''We,'' that pronoun of commonality and cooperation, runs wild as weeds through the conversation of Mahir Babayev, shifting its meaning as the Soviet legal expert describes his odyssey through American corporate law, the contacts made, the deals now brewing and the deals already done.
Sometimes ''we'' means Mr. Babayev and the New York City Bar Association, as in, ''We're working on a draft for a bilateral agreement on the protection of investment.'' Sometimes it means Mr. Babayev and his American hosts, the Wall Street law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. Sometimes it refers to his investment-hungry homeland. 
For another three months, ''we'' also refers to Mr. Babayev and his colleagues in a pioneer group of 17 Soviet legal professionals who, courtesy of the American Bar Association and the Soros Foundation-Soviet Union, are undergoing a seven-month immersion bath in American legal practice and legal culture.
 
Bureaucracy in the Gap
''The law has never played a role in our country as it has in your country,'' said Larisa Afanasyeva, a 30-year-old legal scholar at Moscow's Institute of State and Law. ''Even when good laws were adopted, there was an enormous gap between what the law said and how it was enforced. And in the gap is the bureaucracy.'' In the Soviet Union's political and economic culture, Ms. Afanasyeva added, ''We were oriented toward whatever institute we were subordinate to; the client was the last thing we thought of.''
Now, when her tenure at the Washington firm of Arnold & Porter ends and she returns to her dual roles at her institute and at Infex, a fledgling Soviet legal cooperative, she expects to have a new relationship with her clients and, as a result of the contacts she has made, new clients, too.
What has mattered most to Soviet participants has been not American legal theory, which they were already familiar with, but American legal practice: the power lunching, the long grind of the young associate and, most of all, the way lawyers and executives here approach their work.
 
What 'Mostly' Means
''To me, what's very important is how American lawyers think,'' said Mikhail Barshchevsky, 33, a defense attorney who is also the host of a Moscow television program that tries to explain Soviet law to the layman. He is with the Washington office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.
For example, Mr. Barshchevsky said, the Soviet Union's two-year-old law on joint ventures between Soviet enterprises and Western companies stipulates that such employees be ''mostly'' Soviet citizens. ''For me, it is absolutely understandable what the law means by 'mostly,' '' he said. ''But American lawyers think more concretely. They ask, 'What does it mean? Fifty-one percent? Seventy-five? Ninety?' ''
A Soviet lawyer, he said, would take the rule to mean that in any group of joint ventures the preponderance of the enterprises would have a majority-Soviet work force.
Mr. Barshchevsky's colleague, Leonid Kheifets, has chosen a different approach for his stay here. ''At the beginning I thought it would be a matter of doing research and finding out how American legislation will be useful for our dealings,'' Mr. Kheifets said. ''Now I think the main work I'm doing here is to be a translator of Soviet law for American lawyers.''
 
Wide Range of Legal Studies
While the Soviet lawyers concentrated in Washington and New York are making contacts and learning the skills that will make them the keystone in future business deals, other Soviet legal experts here are scattered throughout the country, exploring environmental law, entertainment law and criminal procedure.
Steven Raikin of the American Bar Association is largely responsible for creating and running the program. Working with the Soros Foundation-Soviet Union, a two-year-old fund whose goal is to aid Soviet systemic change, Mr. Raikin negotiated the terms of the program with Aleksandr Sukharev, now procurator general and president of the Association of Soviet Lawyers.
The foundation contributed $100,000, stipulating that all participants be chosen through an independent competition run largely by Westerners. #17 Applicants Selected From the 162 completed applications that were filed, Mr. Raikin and members of the Soros Foundation chose the final 17, selecting representatives of the various branches of the Soviet legal profession, which is divided between attorneys allowed to practice in court, legal scholars and legal advisers similar to England's solicitors.
The Soviets are paid a stipend by their host law offices. The amount varies, based partly on the cost of living in their community. Mr. Raikin declined to disclose the amount.
When they return to their homeland, a country still in the throes of political and economic overhaul, Mr. Raikin said, ''It wouldn't surprise me if these folks were called on to lend their expertise and help shape how the new laws being passed by the Supreme Soviet are implemented.''
Although the Soviets here do not talk in such bold terms, several hinted that they would put their new skills to use in furthering the rapid political and economic changes, particularly in easing business dealings between the two countries.
 
Links to Entertainment Business
For Valentin Blueger, a Latvian attorney who has spent the fall in the shadow of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry while working with the firm of Farris, Warfield & Kanaday, that may mean creating a new avenue for cultural and entertainment business between this country and the Soviet Union, or perhaps establishing a new record label to compete with Melodiya, the state monopoly label.
For his new contacts in the United States, like Michael Sukin of the New York entertainment law firm of Carro, Spanbock, Kaster & Cuiffo, Mr. Blueger is a wedge into a massive, untapped market.
For John Pritchard at the Wall Street firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor & Havens, the time invested in working with Sven Papp, an Estonian lawyer, will be returned in having an expert available to help the firm and its clients evaluate business opportunities in the Soviet Union.
''Maybe this will influence other other lawyers to come,'' said Mr. Babayev, an Azerbaijani law professor, who hopes not only to resume teaching in Baku, but also to branch out as a consultant in international business. ''Even hundreds of lawyers having this experience won't change our system. Thousands and thousands of lawyers should come. We should invade your country - not with tanks, but with lawyers. What would you call it? From Russia, with law.''

Andres Serrano: Provocation And Spirituality

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENSON

 BODY:
ONE of the few, unintended benefits of the Congressional outrage against Andres Serrano is that it has brought widespread attention to a good artist. His photographs are indeed provocative. They are also serious art. There are 14 of them at the Stux Gallery, including the reviled and dreaded one from 1987, with its 13-inch plastic-and-wood crucifix upright in a Plexiglas tank filled with the artist's urine. This religious emblem enveloped in a dreamy golden haze (without the title, there would be little or no way of knowing what the liquid is) suggests the arty images and the mass production of religious souvenirs that have been partly responsible for the trivialization and exploitation of both religion and art.
This photograph was, along with the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, at the center of the storm that broke last June about the National Endowment for the Arts' grants policy. It was included in a group show that received endowment funds. Many people were offended by the photograph, and offended that Government money was spent on it. 
The kind of art supported by the endowment was thrown into question. Because of objections raised by members of Congress like Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, there are now restrictions on endowment money, which may not be used for work the agency judges obscene.
Stux is a private gallery. There are no public funds involved in this exhibition.
If you haven't seen the work, you should. One of the more alarming aspects of the attack on the endowment has been the assumption of many of those doing the condemning that there is no responsibility to consider the art as it was meant to be seen.
The photograph needs to be seen on the wall, at its altarpiece scale, not in a catalogue or book. And it must be seen within the body of Mr. Serrano's work.
The first question the photograph usually raises is whether the artist is debasing religion or commenting on the way it has been debased. This is a familiar question, one that has been asked in some form or another about the relationship between art and tradition since Manet.
Mr. Serrano is not equivocal, although his titles may have a defiance and a descriptive purity that suggest the two sides of his work. He does not want to have it both ways: his photographs have a point of view. He is searching for a way to sort out what he values in religion from what he does not. There is strong belief in his work, but he is not going to allow anyone to kneel before the trappings of institutionalized art and organized religion without asking what it is they have decided to worship.
The exhibition includes 13 other Cibachrome color photographs, all but 1 of them made this year. Most are 60 by 40 inches; 3 are 30 by 40. All the photographs are clean, economical and seductively colored. Each image is substantially enlarged.
Four photographs contain hallowed, mass-produced, generic images. In ''White Christ'' it is simply a Gothic head. ''Madonna and Child II'' is also Gothic. ''Female Bust'' is representative of classical Greek statuary.
''Madonna and Child II'' and ''Female Bust'' are immersed in urine. ''White Christ'' is in a mixture of milk and water. Mr. Serrano may not have made another yellow Christ because the one he had made was enough of a response to Gauguin's ''Yellow Christ,'' that awkward, highly personal Post-Impressionist document that has become one of the monuments of its age.
Every photograph features bodily fluids. It may be cow's blood from a butcher that is photographically transformed into clouds and sea. It may be a menstrual pad that becomes part icon, part embryo, part dog on its hind legs. It may be sperm that seems capable of leaping whole rooms in a single bound of transcendent light, or milk or cream that, mixed with blood, suggests the break of dawn or an Old Master painting of a religious vision. There is a medieval sense of the human body as the center of the universe. Earth, air, fire and water are the four elements, and air, fire and water are clearly suggested by an almost alchemical blend of fluids in these works.
Like Robert Mapplethorpe, Mr. Serrano struggles against inhibitions about the human body. His use of bodily fluids is not intended to arouse disgust but to challenge the notion of disgust where the human body is concerned.
It is possible to see Mr. Serrano's use of bodily fluids as pure provocation. But you can also believe that Mr. Serrano views them as a form of purification. The fluids make us look at the images harder and consider basic religious doctrine about matter and spirit.
They also raise the issue that was so crucial to the Byzantine Iconoclast Controversy of the eighth and ninth centuries: the relationship of an image to what it represents. The controversy was a bitter and profound debate about the nature of images and the problem of mistaking images for religious truths that could never be entirely incarnated.
You cannot consider the content of Mr. Serrano's work without considering his attitude toward photography. It is the photograph that breaks through convention, that makes the search possible and that enables the artist to sort out what he likes and does not like in religion and art. It is the photograph that becomes the vessel of transformation and revelation.
The photograph then becomes an icon that, for Mr. Serrano, replaces the false icons in his work. The photograph is clean and purified, the reliquary or shrine in which he clearly believes that the word about the body can be stored and spread. People may agree or disagree with him, or they may question his belief in photography, but how can anyone find in his work just obscenity and disrespect? It is hard to believe that anyone whose faith is searching and secure would not be grateful for what Mr. Serrano has done.
The photographs of Andres Serrano remain at the Stux Gallery, 155 Spring Street, through Jan. 6.

HEADLINE: Takeover Of Lincoln Defended

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Government lawyers went to court today to defend the Federal takeover last April of the financially troubled Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
Facing the first legal test of the takeover, attorneys for Federal regulators began presenting arguments for their contention that Charles H. Keating Jr. and his colleagues operated Lincoln in an unsafe and unsound way, violated banking regulations and depleted the assets of the institution.
The hearing in Federal District Court in Washington, which is likely to continue for several days. is the result of a suit Mr. Keating filed challenging the Government's April 14 takeover of Lincoln, which is based in Irvine, Calif.
 
'Capricious and Arbitrary'
Mr. Keating, known for his propensity to sue opponents, filed the suit in May, saying that he had operated Lincoln soundly and that the Government takeover was ''capricious and arbitrary.'' 
James P. Murphy, an attorney for the Office of Thrift Supervision, said in court today that specific transactions to be examined during the hearing would show that Lincoln engaged in practices with no economic value that created a false appearance of profitability.
''We have literally just the tip of the iceberg'' with these transactions, Mr. Murphy told Judge Stanley Sporkin. The Government's investigation of Lincoln found numerous other transactions that were ''just as bad,'' Mr. Murphy said.
Regulators have said that losses of depositors' money from fraud, risky investments and sham real estate transactions at Lincoln total more than $2 billion, and that Lincoln is likely to become the costliest savings and loan failure on record.
 
Suit's Dismissal Sought
The Office of Thrift Supervision, formerly the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, asked the court to dismiss the Keating suit. But Judge Sporkin said that before he ruled on that request he wanted to hear some arguments and testimony. The judge ordered the attorneys for both sides to jointly select four transactions by Lincoln as the basis for arguments before him.
The transactions selected involve two land deals, a tax-sharing agreement and a deal involving the purchase and sale of stock in the Memorex Corporation.
The Government has summoned Mr. Keating to appear as a witness, but it is uncertain whether he will testify. On Nov. 21, in an appearance before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Keating cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions.
In addition to being the subject of civil suits filed by Federal regulators, the Securities and Exhange Commission and bondholders of Lincoln's parent, the American Continental Corporation, Mr. Keating is also the subject of a Federal grand jury investigation in Los Angeles.
As part of Lincoln's defense, Charles M. Stern, a Los Angeles lawyer representing Mr. Keating and Lincoln, charged that the Government's presentation ''contained half-truths and erroneous statements.'' He said that Lincoln's situation on April 14 did not justify a regulatory takeover, which, he said, was the ''ultimate bomb'' in the Government's arsenal.
He said his side would show that there were numerous omissions and misstatements by the Government. ''When you hold it up to light, there is nothing there,'' he said of the Government's case.
 
Tax Payments at Issue
The tax transaction selected for presentation to the judge involved an agreement between Lincoln and American Continental under which Lincoln paid to the parent company $94 million during a three-year period, supposedly as tax payments to be forwarded to the Internal Revenue Service.
Kevin O'Connell, an examiner for the thrift supervision office and the first Government witness today, said Lincoln had been granted permission by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco for such a tax-sharing agreement in 1986. But he said the accord was misused because since none of that money was ever used to pay taxes.
Mr. Murphy said that since the taxes were never paid, the payments to the parent company amounted to an interest-free loan by Lincoln to its parent company. That, he said, is ''against savings and loan regulations.''
 
Interest Income Lost
Mr. Murphy said that during the three-year period Lincoln lost interest income of about $20 million that would have accrued from the $94 million and that Lincoln remained responsible for the full $94 milion tax liability if it could not be recovered from American Continental.
Mr. Stern, in his response, reminded the judge that permission for the transaction had been granted by the San Francisco Home Loan Bank.
The two land transactions involved the purchase and sale of undeveloped land outside Phoenix on which a subsidiary of Lincoln, Amcor, was able to record substantial profits. The Government contends that these were sham transactions undertaken to create the appearance of a profit through accounting techniques.
The Government said that in one transaction Amcor bought in 1985 and 1986 an 8,500-acre parcel called Hidden Valley for an average price of $3,000 an acre.
In March 1987, Amcor sold 1,000 acres to a newly formed limited partnership, West Continental Land. Amcor had paid about $3 million for the acreage and sold it for $14 million, or $14,000 an acre.
Lincoln recorded the $11 million difference as a profit, and paid its parent company $4.4 million in tax payments.
 
Borrowed Money
Mr. Murphy contended in court today that West Continental's financed the purchase with a $10.5 million loan from Lincoln and a $3.5 million loan from E. C. Garcia, a Phoenix businessman, who had shortly before that borrowed $20 million from Lincoln.
Mr. Murphy said that West Continental had a net worth of only $31,000 and was not able to make payments on the loans, which required interest payments of $1.4 million a year. The regulators charged that the partnership never intended to make the payments, particularly since the loans were not secured by any of the partnership's assets.
''The buyer had none of its own money at risk, was not able to make any of the payments and actually had no intention of making payments on the loan,'' Mr. Murphy said, adding that the transaction was done to ''artificially enhance Lincoln's income statement.''
Mr. Stern said that the $3.5 million lent by Mr. Garcia did not come from American Continental or Lincoln.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Terrorist Victim's European Vision

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE complex job of rebuilding the international economic order in the wake of the upheaval in the Communist world and the apparent end of the cold war will require dedicated and brilliant leaders like those who created the Marshall Plan after World War II. The late chief executive of West Germany's biggest bank, the Deutsche Bank, Alfred Herrhausen, who was murdered by a terrorist bomb near Frankfurt last week, was such a leader. Before his death, Mr. Herrhausen had begun to spell out his ideas on the reconstruction of Europe and its economic implications for both East and West.
In a speech that was to have been delivered before the American Council on Germany in New York last Monday, Mr. Herrhausen stressed the need for continued progress toward a united Europe, with member countries giving up a good part of their autonomy over economic policy making. He wanted West Germany firmly linked to the European Community and wrote, ''That East Germans be given freedom and self-determination is more important than a united Germany.'' 
If, later, attainment of that liberty were to be followed by their decision to move more closely, or unite, with the West, that decision would be welcomed in West Germany, he continued, but at this point, it ''is still very much an open question.''
Mr. Herrhausen saw progress toward completion of the single market in 1992 as proceeding, more or less, on schedule, with even stronger growth than the optimists had expected. Europe, he wrote, is now in a much better position to cope with ''a recession in North America, should it occur, than was the case in the 70's or early 80's.''
Next on his priority list was completion of the European Monetary System, because ''a single market calls for a single currency,'' he said. Without specifically mentioning the resistance to monetary integration of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he insisted that there would have to be sacrifices of national sovereignty in such areas as exchange rates, monetary policy and even, ''to a certain extent,'' fiscal policy. He maintained that these thorny issues could be resolved and ''the year 2000 is a realistic goal for the implementation of monetary union.''
Far from viewing Europe 1992 as a ''fortress,'' he saw it as part of a wider phenomenon, a worldwide interlocking of economies, like the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Europe, he said, had to ''remain open for third countries in general and for its European neighbors in the East in particular.''
A philosophical man, Mr. Herrhausen saw dangers ahead in the effort of the Communist countries to convert to market economies. ''One is reminded,'' he said, ''of Alexis de Tocqueville's shrewd observation that authoritarian regimes run into difficulties precisely when they begin to change for the better.'' Political and economic reform would have to go hand in hand; the violent reversal in China, where reform had been restricted to the economic sector, taught him that ''freedom is a comprehensive concept and cannot be confined to just one sector of national life.''
Against those who argue that the United States should not prop up the Soviet economy, he contended that success with perestroika was ''necessary and very much in the West's interest as well,'' and would also give other Eastern European countries more scope to restructure their society and economy. He deliberately invoked the model of the Marshall Plan and called for granting credits and setting up development banks to work closely with Eastern European authorities and trade and industry representatives.
John D. Macomber, president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, who once served on the board of the Xerox Corporation with Mr. Herrhausen, called him a ''self-effacing, kind, decent and very hard-working man.''
Mr. Macomber said in an interview that the fastest way of helping the East would be through export credits and guarantees to private businesses, but said such actions should have the explicit support of Congress. He agreed with Mr. Herrhausen that Western countries should act ''in concert'' in helping the Eastern countries.
Mr. Herrhausen praised the courage of the East Germans for ''forcing upon their Government tremendous political changes,'' culminating in the opening of the Berlin wall. But despite the euphoria, he said, ''one could not miss the irony: The wall was built in an attempt to keep people in the country, and now it had to be opened for exactly the same reason.''
The irony might be explained through the American economist Albert O. Hirschman's concept of ''exit'' and ''voice'' - the two basic means by which people can discipline businesses, organizations or nations. When East Germany could no longer prevent its citizens from ''exiting,'' it had to give them ''voice'' at home. The opening of the wall was a symbol of a new freedom to protest and an implicit commitment to respond and change.
Mr. Herrhausen's speech here was dedicated to the memory of Arthur F. Burns, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and Ambassador to West Germany. The German banker concluded his remarks with a Latin quotation from Tacitus, which in translation said: ''We grieved at his passing and his friends were saddened. People abroad and strangers, too, were affected.''
It was his own epitaph, too. Obviously, the authoritarians and totalitarians had a lot to fear from this gentle man.

HEADLINE: Polish TV Joint Venture For Chase Enterprises

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
An American communications company today announced a joint venture to wire Poland for cable television and provide it with an array of Western programming.
The network, which is scheduled to begin in Warsaw and Cracow in June would, it is believed, be the first cable system in Eastern Europe. Eventually, it will carry 18 channels.
Wiring for the first 1.8 million of Poland's 8 million homes will begin in the next few months, the company, Chase Enterprises, said. 
Although Poles can currently receive some Western programs with satellite dishes, the cable service would make subtitled or dubbed foreign programs widely available. CNN, a news service, and ESPN, an all-sports network, are two American offerings likely to be included in the basic service.
 
Payable in Zlotys
The basic cable service will cost about $8.50 a month, payable in the local currency, the zloty.
Packages of additional channels will be offered at a premium of $8 a month for the first group and $6 a month for the second. Those charges will be due in dollars or another easily convertible currency, and Chase Enterprises will be permitted to export those earnings.
Asked whether these fees - $22.50 a month for the full package - were not too steep for most Poles, Chase officials said their research showed that the prices would be affordable because many Poles have working spouses, second jobs and income from other sources. More than 90 percent of Polish homes have television sets.
Chase officials said that the service would initially have no advertising but that this could come eventually.
''What we're trying to do is export a bit of democracy and way of life to Poland,'' said David T. Chase, the founder of Chase Enterprises, which is based in Hartford. A Pole who escaped from Auschwitz as a youth and came to the United States at the end of World War II, Mr. Chase, 60 years old, has built a communications, real estate and insurance empire.
Mr. Chase said he remembered passing the Statue of Liberty with 25 cents in his pocket when he entered the United States. He is now listed in Forbes magazine as having, along with his family, a net worth that places them among the 400 wealthiest families in the United States.
 
Base in Real Estate
Chase Enterprises is a family-owned business with assets estimated at $2 billion. From its base in New England real estate, the company has expanded into broadcasting in a half-dozen states and into banking and insurance.
Chase Enterprises will own 70 percent of the Polish cable system, to be called Polska Telewizja Kablowa.
Poltelkab S.A. will own the remaining 30 percent. It is a partnership of the Polish post, telephone and telegraph company; Polish Radio and Television Productions Company, and the local governments of Warsaw and Cracow.
Chase officials said the project had been under development for three years but had been expedited by the recent changes in Eastern Europe.
First-phase investment will require about $270 million, with the eventual total amounting to more than $900 million.
Chase's initial equity will be $20 million to $40 million, said Roger M. Freedman, president of the Chase International Corporation. Poland will put up the amounts necessary to maintain its equity at 30 percent.
The bulk of the money would be borrowed, and Chase officials said they hoped for a $100 million loan from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a United States Government agency that finances foreign ventures at concessionary rates and insures against expropriation.
 
Poland Seeks Loans
Poland itself is currently seeking two loans totaling $360 million from the World Bank for overall development. Officials began negotiations on these loans, which could be made as soon as early 1990, a World Bank official said.
Eugenio F. Lari, director of European, Middle East and North African operations for the World Bank, said the loans were part of a $1 billion package that the World Bank has ''on the shelf'' for Poland. The first loans, intended to improve efficiency in the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy, would be practically automatic once Poland and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a broad economic program involving privatization and other market-oriented measures.
Poland owes $40 billion to Western creditors and inflation is running at a rate of more than 500 percent a year.
In the cable television deal, no programming commitments have been concluded, but Chase officials said it was likely that the 18-channel system would contain these channels:
Tier 1 would include TV 1 and TV 2, Poland's two national broadcasting systems; local programming, a sports channel like ESPN or Eurosports; Soviet, French and Italian channels; an educational channel, and the European Cable News Network.
Tier 2 would include Discovery, MTV, Disney and classical music, European Eureka channel, American Arts and Entertainment and a 24-hour movie channel.
Tier 3 would include satellite-received cable channels from Western Europe chosen by a survey of Polish viewers.
Mr. Chase said that the announcement of the project was an emotional one for him and that he would be traveling to Poland this weekend for the first time in more than 40 years.
In addition to exporting democracy and making a profit, Mr. Chase said he sought to expose the Polish economy - including the 250 initial employees there - to economic incentives and show skeptics that the Polish worker is as good as any.
''This is an exciting moment in the history of the United States-Poland relationship and Chase Enterprises is pleased to be so intimately involved in the development of the Polish economy,'' he said.

First Interstate Moves To Shore Up Reserves

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The First Interstate Bancorp, plagued by troubles in the Southwest, moved to clean up its money-losing Texas operation today by adding $400 million to reserves before selling problem assets.
The move comes a quarter after the Los Angeles-based banking company took a $200 million write-off and set aside $150 million to cover problem loans in Arizona, where as in Texas, the economy is weak and real estate values are depressed. 
In Texas, First Interstate holds about $560 million in troubled assets, including problem real estate holdings. The company said that it was adding $300 million to reserves so it could accelerate the sale of its Texas assets and that it was adding $100 million to ''address the risk inherent in the company's real estate portfolio.''
Analysts said First Interstate needed to move now to dispose of the assets before the market becomes glutted with billions of dollars worth of sale properties when the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency created last summer to rescue the savings and loan industry, begins selling the holdings of seized institutions next year.
First Interstate entered the Texas market by agreeing to acquire Allied Bancshares Inc. in May 1987 with no Government assistance. The bank was betting that the Texas economy would improve, but that proved to be an incorrect and costly assumption. Last year, after setting aside $180 million in reserves, the First Interstate Bank of Texas lost $205 million. This year, the bank will lose more than $90 million, the analysts said.
''This is further proof that Texas was a mistake,'' said Dan B. Williams, an analyst at Sutro & Company in San Francisco.

HEADLINE: G.M. Chief to Head Panel

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange yesterday named Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, to head a panel on program trading and market volatility.
The panel is part of a five-point effort announced last month by John J. Phelan Jr., the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, to examine the impact of program trading on exchange trading. Mr. Phelan's efforts have come amid contention that computerized trading programs may have caused several large drops in stock prices in the last few months. 
''Roger's experience gives him a long-term perspective on the interests of corporations and their shareholders, both large and small, and the importance of the American economy and maintaining strong capital markets for all participants,'' Mr. Phelan said in a statement yesterday.
Mr. Smith, who is also head of the Business Council, a lobbying group, said the committee would issue its findings in about six months. ''The issues are complex and the challenge before the panel is great,'' Mr. Smith said in a statement.
A spokesman for General Motors said that Mr. Smith and the exchange will jointly announce the selection of the 20-member panel in about a week and that work will begin after the first of the year.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls By 15.99; Chevron Off

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks moved broadly lower yesterday, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.99 points, to 2,720.78.
More than half the Dow's decline was accounted for by a 5 1/4-point drop, to 66 3/4, by Chevron, which had been widely rumored as a potential takeover target.
The Pennzoil Company said yesterday that it held 8.8 percent of Chevron's stock and might buy more but had no present plans for a takeover bid. Pennzoil rose 5/8, to 83 1/4. 
The Dow was off as much as 30 points at 3 P.M. after several futures-related sell programs were executed.
 
Program Selling a Factor
Analysts said the progam selling was spurred by the sharp drop in Chevron.
Declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances, with 843 issues lower in price and 622 higher.
Volume on the Big Board expanded to 162 million shares, from 145.9 million on Wednesday.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.96, to 347.59, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.44, to 192.38.
''With corporate cash flow diminishing and the Federal Reserve Board apparently not in a hurry to allow interest rates to fall, something had to give and that something was stock prices,'' said Kenneth S. Hackle, president of Systematic Financial Management in Fort Lee, N.J. ''Also tax-loss selling and losses in the arbitrage community are negatively affecting some big-name stocks.''
Traders said that if today's report from the Labor Department on unemployment provides evidence of a sluggish economy, hopes could be revived for interest cuts.
 
Pinnacle West Advances
Pinnacle West Capital was the most active stock as well as the biggest percentage gainer, climbing 4 7/8, to 10 1/4, on a volume of 9.2 million shares. The company agreed to provide $450 million in cash and securities to its Merabank savings and loan subsidiary, meeting a condition of an offer for Pinnacle West made by Pacificorp last week.
The Washington Post Company fell 9 1/2, to 261 1/2, after sliding more than 21 points in early trading. The Post company said it new of no reason for the decline.
Active blue chips included Lockheed, up 3/8, to 39 3/8; Warner Communications up 3/8, to 63 7/8; Philip Morris, up 1/4, to 42 3/8, and I.B.M., off 5/8, to 98.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped 0.74, to 375.09, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dipped 0.36, to 456.31.
In Tokyo, the 225-stock index closed at a record high for the 11th time in 12 sessions. The indicator rose 203.82 points, or 0.54 percent, to 37,858.11.

HEADLINE: October's Consumer Debt Rose at 5.7% Annual Rate

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Americans took out $3.34 billion more in consumer credit than they retired in October, resulting in the biggest increase in net consumer debt in five months.
The Federal Reserve Board said today that consumer credit advanced in October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 percent, the sharpest increase since a 7.3 percent gain in May, when credit rose $4.21 billion.
Outstanding consumer credit rose 2.3 percent in September, a revision upward from the 1 percent increase originally reported. Net loan totals were adjusted to $1.37 billion, from $606 million. 
A large part of the October advance related to the timing of automobile loans, which grew $1.1 billion, or 4.5 percent, in the month after falling 3.2 percent in September.
Economists said that the auto loan figures reflected sales made in September, not October, because of a lag in approving applications and then reporting credit.
 
Credit Card Debt
''The timing of credit and the sales often don't match up,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting organization. ''There's really a rush to get cars into the sales column, but if you sign an agreement to buy a car, you might not actually get the credit for another week.''
The category of debt that includes credit cards jumped to a 6.4 percent annual rate of growth from a 5.6 percent advance in September. Total revolving debt rose $1.04 billion, compared with a $904 million gain the previous month.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose $1.23 billion, a 7.5 percent annual rate of growth, compared with a gain of $1.2 million, or 7.3 percent, in September.
Mobile home debts fell again, down $26 million, or a 1.4 percent rate of decline. These debts had fallen for seven consecutive months until rising $53 million in September, or 2.8 percent at an annual rate.
The various changes left total consumer debt in October at a seasonally adjusted $707.7 billion.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of U.S. Issues Fall Again

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped again in light trading yesterday, as dealers positioned themselves for this morning's release of November employment data.
''Someone who is not involved in the process would yawn over the price declines we have seen,'' said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''But if you are involved, the amounts of money get so large that a down move of any size hurts a lot of participants.''
The declines over the last few sessions have put prices at the low end of the fairly narrow trading range they have occupied since the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions in mid-November.
''Right now most participants sound awfully negative,'' Mr. Brachfeld said. ''But if the economic fundamentals have not changed, then this could be a modest buying opportunity.'' 
Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., said: ''The contents of the Fed's beige book on Wednesday tended to change the market's psychology somewhat. The market is kind of nervous going into the employment numbers, and expectations for an easing in credit policy by the Fed have faded quite a bit.''
 
Market Participants Unsettled
In addition to the beige book, which showed that the economy was ''stable to modestly expanding'' in November, market participants were slightly unsettled yesterday by a larger-than-expected increase in consumer credit and an initial unemployment claims number that was somewhat smaller than anticipated.
''Unless the employment numbers are very bad, and show a rise in non-farm payroll employment of around 100,000 or so, it would seem to me that the Fed will postpone any easing move until the Open Market Committee meets later this month,'' Mr. Stone said. ''At that point, our hunch is that they will probably go ahead and ease policy.''
The consensus estimate among credit market experts is that non-farm employment grew by about 150,000 jobs in November, compared with 233,000 in October.
Once again, price declines among Treasury securities were registered across the maturity spectrum.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 102 3/8, down 3/32, to yield 7.91 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 2/ 32, down 5/32, to yield 7.86 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 25/32, down 5/32, to yield 7.79 percent.
Treasury bill rates inched higher. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.67 percent, up two basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.39 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.28 percent, up four basis points.
 
New-Issue Activity
New-issue activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by an offering of $100 million worth of new 10-year notes by Baxter International. The 9 1/4 percent notes were priced at ''par,'' or $100, 1.375 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 7 7/8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. The notes, which are noncallable for life, have a final maturity of Dec. 15, 1999.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Traders in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues slipped by about an eighth of a point in very quiet trading.
Meanwhile, participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices dipped about half a point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Nov. 27. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Trading As Dealers Await Job Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed marginally higher against most foreign currencies yesterday, but trading was light.
Gold prices scored large gains in United States trading, after finishing somewhat higher in Europe. Technical factors were cited for driving prices higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery ended at $410 an ounce, up $5.10 an ounce from late Wednesday. 
Dealers said the dollar traded in a very narrow range throughout the session, as most traders waited for today's release of the November unemployment data by the Labor Department. The market consensus was that the report would show an increase of roughly 150,000 jobs, lower than the 233,000 jobs added in October, and an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.
 
Cut in Interest Rates Seen
Unfavorable employment figures would further indicate that the economy is slowing and might encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates are bearish for the dollar because they decrease the value of dollar-denominated securities.
''Everybody is convinced that U.S. rates will go down,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
The West German mark showed continued strength. Traders noted that the mark remained extremely strong against the Japanese yen.
In New York, the dollar closed at 144.31 yen, up from 144.02 on Wednesday. It cost $1.5780 to buy one pound, up from Wednesday's $1.5765.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday,included: 1.7725 West German marks, up from 1.7660; 1.5900 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.0515 French francs, up from 6.0335; 1.1618 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1612, and 1,307.25 Italian lire, up from 1.303.25.
In London, gold rose to a late bid of $404.25 a troy ounce, from $402.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $404.00, from $403.75 bid late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metal Prices Rise; Move Tied to Stock Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metal futures prices rose sharply on the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday. Traders said the advance was partly in reaction to a decline in stock prices.
Gold settled $4.10 to $5.10 higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $410 an ounce; silver was 6.5 cents to 7.2 cents higher, with December at $5.623 an ounce. 
''The sharp fall in the stock market caused a flight to quality buying in the precious metals market,'' said Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
Mr. Steel said that many things had caused movement in precious metals prices, including dollar strength or weakness, interest rates and inflation. ''But what has given gold its bold moves have been the declines in the stock market,'' he said.
Silver prices followed gold in the upward surge, helped along by the perception that the metal has been sharply oversold in recent sessions, Mr. Steel said.
 
Cotton Prices Sharply Lower
Cotton futures were sharply lower on the New York Cotton Exchange as traders had difficulty unloading offerings because of a lack of buyers.
At one time, the March contract was down the limit before recovering some losses, said Ed Whitten, an analyst with the Balfour Maclaine Corporation in New York. He pointed out that commission houses were active sellers as prices moved below several support levels.
Cotton was 0.23 cent to 1.55 cents lower, with December at 63.97 cents a pound.
Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower in sluggish trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The slide in wheat prices was a result of the release Wednesday of the National Weather Service's 6-to-10-day forecast, which calls for precipitation in the winter wheat crop areas, said Susan Leighty, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
Wheat futures received little support from news that the Department of Agriculture has approved an offer by the Soviet Union for 410,000 metric tons of wheat under the department's Export Enhancement Program.
Under the program, private exporters can sell United States commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in some markets and collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
Corn futures traded in a narrow range, finishing lower as professionals and commission houses liquidated their long positions.
Soybean prices continue to be weighed down by a lack of export business and continuing good planting conditions in South America.
Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange as prices fluctuated widely during moderate trading.
Heating oil continued to provide strength to the market, as another blast of cold weather is expected in the Northeast in coming days, analysts said.
Livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures down sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Players and Owners Taking Divergent Courses in Talks

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 7

 BODY:
Not that anybody expected baseball's labor negotiations to proceed smoothly and quickly, but with the two sides talking on two different planes, the owners and the players will very likely take a long time to get nowhere.
That the two sides will proceed on divergent courses became obvious today. Donald Fehr, the union leader, made it clear that one of the players' primary goals in negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement will be to regain the salary-arbitration eligibility players gave up four years ago, when the eligibility requirement was raised from two years of major league service to three. The owners want to eliminate salary arbitration. 
Fehr, emerging from a meeting of the Players Association executive board, questioned comments attributed to Commissioner Fay Vincent in newspaper reports today. Vincent, who spoke with reporters at the owners' meetings in Nashville on Wednesday, was quoted as using the term ''economic warfare'' and talking about a negotiating deadline ''sometime after the middle of February.''
''I find it odd and troubling,'' Fehr said, ''that as negotiations begin and on the heels of announcements of 'we've got to have trust, we have to form a new partnership, we're going to persuade players things are going to be different,' that words like 'economic warfare' are coming out of their mouths and suggestions of setting deadlines, which means lockouts, are coming out.''
 
Owners Want New System
The owners have told the union they want to implement a new salary system, based on revenue sharing and a pay-for-performance scale. That concept has monopolized the attention that has been focused on the talks, which began last week. Fehr, however, stressed today that the players would have their own agenda to discuss.
''The players have every right and obligation,'' Fehr said at a news briefing, ''to propose the kind of system that they believe makes the most sense, and the owners clearly have the obligation to treat that just as seriously, if not more seriously, because it's a system they know and understand and that the parties have agreed to fundamentally in the past.''
The players, Fehr said, would have their proposals formulated by Friday. He said they would not make them public before they present them to the owners' labor representatives. But the proposals, or areas of concern, will focus on salary arbitration, players with less than three years of major league service, the 25-man and 40-man rosters and improvements in benefits, both for current players and retired players.
The talks resume in Los Angeles next Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Army-Navy Sends Message to Philadelphia Officials

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE

 BODY:
The difference between Saturday's Army-Navy game and the 89 that preceded it is the location: Giants Stadium in New Jersey's Meadowlands. This is a one-time-only arrangement and also a subtle message to the city of Philadelphia, where 67 of the games have been played.
The contract for use of city-owned Veterans Stadium, the site of the game since 1980, has expired and the two service academies wanted Philadelphia to know they could take their contest elsewhere if they chose. The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority was delighted to be the landlord and the host to the 8,900 men and women who make up the student bodies. 
The event, which begins with the parade of the Brigade of Midshipmen into the stadium at noon followed by the Corps of Cadets, will sell out all of Giants Stadium's 76,891 seats. The game has not always been a sellout in recent years at Veterans Stadium. The kickoff will be at about 2:30 P.M. and CBS is televising the game nationally without competition from other major college games because there are none.
Although it has often been said that past records mean nothing because of the intensity of the rivalry, that may not be the case this time. Army has much the superior team offensively, one that set a West Point record in its last game by rushing for 631 yards against Colgate in a 59-14 victory.
 
Navy Has 2-8 Record
The same afternoon, Navy was losing to Delaware, its third loss of the season to a Division I-AA team. Army routed its four I-AA opponents by a collective 194-71 and its overall record is 6-4 to Navy's 2-8. For the 10th time, the series record is tied again, 41-41-7.
In the Colgate game, the Cadets were without their starting quarterback, Bryan McWilliams, and after one quarter their best running back, Mike Mayweather. Both will be back for Navy, and Mayweather, a junior, needs only 56 yards to set a new single-season West Point rushing record and 81 to exceed the Army career rushing standard, 2,957 yards, set by Glenn Davis, the 1946 Heisman Trophy winner, in four seasons.
Navy, which last enjoyed a winning season in 1982, has no players like those. Once more the Midshipmen will be counting on Alton Grizzard, their junior quarterback who has started 24 of the last 32 games and has taken a lot of punishment along the way.
 
Navy Needs to Strike Early
McWilliams averages about four pass attempts a game in the Army wishbone offense and Grizzard, also from the wishbone, will throw more often than that. In nine games he has passed for 947 yards and also, as Navy's leading rusher, has run for 821 yards. But his net average is only 63 yards a game after subtracting 255 yards in losses from all the sacks he has taken.
Navy's best chance to keep Army from winning for a fourth consecutive time is to try to pass for early scores and gain a lead. The Cadets do not come from behind easily with their inflexible wishbone attack.
A victory over Army would be the first for Navy's coach, Elliot Uzelac, whose record is 7-25 in his third season at Annapolis. Navy football is in a trough. Recruiting hurdles cannot be entirely blamed because the other service academies have been doing well at fielding successful football teams.
 
Air Force Steals the Show
Air Force beat both Army and Navy this year to take away the Commander-in-Chief Trophy from the Cadets and the automatic invitation to the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, where Air Force will play Mississippi on Dec. 29.
This will be the last football game for Army's 14 senior starters and Navy's 7. One, Army's Mike Thorson, is a 5-foot-9-inch, 180-pound cornerback who has made 51 tackles and carries a 3.995 academic grade-point average as an economics major.
On Tuesday, Thorson was awarded a $4,000 graduate studies scholarship as a member of the National Football Foundation's scholar-athlete team and he is a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship and a Marshall Fellowship. He also is the deputy brigade commander, the second-highest position within the Corps of Cadets chain of command. He will be starting his 23d consecutive game.

HEADLINE: AQUINO ACCUSES 3 OF LEADING REBELS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Dec. 8

 BODY:
In her first public appearance since the Philippine Government was nearly toppled, an angry President Corazon C. Aquino today named three men - the country's Vice President, its chief opposition leader and her own cousin - as the leading suspects in the abortive rebellion.
Wearing her signature bright yellow dress and speaking with few notes to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters this afternoon, Mrs. Aquino vowed to ''go after these people who want to destroy our economy and who want to destroy the Filipino people.''
Mrs. Aquino's aides said the speech was specifically intended to counter charges that she was weak, indecisive and unwilling to risk open confrontation with her political enemies and with rebellious factions in the military. Mrs. Aquino rejected those charges today, saying, ''Just because I am a woman they belittle me.''
But she said nothing about how, or even whether, she would punish the military officers who staged a six-day rebellion in which 79 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded. Nor did she discuss how to cure the rampant economic problems and urban decay that rebels and many other Filipinos say prompted the rebellion. 
 
Holdouts Won't Surrender
She announced a doubling, to about $1.50 a day, of the amount that soldiers are paid for their incidental expenses, an effort to reward the military units that remained loyal to her.
As Mrs. Aquino delivered her speech, on the site of one of the huge rallies that helped put her in office in February 1986, the last holdouts in the rebellion refused to surrender.
The renegades who took Manila's Makati financial district returned to their barracks on Thursday, but the rebels holding an air base in Cebu, the nation's second-largest city, about 350 miles from Manila, broke off negotiations. To step up the pressure, the Government flew in hundreds of loyalist troops and appeared to be threatening an attack on the rebel position. The Senate also continued debating new restrictions to be announced here as part of the state of emergency.
In her speech, Mrs. Aquino stopped short of accusing anyone of starting the rebellion. She said a five-member commission she established earlier in the week would resolve such questions.
She spoke emotionally - in native Tagalog instead of English - about her three prime suspects. They are Vice President Salvador H. Laurel, who was in London and Hong Kong during the rebellion; Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a leading opposition figure and the man who directed the military revolt against Ferdinand E. Marcos, which put her in power; and Eduardo ''Danding'' Cojuangco, her cousin and one of the nation's richest men, who left the country with Mr. Marcos in February 1986. Mr. Conjuango, who is under indictment here, slipped back into the country from California several days before the rebellion.
 
Presidential Ambitions
Speaking quickly, Mrs. Aquino first attacked Mr. Enrile, who was Minister of Defense under Mr. Marcos and under her. He turned against the Marcos Government in the early 1980's and was a leading force behind the junior officers who mounted the revolt against Mr. Marcos.
Senator Enrile and President Aquino split months after she took office, when he challenged her authority and questioned publicly her handling of the Communist insurgency. Mrs. Aquino dismissed Mr. Enrile in November 1986, when he was linked to a rumored coup attempt involving some of his closest military aides. He was later elected a Senator and has made no secret of his presidential ambitions.
Mrs. Aquino said she was enraged to learn earlier this week that a Senate committee looking into the rebellion included Mr. Enrile. ''Are we fooling each other?'' she asked today. ''He ought to be investigated instead of being the investigator.''
Mr. Enrile, a Harvard-educated lawyer, has said in recent days that he would welcome an investigation and would step down from the Senate committee. Mrs. Aquino said, ''It's good to see he has a little shame left.''
Gregorio ''Gringo'' Honasan, a renegade former colonel who was a leader of a 1987 coup and is believed to be deeply involved in this one, was once Mr. Enrile's security aide. But Mrs. Aquino did not directly say that Mr. Enrile was working with Mr. Honasan, a widespread assumption here.
 
'Flick Him Like a Fly'
As the crowd cheered, Mrs. Aquino then turned to Mr. Laurel, also known by the nickname ''Doy,'' who ran on her ticket in 1986 but later split with her. Mr. Laurel has been answering charges all week that in interviews while he was in Hong Kong during the rebellion. he said he would be willing to serve in a military government. Mr. Laurel said he was misquoted, but an impeachment effort was begun this week by Mrs. Aquino's loyalists.
She asked the crowd, ''Should I bother mentioning Doy or shall we just flick him like a fly?'' Mrs. Aquino rejected Mr. Laurel's calls for her resignation. And she recounted, as she has on other occasions, how he was out of town during several previous coup attempts, suggesting it was more than coincidental. ''I will never give up the presidency to him,'' she vowed.
Finally she turned to Mr. Cojuanco. ''The suspicious thing,'' she said, ''is that one week after he returned, there was a rebellion. Our next election is not until 1992. Those who want to be president will have to wait until then.''
 
'She Has Come of Age'
Mrs. Aquino's supporters were clearly relieved to see her beginning to swing back at her opponents, hoping that it will begin to win back the public support for her administration that has been rapidly deteriorating.

HEADLINE: CANADA UNNERVED BY SLAYINGS OF 14

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTREAL, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Although Canada has witnessed mass killings over the years, none have involved so many deaths, or so profoundly shaken the national psyche, as the rampage this week at the University of Montreal.
On Wednesday, a 25-year-old unemployed recluse, shouting ''You're all feminists!'' shot and killed 14 young women at the university's school of engineering, while wounding 13 other people, 9 of them women. Then he turned his semiautomatic hunting rifle on himself.
A three-page suicide note found on the body of the gunman, Marc Lepine, along with information provided later by the police, offered a picture of a man who felt he had failed at virtually everything, from getting into graduate school to falling in love - and blamed women for it. 
Apart from the public shock, anger and grief expressed in candlelight vigils and lowered flags across the nation, there is also a sense of shame here over the crime: a realization that the nation may not, as many Canadians had long supposed, be somehow less vulnerable to such horrors than its neighbors in the United States.
 
'A Kick in the Teeth'
''This thing has been a real kick in the teeth for sanctimonious types like me,'' said Prof. Elliott Leyton of Memorial University in Newfoundland, an anthropologist who has studied mass and serial killers. ''It shows we've fully entered the modern era and no longer have anything to be smug about.''
''When I first heard about it, I thought I was listening to something that had happened in California or New York,'' said Yuri Dayan, a cab driver who moved to Montreal from Israel 21 years ago. ''I thought, 'It's crazy - this isn't supposed to happen in Canada.' ''
There has been a rush of speculation on the workings of the gunman's mind, on whether Montreal's overburdened hospitals have the counseling resources to help avert such acts, and about the effectiveness of Canada's already strict gun-control laws. The gunman was able to purchase his American-made rifle in Montreal legally a few weeks earlier because he had no criminal record.
 
Violence Against Women
Mostly, however, the incident has focused attention on the issue of sexism and violence against women.
Some people, including many feminist groups, have characterized the shootings as an extreme version of a kind of male hatred that they believe has contributed to rapes, beatings and other forms of abuse of women.
''I think it's dangerous to treat this as an isolated incident,'' said Etoile Stewart, a member of the Concordia University Women's Collective, one of several student groups that sponsored a vigil at the murder scene on Thursday night. ''There are still men beating women, raping women, knifing women. Unfortunately, we live in a society where misogyny is encouraged.''
Several women students, including some who survived the massacre at the University of Montreal's engineering school, said they feared that such a mass assault could happen again -and that women studying in fields traditionally dominated by men, like engineering, could be more vulnerable.
 
'So Frightened, So Angry'
''Women everywhere were so frightened and so angry,'' said Jocelyne Cottier, the coordinator of the Concordia University Women's Center, a university-sponsored group that offers counseling and organizes discussion groups on women's issues.
Margaret Atwood, a Canadian novelist who has explored women's issues in her work, said that the killings of the 14 women, who ranged in age from 21 to 31, ''clearly touched many people.'' But she said she hesitated to make direct comparisons with violence in the United States or Britain.
''Every society has its craziness, which takes different forms,'' she said from her home in Toronto. ''Every incident is culture-specific.''
There was no indication that Mr. Lepine had used drugs or alcohol, the police said. He shared a large apartment with his mother, a sister and a male roommate. His suicide note, written in French, included an apparent enemies list of 15 prominent Quebec women, one of whom was said to be a provincial cabinet minister.
 
Typical but Atypical
Detectives, noting that Mr. Lepine had unsuccessfully applied for admission to the University of Montreal engineering school, said he may have been enraged that women were accepted into traditionally male fields while he was not.
Professor Leyton, author of the 1986 book, ''Hunting Humans: The Rise of the Modern Multiple Murderer,'' said that the gunman seemed superficially to fit the classic profile: a frustrated, lonely person from a conventional background who takes out all his aggressions in one suicidal assault.
But Professor Leyton said there was a striking difference in the Montreal shooting.
''This is one of the very few mass murder cases I know of in which women were specifically targeted,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
Castro Says He'll Resist Changes Like Those Sweeping Soviet Bloc

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 8

 BODY:
In his bluntest public rejection yet of the profound political and economic changes now sweeping the rest of the Soviet bloc, President Fidel Castro of Cuba has vowed to resist all such reforms even if it means a parting of the ways with his allies.
''If destiny assigns us the role of one day being among the last defenders of socialism in a world in which the Yankee empire has succeeded in embodying Hitler's dream of world domination, we will know how to defend this bulwark to the last drop of blood,'' President Castro said in a speech delivered on Thursday in Havana and monitored here.
Mr. Castro's remarks were his first public comment on the state of East-West relations since last weekend's summit talks between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and reflected his growing ideological isolation within the Eastern bloc. At the meeting off Malta, Mr. Bush called on Mr. Gorbachev to do more to prevent Cuba from shipping arms to Nicaragua and to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador and also offered to assist Mr. Gorbachev in carrying out economic reforms. 
 
Doesn't Mention Names
Speaking at ceremonies honoring Cuban combatants killed in the course of ''internationalist missions'' in Angola, Ethiopia and other African countries, Mr. Castro did not criticize Mr. Gorbachev or any Eastern European leader by name. But he complained of the difficulty of building a Communist state when others are ''slandering socialism, destroying its values, discrediting the party and liquidating its leading role, doing away with social discipline and sowing chaos and anarchy everywhere.''
Mr. Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost, or restructuring and openness, have aroused interest in Cuba, which experimented briefly with a degree of economic liberalization early in the decade but then reversed course with a ''rectification'' program after Mr. Castro decided that some people were making too much money and egalitarianism was eroding. The Soviet leader received a warm popular welcome when he visited Cuba in April, but Mr. Castro has rejected many of Mr. Gorbachev's innovations as violations of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy.
The transformations taking place elsewhere in the Soviet bloc coincide with Cuba's most serious political and leadership crisis in years. In July, several senior Cuban military officials were executed for drug trafficking in circumstances that have yet to be fully explained, and economic and morale problems have also forced Mr. Castro, who is 63 years old and has been in power for more than 30 years, to shake up his Cabinet.
The Cuban leader has long feared that the lessening of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union will translate into changes in the military status quo in Europe that would increase Washington's ability to impose its own views elsewhere, including the Caribbean. He also remains firmly committed to the principle of ''proletarian internationalism,'' a justification for intervention abroad that he fears is on the wane elsewhere.
 
Soviet-Cuban Meeting
According to reports from Managua, the Soviet Ambassador there met with Nicaraguan and Cuban officials on Nov. 28, just days after Mr. Bush had blamed the Soviet Union for supplying arms to Mr. Castro that eventually ended up in the hands of rebels in El Salvador. ''We are hearing that he really read them the riot act,'' said a European diplomat based in the Nicaraguan capital.
The official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported on Thursday that American forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station had fired twice on Cuban sentries outside, calling the incident ''serious and of unpredictable consequences.'' Today, a Pentagon spokesman denied the charge, saying ''no weapons or rounds ever crossed the fence line.''
In his address, Mr. Castro justified the prohibition in Cuba of some Soviet publications, such as Sputnik and Moscow News. He said the measure was necessary because such publications were ''filled with venom against the U.S.S.R. itself and against socialism'' and have ''demanded the cessation of just and equitable commercial relations between the U.S.S.R. and Cuba.''
Since the early 1960's the Soviet Union has heavily subsidized the Cuban economy through such measures as the purchase of Cuban sugar at prices well above market levels and the sale at bargain rates of petroleum, some of which Cuba then resells to gain hard currency. Those subsidies, amounting to as much as $5 billion a year, have increasingly been questioned by Soviet officials as part of the economic restructuring that is under way.
'Negative Economic Consequences'
''From the crisis that has emerged in the socialist camp, we can only expect negative economic consequences for our country,'' Mr. Castro said.
Just hours before Mr. Castro's appearance at the war commemoration ceremonies, during which he was accompanied by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, the Cuban Government for the first time announced casualty figures for the more than 400,000 soldiers and ''technical advisers'' it has sent to fight in Africa over the last 15 years. According to official statements, 2,289 Cubans have died abroad, more than 2,000 of them in Angola.

HEADLINE: Better Traps Being Built For Delinquent Parents

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEDIA, Pa., Dec. 8

 BODY:
The Delaware County Domestic Relations Court here has devised a new way to find people who fail to pay child support and elude arrest: the court advertises their names on a ''Most Wanted'' list 300 times a week on cable television and once a month in full-page newspaper advertisements.
''It's been very successful,'' said Francis J. Catania, president judge of the court. ''The Most Wanted list has helped us locate 33 people, over half of the people we have named. Many other people who felt they might be next on the list have also come in and made voluntary payments.'' 
Delaware County is not alone in circulating Most Wanted lists; Florida and Virginia began similar programs last month, and Maryland plans to start one in January. Public officials have discovered that programs to collect child support not only raise money for children whose parents have divorced or perhaps never married, but also pay for themselves by reducing welfare expenses.
With program budgets rising by almost 50 percent in the past five years, enforcement agencies have been able to use increasingly sophisticated collection techniques. Many use computers to search public data banks, including credit files and rosters of prison inmates, for clues about the location and financial affairs of fugitive parents. To increase pressure on late payers, Texas officials say that next week they will begin using a computer system that will automatically give credit bureaus the names of parents who are more than $500 behind in child support payments.
 
Tightening of Rules
Despite the recent gains in enforcing child support orders, specialists say far too little money is being collected to feed, house and clothe the children.
As a result of the 1988 overhaul of the nation's welfare system, Federal law now requires states to enforce guidelines insuring that support payments are consistent within a state. Payments previously varied from judge to judge, a situation that sometimes led to ''judge shopping.''
The new law also requires that the amount of court-ordered payments be withheld from the paychecks of parents who have been delinquent in providing money. By 1994 all child support payments will be automatically withheld.
The Federal Government reimburses states for up to two-thirds of the costs of their collection programs.
As a result of the new law, judges say they are demanding larger support payments and are quicker to strip delinquent parents, usually fathers, of their property instead of trying to collect back payments. ''I take away their rings and empty their wallets right in court,'' said Judge Charles D. McClure, chief judge of Florida's Second Judicial Circuit, which is based in Tallahassee.
 
Unfilled Needs Are Seen
But Federal and state efforts are not enough, according to a Congressional study made public on Thursday by Representative Thomas J. Downey of New York, Mr. Downey, a Suffolk County Democrat, is acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources.
''The good news is that the program seems to have improved since the mid-1980's,'' said Mr. Downey. He noted that the report, by the Congressional Research Service, found that state programs collected $4.6 billion last year, or almost double the $2.4 billion they collected in 1984.
''The bad news comes from census data, which show that we still are not doing a very good job at helping children who need support from their parents,'' he said.
The census data, based on a 1985 survey, indicate that only 25 percent of 8.8 million mothers who were owed child support were receiving full payments; half received nothing. Parents who do not have custody of their children made a total of $7.2 billion in payments that year, when $10.9 billion was due. But the Congressional study said the true needs of the children amounted to $30 billion that year.
The census survey shows the average child support payment, when adjusted for inflation, declined 25 percent from 1978 to 1985. The average annual payment in 1985 was $1,679 for one child, $2,597 for two, $2,800 for three, $3,739 for four or more. Child support payments were lowest for women who were less educated, minority members or never married.
 
Success of Collection Efforts
Last year, the Congressional study said, child support payments collected by state agencies helped 200,000 families leave the welfare system and partly reimbursed the state and Federal Government for welfare grants made to another 600,000 families. The study found that these savings in welfare payments more than covered the $1.4 billion cost of the collection programs, which also collected $3.2 billion in child support payments for 1.1 million families who were not on public assistance.
Armed with the innovative new methods of tracking down delinquent parents, agencies have been conducting countywide roundups of child support fugitives, often on Father's Day. And state officials say they expect to order more paternity tests now that the Government reimburses states for 90 percent of the laboratory costs; 300,000 tests were done last year to determine financial responsibility for children in cases where the father's identity was in dispute.
Advocates for custodial parents say the new enforcement measures do not go far enough, and advocates for noncustodial parents say some go too far.
Geraldine Jensen, president of the Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, a membership organization, supports the new enforcement programs, but says they need to be much stronger. ''There are great laws on the books, but we still don't have adequate local enforcement,'' she said.
 
'I Was Embarrassed'
David L. Levy, president of the National Council for Children's Rights, an advocacy group for noncustodial parents, opposes some enforcement actions. He argues that if states publish the names of parents who fail to pay child support, the states should also publish the names of parents who fail to comply with court-ordered visitation rights.
Publication of a ''Most Wanted'' list can be stressful for the whole family, but some people see no alternative. ''I was embarrassed by it,'' said Patricia A. Huddy, a resident of Ridley Park, Pa., whose husband's name appeared on the Delaware County list this spring. ''But anything they have to do to bring him is O.K. with me.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Gain but So Does Joblessness As Expansion of Economy Slows

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Despite a surge in layoffs and the eighth straight monthly decline in factory jobs, the economy continued to generate jobs in November, the Labor Department reported today.
But the gains were not as great as the increase in the labor force, so the unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a point, to 5.3 percent, the highest since January. In all, 119.5 million Americans had civilian or military jobs and 6.73 million were looking for work in November.
The civilian unemployment rate, excluding the 1.7 million members of the armed services stationed in the United States, also rose one-tenth of a point, to 5.4 percent. A one-month increase of less than two-tenths of one percentage point is not considered statistically significant. 
Today's figures, the first comprehensive reflection of the economy's performance last month, appeared to indicate further slowing of the seven-year-old business expansion.
According to the department's survey of households, employment rose by 236,000 and unemployment by 169,000. The department's separate survey of business payrolls, considered a more reliable measure of job growth, showed an increase of 210,000 jobs last month, more than expected.
But the implied strength was nullified by a sharp revision in the job growth figures for October. Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said the department had overestimated hiring in state and local education, ''an industry,'' she said, ''which is especially difficult to measure in the fall months.''
 
Lower Interest Rates Likely
The slowing of job growth made it more likely that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates again to head off a recession, and that likelihood prompted rallies in the bond and stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 10.66 points to close at 2,731.44.
Yet analysts remain divided on whether the economy will continue to expand this winter or slip into a modest contraction.
''In general, the numbers point to a continuation of an economy that's growing, but at a slow pace,'' said Darwin L. Beck, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. He added that the November jump in layoffs was concentrated in the automobile industry, which has long been regarded as weak.
But Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorporation in Philadelphia, predicted that the gross national product would decline slightly in the last quarter of 1989, which would be the first quarterly contraction since the spring of 1986.
By common definition, a recession requires two consecutive quarters of decline; Mr. Levy said he expected a tiny gain in the first quarter of 1990.
 
Disquieting Surge in Layoffs
The number of laid-off workers jumped to 982,000 last month, 30 percent more than in October, and well above the past year's range of 750,000 to 875,000.
Officials and other analysts said the surge was not worrisome in itself but would be grounds for alarm if repeated. Mr. Levy said businesses had been cutting back payrolls because their profits were off and they were finding it harder to pass along higher costs to consumers.
The continuing decline in factory jobs was more clearly negative. In the overall decline of 27,000, as measured by the survey of payrolls, the biggest losers were in automobiles and electrical machinery. There were smaller declines in several other industries. On the other hand, there were gains in construction, machinery, printing and publishing, and oil and gas.
All four regions of the country showed an increase in unemployment, according to figures that, unlike the others, are not adjusted for seasonal variations. Unemployment rose two-tenths of a point in the Northeast, to 4.7 percent, and in the Midwest, to 5.5 percent; four-tenths of a point in the West, to 5.1 percent, and one-tenth of a point in the South, to 5.4 percent.
In New York State, unemployment rose to 5.2 percent from 4.7 percent in October; because it is based on a much smaller sample than the national figure, this increase may not be statistically significant. In New York City, where an unemployment survey was conducted for the first time in 20 months, the rate jumped to 6.5 percent, from 4.6 percent in March 1988. New Jersey's jobless rate was 5.1 percent in October, unchanged from October.
John Wieting, an economist for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the New York City and New Jersey figures resulted from a slowdown in the economy since the October 1987 stock market crash. ''More people are looking for work on the backdrop of a slower economy,'' he said, adding that the figures did not indicate that a recession was imminent.
''The economy is in a stall because of the crash but it hasn't fallen apart,'' Mr. Wieting said. ''It has slowed and leveled off.''
Among the 11 largest states, Pennsylvania and Texas showed increases in unemployment of eight-tenths of a point, to 5.4 and 7.2 percent; Michigan showed a statistically significant decline of nine-tenths of a point, to 7.3 percent, despite the auto industry's woes. There was no immediate explanation for this decline, but it followed a large increase, 1.2 points, in September. These figures are seasonally adjusted.
Nationally, the unemployed had been without jobs for an average of 11.7 weeks in November, slightly less than the average in October. Ten percent of the unemployed had been idle for more than six months.
The payroll survey also showed big gains for health services, wholesale trade, finance and real estate. Christmas hiring in general merchandise and other retail stores met normal seasonal expectations.

HEADLINE: Irresponsible Publicity on the Fur Industry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am writing to express my concern over the recent wave of publicity that has been given to anti-fur organizations. The foremost example was the season premiere of ''L.A. Law,'' which was aired on Nov. 2 on NBC television.
The show presented the fur industry in a very bad light, without the chance to defend itself. The main focus was several video clips of animals being caught in traps. After viewing this it is hard to make the audience realize that only a small percentage of furs are obtained in this manner. 
The majority of the furs come from ranch-raised animals treated with the utmost care and respect. There is no difference between a fur farm and a poultry farm, a cattle farm or a fish farm, and what is the difference between fur and leather?
Fur sales are down a bit, mostly due to overproduction, but also in part because of the furor caused by the anti-fur movement. There is still a demand for high-quality pelts like those produced in North America. The drop in the return on pelts has forced many trappers to go out of business. Therefore the car has taken the trapper's place. The numbers of wildlife killed and maimed on rural roads are proof of this.
The media for the most part have been very irresponsible in their coverage of the issue. They have chosen to cover a volatile and emotional issue without speaking to some of the largest fur producers in the world.
Although we were not asked, here is our response. The fur industry produces a renewable resource that makes use of the byproducts of other industries that would otherwise require their disposal. Fur farming generates more than $318 million in direct economic impact. Retail sales amount to $1.8 billion and have a positive impact on the international trade balance, since more than 50 percent of fur farmed in the United States is exported.
Most of all, the fur industry supports the right of a person to choose his or her own life style, and not impose his views on the rest of society.

HEADLINE: Unions, Docile Since '81, Show New Militancy

BYLINE: By A. H. Raskin;A. H. Raskin was for many years labor correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
The militancy that has made workers' movements so conspicuous in the struggle for human rights in Eastern Europe, China and Latin America shows incipient signs of resurgence in the U.S. trade unions for the first time since Ronald Reagan fired 11,500 striking Federal air traffic controllers and smashed their union in 1981.
The new mood was much in evidence at the biennial convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations in Washington last month. Solidarity was the convention's central theme, and Lech Walesa was on hand to acclaim the federation's pioneer role as his group's earliest and most steadfast backer.
Oddly, a similarly effusive tribute to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. as a sparkplug powering the resistance of underground labor movements abroad came from President Bush, whose support for the federation in its domestic objectives has been almost as invisible as was his predecessor's. 
''Labor,'' the President told the convention, ''has been an enduring force for freedom - at times a cry in the wilderness, at times the conductor of a mighty chorus - rejecting all forms of totalitarianism, fascist and Communist alike. With each passing year, through the labor movement, freedom is finding its voice.''
The one thing the 800 delegates found missing from Mr. Bush's rhapsodic 30-minute testimonial to them as ''the beating heart of American liberty'' was any remotest suggestion that he would join the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in its drive to put workers' rights at the top of its agenda. For a decade, the federation has called for reform of creaky labor laws in ways that would make it harder for union-busting employers to misuse them as devices for frustrating organization and collective bargaining.
The convention's opening day had been marked by a thunderous demonstration in support of striking unionists at Eastern Air Lines, Nynex and Pittston Coal. The strike in which unions are in deepest trouble, and for which they most fault the Bush Administration, is the nine-month-old walkout of machinists at Eastern.
Labor's high command had hoped that a strike might be averted altogether. It counted on a governmental procedure that had been virtually automatic before the Reagan-Bush era - appointment under the Railway Labor Act of a Presidential fact-finding board to make settlement recommendations. Frank Lorenzo, Eastern's chief, ranks in labor's book as a cross between Genghis Khan and Ebenezer Scrooge.
When hope for peace vanished and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., with Eastern's pilots and flight attendants in the vanguard, formed a united front to bolster the machinists, labor turned to its Democratic friends in command of Congress to build a bonfire under the President. Last month, both houses passed a measure calling for a bipartisan commission to investigate the dispute and make recommendations within 45 days. This bill was on Mr. Bush's desk when he appeared at the convention to shower accolades on the federation for its activities - but only those remote from these shores. At the end of his speech, there was tepid applause (in contrast to the tumultuous ovations accorded Lech Walesa), but this was soon drowned out by a chorus of shouts: ''Sign the bill! Sign the bill! Sign the Eastern bill!'' The President gave his answer just six days later - a veto that all but doomed the strike. The pilots and flight attendants quickly abandoned the picket lines, leaving the machinists in desolate isolation as Mr. Lorenzo makes over his crippled airline.
How crucial Government intervention is to unions involved in siege-like strikes is being illustrated on labor's other principal battlefield of 1989 -the half-year-long strike of the United Mine Workers against the Pittston Company in the Appalachian region.
The miners seemed in desperate straits until Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole intervened in late October to appoint former Secretary W. J. Usery Jr. as a ''supermediator.''
Pittston was swift to welcome her departure from the hands-off policy that Mr. Bush cited as his reason for vetoing the Eastern bill. That left union leaders with no doubt that Pittston had given a signal to the White House that it was hurting badly enough to want a face-saving way out. This is fine with the miners, who now see their first real hope for a contract that preserves the proud traditions of this once mighty, now shrunken union.
It did not take developments of the volcanic kind that made Lech Walesa a convert to private entrepreneurship to enlist U.S. unions as stalwart believers in a free economic system. But a decade in which antiunion employers have taken comfort from lopsided administration of the labor laws, and from the exaltation of greed in public policy, has provided scant fortification for labor's faith. The ferment that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. helped fuel in Europe may not stay that remote.
In its resolution pledging solidarity with all major strikes, the federation urged every union to seek contractual provisions permitting its members to quit work on ''floating demonstration days.'' These would let labor mount citywide or even nationwide mass rallies or picket lines in aid of beleaguered unionists. That is a long way from a general strike on the overseas model, but it is a warning of restiveness in a movement that feels it has been too docile too long.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Names Eight Appointees, Including Four Deputy Mayors

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins named eight appointees to his administration yesterday, including an experienced Federal prosecutor to head the New York City Department of Investigation, with responsibility for uncovering corruption in government.
If confirmed by the City Council, the prosecutor, Susan E. Shepard, could face the prospect of pursuing an inquiry that is under way by the department into Mr. Dinkins's financial affairs. At a news conference announcing her appointment, she said that Mr. Dinkins had not discussed the issue with her and that she would decide on her own whether to conduct the investigation or leave it to someone else if it was not resolved by the time Mr. Dinkins took office on Jan. 1.
Later, in an interview, she seemed to go a step further, saying, ''It would seem clear to me that if there are some substantial allegations that require investigation, that invites investigation by someone other than a person appointed by the Mayor.'' 
As expected, the Mayor-elect filled the central posts at City Hall by naming four deputy mayors, led by Norman Steisel, a former sanitation commissioner who is not close to Mr. Dinkins but is highly regarded for his management skills, as first deputy in charge of day-to-day operations. Three trusted aides will fill the other slots.
 
Core of Official Family
Bill Lynch, Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager and former chief of staff in the Manhattan borough president's office, will be deputy mayor for intergovernmental relations, overseeing dealings with the City Council, borough presidents and political groups. Mr. Dinkins's acting chief of staff, Barbara J. Fife, will be deputy for planning and development, and Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, a former deputy borough president and now Financial Services Commissioner, will oversee finance and economic development.
They will form the core of Mr. Dinkins's official family along with Victor A. Kovner, a lawyer who will be Corporation Counsel, and the press secretary, Albert Scardino. Mr. Scardino is a reporter who stopped work yesterday at The New York Times. His resignation does not take effect until Dec. 31 so he can take owed vacation time.
The Mayor-elect also said yesterday that Mary Schmidt Campbell, whom he recommended for Cultural Affairs Commissioner in the Koch administration, would remain in that post.
Even as Mr. Dinkins filled some posts, his panel seeking candidates for Police Commissioner has scheduled an interview for tomorrow morning with Police Chief Lee Brown of Houston, one of the most prominent black law-enforcement officials in the nation, people close to the search said. Chief Brown, who has been mentioned as candidate from the beginning of the search, is expected to join the small group of serious contenders that includes Richard J. Condon, the current commissioner, and Joseph McNamara, a former commander in New York who is now Chief in San Jose, Calif. The committee is to recommend three to five names to Mr. Dinkins by Monday.
Ms. Shepard, who worked 10 years as an assistant United States attorney in Brooklyn, where she was chief of the major crimes and general crimes sections, is chief counsel of the State Commission of Investigation. A registered independent, she is married to a Republican, former United States Attorney Raymond J. Dearie, now a Federal judge in Brooklyn.
She would be the first woman to be Investigation Commissioner, an in-house investiagor whose principal duty has often been perceived as much to spare mayors the embarrassment of scandals on their watch as to root out wrongdoing. In her first encounter with reporters yesterday in a news conference announcing the appointments at the City University Graduate Center in midtown, she struck a note of cool and considered independence.
''My background is as a prosecutor,'' she said as Mr. Dinkins stood behind her. ''I consider myself a professional. My only role is to try to find out where people in city government are not functioning well, to look at it, investigate it as hard as we can and make a decision about what ought to be done about it.''
 
Inquiry on Apartment
Mr. Dinkins is the subject of an inquiry by the department into possible conflicts of interest or failures to disclose his stock interest in a company that has cable television franchises, holdings he says he transferred to his son. The department has also been investigating the acquisition of a subsidized apartment by a senior aide in Mr. Dinkins's office whose income may have exceeded the limits for that unit.
Ms. Shepard said she had not discussed the inquiries with Mr. Dinkins or city officials and had no inside knowledge of them.
''If at the time that I take office, there is still an investigation or investigations pending, I will review the material and I will make a decision myself about whether it's something that I feel it's appropriate for me to handle or whether it's something that ought to be handled by somebody else,'' she said.
She said an option might be to appoint a special prosecutor or a special counsel for the investigation. But, Ms. Shepard said, she could not make such a decision yet. Asked whether there would be an inherent conflict for her to investigate Mr. Dinkins, Ms. Shepard said, ''I would certainly say that there could be serious questions, at the very least, about the appearance'' of doing so.
 
Background Clearances Required
But in the subsequent interview, she seemed more emphatic, noting an investigation of Mr. Dinkins by someone he did not appoint would be ''for his protection, as well as for mine.''
Mr. Dinkins said all the appointments announced yesterday were subject to final background clearances by the Investigation Department. All the candidates have replied to preliminary questionnaires. Only Ms. Shepard is subject to City Council confirmation.
Asked how his senior staff would work, and whether Mr. Lynch, the architect of his victory, would have more sway than the other deputies, including Mr. Steisel, Mr. Dinkins said the hierarchy would depend on the idea under consideration. He praised Mr. Steisel for agreeing to accept an awesome responsibility and acknowledged that Mr. Lynch, Mrs. Fife and Ms. Hernandez-Pinero were from his inner circle. He said that was good.
''Bill and Barbara and Sally are friends and people with whom I've worked,'' he said. ''I know their abilities, their skills. I know how hard they work. I know they're good people, I know their instincts. I know that on many issues we would almost not have to communicate; they would automatically sort of think like I do.''
Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Steisel acknowledged that they disagreed on the question of building garbage incinerators. Mr. Steisel promoted the idea as sanitation commissioner; Mr. Dinkins has called for a moratorium of several years on plans to build the first one in Brooklyn.
Mr. Steisel said yesterday that he did not consider the issue as a ''litmus test'' and viewed the job of deputy mayor as carrying out a mayor's policy. He added that there were always many discussions and debates in that process. Mr. Dinkins said that he would not shrink from discussion and that if Mr. Steisel disagreed, he would say, ''Prove your case.''

HEADLINE: New Administration: Profiles of Dinkins's Eight Appointees;
Barbara Joelson Fife: Deputy Mayor

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
Barbara Joelson Fife is a classic case of civic leader become political leader.
She first became involved in civic affairs promoting the causes of the environment, parks, urban renewal and waterfront rehabilitation. It was natural for Mrs. Fife to jump first to the political arena and then to her first public office as special assistant. This year she became acting chief of staff to Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins. 
Soon she will move to the the warren of offices around the mayor's office in City Hall, where she will be one of four deputy mayors.
The 58-year-old West Side Democrat is also a rare politician - someone who managed to bridge the ideological gap in the Democratic Party when that schism was at its worst, during the Vietnam War era. Though a peace advocate, a liberal and reform Democrat, she was friendly with such Democratic Party leaders as Patrick J. Cunningham and Joseph F. Crangle.
Mrs. Fife, whose husband, Martin, is a successful businessman, raised four sons while active in efforts to clean up the Hudson River and Jamaica Bay, to build low-income housing in Clinton and to preserve parks.
Only one of her sons, Richard, is involved in politics or government. He is a political media consultant.
A graduate of Bryn Mawr College in 1952, she returned to formal schooling and received a master's degree in urban planning from Hunter College in 1983. She also lectured at Hunter and administered an urban internship program before her appointment to the Borough President's office in 1985.
She has lived almost all her life in the city. Born in Newton, Mass., she moved to New York as a child with her parents. Her father, Julius Joelson, owned a small chain of movie houses in the Bronx, and Mrs. Fife still recalls Sunday afternoon family outings checking the various JJ Theaters.
Until her move to the Borough President's office, she was a familiar figure in politics for 20 years as a Democratic state committeewoman from the West Side, chairwoman of the state committee reform caucus for half that time; treasurer of the Democratic state committee for the last four years and a Democratic national committeewoman for the last nine years. She said she would resign her party posts.
She managed the unsuccessful campaign of Carl McCall for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 1982, but in the mayoral campaign this year she ran the Borough President's office while Mr. Dinkins campaigned.

Albert Scardino: Press Secretary

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
''The mayor of New York City is the second most important political figure in the country when it comes to setting the tone of public discourse,'' Albert Scardino said yesterday. ''To be able to help shape that tone is a truly remarkable opportunity for someone interested in public policy, which I am.''
Mr. Scardino, a New York Times reporter who stopped work at the newspaper yesterday, will have that opportunity as Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins's press secretary. His resignation at The Times takes effect Dec. 31 so he can take owed vacation time. 
''The mayor of New York is terribly important,'' Mr. Scardino said, ''because New York is the media capital of the world, and the media amplifies everything the mayor says. Dinkins, who is starting with immense good will in spite of some problems, has an opportunity to influence public discourse everywhere.''
In 1984, as editor of The Georgia Gazette, a weekly in Savannah, Mr. Scardino won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. He founded the paper in 1978 and edited it for more than six years.
''We had a hand, directly and indirectly, in getting 38 public officials to be convicted of, or to plead guilty to, felonies,'' he said. ''A lot of them went to jail.'' 60 Days' Notice on Ads After Mr. Scardino won the Pulitzer, he said, a daily newspaper in Savannah backed some candidates who won in the next election. Once in office, the candidates withdrew the city's legal advertising from The Gazette.
''They gave us 60 days' notice,'' Mr. Scardino said. ''The Gazette went out of business on the 59th day.''
Several days later, he joined The New York Times.
Mr. Scardino, who is 41 years old, was born in Baltimore and was raised in Savannah, where his father, Dr. Peter L. Scardino, practices medicine. Mr. Scardino graduated from Columbia University in 1970, returned to Columbia for a year to study international affairs, and went to work as a reporter for The Associated Press in West Virginia, where he met his wife, Marjorie.
After working as a freelance, Mr. Scardino spent two years at the University of California Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley, where he filmed a documentary about the Georgia Coast for his thesis. When efforts to sell the film foundered, he accepted the invitation of a group of Savannah lawyers to start The Gazette.
The Scardinos live in Manhattan, where his wife, a lawyer, is president of the North American edition of The Economist magazine. They have three children.

Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero: Deputy Mayor

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
As a child, she says, she was extremely shy, and to this day her mother says, ''Sally never bothered anyone.'' This may surprise those who have worked for and with Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, New York City's Commissioner of Financial Services, who was named yesterday to be deputy mayor for finance and economic development.
Her colleagues characterize Ms. Hernandez-Pinero as anything but shy and reserved. They use words like aggressive, opinionated, determined and ambitious. And Ms. Hernandez-Pinero says that her shy days are past. 
''Some people like it, some people do not,'' she said. ''I have a lot of conviction about the things I believe in and I am forceful.''
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, 37 years old, a deputy Manhattan borough president under Mr. Dinkins, grew up in the Bronx, one of five children of parents who came to the United States from the small town of Moca, P.R. Her father worked as a building superintendent and a dishwasher, and her mother still works as a school lunch worker at Junior High School 45. Her parents live in Co-op City in the Bronx. Ms. Hernandez-Pinero attended Junior High School 44 and Bronx High School of Science before she went to Wesleyan University, where, she says, ''I officially came out, fighting one cause or another.''
 
'A Real Problem-Solver'
As commissioner, she emphasized assisting small businesses and not-for-profit companies.
She is still overwhelmed by her appointment as deputy mayor. Several colleagues questioned her ability to compromise and wondered if the large companies knew her sufficiently. They also said that her focus on smaller businesses was not suited for these times. But others were confident she would succeed.
''To some degree it is true that she is not completely familiar to the business community,'' said First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff. ''But it would be a big mistake for anyone to underestimate Sally. She is a very talented, gifted person and real problem-solver.''
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said she is surprised by those who say she is not a team player.
''I'm the type who prepares very hard to back up my point of view,'' she said. ''But I can find the middle ground, and if my boss says he wants to do it another way, I accept that and go on to the next thing.''
She and her husband, Hector Pinero, a vice president of a real-estate company, have two sons, ages 3, and 8 months.

Susan E. Shepard: Investigation Commissioner

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FREITAG

 BODY:
Susan E. Shepard, who was named yesterday to head the Department of Investigation, may soon find herself in the awkward position of inheriting an investigation of the man who hired her, Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins.
Should that happen, Ms. Shepard said in a telephone interview yesterday, she probably would remove herself from the case.
''It would seem clear to me that if there are some substantial allegations that require investigation, that invites investigation by someone other than a person appointed by the mayor,'' she said. ''That's for his protection as well as for mine.'' 
Ms. Shepard, who is 46 years old and lives in Brooklyn Heights, sees her new position as an opportunity to combine her experience as a Federal prosecutor and as chief counsel for a state agency that investigates misconduct and corruption by local officials.
If her appointment is approved by the City Council, Ms. Shepard will take over an agency with 625 employees and a budget of $30 million. She would succeed Kevin B. Frawley.
 
Investigating Misconduct Charges
For the last three years, Ms. Shepard has been the chief counsel for the New York State Commission of Investigation. She is also a member of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Drug Enforcement Task Force.
The commission has no prosecutorial power, but it is the state's principal body for identifying abuses in state and local government through inquiries, public hearings and reports. It recently investigated allegations of misconduct by the Commissioner of Public Safety in Westchester County, and in the district attorney's office and the police department in Suffolk County, Ms. Shepard said.
Before her appointment to the state commission in 1986, Ms. Shepard served as an assistant United States attorney in the Eastern District for nearly 10 years. She headed the office's major-crimes section from 1983 to 1986.
Ms. Shepard, a native of Chicago, graduated from Radcliffe College with a degree in economics in 1965. She was an editor at Business Week magazine for three years before entering Columbia University Law School. After graduating from Columbia, she became a lawyer for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.
In 1976, David G. Trager, then the United States Attorney in the Eastern District, appointed Ms. Shepard as an assistant attorney.
In 1984, Ms. Shepard married Raymond J. Dearie, who was then the United States Attorney in the Eastern District and is now a Federal judge. They have two children.

 European Community leaders took an important step toward creating a central bank and a common currency, overriding objections from Prime Minister Thatcher of Britain. West Germany's Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, endorsed a French position contending that the community needs to be strengthened so it can help Eastern European countries gain greater freedom and handle the growing prospect of German reunification.

[1.] The economy continued to generate jobs in November, despite a surge in layoffs and a decline in factory employment, the Labor Department reported. But the gains were not as great as the increase in the labor force, and the unemployment rate was said to increase one-tenth of a point, to 5.3 percent, the highest since January. The Government also sharply lowered its estimate of the growth in jobs in October. [12.] Regulators seized New Jersey's largest savings association.

HEADLINE: Soviets Seek U.S. Venture

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 8

 BODY:
A Soviet research institute is negotiating to become a part owner of a Silicon Valley high-technology company.
Such an investment would involve a contribution of Soviet technology in return for what would apparently be the first Soviet equity stake in a fledgling technology company. It could set a precedent for converting Soviet scientific advances into viable commercial products.
The deal would be highly unusual because the Soviet Union would be backing a risky venture in the United States, entrusting the American entrepreneurial process to produce a payoff. 
Most ventures between the two countries have involved joint ventures operating on Soviet soil under Soviet rules, according to experts on such ventures. The few joint ventures based outside the Soviet Union have involved less risky terms, like payment in advance for any technology licensed from the Soviet Union.
Under terms of a preliminary agreement, the Institute of Protein Research of the Soviet Academy of Sciences will contribute a new way to produce proteins for use in research and for pharmaceutical manufacturing. In return it will receive a 5 percent stake in Transgene, a biotechnology company being formed in the San Francisco Bay area.
 
Contracts and Approval Seen
 Sierra Ventures, a Menlo Park, Calif., venture capital company that is the main investor in Transgene, said it expected the final contracts to be signed in a few weeks. Petri Vainio, a Sierra Ventures associate, said Soviet Government approval is also expected shortly from Vladimir Ezhkov, deputy chairman of the Soviet State Committee on Science and Technology.
But Aleksandr Markov, an official of the Committee on Science and Technology, said in Moscow today that a final agreement had not been reached. Aleksandr S. Spirin, director of the Institute for Protein Research, said this week that unbeknown to Transgene, the institute has also been talking to two other American companies - both established concerns rather than start-ups - and has not yet chosen among the three.
The participants have also only started the process of applying for United States Government approval to export any technology that Transgene develops back to the Soviet Union, which would be part of the arrangement.
Silicon Valley, where fortunes can be made overnight and some executives cruise around in Ferraris and Jaguars, would have been considered anathema to the Soviet Union a few years ago.
But faced with a deepening economic crisis, the Soviet Union is trying all types of new approaches to advance its economy and generate hard currency to pay for imports. ''It is leading them to do things that in earlier years would have been considered treasonous,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University.
Experts on Soviet business ventures said such an alliance of opposites could represent a new way of turning basic Soviet scientific advances into commercial products, while providing a new source of technological skill for Americans.
''You constantly hear of the wisdom of combining American ingenuity with Soviet research and turning it into useful products,'' said William D. Forrester, president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, a binational trade promotion group, who called the Transgene arrangement unique.
 
Putting Research to Work
 ''We have a lot of innovative technology but to implement it is a problem,'' said Aleksandr Yakovlev, deputy Soviet trade representative in Washington. But American start-up companies, he and others noted, have an unparalleled reputation for turning research advances into commercial gains.
The Soviet institute will realize a profit from its stake in Transgene if the company is successful and makes a public stock offering or is bought by another company. Sierra Ventures is putting up $1.85 million for a 50 percent share. The founders and employees will own the rest of the company.
Transgene will also lend the Soviet institute up to $500,000 over five years for research. That amount will be paid back if the technology is successful enough to earn sufficient royalties. To handle royalty payments and licensing, a joint venture would be set up in which Transgene would own 51 percent and the protein institute 49 percent.
Transgene is working on a new way to produce proteins, which include enzymes, hormones and virtually all other substances made by the body. Its technology could be an alternative to the genetic engineering now used to produce proteins like insulin, growth hormone and interferon that are sold as drugs.
 
An Expensive Process
 Genetic engineers mass-produce proteins by implanting the gene for production of that protein into bacteria or mammalian cells, which are then made to multiply. The cells are eventually killed and the protein of interest must be extracted from all the other proteins the cells produce, a costly process.
''You have to find the one protein you want out of hundreds or thousands,'' said K. P. Wong, a professor of chemistry at California State University in Fresno and a founder of Transgene. The two other founders have not yet been identified; they are biochemists who work for large food and drug companies and have not yet told their employers about Transgene.
Transgene will try to make artificial cells by putting ribosomes - the part of a cell that actually manufactures proteins - in a special vessel along with amino acids, the basic building blocks of proteins. The gene coding for only one protein would be inserted into the vessel, and the ribosomes would assemble the amino acids into that one protein.
While such artificial cells, known technically as cell-free translation systems, have been the subject of research for many years, it has been difficult to get them to work for more than a few minutes or produce more than tiny quantities of the desired protein, Professor Wong said. But the researchers at the Institute for Protein Research have a way to overcome these problems, he said.
Transgene plans first to make protein-synthesizing machines that could be used by biotechnology researchers to produce small quantities of needed proteins quickly. They would compete with machines now sold by companies like Applied Biosystems Inc. that can synthesize simple proteins by linking amino acids together in a purely chemical process.
For the longer term, the Soviet technology could someday be used for manufacturing proteins that serve as drugs.
 
Significant Advance Seen
 Two scientists not connected to Transgene said the Soviet technology appears to represent a significant advance in the area that could have promise for making proteins for use in research. But both scientists said they doubted it would be competitive with existing technology for mass-producing drugs.
Dennis Henner, director of the department of cell genetics at Genentech Inc, a leading biotechnology company, said it might be too expensive to supply pure amino acids and other ingredients for an artificial cell. With real cells, ''you feed them glucose and they provide all the components,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Caution, Patience: Advice for the 90's

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
For investors considering what year-end moves to make in their portfolios, the watchword from Wall Street experts is prudence. ''Nineteen-ninety may well be a year to sow rather than to reap,'' said Robert J. Farrell, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. ''Rates of return on stocks could well be below average, in general, after 10 years of far above-average returns in the 1980's.''
George J. Collins, president and chief executive of T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based investment and mutual fund manager, said, ''Individual investors would do well to lower their expectations and not take double-digit returns for granted.'' 
Both investment houses forecast a slowdown next year, which may keep a lid on the markets' overall performance, but they do not expect a recession. Both see pockets of long-term opportunity.
''A soft landing could lead to a soft takeoff,'' said John H. Laporte, president of T. Rowe Price's New Horizons and New America Growth Funds, noting that ''corporate cash flow remains strong and provides a solid underpinning to the market.''
He advises investors to keep high-quality stocks, but avoid borrowing to maintain positions, and expects small stocks, which have lagged in recent years, to become more attractive.
Mr. Farrell advises a ''strong position in long Treasury bonds and utilities'' along with plans to accumulate stocks in growth industries, when these shares show price declines. Favorable areas he cited include health care, pollution control, construction engineering, electrical equipment, natural gas, oil service and telecommunications, and he said he expected consumer stocks and financial issues to lose their leadership position.
He warned that portfolios dependent on an ever-rising market will not do well. Leveraged buyout activity will also decrease, he predicted, along with the chances for success in investing in companies that are likely takeover targets because of their underlying ''breakup'' value.
Interest rates next year are expected to be relatively stable, with comparatively low returns on cash and equivalents.
James Kochan, Merrill Lynch's chief fixed-income strategist, said, ''Municipal bonds appear to offer some of the best values in the fixed-income markets now,'' while intermediate-maturity agency, corporate and mortgage-backed securities should outperform Treasuries of similar maturities. ''A diversified fixed-income portfolio should include high-yield bonds at the current generous spreads to Treasuries,'' he added.
The ''junk bond'' market, said Richard S. Swingle, president of T. Rowe Price's High Yield Fund, with returns of 16 percent, is ''one of the most undervalued segments of the capital markets.'' Yields could reach 19 percent next year, he suggested, and the market could rally by midyear.
Most important international equity markets did well in 1989, noted M. David Testa, chairman of Rowe Price-Fleming International Inc. But the dollar's gains on the foreign-exchange markets trimmed the gains of American investors abroad.
Thomas R. Robinson, chief international equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, favors ''a more defensive strategy relative to world markets'' until the direction of global interest rates becomes clearer.
 
'The Prudent Speculator'
 For those who would like to master prudent, long-term investment strategies, Dow Jones Irwin has just published ''The Prudent Speculator - Al Frank on Investing'' ($22.95 in hard cover).
Mr. Frank, a former printer and college humanities teacher, was first drawn to the stock market in 1968 by his Ph.D. sponsor at the University of California at Los Angeles. He recalls that he found the market appealing as a participatory democracy and ''a way of making a living without working,'' while Ben Graham's book, ''The Intelligent Investor,'' was a ''fascinating intellectual exercise.''
Mr. Frank now manages $160 million for others, as well as publishing ''The Prudent Speculator,'' the newsletter that The Hulbert Financial Digest rated as the best performing for the nine years ended June 30. Mr. Frank's leveraged portfolio rose 461.4 percent in that time, compared with a 308.5 percent gain by the S.&P. 500.
Small investors belong in the market, Mr. Frank contends, if they buy ''small pieces of good companies and maintain them'' with at least a three-year outlook. He views Ford Motor, Chrysler, Reynolds Metals and Phelps-Dodge, for example, as undervalued companies.
The market is a good place to get rich slowly, he says, advising ''patience and selection and diversification and risk management.'' His book is a solid explanation of fundamental analysis. It is readable and understandable without being too cute as so many books for the popular market are.

HEADLINE: Hungary Asks Soviets to Base Trade on Dollars

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Seeking to expand trade with the West and bolster its economic efficiency, Hungary has moved to have its trade with the Soviet Union settled in dollars instead of rubles, State Department officials said today.
Other Eastern European governments are also seeking to free themselves from the ruble, but Budapest this week became the first to make a formal request to the Soviet Union for trade based on dollars, the officials said.
It is unclear whether Moscow has responded, or how. ''There is a testing of Soviet limits in so many areas these days that we are unwilling to say how far they will go here,'' one State Department official said. 
All trade between the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies is denominated in rubles, which have little value outside the Soviet Union. Eastern European countries have long complained that if they earn surpluses, they can spend the rubles only on Russian goods that they do not want.
 
Hungary Expects Surplus
 This year, Hungary is expected to earn a surplus of rubles, equivalent to about $1 billion, at the official exchange rate, in its trade with the Soviet Union. But Hungary has no plans to use the rubles, which are expected to remain in its account.
With dollars, Hungary and other Eastern European countries would be able to buy the better-quality consumer goods and sophisticated industrial products that they badly need, American officials said.
American officials expect Moscow to drive a hard bargain with the Hungarians. The Soviet Union now gives Hungary and other Eastern European countries a significant discount on the price of their oil purchases. Moscow could end the discount and insist that the Hungarians pay for the oil in dollars.
A shift from ruble-dominated trade is considered essential if Eastern European countries are to open their economies, establish market pricing and try to make their own currencies convertible into dollars or other Western currencies. Currently, these currencies are used exclusively in their home countries.
''It's a function of necessity if they want to have a rationalized price structure,'' said Joseph P. Tragert, economist at PlanEcon, a Washington-based research group specializing in Eastern Europe.
One American official just returned from Eastern Europe reported that many officials he spoke to consider nonconvertible currencies as much an obstacle to the purchase of Western products as Western export controls. ''They just don't have the money to buy anything,'' he commented.
Western governments strongly support efforts by the Eastern Europeans to give their currencies value in the world market.
One official said a plan was being drawn up for Poland, for example, in which Western governments and Japan would put $1 billion into a stabilization fund for the zloty to help make the Polish currency convertible.
The United States and West Germany, this official said, would each provide $200 million and Japan $150 million to the zloty fund. Britain is expected to contribute $100 million.
The plan is expected to be discussed at a meeting next week in Brussels of foreign ministers of 24 Western nations.

HEADLINE: Bush to Name Fed Governor

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
President Bush announced today that he would nominate David W. Mullins Jr., Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, to be a Federal Reserve Board governor.
Mr. Mullins, a former professor at the Harvard Business School, is the first person named by Mr. Bush to the seven-member board. The seat has been vacant since June, when H. Robert Heller resigned to become executive vice president of Visa International, the credit card company.
Mr. Mullins, who is 43 years old, is not identified with strong ideological positions. His academic speciality is in banking, capital markets and corporate finance and not in overall economic policy.
Nonetheless, he could provide a strong voice for the Treasury within the central bank. Recently, the Fed and the Treasury have been at odds. The Fed has insisted on keeping interest rates high as a means of fighting inflation. The Treasury has favored lowering rates to stimulate economic growth and bring down the value of the dollar.
Mr. Mullins was instrumental in drafting the Bush Administration's plan to rescue the savings and loan industry, and he had primary responsibility for guiding the measure through Congress this year.

HEADLINE: Japanese Purchase Aids Bond Rally

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rebounded and yields tumbled yesterday. Dealers said one reason for the market's rally was a substantial purchase of Treasury bonds by a Japanese brokerage house that many dealers refer to as the ''Billion Dollar Buyer,'' although the house has been known at times to sell just as equally large amounts of Treasury bonds.
Some dealers said the Billion Dollar Buyer was Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International's New York office, which first drew notice in October because of its huge purchases. But Eishi Wakabayashi, executive vice president at the company, said in a telephone interview that he could not talk about any of its specific business. 
The Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, soared a half-point immediately after the opening, then eased slowly during the rest of the session. In late trading, the long bond was up 14/32, at 102 26/32, to yield 7.88 percent, down from 7.91 percent the day before and 7.86 percent a week ago.
 
Initial Impact of Job Data
 The fixed-income market thrives on negative economic news because it supposedly reduces the demand for credit and its impact on interest rates and inflation. Thus the Government report that unemployment had climbed to 5.3 percent in November might have been expected to enchance the value of outstanding fixed-income securities, and initially it did, However, several dealers, who asked not to be identified, said the initial euphoria in the bond market over the rise in unemployment for November quickly vanished when the Ocotber employment data were revised from a previously reported gain of 233,000 non-farm jobs to only 93,000.
''The big revisions are not only disturbing but raise questions about the methods used in compiling them,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Also unexpected in the Government's report was a decline of 27,000 manufacturing jobs last month. Normally, this decline, which was twice what many economists forecast, would have been bullish for the bond market. But dealers said the large revisions in the October data made this figure also suspect.
 
Quoted Price Paid
 ''In any event, the Billion Dollar Buyer materialized again and snapped up an estimated $1.5 billion of long-term Treasury bonds off the screen of a West Coast dealer and perhaps another $500 million from local dealers,'' Mr. Sullivan said. He meant the buyer simply paid the price quoted on the Telerate screen, rather than negotiating a more favorable price, as large buyers typically do.
Mr. Sullivan said: ''The fact that dealers were eager to sell such large amounts in a rising market to the so-called Billion Dollar Buyer tells us that dealer inventories may be larger than the Street thinks. In the midst of all this, the Federal Reserve was on the sidelines, which also suggests that it has no immediate intention to ease. Many of us think the Fed is comfortable with the funds at between 8 3/8 and 8 1/2 percent.''
Indeed, the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans and is thus considered the bedrock cost of credit, held steady at 8 3/8 percent, after trading a bit higher at 8 7/16 percent for most of the day.
 
Large Declines for Bills
 The discount rates on Treasury bills, usually most immediately influenced by the funds rate, posted large declines. The 90-day bills lost 10 basis points, at 7.59 percent; the six-month bills fell eight basis points, to 7.33 percent, and the one-year bill rate dropped 10 basis points, to 7.20 percent.
The Treasury announced that it planned to auction $9.75 billion of new one-year bills on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 10.66 but Is Down for the Week

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Helped by early strength in the bond market, stock prices rose modestly yesterday.
After shooting up nearly 17 points in the first half-hour, the Dow Jones industrial average traded in a narrow range through most of the day. It closed at 2,731.44, a gain of 10.66 points.
For the week, the closely watched market indicator fell 16.21 points, or six-tenths of a percent. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, rising issues outnumbered falling ones by 813 to 646.
Volume on the Big Board fell to 144.9 million shares, from 162 million on Thursday.
 
Speculation on Rate Cut
 Sharp downward revisions in the October non-farm payroll figures raised speculation that the November data might also be revised downward, showing a further weakness in the economy that could compel the Federal Reserve Board to ease credit by lowering interest rates.
The Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls expanded in November by an unexpectedly large 210,000 jobs. It also showed that the number of new non-farm jobs created in October was revised to 93,000, from 233,000.
''The large adjustment in October non-farm payrolls took the edge off any ill effects from the higher November reported figures,'' said Gene Jay Seagle, chief technical analyst at Gruntal & Company. ''Investors are wondering if they should be so sensitized to statistics that change so readily. Still, the economy is more and more conducive to easing by the Fed.''
 
Year-End Rally Envisioned
 As year-end selling for tax reasons abates, Mr. Seagle said, the stock market is likely to find the going easier. He said a year-end rally could take the Dow above the 2,800 level.
''The market looks like a year-ago repeat, with the powerful peace catalysts introducing the third phase of the bull market into the new year,'' Mr. Seagle said. By late in the day the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond was up 14/ 32, to 102 26/32, to yield 7.88 percent.
In the broader maket, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.10 points, to 348.69, while the New York Stock Exchange composite gained 0.54, to 192.92.
Among individual issues, Pennzoil jumped 3 1/4, to 86 1/2, on speculation that Chevron might try to take over Pennzoil. Chevron announced that it was filing a lawsuit contending that Pennzoil had illegally accumulated its stock and that it had arranged a $5 billion line of credit ''to capitalize on opportunites that may develop.''
J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil's chairman, reiterated that Pennzoil had no interest in taking over Chevron, which gained 1/8, to 66 7/8.
 
Report on Eastern-AMR Talks
 AMR slipped 3/4, to 64, after rising earlier, on a report that it was near an agreement to buy the Latin American routes of Eastern Airlines from Texas Air. Analysts said Eastern could get a cash infusion of $300 million to $400 million if the deal was completed. Texas Air benefited from the news, analysts said, rising 1 1/4, to 13 5/8.
Gainers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, up 1 1/8, at 78; Du Pont, up 1/8, at 120 7/8; Exxon, up 3/8, at 49; Sears, Roebuck, up 3/8, at 38, and Chrysler, up 1/2, at 19 3/8.
Compaq Computer fell 3 3/4, to 85 7/8. Charles Wolf, an analyst at First Boston, lowered his rating on the company to a ''hold'' from a ''buy'' and cut his 1989 and 1990 earnings estimates.
Pfizer, which projected slightly lower earnings for the fourth quarter, dropped 4 3/8, to 69 1/8.
Tonka was among the bigger losers in percentage terms, falling 2 1/2, to 11 1/4. Citing lackluster holiday sales, the company lowered its revenue estimates for 1989.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index edged up 0.36, to 375.45. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dipped 0.09, to 456.22.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Marginally Weaker; Gold Prices Soar in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended marginally weaker yesterday against most key currencies after the Government reported that the jobless rate rose last month to a 10-month high of 5.3 percent.
Gold rose in domestic trading following a big advance overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $411.80 an ounce, up $1.80 from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $411.50 an ounce, up $1.90. 
Currency dealers said the November unemployment data did little to move the dollar because it was within market expectations, although some traders were confused by a sharp revision in the previous month's figures.
The Labor Department said the rate for civilian unemployment alone increased to 5.4 percent in November from 5.3 percent in October - the highest level since January - despite the addition of 210,000 non-farm jobs last month.
While 210,000 is a moderately strong number for new jobs, the Government also sharply revised its job growth figures for October to 93,000 from 233,000.
 
'A Mixed Bag' of Data
 ''It's hard to know how much to react to data that are subject to revisions of that magnitude,'' said Trevor Woodland, a vice president and chief corporate dealer for Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. ''What we got was a mixed bag.''
In Tokyo the dollar ended at 144.27 Japanese yen, up 0.14 yen from Thursday's close. It traded at 144.20 yen in London, and 144.300 yen in New York, down from 144.305.
The dollar declined against the British pound, which traded at $1.5793 in London, compared with $1.5750 Thursday, and at $1.5825 in New York, up from $1.5780.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.7705 West German marks, down from 1.7725; 1.5970 Swiss francs, up from 1.5900; 6.04885 French francs, down from 6.0515; 1,304.00 Italian lire, down from 1,307.25, and 1.16225 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16175.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's figires, included: 1.7720 West German marks, unchanged; 1.5985 Swiss francs, up from 1.5920; 6.0565 French francs, up from 6.0560; 1,306.50 Italian lire, down from 1,308.00, and 1.1615 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625.
The dollar, which on Thursday dipped below 2 Dutch guilders in Europe for the first time since Jan. 3, recovered to an even 2 guilders late yesterday.
Gold soared in London to a late bid of $411.55 an ounce, from $404.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, it rose to $409.25 an ounce, from $404. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold gained $2.74 an ounce to close at $407.75. Silver prices also strengthened. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose 2.1 cents an ounce, to $5.644. Silver closed in London at $5.64 an ounce, up from $5.60 Thursday.

HEADLINE: TOP AIDES TO BUSH ARE VISITING CHINA TO MEND RELATIONS

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The White House national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, made a surprise visit to Beijing today and said he had come as an emissary of President Bush ''to bring new impetus and vigor'' into United States-Chinese relations.
Ending a suspension of high-level contacts with China imposed after soldiers in Beijing killed hundreds of democracy demonstrators in June, Mr. Scowcroft said it was time for the United States and China to find areas where agreement is possible and ''to isolate for another time those areas of disagreement.''
Mr. Scowcroft was accompanied on the previously unannounced visit by Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State. Both men are friends and former colleagues of Henry A. Kissinger, who as President Nixon's national security adviser and Secretary of State led the way to normal relations with China and who is regarded warmly here. 
 
Briefing Beijing on Malta
The ostensible reason for the visit was to brief Chinese leaders on last weekend's Soviet-American summit meeting in Malta, but it was clear that President Bush had decided that it was time to end China's quarantine.
''We believe it is important that we not exhaust ourselves in placing blame for problems that exist,'' Mr. Scowcroft said at a dinner given by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
The United States had earlier welcomed the moves toward democracy in China and criticized the subsequent crackdown by the Chinese Army, but even though the White House reaction was mild compared to that of Congress, Beijing protested bitterly, accusing Washington of hypocrisy and interference in its internal affairs.
 
Critical of Change in Europe
China has also been critical of the changes sweeping the Communist movement in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and of the close ties between Washington and Moscow.
The visit raised the possibility that a major irritant in relations between the two countries - the sanctuary provided in the American Embassy here to the dissident couple Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian - might also be resolved in these talks.
The Chinese have issued warrants for the arrest of the couple, who sought refuge in the embassy during the June crackdown, and called them counterrevolutionaries.
 
High Hopes Before Crackdown
Before the crackdown, the Bush Administration had high hopes for close relations with China, where Mr. Bush had been the American envoy and where he has many friends. The Administration reacted carefully to the killings in Beijing and tried to temper heated Congressional reaction.
In addition to banning high-level contacts, the Administration suspended military exchanges and arms shipments to China and used its leverage at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to defer new loans to China.
But contacts continued as usual in many areas as American officials said that a continuing relationship with China was too important to neglect or abandon in a period of such profound global change.
Even though there was a White House ban on high-level meetings, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met with Foreign Minister Qian in New York during his visit to the United Nations in September. And the Administration allowed a waiver of the sanctions so commercial planes could be shipped to China.
 
For China, Obvious Pleasure
Chinese officials have reacted to this visit with obvious pleasure. Mr. Qian met with the Americans for two hours this afternoon before the formal banquet tonight. On Sunday, they are to meet separately with Prime Minister Li Peng, Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, and the Communist Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, before leaving for Tokyo to brief Japanese leaders.
The meeting with Mr. Deng, who is 85 years old, is particularly significant, since he retired from public life in November and had indicated that he was no longer going to meet high-level visitors.
In Washington, President Bush moved to try to head off Congressional criticism of the new opening to China. His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ''The President has concluded that it is appropriate and in the long-term interests of the United States to inform the Chinese leadership of his discussions with the Soviet leader,'' Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
 
China Still 'Part of the World'
While President Bush ''deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen Square last June, China nevertheless remains part of the world around us,'' the statement said. ''The President views China as an important country in world affairs.''
Mr. Qian, in his banquet toast tonight, welcomed Mr. Scowcroft as ''an old friend,'' and said his visit shows the importance President Bush attaches to United States-Chinese relations, ''for which we would like to express our appreciation.' '
''As important as our differences are,'' Mr. Qian said, ''they cannot obliterate the major common interests between us.'' He said that the Chinese leadership believed that the visit ''will certainly be helpful in promoting mutual understanding, overcoming difficulties and removing differences between both countries so that Sino-United States relations may return to normal and further develop at an early date.''
In his toast, Mr. Scowcroft said that he and Mr. Eagleburger had come ''as friends, to resume our important dialogue on international questions of vital interest to both our nations.'' He said that in addition to briefing the Chinese about Malta, ''we also come today to bring new impetus and vigor into our bilateral relationship and seek new areas of agreement - economic, political and strategic.''
 
Seeking Common Ground
''Speaking as a friend,'' Mr. Scowcroft said, ''I would not be honest if I did not acknowledge that we have profound areas of disagreement - on the events at Tiananmen, on the sweeping changes in Eastern Europe.'' But in their meetings, he said, ''we seek to outline broad areas where agreement is possible and to isolate for another time those areas of disagreement.''
The Americans had also come, he said, ''to reduce the negative influence of irritants in the relationship.''
In the last three weeks, the Chinese have lodged three protests with the United States over Congressional moves to strengthen economic sanctions on China and to allow Chinese students currently in the United States to extend their visas. The last protest came on Friday when Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu met with American Embassy officials here.
President Bush had vetoed a Congressional effort to allow Chinese students who feared persecution in China to remain in the United States, for which the President was widely criticized. But he had accomplished the same ends administratively, Mr. Liu said.
He said charges that students might be persecuted upon their return home were groundless, and said he had expressed ''our utmost indignation'' in a formal protest to the Americans.
Tonight, however, the talk was all conciliatory. Mr. Scowcroft said that it was President Bush's ''strong desire'' to see these talks make progress. ''Both sides must persevere, now more than ever,'' Mr. Scowcroft said. ''The sooner we set about this task, the better.''
According to the official Chinese press agency, '' talks on some major issues'' continued immediately after the banquet between Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Qian. The agency said the talks today were ''helpful'' and ''constructive'' and took place in a ''friendly, sincere and frank atmosphere,'' the usual diplomatic catchwords for productive conversations with moments of bite.
American officials reached tonight would not comment on the talks or on the Chinese press agency's characterization of them.

HEADLINE: Playing Games With Labor Laws: When Work Fills a Child's Hours

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Right here, under the nose of the Federal Government, children not yet in their teens are working 20, 30 and 40 hours a week in flagrant violation of the child labor laws.
The children dart after commuters at subway stations, scamper door to door in affluent neighborhoods and ply the busy sidewalks just blocks from the White House, selling boxes of candy for $4 to $5 and keeping a dollar a box.
Federal labor laws prohibit most paid work for children under 14 years old so as to protect them from commercial exploitation and keep them in school, and the laws set strict limits on how much children under 16 can work after school and on weekends. But Federal and state officials say that in scores of communities, more and more employers, like many who manage candy peddlers, are flouting the laws.
The Labor Department says it found 22,508 children working in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act in the 1989 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. That is more than twice the levels of the first half of the 1980's and the highest since the law was enacted in 1938. New York State studied child labor last year and found 182 children working illegally in New York City. It also found 122 businesses, most of them garment makers, employing children illegally. 
 
Turning to Children
Officials say an important reason for the rapid rise in child labor violations is the nation's low unemployment rate, which has hovered around 5 percent for more than a year. Pressed to find people to do menial jobs, supermarket chains, fast-food outlets and pizza delivery shops have had to dig deeper into the population and are often turning to minors.
The children do not complain, nor do their parents; they like the extra money. Labor officials acknowledge that working in fast-food outlets or selling legitimate products door to door can help keep children away from drugs and other dangers as well as teach them the virtues of work. But sometimes teachers complain. They say the children are not doing their homework or are napping at their desks, condemning themselves to careers in the ghettos of the work force.
''It's not a bad deal for the kids if the businesses are run according to the law,'' said Kenneth Goldberg, chief of employment standards in the Maryland Division of Labor and Industry. ''But many are not run according to the law. They're fiddling with the law.''
Nor is the situation likely to improve quickly. State and Federal enforcement agencies say that because of budget constraints, they usually can only respond to complaints of violations, not go out and look for them. When they do go out, however, they find that the statistics just scratch the surface. ''We're really seeing an increase in child labor violations,'' said Nancy M. Flynn, the Labor Department's acting wage and hour administrator.
 
Door-to-Door Sales
Because of the ages of the children involved and the hours they keep, a segment of the door-to-door sales industry is an especially flagrant violator, the most insidious and the hardest to stop, according to advocates for children and labor officials. While some employers, including some candy distributors, respect the law, state and Federal officials say others do not.
In Washington, at 8:30 on one recent weekday evening, the violations were apparent. A boy who said he was 10 years old and another, a head taller, who said he was 11, were hovering at the top of an escalator at the Friendship Heights Metro station on the border of Chevy Chase, Md., and the District of Columbia. At the feet of each was a cardboard carton of boxes of peanut brittle and other candy.
As homeward-bound, prosperous-looking commuters reached the top of the escalator, the boys scooted after them, offering the candy for $5 a box.
They said that the ''van man'' who brought them to the station lets them keep $1 to $1.50 for each box they sell, but that they have to behave because he also fines them for cursing and roughhousing in the van or not being at their posts when he comes to pick them up. ''He tells you the rules,'' the older boy said. ''If you don't obey the rules, you pay $2.''
 
'He Lets Us Work to 11'
With some exceptions, like delivering newspapers, acting, selling cookies for charity and working in a family business, work for pay is prohibited for children under 14. When children are 14 and 15, Federal law permits employers to hire them for three hours on school days and no later than 7 P.M. On non-school days they can work eight hours and no later than 9 P.M.
Most states have their own child labor laws. A few, notably Oregon and Alaska, have more stringent regulations than the Federal Government.
The 11-year-old said the van man had picked them up at home that day, just after school at 4 P.M., and would be back to get them around 9 P.M. ''On weekends,'' the 10-year-old said, ''he lets us work to 11.''
Each boy carried a blue card to read to customers. It said: ''My name is -and I'm a member of the E & J Sales Club program. E & J Sales Club is a work and recreation program for community children after school.'' The club does not appear in any of the standard Washington or Maryland directories, and Federal and Maryland labor officials said they had never heard of it.
 
Names Change With Seasons
The officials said E & J may be one of scores of local distribution companies that change their names with the seasons and are often impossible to trace. The distributors are recruited by wholesalers and manufacturers. Some of these are legitimate operators, but others are not, the officials say.
''Internally, we have talked quite a lot about that,'' William C. Brooks, Assistant Labor Secretary for employment standards, said Friday. He said he had spotted children selling candy one evening recently after leaving work and dispatched an aide to go talk to some the next day. But the children rarely show up at the same place two days in a row, so the aide is still looking, he said.
''Where we see it, we'll get the appropriate people in there and see what we can do about it,'' Mr. Brooks said. He said the Labor Department's Baltimore office was investigating two distributors it suspects of operating around Washington.
William J. Gainer, director of education and employment issues at the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, told a forum on child labor here last month that with the rise in the reported infractions of the child labor laws, injuries to working children were also increasing.
 
Violations on the Rise
The laws restrict children from using hazardous machinery, like slicing machines and trash compactors. Yet children have often been found operating such devices. Mr. Gainer said the 33 states that participated in a poll he conducted reported that 48 children were killed on the job in 1987 and 1988 and that 128,000 were hurt.
Violations of child labor laws, in general, are on the rise, many states report. ''Approximately 50 percent of the businesses who employ minors in Michigan are in violation of some provision of the Michigan Youth Employment Standards Act,'' said Marsha Bowers, a youth employment specialist in the Michigan Department of Labor.
Frederick Seaman, assistant director of the Missouri Labor Department's division of labor standards, said: ''We're getting tons of this in the fast-foods industry, little mom-and-pop places in small towns. There's a lot more kids working now. In Missouri, a kid needs a certificate from his superintendent of schools to work, and these are increasing 25 and 30 percent a year. With more kids working, there are more violations.''
Mr. Goldberg of Maryland said 156 businesses in the state have been found in violation of Maryland's child labor laws, an increase from 133 last year.
 
Complaints From an Educator
In October, Mr. Goldberg's agency charged four candy company distributors with numerous violations of the child labor laws through their employment of 11 boys and girls 9 to 14 years old. It might not have done so, Mr. Goldberg acknowledged, were it not for the persistent complaints of Michael Zadjel, the principal of Mars Estates Elementary School in Baltimore.
Mr. Zadjel said he got involved a year ago, when a van with Florida license plates was in an accident in Baltimore's busy Harbor Tunnel and all five children aboard were injured and required hospital treatment. The next day, Mr. Zadjel said, ''a girl came in'' and said her brother had been in the van. ''She said he was selling candy and that he did it all the time,'' Mr. Zadjel said.
Mr. Zadjel spoke with other children who were having trouble with their schoolwork: '' 'Why didn't you do your homework?' I'd ask. 'We were selling candy,' they'd say. 'We didn't get home until 10 o'clock.' ''
In the past, many state labor officials have traced some of these operations, though not the one in Baltimore, to Gerald L. Winters, a wholesaler and manufacturer in northern New Jersey. Mr. Winters has operated nationwide door-to-door candy sales networks for a couple of decades, most recently with a company called Miller Candy Sales.
 
Settlement of $150,000
Last year, said William Burger, a Federal Labor Department lawyer in Atlanta, the Government settled a child labor law case against Mr. Winters in North Carolina, after he lost two court appeals and he agreed to pay $150,000 in civil penalties.
Efforts to reach Mr. Winters were unsuccessful. Phone service at companies with which he is said to be affiliated had been disconnected or their phone numbers could not be obtained through information. A spokesman, Michael W. Kempner, said: ''There's a new Gerry Winters out there. Winters made a lot of mistakes in the past because he was too zealous to help kids.''
Mr. Kempner is involved in a campaign by more than 50 candy distributors to relax what he called ''antiquated child labor laws'' to permit more door-to-door selling.
Others are pressing for tighter laws. Linda Golodner, executive director of the National Consumers League and chairwoman of the Child Labor Advisory Committee, set up by the Labor Department, said the committee had recommended a ban on most door-to-door sales by children under 16. The department has not disclosed its view.
''Most of the jobs these kids get aren't going to get them anywhere,'' Mr. Gainer of the G.A.O. said, ''and about 20 percent of young adults are functionally illiterate. If we're going to be competitive as a country, then I think we're going to have to concentrate on getting kids educated.''

HEADLINE: THE CHALLENGE OF KEEPING U.S. TECHNOLOGY AT HOME

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Despite mounting concern about the nation's dependence on Japan and other foreign nations for important technology, keeping crucial components or machinery in American hands is proving exceedingly difficult.
The latest example of the trend is that the Perkin-Elmer Corporation, unable to find an American buyer for a division that makes equipment for manufacturing computer chips, has opened talks with a Japanese company.
American companies, whose worry is mainly directed at Japan, fear that if they become dependent on foreign companies they will not be granted access to the most advanced machinery or components as quickly as their foreign competitors, putting them at a severe disadvantage.
 
Profits Before Patriotism
But such fears are somewhat hypothetical, and American companies have been unwilling to hurt their own profits and anger their shareholders merely out of a sense of patriotism. This observation is true particularly because many of the businesses up for sale are seriously troubled and costly to turn around. 
And even when American companies are willing to make such investments, they are often outbid by Japanese companies, which can borrow money at lower interest rates in their country and face less pressure to produce quick profits on their investments.
 
A Series of Sales
One result is a continued series of sales that distress the nation. ''We all become national treasures after deals are made,'' said Dr. Sheldon Weinig, president of the Materials Research Corporation, a semiconductor equipment and materials company acquired by the Sony Corporation in August after an acceptable deal with an American buyer was not found.
Perkin-Elmer is the latest case in point. The company, based in Norwalk, Conn., said in April that it planned to sell its division that makes equipment used to make semiconductors - the silicon chips used in computers, telephones, missiles and other electronic products.
Its inability to obtain an adequate American bid prompted it to discuss a sale to the Nikon Corporation of Japan, although those talks eventually broke down. A sale to Nikon would have left American chip producers even more dependent than they already are on Japanese suppliers for the sophisticated machinery used to etch circuits on chips.
Since 1983 alone, the American share of the market for wafer steppers, a main kind of equipment used to make semiconductors, has declined to about 20 percent from almost 65 percent, while the Japanese share has risen to 72 percent from 35 percent.
 
U.S. Companies Just Saying No
In another case earlier this year, American semiconductor industry leaders urged the Government to block the sale to a West German company of the Monsanto Company's silicon business, the last big American-owned producer of the silicon wafers from which chips are made.
Robert C. McCormack, a Defense Department official, told the industry leaders that the Pentagon would try to block the sale if the semiconductor companies themselves would pool half the money needed to buy the operation. ''Not one of them was willing to put up a single dollar,'' Mr. McCormack said. The sale to Huels A.G. went through. And despite fears that the nation is becoming too dependent on Japan for computer memory chips, most American computer companies have decided against paying $5 million to $50 million to invest in U.S. Memories, a proposed cooperative venture that would make such chips. Unless it can come up with more investors in the next few weeks, the venture will fail.
 
The Root of the Problem
To some industry officials and analysts, the recent events indicate a failure of American companies to back their words with actions. ''Everyone is trying to optimize their own tree and the farm is being purchased,'' said Papken Der Torossian, president of the Silicon Valley Group Inc., an electronics company in San Jose, Calif.
''The Japanese are more intelligent about these large-scale strategic decisions than the Americans are,'' said Charles H. Ferguson, a semiconductor industry expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But industry executives say the real problem is not that American buyers cannot be found for ailing companies but that companies are withering to the point where they have to be sold. What are needed, they say, are Government policies like cutting the Federal deficit and lowering interest rates, to make it easier for American companies to raise money for investments. Some suggested tax incentives to encourage American companies to buy from other American companies.
 
Hardly a Jewel
The Perkin-Elmer semiconductor equipment operation is hardly a jewel. The company missed a major change in technology about 10 years ago, and it has fallen behind Nikon and other competitors in the market for lithography equipment, which is used to shrink circuit patterns photographically onto silicon wafers.
Stephen J. Balog, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., estimated that Perkin-Elmer's semiconductor equipment division, with revenues of about $190 million, has had $200 million in operating losses and charges against earnings over the last three fiscal years. Perkin-Elmer executives declined to be interviewed, citing the talks over the sale of the business.
Still, Perkin-Elmer, with considerable technical and financial help from the International Business Machines Corporation, has developed a new machine, called a step-and-scan, that has the potential to leapfrog Nikon's technology. But even that machine came out about two years behind schedule and still needs work.
After spending more than $100 million of its own and I.B.M.'s money on the project, Perkin-Elmer still faces spending of $50 million to $100 million to perfect the product and advance it to the next generation of technology. And besides I.B.M., American semiconductor companies have been reluctant to order the machine.
Given its uncertain prospects, industry officials say, it is not surprising that the company decided in April to get out of the semiconductor equipment business, to concentrate on its core business of scientific instruments and to improve its profits.
These prospects will also make it difficult for other semiconductor equipment companies, most of which are very small, to buy the division. Some companies that produce semiconductors, including I.B.M. can afford a purchase but they do not want to become tool producers.
 
Fear of Political Backlash
Still an American buyer might be found. This possibility is especially likely because Nikon said two weeks ago that it is no longer negotiating, apparently because of a rising political backlash in the United States.
The leading American prospect is considered to be KLA Instruments, a semiconductor equipment company from Santa Clara, Calif. A consortium of companies might also be formed to make the purchase, industry executives said. In either case, If KLA or a consortium made the purchase, I.B.M. would be expected to somehow reduces the risk, either through financial backing or guaranteed purchases, industry executives said.
The Ateq Corporation, a privately held semiconductor equipment company in Beaverton, Ore., has bid for a separate part of Perkin-Elmer's operation, the electron beam division in Hayward, Calif., industry people said.
So far, Perkin-Elmer has not found any of the American offers adequate, no doubt because it expects to command a higher price from a Japanese company, industry people said. The company has an obligation to its shareholders to seek the highest price. Some analysts and industry people said the company hopes to receive as much as $200 million, while American companies might pay no more than half that amount.
 
Why General Signal Bowed Out
''We couldn't see how to bridge the difference between what we thought it was worth and what they thought it was worth,'' said Jack Halter, senior vice president of the General Signal Corporation, the other big American photolithography company. General Signal looked at Perkin-Elmer's business but did not make a formal bid and is no longer in discussions, he said.
It is in the interest of the American bidders to force Nikon to back away by raising a political outcry or to persuade the Government to veto the sale to a foreign company, as can be done under the 1988 trade act. Then Perkin-Elmer would have to accept the best American bid. That is what happened when Fujitsu Ltd. backed away from its plan to buy the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, allowing the National Semiconductor Corporation to buy Fairchild for about half the price Fujitsu was willing to pay.
 
Japan's Advantage on Rates
Japanese companies are willing to pay more partly because they have more. In addition, they have access to capital at lower cost than American companies. Japanese companies can borrow at interest rates of 5 percent while the United States prime rate is above 10 percent.
Moreover, Japanese companies often have profit levels that would be considered unacceptably low by Wall Street. They are willing to spend more time and money developing a promising technology without an immediate payoff.
Dr. Weinig, who is with Materials Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., said his company, like many small semiconductor equipment companies, was having trouble raising the capital needed to keep pace with rapidly changing technology.
The main option appeared to be a buyout by a Wall Street investor group that would have paid $8 a share - less than the stock's book value - and would have changed management and laid off numerous workers, Dr. Weinig said. So he went to Sony and within a few days arranged a purchase for $14 a share.
Sony retained the existing management. And instead of layoffs, ''they gave everyone a Sony Walkman, a copy of Morita's book 'Made in Japan' and an extra week's pay,'' said Dr. Weinig, referring to Sony's chairman, Akio Morita. ''They said to me, 'You have essentially unlimited capital.' I'm no longer concerned with quarterly profits. I can think of projects that take two years. It's a wonderful way to live.''

HEADLINE: Turks Fear Changes Undercut Ties to Europe

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Eastern Europe's shifting political map has left Turkey wondering from the sidelines whether it will end up a diplomatic loser when the dust settles.
In Ankara, senior officials applaud the recent developments and say they want to encourage further democratic change with offers of aid and credit to Poland and Hungary. But some Turkish political leaders and newspaper commentators express concern that the upheaval in Eastern Europe could come at their country's expense, especially if the change undercuts a two-year-old application for full membership in the European Community.
Eventual community membership is a cornerstone of Turkey's foreign policy, and a trump card has been the country's strategic importance as the largest armed force in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the United States. 
But questions have been raised about what might happen if NATO and the Warsaw Pact began seriously to rethink their military alignments. As the skeptics see it, any change that might appear to dilute Turkey's importance as a southern bulwark of the Atlantic alliance could also undermine its campaign for community membership.
''Those countries who have some commitments vis-a-vis Turkey may reconsider those commitments,'' Suleyman Demirel, head of the conservative True Path Party, was quoted as saying this week in the Turkish press.
Bulent Ecevit, head of the Democratic Left Party and like Mr. Demirel a former Prime Minister, cautioned recently that ''Turkey's strategic importance has been declining in view of developments taking place between the East and the West.'' Government claims to the contrary, Mr. Ecevit said, are ''self-deceiving.''
Government officials do indeed take a different view, insisting that there is no link between Eastern's Europe's turmoil and Turkey's application to the 12-member community.
NATO is not about to go out of business tomorrow, they say. The Government asserts that Turkey's 800,000-member armed forces are internationally important not only because they defend a third of NATO's borders with the Warsaw Pact but because they patrol frontiers with Iran, Iraq and Syria. The Middle East will remain a sensitive region even after Europe sorts itself out, they say.
''Our geographical importance will not change,'' a Foreign Ministry official said.
Nevertheless, some Turkish officials worry that Western Europe may find the notion of ultimate integration with the East too powerful to resist, and may decide to leapfrog it ahead of Turkey on its agenda. In telephone interviews from Ankara, several officials described the situation in Europe as volatile. ''We want the process to be gradual,'' said Murat Sungar, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
 
Poverty and Other Handicaps
Even without the added complication of Eastern Europe, Turkey's application to the European Community faces severe scrutiny. The country is relatively poor, its economy has faltered under an inflation rate of 75 percent, its human-rights record is widely criticized and its population of 55 million Muslims leaves many Europeans in doubt about the prospects for bridging cultural differences.
Turkish officials should get a better sense of their standing when they receive a major report, expected later this month, from the community's executive commission. For now, their main hope seems to be that the European Community will agree at least to begin negotiations before its scheduled economic integration at the end of 1992.
Among the events favoring Turkey are recent changes in Bulgaria, its neighbor and rival, where the longtime Communist leader, Todor I. Zhivkov, was ousted last month. Under Mr. Zhivkov, Bulgaria conducted a harsh campaign of forcibly assimilating ethnic Turks, which prompted an exodus of 310,000 people to Turkey last summer.
It is too early to tell if Bulgarian policy will change, Turks say. But a Foreign Minister official said, ''It is natural for a new government to reassess the previous government's mistakes.''

HEADLINE: China Trip Seeks to Alter Americans' Perceptions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Behind the decision to send President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, on a mission to Beijing was a desire by the Administration to get Congress and the public used to the idea of restoring normal diplomatic contacts with China.
An official said today that the Administration would like to treat the events in Beijing in June, in which hundreds were killed when the Government crushed the student-led democracy movement, as an unfortunate affair -which, while regrettable, should not be allowed to overshadow the strategic importance of Chinese-American relations.
Mr. Scowcroft's visit was formally a mission to brief the Chinese on the Malta summit meeting.
In announcing his trip, along with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the White House emphasized that the trip was a realistic effort to improve a troubled situation. 
''The President views China as an important country in world affairs,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said. ''While he deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen Square last June, China, nevertheless, remains part of the world around us.''
''The President has concluded that it is appropriate and in the long-term interest of the United States to inform the Chinese leadership of his discussions with the Soviet leader,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
 
Don't 'Focus on the Past'
''This trip was meant to break some of the ice between us,'' thr Administration official said of the China trip. ''By sending a top White House official, it sends a political signal that we are now ready to resume relations on a more normal basis. We hope that we have reached the point where time heals all wounds, and that once the public gets used to more normalized contacts it won't be focused on the past.''
Administration aides said that the trip was kept secret at Beijing's request, apparently because the Chinese wanted to make certain that it appeared the Americans were coming to them on Chinese terms and not the other way around. The visit was announced by the White House at 2 A.M. today, after Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Eagleburger landed in the Chinese capital.
Administration officials denied that the White House was trying to avoid criticism at home by making the early-morning announcement. They also said that despite speculation that Mr. Bush might travel to Australia and other Pacific countries next year, this diplomatic visit was not a prelude to a visit to China by Mr. Bush.
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, called the trip ''a mistake'' and ''inappropriate'' in light of what he called China's continuing violations of human rights.
 
Bad Timing, Too
''This is a signal to the Chinese that the Administration is desperate to get back to business as usual without any improvement in human rights in the People's Republic of China,'' Mr. Solarz said. ''It is another example of the Administration kowtowing to the Chinese.
''The paradox is that this is happening precisely when the Soviet threat is diminishing and the strategic imperative of a close relationship with the Chinese is thus declining. ''This makes neither good moral nor strategic sense.''
The trip by Mr. Scowcroft to Beijing was only the latest example of President Bush's desire not to allow the June killings to create any kind of lasting strain in relations.
From the beginning of Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, the President and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d have used restrained language to condemn the Chinese and have imposed the minimum sanctions they felt were politically acceptable at home. These included limited economic curbs, a ban on arms sales and on high-level military and diplomatic exchanges, and a decision to allow Chinese students in this country to extend their visas.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
U.S. Ties With West Germany Begin To Eclipse Relationship With Britain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
While no one in the Administration will say so, it has become clear in recent months that the longtime ''special relationship'' between the United States and Britain is being overshadowed by an increasingly demanding relationship between Washington and Bonn.
It is not that Washington is downgrading ties with London, Administration officials say. It is simply bowing to the fact that at this moment in history Germany is Washington's main concern in Europe. From Washington's perspective, no issue has more potential to destabilize Europe today than unification of the two Germanys, and no single country has more economic resources to help stabilize Eastern Europe today than West Germany.
The development has begun to cause a bit of consternation in London, fanned by the Fleet Street press - concern that forced President Bush to make an early-morning phone call last week to reassure Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the special relationship was still special. In addition, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d hastily added London to his trip to Europe next week, where his top priority is delivering a major policy address in West Berlin. 
The subtle shift in American attention from Britain toward West Germany is a result of a variety of factors, not all of which are strategic. Washington's affinity with London has always been based largely on history and culture as much as on shared interest.
The relationship with Bonn has been no less significant, but has always been rooted in the strategic realm, given the presence of more than 300,000 American troops on West German soil and West Germany's importance on the front lines of the East-West divide.
Mrs. Thatcher and former President Reagan ''tended to view themselves as fellow crusaders against Communism abroad and socialism at home,'' said Peter Riddell, the United States editor for the London-based Financial Times. Because they grew personally close -and were perceived to be close - Mrs. Thatcher had unusual access to President Reagan, and therefore unusual influence.
 
No Longer First Among Equals
While Mr. Bush has a cordial relationship with Mrs. Thatcher, he does not share her conservative ideological fervor or view her as first among equals as a source of advice.
Shortly after the Malta summit meeting was announced, the American Ambassador to Britain, Henry E. Catto Jr., suggested to some senior Administration officials that on his way home Mr. Bush stop in London to brief Mrs. Thatcher. No, one of the officials told Mr. Catto, if the President stopped off anywhere, it would be in Bonn, to chat with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the end, Mr. Bush stopped in Brussels and briefed all the NATO leaders together, but the night before he dined alone with one of them - Mr. Kohl.
In many ways the juggling of itineraries for Mr. Baker's trip, which begins Sunday night and will also include extensive consultations with all the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in Brussels, illustrates the new challenges that he is facing as Secretary of State. As the threat from Moscow abates, Washington has had to devote more and more energy to making sure that the East-West cold war is not replaced by something of a West-West cold war.
But as events in Europe race ahead, Mr. Baker's preference for low-key, step-by-step diplomacy and coalition building are coming under pressure from allies seeking clear-cut, detailed American positions on issues from German unification to European integration - issues on which old friends like Bonn and London are divided.
''Baker is trying very hard to avoid juggling the two,'' an Administration official said of West Germany and Britain. ''The key is not to have to juggle. If you're juggling, you're in trouble.''
 
Washington Counting on Bonn
Mr. Baker and his aides, after two years running the Treasury Department, were already predisposed to viewing Bonn and West Germany's central bank as the real powerhouse in Europe.
But there are more structural factors at work as well. To begin with, as liberalization takes hold in Eastern Europe, West Germany, by dint of geography and resources, has become Washington's primary partner for managing change on the Eastern front. Washington is counting on Bonn, and in a way Bonn alone, to keep East Germany propped up economically and politically so any unification can come about in a smooth, gradual manner and as a result of free elections in the East. Washington has also ceded to Bonn the leading role in both coordinating and financing the Western alliance's aid program for Poland and Hungary.
Equally pressing is the fact that because the conditions under which any German unification might take place will have an enormous effect on how the United States remains in Europe -the brunt of American troops are based on West German soil - and on how well NATO holds together, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker have been obsessed with maintaining close consultations with Bonn to prevent any sudden lurch toward unification. Mr. Bush has been speaking with Mr. Kohl, or Mr. Baker with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, about once a week.
 
'A Reliable Ally'
''In a way, Britain is suffering now precisely because it is such a reliable ally,'' an Administration official said. ''Nobody is worried about Britain going neutral. There isn't any need for a lot of the constant consultations that we have with Bonn.''
It is not only that the United States needs Bonn now, but also that Bonn needs Washington more than ever. Of all West Germany's allies, the United States, because it is far away, is likely to be the one that is least opposed to German unification and best disposed to sell it around NATO.
To insure that any unified Germany is solidly anchored in the Western alliance, Mr. Bush has begun to promote tighter political integration of the European Economic Community. But this too has created a bit of tension with Mrs. Thatcher, who is less than enthusiastic about some aspects of the proposed European economic and political union as outlined by Jacques Delors, the head of the European Community's Executive Commission.
That plan calls for going beyond the creation of a single European free market in 1992 to establishing a single central bank and monetary union, a strong European Parliament and a ''social charter'' for the community that would standardize labor union rights, wages and welfare after 1992.
Administration officials say that when it comes to the European Community's economic policies, the United States is not going to ''pick sides,'' and would be the last country to tell Mrs. Thatcher that she must accept a social charter. But when it comes to closer political and security ties within the community, there is no question that Washington would like to see Mrs. Thatcher be more forthcoming.
''I think she should understand that she has a strategic interest in seeing the E.E.C., which is clearly going to be the core of the future Europe, promoting greater European political and security integration,'' a senior Administration official said. ''Instead of resisting that process, she should join it and shape it and not fear it. Back in the 60's when the British were arguing about whether to join the E.E.C., the proponents said the Americans won't take us seriously if we are just a small island off the Continent.''
That arguement was valid then, the official added, and it is still valid today.

Excerpts From Statement By European Community

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STRASBOURG, France, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the statement today by the leaders of the European Community:
 
 Each day in Central and Eastern Europe, change is assering itself more strongly. Everywhere a powerful aspiration toward freedom, democracy, respect of human rights, prosperity, social justice and peace is being expressed. The people are clearly showing their will to take their own destiny in hand and to choose the path of their development. Such a profound and rapid development would not have been possible without the policy of openness and reform led by Mr. Gorbachev. 
Expressing the feelings of the people of the whole community, we are deeply gladdened by the changes taking place. These are historic events and no doubt the most important since the Second World War. The success of a strong and dynamic European Community, the vitality of the C.S.C.E. process and stability in the area of security, in which the United States and Canada participate, have contributed greatly to them.
These changes give reason to hope that the division in Europe can be overcome in accord with the aims of the Helsinki Final Act, which seeks, through a global and balanced approach and on the basis of a set of principles that retain their full value, to set up new relations between European countries whether in security, economic and technical cooperation, or the human dimension.
 
 
 
Strengthening Peace
 We seek the strengthening of the state of peace in Europe in which the German people will regain its unity through free self-determination. This process should take place peacefully and democratically, in full respect of the relevant agreements and treaties and of all the principles defined by the Helsinki Final Act, in a context of dialogue and East-West cooperation. It also has to be placed in the perspective of European integration. . . .
The European Council is convinced in the present circumstances that all must, more than ever, demonstrate their sense of responsibility. The changes and transitions that are necessary must not take place to the detriment of the stability of Europe but must contribute to strengthening it.
Far from wanting to derive unilateral advantages from the present situation, the community and its members need to give their support to the countries embarked on the road to democratic change. They deplore all the more so that in some countries this process is hindered.
The community and its member states are fully conscious of the common responsibility which devolves on them in this decisive phase in the history of Europe. They are prepared to develop with the U.S.S.R. and the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and with Yugoslavia, insofar as they are committed to this path, closer and more substantive relations based upon an intensification of political dialogue and increased cooperation in all areas.
 
 
 
Supporting Reforms
 The community has in particular decided to support the economic reforms undertaken in these countries by contributing - in collaboration with its Western partners - to the establishment of healthy and prosperous economies within the framework of appropriate structures.
The European Council has drawn up conclusions which illustrate this intention. For the future and in accordance with the developments taking place, the community is willing to implement still closer forms of cooperation with these countries.
At this time of profound and rapid change, the community is and must remain a point of reference and influence. It remains the cornerstone of a new European architecture and, in its will to openness, a mooring for a future European equilibrium. This equilibrium will be still better insured by a parallel development of the role of the Council of Europe, E.F.T.A. and the C.S.C.E. process.
Construction of the Community must therefore go forward: the building of European Union will permit the further development of a range of effective and harmonious relations with the other countries of Europe.

HEADLINE: New Turmoil Over Police in Houston

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
In the last six weeks, two Houston police officers have shot and killed motorists after traffic stops. Two other officers were found guilty in rape cases. One more was arrested for heroin possession, one was charged with coercing sex from a prostitute, one was reassigned amid charges of police harassment and two officers' houses were searched as part of a drug investigation.
The incidents have caused heated debate here. Some citizens charge that they show pockets of police corruption and racism, but officers describe them as symptoms of budget cutbacks and low morale.
In recent years the police force here has been widely described as a model of efficiency. It is headed by Lee P. Brown, who is being considered for the job of New York City Police Commissioner in the administration of Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins, people close to the search committee said. 
''Currently Houston is seen as the leader, or one of the leaders, of progressive police departments in the country,'' said Mary Ann Wycoff, project director for the Police Foundation, a research organization in Washington. ''It's one of the most farsighted departments I know of.''
 
Incidents Eroding Confidence
But there is concern among officials in Houston that the recent events will tarnish that hard-won reputation. Anthony Hall, a Houston City Councilman, said: ''There has been significant improvement in the Police Department in recent years, but this shows there are still problems. I don't think it represents a crisis in the department as much as it has served to erode the confidence that has been carefully built up over the years.''
Less than a decade ago, the Houston Police Department was widely thought of as a wild, lawless group. Texas Monthly magazine ran a cover drawing depicting the department as a motorcycle gang. Among other things, a group of officers in 1977 beat a suspect and threw the handcuffed man into a bayou, where he drowned.
When Kathryn J. Whitmire was elected Mayor in 1981, she brought in Chief Brown, who is credited with soothing racial tensions and eliminating many undesirables.
Mr. Brown, who is black, increased black officers to 14.1 percent of the force from 8.5 percent and toughened the requirements, making two years of college mandatory. He created a neighborhood system, opening 19 storefront police posts around the city.
 
No Raise in Six Years
But the changes came at the same time that the oil bust put harsh economic constraints on the city. The Houston Police Department has not had a raise in six years, and salaries, which were among the five highest in the country, now rank 25th among the 31 largest police departments. Rookies start at $20,755 and earn $23,696 after a year.
Hiring was discontinued in 1986 and was not resumed until this year. A recent department study said the force needed nearly 1,000 more officers.
Salary and staffing were major issues in the fall mayoral campaign, with the police officers' union campaigning against Mrs. Whitmire, who was easily re-elected. ''It was demoralizing,'' Mark R. Clark, the president of the Houston Police Officers Association, said of the election results.
He uses the same word to describe the new incidents involving police officers.
On Oct. 31, Ida Lee Delaney, a 50-year-old black woman was fatally shot by Officer Alex Gonzales, who was off duty and was later found to be intoxicated. The police said Mr. Gonzales was wearing civilian clothes and driving a private car when he and two fellow officers tried to force Mrs. Delaney to the side of the road after she allegedly cut them off in traffic at 3 A.M. Mrs. Delaney fired shots at the pursuing car, pulled over eventually, then fired again, wounding Mr. Gonzales before he killed her.
On Nov. 15, Officer Scott Tschirhart, 27, killed Byron Gillum, a 24-year-old security guard he had stopped for speeding. Mr. Tschirhart told investigators that Mr. Gillum had reached for a gun on the front seat of car. Mr. Gillum was shot four times in back, once in the abdomen and once in the arm, the police said. It was the third time in six years that Mr. Tschirhart fatally shot someone. He was also disciplined for beating a handcuffed prisoner.
On Nov. 29, one of the leading critics of the department, the Rev. J. Don Boney, a Baptist minister, was arrested at midnight on a nine-year-old warrant for failing to pay child support. The arresting officer, Sgt. Don Harford, also arrested Mr. Boney last year on a heroin charge, but he was found not guilty. Arrests for nonpayment of child support are almost never made by the Police Department but are handled by the Harris County Sheriff's Department. Mr. Harford was reassigned by Chief Brown, who ordered an internal investigation.
On Dec. 5, Harold I. Burkett, a former officer, pleaded guilty to charges of rape, robbery and kidnapping. He was accused of locking a man in the trunk of a car in February, then abducting and raping the man's 19-year-old date. Mr. Burkett's lawyer has said his client was suffering a breakdown at the time. He has since left the force.
The two cases involving killings are still under internal investigation by the department.
A much-asked question in Houston lately is: ''Who is to blame?''
The public seems to blame the police. At a recent City Council meeting, 60 people spoke in the public comment period - three times the usual number - and described the officers as ''pill popping racists,'' ''terrorists,'' and ''assassins.''
The police, in turn, blame Mrs. Whitmire, noting that she had reduced the force and put a cap on salaries. ''It's hard to get perfection for $25,000 a year,'' Assistant Police Chief Thomas G. Koby said.
 
Mayor Blames Volume of Rules
Because of staff reductions, officers who should be in desk jobs are on the streets, some officers say. Mr. Tschirhart, for example, had been given desk work in 1985 after his second fatal shooting, but this year his desk job was eliminated.
The Mayor blames the system. There are too many state and union regulations on the discipline and dismissal process, she said in a telephone interview. ''I think the Chief needs more ability to fire people,'' she said. ''Right now he has to run a whole gamut of rules and regulations. His hands have been tied.''
Some, but not many, place the blame on Chief Brown. Mr. Clark, the union leader, said the Chief was not standing up for the majority of officers ''who are being given a black eye for the actions of a few,'' adding, ''The agenda he's most interested in is the Chief Brown promotion agenda.''
Some changes are being made, including the creation of an officers-at-risk program that would provide psychological help for officers accused of using excessive force. The Mayor backed formation of a citizens' review board, but the City Council blocked that idea.
Complicating the situation is the question of whether Chief Brown may leave Houston for New York. He did not return repeated telephone calls a reporter made to his office.
Mrs. Whitmire said she had spoken with Mr. Brown about the New York job and ''he told me he was interested in staying in Houston.''
''I believe that Lee Brown is the best police chief in the country,'' she said. ''I hope the Mayor of New York finds a good police chief - as long as he's not mine.''

Don Boney, right, an outspoken critic of the Houston police, on a nine-year-old warrant is among the recent incidents that have raised questions about officers' conduct. Mark R. Clark, president of the Houston Police Officers Association, called such incidents ''demoralizing.'' (NYT/F. Carter Smith)

HEADLINE: California Resumes Air War Against Invading Fruit Fly, Stirring Debate

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRA SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 9

 BODY:
For the second time in this decade, California has undertaken vast aerial spraying of a pesticide over residential areas here in an effort to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly, fueling a renewed debate that pits protection of agriculture against environmental concerns.
Since a single fly was trapped near Dodger Stadium in August, helicopters have sprayed the pesticide malathion over 250 square miles of neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and Orange County.
The Mediterranean fruit fly is the most stubborn of several fruit flies that have threatened California crops in recent decades. An infestation of Oriental fruit flies was quickly supressed in 1974, as was a Mexican fruit fly invasion in 1984. 
As the work on the current infestation goes on, two questions arise: Is the pesticide dangerous to humans, and can the produce industry in California survive both the fly and the spraying?
 
State Produce Could Be Barred
State officials say they hope to eradicate the pest before it spreads to the San Joaquin Valley and threatens the $16.6 billion agricultural industry. The fly lays its eggs in 250 kinds of fruits and vegetables, rendering them unfit for sale. California's produce could be barred by other states and nations.
The spraying, which will cost about $12 million, has been challenged by residents and politicians.
''We still don't know if malathion is completely safe,'' said Richard Alatorre, a City Councilman whose district has been sprayed. ''We were told that DDT was safe, that Agent Orange and asbestos were safe, but the facts about malathion's long-term effects won't be known for another generation.''
A toxicologist, Brian P. Dolan, argued that even though malathion was a ''reasonably safe'' pesticide, it was still a toxic chemical that had not been fully studied and therefore should not be sprayed over dense urban populations until proven safe.
''Its toxicity still has not been well worked out, and now the E.P.A. is saying some of their research was flawed,'' said Dr. Dolan, a private internist in occupational medicine who is an expert on chemicals and how they affect humans. He has worked with California farm workers for the past ten years.
''My concerns are that with repeated sprayings, you increase exposure, which raises the risk of birth defects and cancer,'' he said. ''Nobody wants the Medfly to wipe out our economy, but there are still so many questions about the chemical being used.''
 
Officials Cite Small Doses
State agriculture officials insist that malathion does not hurt humans, especially not in the small doses used in aerial spraying. But people are advised to cover their cars with tarpaulins to protect the paint.
''This stuff has been around for 40 years and study after study has shown it doesn't harm people,'' said Gera Curry, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. ''Homeowners use it in their backyards. In Europe doctors apply it on the heads of children for head lice.''
In some areas, sterile Mediterranean fruit flies, bred in laboratories, are being released to breed with the invader; the mating will not take. But elsewhere a shortage of the sterile flies has caught officials off guard.
 
Spraying Goes On for Now
Until a new laboratory to breed sterile fruit flies is completed in Hawaii, California will rely on aerial spraying, Ms. Curry said. The pest is rife in Hawaii, but farmers escape extensive damage because the major commercial crops, pineapples and sugar cane, are immune to the fruit fly, Malathion was first used in California in 1981, after a year of debate in which the Governor, Edmund G. Brown Jr., delayed the spraying. That allowed a small infestation in Northern California to spread statewide. Farmers lost $100 million.
And the Governor's decision was believed to have been a factor in his losing a United States Senate race to Pete Wilson in 1982.
Since the 1981 sprayings, the Department of Health Services has conducted studies on the effects of malathion on humans, said Veda Federighi of the Department of Food and Agriculture. ''They concluded that malathion posed no adverse health effects to the public,'' she said, ''and we were dealing with a much larger area then.'' In 1981, about 1,400 square miles were sprayed.
 
Environmentalist Is Suspicious
Randall Toler, who heads the United States Green Party, an environmental group, said some studies indicated that the pesticide was harmful to humans.
''Studies in central Japan showed that malathion affected the liver enzymes and destroyed nervous responses in children and agricultural workers,'' said Mr. Toler. State officials argue that even if it was toxic, only one-third of an ounce of the pesticide is sprayed over an area of 60 by 100 feet.
Ms. Curry said, ''The dosage is the important thing and the amount we use is so small it's almost infinitesimal,'' adding, ''If you have a sick shrub in your backyard, you're going to use a lot more on that than we use on an entire city lot.''
Environmentalists say state officials did not give enough notice that neighborhoods would be sprayed.
''The officials know they can announce it and then spray a few days later and a community can't really get organized in that time to put out loud opposition,'' said David Bunn, a research director for Pesticide Watch. ''The state has learned that the faster they can reduce the notification time, the less likely people will protest.''
In an odd twist, Mayor Tom Bradley, agricultural officials and the press recently received a letter from a group called ''Breeders'' taking responsibility for the spread of the fruit fly and condemning the spraying.
The letter - officials say it may be a hoax - threatened to continue breeding and spreading Mediterranean fruit flies until the spraying becomes ''politically and financially intolerable.''

HEADLINE: Boston's Black Areas Mount New Secession Drive

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Roxbury section of Boston is a mix of red brick town houses, high-rise public housing projects and weed-covered lots. To the north stand the glittering skyscrapers of the downtown financial district; to the west, comparatively well-to-do suburbs like Brookline and Newton.
But Roxbury is a neighborhood besieged with problems like high unemployment, a high school-dropout rate, drug trafficking and almost nightly shootings. Forty-seven murders have been reported this year in the police district that includes Roxbury. That is more than twice the number of any other district in the city. 
Many residents say they fear that an influx of more affluent home buyers, already nibbling at the best housing stock, will force them out if they survive the neighborhood's other afflictions.
But under a plan being promoted with renewed vigor, Roxbury and three other predominantly black areas - Dorchester, Mattapan, and part of the South End - would be joined to form a separate city of 12 1/2 square miles with about 125,000 residents.
Supporters of the plan argue that it is not simply a matter of money, though they also say these neighborhoods have long been on the short end of every stick. More important, they say, is the power residents think they would have if the plan became reality.
 
Voters Rejected Plan Twice
''We used to think integration was the antidote,'' said Andrew P. Jones, a film producer and classical violinist who is a principal organizer of the plan. ''Now we think incorporation is the antidote. We would get what we need to exist as a viable community, not as a ghetto that's coming apart at the seams.''
The plan was placed on local ballots in 1986 and again last year. Both times it was defeated, though the margin of opposition narrowed from 3 to 1 to less than 2 to 1 last year.
Now organizers like Mr. Jones want the Legislature to approve a question for the voters next year that would authorize a commission to study the pros and cons of turning the neighborhoods into an independent city or town. Any charter produced by the commission would be voted on by residents whom it would affect. That would be almost a quarter of Boston's population of 600,000, including more than 90 percent of its black residents.
 
But Mayor Flynn Is Opposed
The concept has not met with universal approval. ''I don't think it's a good idea,'' said Bruce C. Bolling, a City Councilman whose district includes Roxbury. ''The overwhelming majority of the residents in the affected community do not want to create a separate municipality. However, there is concern about the overall direction of the community and what needs to be done to strengthen it.''
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn has opposed the idea every time it has come up, arguing that it would reverse important recent gains by blacks since the years of racial turmoil in the mid-1970's over court-ordered busing to end school desegregation. Many people here also say the plan would be a financial disaster for the new municipality itself; the area is largely residential, with a small tax base. Perhaps, the plan's supporters say. ''One of the problems has been the availability of information,'' said State Representative Byron Rushing, a Democrat whose district includes part of what would be the new city.
 
Money Records Called 'Key'
''This commission would have subpoena power and could obtain municipal records to see how much money is received and how much is actually spent on this area,'' said Mr. Rushing, who has filed a bill calling for the creation of the charter commission. ''That is key.''
Residents of Roxbury and other predominantly black neighborhoods have long suspected that more money is allocated for their neighborhoods than they actually see, Mr. Rushing said. But he said the desire to break off from the city should not be considered a criticism of the Mayor.
''It's criticism of a lot of mayors,'' he said. ''It's a criticism of the disenfranchisement and powerlessness of this community. You can't say the state of municipal services in Roxbury can be blamed on one administration. It's blamed on a series of administrations that did not have this community as its priority.''
Mary Hill, who lives and works in the Mandela Apartments, a subsidized housing complex in Roxbury, said she thought the plan would mean better times for her neighborhood. ''We'd have cleaner streets and get things that we don't get now,'' she said.
The latest strategy is expected to take at least four years to work its way through the system. Mr. Jones is confident. ''With persistence, people start to trust you,'' he said. ''Nothing tells the truth like time.''

HEADLINE: Hospital Economy: Change the Diapers Policy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 9

 BODY:
Dr. Stanley Hellerstein's garbage doubled last spring after his infant granddaughter was brought to visit him, along with her disposable diapers.
''That experience made me think about all the diapers we use at the hospital,'' said Dr. Hellerstein, chief of pediatric nephrology at Childrens Mercy Hospital. ''We've gotten into the habit of disposing with everything without thinking about our resources and the waste it produces.'' 
Dr. Hellerstein led a campaign at the hospital to reduce solid waste, and in September, cloth, rather than disposable diapers, came into use.
Several hospitals on the West Coast have also begun to use cloth diapers and the trend is expected to increase, said Jeanne Wirka, a policy analyst with the Environmental Action Foundation in Washington, D.C.
 
Hoping to Be a Community Model
''This is a trend where institutions that have relied on disposal products are trying to cut back,'' she said. ''Institutions like hospital and day care centers can do a lot to make a difference.''
''We decided to use the reusable diapers because we wanted to diminish the waste,'' Dr. Hellerstein said. ''We also had hoped that we could be a model in the community.'' A local diaper service arrives each day with the diapers, most of which are about 5 inches by 12 inches, for the 2- to 3-pound babies of the intensive care nursery.
The hospital also uses nylon diaper wraps that attach with Velcro so pins and plastic pants are not necessary.
''There are some people who like the idea and some people who think we're a little bizarre,'' said Dr. Fred K. Hall, director of the intensive care nursery.
Initially, some people worried about odor and inconvenience, but neither has been a problem, said Dr. Hall.
He said disposable diapers were still used on infants whose urine and fecal matter must be measured. Children with infections, including AIDS, would use a disposal diaper.
 
Literature for Parents
''It seemed to us that this was one of the most obvious ways we could decrease waste and there already were existing services and products,'' Dr. Hall said. The next step, he said, is to produce literature for parents to encourage them to use cloth diapers at home.
The doctors also hope the program will save the hospital money by decreasing its costs for incinerating garbage. Ms. Wirka said about 18 billion disposable diapers are used each year.
Environmental concerns persuaded the Bess Kaiser Medical Center and Kaiser Sunnyside Medical Center in Portland, Ore., to switch in November to cloth diapers for newborns and hospitalized babies and toddlers, said Amy Keiter, a spokeswoman for the hospitals.
She said it was the nurses' idea because the hospitals used about 200,000 disposable diapers a year. ''It's going great,'' she said. ''And the new moms love it.''

HEADLINE: Another Day, Another $4? Toll Plan Irks Drivers

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT LEE, N.J., Dec. 8

 BODY:
Stopped in lines in another morning rush hour at the George Washington Bridge, motorists used terms like ''crazy'' and ''rip-off'' to describe a proposed dollar increase, to $4, in tolls on interstate bridges and tunnels.
''I think it stinks,'' Bob Piro, of Fort Lee, said Thursday morning. ''I think $3 is enough. I live right by here and I see how many cars go through here. They've got to be making millions of dollars a day.'' 
Mr. Piro's comment reflected the anger and skepticism in New Jersey toward the announcement last week that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey wants to raise round-trip tolls on its four bridges and two tunnels in April. The fare on PATH, the commuter rail system linking Manhattan and New Jersey, would rise 25 cents, to $1.25, next December.
The $1 increase has angered motorists and New Jersey officials not only because of its size, but also because it comes so soon after the last one, in 1987, when the Port Authority said that that increase would be sufficient until 1991. Many critics also believe that the new increase would pay for operations other than bridges and tunnels. The increases must be approved by the Governors of New York and New Jersey. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has declined to comment until meeting with Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey. Mr. Kean, who earlier threatened to veto any increases, said today that he would urge his successor, Gov.-elect James J. Florio, and Mr. Cuomo not to act until an outside review is done, as one was in 1987.
In 1987, Port Authority officials said the increase that year was justified because it would help finance a $5.8 billion capital improvement program.
This year, the agency said a regionwide economic slowdown made another increase necessary. The executive director, Stephen Berger, said the slowdown resulted in insufficient revenue from the six crossings, PATH, the World Trade Center and the three major airports in the New York area, all of which the Port Authority oversees. The increases were proposed in the agency's $2.9 billion budget, which was presented this month.
 
Proposal Called Arrogant
Mr. Berger also said that the agency had higher operating and maintenance costs and had spent money for improvements faster than expected.
Pam Fisher, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Automobile Club, which represents 237,000 motorists in Essex, Morris and Union Counties, said the proposed increase was ''arrogant.''
''Basically, they're asking motorists to pay another dollar for projects they promised to do when they got the last hike,'' she said.
Mr. Berger said the increases would generate $93 million more in revenue to close a Port Authority deficit.
The Authority defines the system as the six crossings, PATH, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in mid-Manhattan, the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, the Port Authority bus programs and the new Hoboken-Battery Park City ferry service.
The president of the 900,000-member Automobile Club of New York, Donald T. Phillips, has asked Governor Cuomo to veto the increase. Mr. Phillips said in a letter to Mr. Cuomo that the proposal illustrates the Port Authority's ''autocratic'' view that the motorist is ''little more than a dollar sign on wheels - to be gouged for everything from airport to port facility improvement projects.''
Mr. Berger said that more profitable operations, like the airports, could no longer subsidize the transportation network as they had in the past.
Without a toll increase, he said, $300 million in capital spending scheduled for 1990 would be deleted, including major redevelopment projects at Newark International Airport.
New Jersey legislators have called for the Port Authority to find the money elsewhere in its budget. The Assembly's Independent Authorities Committee has scheduled a hearing on the toll increase for Dec. 20.
On an average fall weekday last year, 234,000 people crossed the Hudson from New Jersey into New York between 7 and 10 A.M., 72 percent by mass transit and 28 percent by automobile, the Port Authority said.

HEADLINE: LIFE STYLE;
Social Studies: The Christmas Lunch and the Office Party

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The office Christmas party isn't what it used to be, but it's getting livelier.
People are networking more and drinking less alcohol. But the sterile business setting is gone for the most part, and so is sedate office attire and decorous party chitchat. Instead, at least at big-corporation parties, there are tuxedos and velvet dresses, nonstop music, dancing and open bars, lavish buffets and backdrops that range from the ''21'' Club to the Wollman skating rink in Central Park. 
''Companies may be making some budget cutbacks, but when it comes to the office Christmas party they want only the best, whether it's for clients or staff,'' said Bill Bonbrest, director of marketing at the ''21'' Club. Corporate parties began there early last week and are booked past Christmas.
 
No Signs of Gloom
Gloomy economic forecasts have not stopped companies from playing Santa Claus, judging from some of the parties being given around town this month.
The Avon Company is planning a party for 1,100 people at the Wollman Rink on Tuesday. There will be wine, chili, chicken wings and a disk jockey, and a private security staff to insure that a good time is had by all.
Porter/Novelli, the public relations concern, has rented out the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue for its Christmas party Monday. Cocktails and hors d'oeuvres will precede a dinner of roast turkey, baked ham or sliced steak, vegetable lasagne, sole almondine, assorted vegetables, wild rice, potatoes and pumpkin and apple pie.
''We've been looking forward to this for months,'' said Judy Twersky, a senior account executive at Porter/Novelli. ''The armory has these wonderful wood-burning fireplaces, oak floors and red leather chairs. It's such a warm feeling. It looks like something straight out of a Ralph Lauren ad.''
Hilliard Farber & Company, brokers in Government securities, had its annual Christmas party Thursday at the City Midday Club in lower Manhattan. ''At that first party 14 years ago, we had maybe 40 or 50 clients attending,'' said Hilliard Farber, president of the company. ''We're expecting 500 people at this year's party.'' One of the most lavish holiday parties was thrown Friday by the Swiss Bank Corporation. The company reserved the entire third floor of the New York Hilton - Grand Ballroom and all. The celebration, for 2,000 guests, also marked the bank's 50th anniversary in the United States.
 
Avoiding Damage
Holding office parties outside the office not only gives employees a welcome change, but also cuts down on possible damage to office equipment. But a few companies still entertain on their home territories.
Jean-Christophe Le Picart, president of Tentation, a catering company in Manhattan, will be handling a small party for the People magazine staff at the Time-Life Building. Mr. Le Picart is also serving a small buffet for the Hermes Company at its Fifth Avenue boutique.
Despite the festive mood, some people in the food and entertainment businesses say the office Christmas party may be less a reflection of corporate confidence and ebullience than a tradition that is difficult to part with.
''For smaller-sized companies, the office party, per se, is disappearing,'' said Letitia Baldrige, the writer on etiquette and entertaining. ''Rather than throw a party, they're going out and having dinner together. But the larger companies that used to do lavish things, they're still doing it because they feel trapped.''
Regardless of why or where a company holds a party, career consultants caution against too much frivolity, noting that the office party can still make or break a career.
''Look at your office holiday fest as a business savvy test,'' said Susan Kleinman, author of ''Real Life 101 (Almost Surviving Your First Year Out of College),'' published by Mastermedia Limited.
Ms. Kleinman, who was hired by Crown Royal, the distiller, to write a guide for recent college grdauates on mixing business with pleasure, added: ''Having fun is not the prime objective. Rather, it's an excellent opportunity to score points.''

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE;
When Modernism Kissed The Land of Golden Dreams

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
In 1960 THE ARCHITECTURAL PHO-tographer Julius Shulman took a picture of a glass house perched high in the Hollywood Hills that will always be, for me, one of those singular images that sums up an entire city at a moment in time. The house is sleek and white, and its glass walls are cantilevered out over the hills; two elegantly dressed women lounge inside as the lights of the vast sprawl of the Los Angeles basin twinkle below. Modernity and elegance, privacy and openness - things that so rarely went together in the older cities of the East Coast - here become one, bound together in a way that epitomizes the seductive power of Los Angeles in the first years of its heady postwar growth. Here was the modern world, fresher and newer than in the East, possessed of a visual drama that the cities of the East Coast could only dream of, and yet with all of their luxury and style. 
No matter that the promise of that photograph was not borne out by the evolution of Los Angeles through the 1970's and 1980's; 30 years ago the city was still full of possibility, and this image crystallizes it. This sense of possibility is the real theme of ''Blueprints for Modern Living,'' a massive and ambitious exhibition that opened recently at the Museum of Contemporary Art here. The exhibition, which is subtitled ''History and Legacy of the Case Study Houses,'' is nominally about the architecture of a remarkable series of modern houses designed and constructed around Los Angeles between 1945 and 1966. But its true subject is the promise of a new and golden modern life, the allure of the 1950's in that most alluring of 1950's places, Southern California.
It is a marvelous, voluptuous, sweeping, exhilarating and at times frustrating exhibition. By its very nature, it tries to do too much, and because of that does not always succeed. But though its reach exceeds its grasp, ''Blueprints for Modern Living'' is one of the major architectural exhibits of the last few years. Organized by Elizabeth A. T. Smith and designed by Craig Hodgetts and Ming Fung, the exhibit takes full advantage of the huge space of the Temporary Contemporary, the warehouse converted into a museum by Frank Gehry in 1983 as MOCA was awaiting the completion of its main building by Arata Isozaki. (The ''Temp'' was so acclaimed that it was kept as a permanent auxiliary building, and it is ideal for large architectural exhibitions.) ''Blueprints for Modern Living'' contains not only the usual photographs, drawings and models, but also two full-size mock-ups of Case Study houses, a portion of the frame structure of a third, a wall of video screens showing tapes of the architects and builders of these houses talking about them, and miscellaneous pieces of furniture and household objects from the 1950's.
The full-size replicas of the houses are the real knock-'em-dead crowd-pleasers here: You can't build a whole house in most museums, but here are two of them with room to spare. The first house is one of the few Case Study designs that was not built, a 1945 project by Ralph Rapson in which all the rooms opened onto a small central garden court. The other structure, Case Study No. 22 by Pierre Koenig, is the very house shown in Mr. Shulman's famous photograph, and it has been reproduced here in faithful detail, down to the furniture in its rooms and 1950's appliances in its kitchen. The swimming pool, alas, is only suggested by an expanse of black vinyl, but the house is mounted one level above the main exhibition floor, so that visitors have at least a sense of looking down across the expanse of the city. In a gesture that is either a happy accident or a devilishly clever irony, the twinkling lights of the vista from the real house have been replaced here by the view down to the 18 television screens which make up the video section of the exhibition that has been installed just below the house.
The Case Study program was conceived by John Entenza, the visionary publisher of a now-defunct Southern California magazine called Arts & Architecture, as a means of proving that an architectural publication could be something other than all talk, and could have some concrete effect on the landscape. Entenza believed earnestly, if innocently, that good examples of modern architecture could improve public taste and influence the building industry to raise its standards, and over the years he commissioned 36 Case Study houses to serve as prototypes for modern design in Southern California. The houses were all designed by first-class architects, and were all intended to be built with modern materials at modest budgets. (All succeeded on the materials front, but the results were more mixed on the economic end.) Entenza was hardly the first to believe that Southern California was the ideal turf for the modern movement to prove its ability to assure the good life. But he put this belief into practice more determinedly than anyone else before or since, working with architects like Craig Ellwood, Raphael Soriano, Richard Neutra, Julius Ralph Davidson, Eero Saarinen, William Wilson Wurster, and Charles and Ray Eames, who produced for themselves the most famous Case Study house of all, No. 8, which was built in Pacific Palisades and which they lived in until their deaths.
The houses vary tremendously in quality and, for all their shared commitment to modernism as an idiom, in architectural style. Several, like the Eames house, are celebrations of technology: The Eameses sought to apply industrial materials to the problem of designing a residence, and their steel house, finished in 1949, became the touchstone for a whole generation of so-called ''high-tech'' designs a quarter-century later. Other houses, like Davidson's and Thornton Abell's, rely more on wood and glass, and curving forms.
The models created for the exhibition, which are made of identical light, unfinished wood, have a tendency to make all of the houses look the same - and in fact, for all the differences in shape and materials, all of the houses are very much the same. They are all light, tensile pavilions, houses in which the Southern California dream of inside and outside merging into one are fulfilled. And if the nasty truth be told, more than a few of them are actually rather dull.
Thus it comes as no surprise that the exhibition's designers have relied rather more heavily than they might have on objects from the 1950's - vacuum cleaners, washing machines, chairs and televisions which are officially there just as supporting props, but I suspect have really been included because they keep us more entertained than all of this earnest, but so very minimal, architecture could do by itself. It is too bad, because the objects make this exhibition, which tries hard to be a serious inquiry into how architecture could embody a whole culture's optimism, into more of an exercise in nostalgia.
But it is worth pushing past the seductive curves of 1950's appliances back to the architecture here, for collectively these houses have much to say. They were not the first modern houses in Los Angeles by any means, and neither were they the first houses to pay serious attention to this region's climate. They also depended, far more than we like to admit, on relatively empty land; few look as good in the context of the congested Los Angeles of today as they did in the raw and bare landscape of the 1950's, when each house could wallow in privacy.
But as a group the Case Study houses still represent a marvelous moment in the architectural culture of this country. To an age in which the most difficult architectural choice in Los Angeles has come to be whether to build in reproduction Spanish Colonial or reproduction Georgian, they remind us that there was a time when Southern California really did hold out the promise of shaping a new world, its architecture poised to satisfy the dreams of a postwar culture. It was not so much the houses themselves, then, as it was the combination of their serious intent, the heady postwar atmosphere and the increasing sense that Southern California represented America's future that gave the Case Study program its importance.
The most pleasurable things here, aside from the full-scale houses themselves, are the drawings and vintage photographs of the Case Study houses (including the famous Shulman shot of No. 22), and the video wall, in which the surviving architects speak with warmth about the long Case Study effort. The exhibition also includes a section of the framework of the Eames house, which does not come off well; placed in a corner, it is lonely, almost lost, and the steel frame blurs ambiguously with the trusses of the Temporary Contemporary's own roof. It is a well-meaning homage to the most important structure in the Case Study program, but by itself, without the Eameses' remarkable objects inside it, the framework ends up being more a piece of abstract sculpture than anything else.
In an attempt to continue the spirit of the Case Study program, the Museum of Contemporary Art also commissioned several architects to design latter-day Case Studies - in this case, prototype housing for affordable multifamily housing in Los Angeles, and prototype residential units for the elderly. The models for this effort, which include works by Adele Naude Santos, Eric Owen Moss, Craig Hodgetts and Robert Mangurian, among others, are also on view. The attempt to continue the Case Study idea in our time is not merely symbolic: The Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles is actually building Ms. Santos's project, the most conventional of the group, on a site in Hollywood.
The exhibition, which will run through Feb. 18, 1990, is accompanied by a lavish catalogue, published by MIT Press, that contains a lovely essay-memoir by Esther McCoy, the grande dame of California architectural criticism, as well as strong essays by an all-star roster of California architectural historians including Thomas Hines, Helen Searing, Kevin Starr, Reyner Banham, Dolores Hayden and Thomas Hine.

HEADLINE: Broadway and the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL; Peter Passell writes about economics for The New York Times.

 BODY:
The core market of consumers is aging. . . . Costs are out of control. . . . Five out of six new products lose money. . . . The most talented workers increasingly look to competing industries for most of their livelihood. . . .
If Broadway were a case study at the Wharton School, the best students in the class would probably recommend liquidation.
But, of course, Broadway is not a case study. It is a century-old business that has always operated by its own peculiar economic rules. And while few serious analysts of the theater are sanguine about Broadway's long-term prospects, nothing has happened to suggest the lights will be going out anytime soon.
The realistic worry, many insiders say, is that current trends will continue - that an ever-smaller and more defensive Broadway will find it increasingly difficult to sell backers on anything but the safest productions with the broadest potential market. 
''We must start with the assumption that the audience is dumb,'' says Elizabeth McCann, a producer of ''Orpheus Descending,'' ''Elephant Man'' and ''Amadeus.'' And while Ms. McCann's own record shows that Broadway investors do not always finish with that assumption, her successes have become exceptions to the rule.
Innovation is generally left to Off Broadway, or to nonprofit theaters - or not produced at all. And with just 30 to 35 new shows reaching the stage each year (compared to 50 to 60 in the 1970's), the one-third of Broadway houses with poor locations, like the Lyceum or the Nederlander, or with undesirable second balconies, are rarely booked.
High operating costs, moreover, make it difficult for productions that open with indifferent reviews to hang on long enough to find an audience through advertising or word of mouth. While there are exceptions, like ''Lend Me a Tenor'' (which opened last March), the moderately successful production has been an endangered species since the 1960's. ''There used to be a lot of shows in the middle range,'' says Rocco Landesman, president of the Jujamcyn chain, which along with the much larger Shubert and Nederlander organizations operates most Broadway theaters. ''Now you are a big hit overnight or you close down.''
Nor is it clear that one historically reliable strategy for selling serious drama on Broadway will always work. James Walsh, a producer of ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' points out that raising capital for a play often turns on the availability of a brand-name actor - a Vanessa Redgrave for an ''Orpheus Descending'' or a Dustin Hoffman for a ''Merchant of Venice.'' And as the number of performances needed to cover the overhead increases, it is growing harder to find stars willing to commit themselves to a suffienctly long run.
Even glitzy musicals are vulnerable. Since the mid-1970's theater owners have been forced to make risky and often economically unjustifiable investments in expensive shows in order to keep their marquees lit. ''We give the producers money to give back to us,'' laments Mr. Landesman. How long the three theater chains will passively acquiesce to what amounts to deep discounts on rental rates is impossible to say.
Hardly anyone in the business believes that Broadway can ever regain the turf it has conceded in recent decades. But there may be ways to increase revenues from the spectacles that already draw capacity crowds at seven or eight times the price of a movie ticket. And it may also be possible to use discounts more creatively to help sagging productions, filling seats that would otherwise go empty.
Cost containment may also be possible where it does not threaten the privileges of those who have secure places on what remains of the Broadway gravy train. According to Mr. Landesman and others, unions, theater owners and producers are now quietly haggling over plans to create an Off Broadway enclave on Broadway, lowering costs sufficiently to attract a half-dozen plays each year that could not possibly afford to pay the full Broadway tab. And while much remains to be settled about what might be called ''Broadway B,'' key meetings among the various interests involved are now being held. An agreement could be reached as early as this next week.
 
Matters of Cost And Sacrifice
 Even if efficiency were the watchword and self-sacrifice the standard, Broadway would still be caught in a cost vise, argues William Baumol, a Princeton University economist who has long studied the markets for performing arts. Theater is a service business in which most of the cost of the product is labor. As wages rise with general living standards, most other businesses can blunt the inflationary impact by substituting machines or technology for people. But in theater, the opportunities for saving labor are limited: It takes just as long to design the stage barge for Cleopatra or bewail the death of Anthony as it did in Shakespeare's day.
And unlike many other service industries, notes Professor Baumol, live theater has direct competition from a business with enormous economies of scale. Hollywood, like Broadway, has suffered from exploding production costs. But once a movie is in the can, it is easy to dilute the multimillion-dollar overhead of a film with tens of thousands of showings.
As important, the competition for live theater is highly mobile: When America moved to the suburbs, the movies went along. But Broadway must stay on Broadway, where parking and restaurants are expensive and personal safety is an issue.
In any case, those who work on Broadway are not generally inclined toward efficiency or self-sacrifice. Unions representing every Broadway craft achieved their great successes at the bargaining table long ago. By 1954, for example, senior stagehands were guaranteed a weekly minimum of $136, compared to $59 for the average American who worked 35 hours. And they have since managed to hold their own through decades of inflation and rising real wages in the rest of the economy.
This year their minimum is $857 a week, compared to the $330 national average wage. Exceptionally generous fringes add another 36 percent to the overall cost. Other unions, ranging from those who represent the workers who assemble scenery to those who run the box offices, have done comparably well.
 
Work Rules from The Middle Ages
 What seems to gall producers more than wage levels is their inability to reduce featherbedding or, in some cases, to make use of labor-saving technology. Broadway's work rules are as complicated and precedent-bound as those of medieval guilds, with numbers of workers from each craft specified for each theater and every circumstance. Where new technology is introduced, it rarely is permitted to displace labor or reduce overtime.
Electronic synthesizers, for example, have been a focus of contention between the League of Theater Owners and Producers, the management trade association, and the American Federation of Musicians, Local 802. These machines can duplicate the sound of most conventional instruments with uncanny accuracy: By some accounts, a few musicians playing synthesizers could now do the work of an entire orchestra. But the only concession obtained from Local 802 in the last round of negotations was the right to use synthesizers. And as a practical matter, that amounts to no concession at all since the minimum number of musicians paid for each performance has not been pared. The waste in featherbedding varies with the size of the theater, the scale of the production and the ingenuity of the producer. James Walsh puts the average at 25 to 35 percent of total operating costs. But even the 15 percent figure suggested by Rocco Landesman is a lot of money for a musical that costs $250,000 or more a week to perform - enough, in some cases, to spell the difference between a healthy profit and a show-stopping loss.
Why, then, in an era in which organized labor seems to be losing on every front, have producers and theater owners been unable to gain significant concessions? Abigail Evans, an assistant general manager in the Emmanuel Azenberg organization who wrote a distinguished thesis on the economics of Broadway at the Yale School of Drama, believes the bargainers are poorly matched.
Most theater unions have clearly defined interests in maintaining the status quo. And in the case of the stagehands' union, they have powerful bargaining leverage: Members could easily withstand a long strike because the majority are employed in television. Most producers, by contrast, are one-at-a-time dealmakers who have neither the capital nor the long-term attachment to Broadway to risk the loss of a show in a strike.
Theater owners do have a long-term stake keeping Broadway competitive. But they are no stronger than the edgiest producer with a $5 million show about to open. In any case, the unity of the three theater chains is undermined by personal feuds, as well as by diverging priorities among the hundreds of contract provisions that must be negotiated.
 
A Leading Role For the Shuberts
 A further impediment to tough bargaining - one not covered in Ms. Evans's thesis and rarely discussed openly in Broadway circles - is the awkward role of the Shubert Organization.
As the owner of roughly half the theaters on Broadway (16 1/2 to be exact, the half being the Music Box, which is co-owned with the estate of Irving Berlin) and largest single investor in new productions, the Shubert chain is the 700-pound gorilla of Broadway: Independent producers and other theater owners could accomplish little without its active cooperation. But unlike other Broadway management interests, the Shubert Organization is a charitable trust without profit-driven stockholders to satisfy, or debts to service.
That gives Shubert President Bernard Jacobs and Chairman Gerald Schoenfeld enviable freedom to take the long view. But it also reduces the pressure to maximize earnings at the expense of hard feelings with labor or civic leaders.
 
No One Will Settle for Less
 Yet another complication in demanding sacrifice from labor is that others who share in the largesse of Broadway are reluctant to throw stones.
According to Professor Baumol, workers toiling at contractual minimums are absorbing a shrinking proportion of Broadway revenue. Star writers, composers, directors, choreographers, set designers and actors command high fees and royalties. New York City collects hefty taxes on theater tickets and Broadway real estate; Con Edison commands high tariffs for utilities; the media charge top dollar for advertising.
Elaborate sets, deemed necessary to lure patrons from the likes of ''Batman'' or ''Black Rain,'' are incredibly expensive: The contraption in ''Starlight Express,'' with its 1,000 feet of fluorescent tubing and 22 miles of fiber optic conductor, reportedly cost $2.5 million. And when brand-name talent spends freely in the name of art, only philistines protest.
In ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway,'' for example, the director-choreographer reportedly insisted on an enormous cast, an oversize orchestra and complex staging that required extra months of rehearsals. The finished product has drawn critical praise and kept the theater nearly full since it opened last February. But it left the investors - among them the Shubert Organization and Suntory International, the Japanese whisky maker - to face an Everest-like climb to solvency.
Pre-opening production costs for ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway,'' originally budgeted at $5 million, totaled a record $8.8 million. With 1,415 seats and a top ticket price of $60, the show can generate over half a million dollars in weekly revenues - enough, one might guess, for the hit to recoup even that enormous investment relatively quickly.
But along with record production costs, ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway'' labors under record operating costs and royalties exceeding $400,000 a week. In the unlikely circumstance that the musical fills every seat, it will take 17 months to break even and almost three years for the investors to double their money.
 
There Will Always Be Investors
 Still, there are good reasons to believe that Broadway will continue to find the capital for such extravaganzas. Many, perhaps most, investors never see more than a few pennies return on their outlay. But hit musicals, even very expensively staged musicals, can make a lot of money if operating costs do not stray into the ionosphere. The American production of ''Cats,'' for example, has already earned more than $10 for every dollar sunk in the enterprise. And by staging heavily capitalized shows first in London (for about one-third the production cost), as ''Cats'' was, productions are in effect, test-marketed, greatly reducing the risk of a flop on Broadway.
Remember, too, that big Broadway theaters have no alternative uses. As long as they are frozen by landmark status, it makes sense for their owners to put money into shows that may never turn a profit - but will pay six-figure weekly rents.
Richard Tickton, a prominent show business lawyer in New York, believes there is another largely unexploited source of cash for Broadway that is insensitive to prospective returns. Corporations, notably Japanese corporations, he argues, value the glamour of an association with Broadway, especially when it can be rationalized as a way of advertising consumer products or as an inside track to subsidiary rights - movies, music, road companies. As one example, Suntory invests in shows produced by Shuberts.
 
Could Ticket Prices Be Too Low
 It may also be possible to extract more revenue from successful productions by raising ticket prices. At $55 to $60, top prices to musicals already seem outrageously high. But as Professor Baumol notes, the best seats in the house have always been an expensive luxury. Adjusted for the general increase in prices, the average top ticket price in 1929 was actually 9 percent higher than in 1988.
Two phenomena probably explain why prices now seem out of hand:
* Adjusted for inflation, ticket prices averaged a whopping 35 percent more last season than in 1978-79. But the 1980's was the first decade since the 1920's in which Broadway prices have done much better than hold their own. Ticket prices in 1959, for example, were higher than they were in 1979.
* Box-office prices for the cheapest seats have shot up in recent years as producers abandoned the policy of selling the least desirable balcony seats for a tiny fraction of the price of the orchestra. But that does not mean many undesirable seats to Broadway shows are actually sold at $30 or more. Roughly 20 percent of all seats, including most balcony seats, are dumped at half-price on the day of performance at the TKTS booth on Duffy Square.
Whatever the reason, current prices are obviously no deterrent for the hundreds of thousands of patrons who wait months for orchestra seats to hit shows, even when good balcony seats are available a few days in advance for two-thirds as much. Nor does price seem to matter to the uncounted thousands who pay double or triple the box-office price to brokers.
One plausible marketing strategy that has been discussed for years by producers would be to set aside choice blocks, perhaps the 100 or so ''house seats'' usually reserved for those who have a financial interest in productions, at, say, double the regular price. That would increase income for a hit by $40,000 a week, sharply reducing the time for recoupment. And it would melt box-office ''ice,'' the kickbacks sometimes paid to employees who funnel scarce tickets to brokers. The only risk, producers say, is that it would make it more difficult to sell ordinary seats to the new breed of theatergoer fixated on having the very best for the big night out.
Once a show begins to decline, its profitable life may be stretched by months or years by offering discounts on seats that would otherwise go empty. That explains both the ubiquitous ''two-fer'' coupons and the success of the TKTS booth. But such price discrimination, argues the producer Elizabeth McCann, is an underused means of building audiences. She would like the flexibility to sell same-day tickets through TKTS at more than half-price. And she would like the booth to sell half-price tickets to straight plays for the following day. That might generate impulse sales to bargain-hunting tourists who line up to buy tickets for same-day performances of musicals.
Professor Baumol is after different game: area residents who would go to Broadway performances 10 or 15 times a year if tickets were cheaper or discount seats easier to obtain. He suggests ''two-part'' pricing, routinely used by other businesses with very high fixed costs.
Broadway might, for example, sell a one-year ''Broadway addicts' pass'' for $100 that would entitle the owner to buy any available balcony seat in advance for any play at, say, half-price. That might encourage a Broadway habit for New Yorkers who have lost it, as well as those too young to have ever had it. And it would turn balcony seats that often go empty into a significant revenue source.
Alan Eisenberg, the head of the Actors Equity Association, the actors' union, believes that Broadway has done a poor job of marketing and is eager to experiment with such revenue-enhancing schemes. But Bernard Jacobs's cautious reaction is probably more typical. He fears that the theater-going public would react with hostility to further increases in top box-office prices. And he worries that any tampering with the TKTS system would drain away patrons who now pay full freight.
There are limits, in any case, to what could be achieved with more sophisticated pricing schemes. It would make it more likely for Neil Simon to succeed on Broadway in spite of the fact that his current play, ''Rumors,'' cost four times as much to stage as his 1976 production of ''California Suite.'' But no such gimmick could bring back the sort of theater that the producer Tom Viertel has in mind. Mr. Viertel, whose Off Broadway credits include ''Driving Miss Daisy'' and ''The Cocktail Hour,'' dreams of a way to bring serious plays with limited potential audiences back to Broadway -plays that cannot expect to fill more than half of a 1,000-seat theater on week nights, or run longer than six months. A leveling of every bastion of economic privilege on Broadway, one that opened every theater craft to competition, would make that practical. But such radical change is not likely in today's get-along, go-along Broadway climate.
 
New Hope For a Renaissance
What may be possible, however, is the creation of what might be called a ''Broadway B'' track, with costs and ticket prices roughly equivalent to Off Broadway. The idea now being discussed is to set aside three Broadway theaters that are rarely booked - one from each of the chains - for lower-budget drama. Likely theaters would include the Walter Kerr (formerly the Ritz) on West 48th Street, the Nederlander on West 41st Street and the Lyceum on West 45th Street. While details have yet to be worked out, Mr. Landesman has sketched the broad outlines of a deal, and other parties to the negotiations confirm their accuracy.
Across-the-board wage, royalty and theater rental cuts of 25 percent or more, plus major concessions on work rules, would sharply cut both production and operating costs. In return, producers would be obliged to hold the top ticket price to $24.
This is not the first time Broadway has tried to cope with the problem. In fact, an ''endangered theater'' agreement has been on the union contract books for a decade. But according to Mr. Landesman and Mr. Jacobs, the cost concessions were too small to make much difference and a rule limiting ticket sales to 499 for each performance amounted to a deal-killer.
There would not be much point to a Broadway B if it simply sucked commercially viable shows from Off Broadway theaters. In fact, says Mr. Viertel, the squeeze on Manhattan real estate has created a shortage of medium-sized Off Broadway theaters and this is already cutting into the total number of plays being produced. And many theater analysts believe that relatively cheap tickets could lead to a renaissance of exciting, riskier theater. ''The audience is there,'' concludes Arthur Sherman, who directed a revival of ''The Caine Mutiny'' in 1985. ''We just priced them out of Broadway.''
Broadway B, moreover, might have salutary effects beyond the direct benefits of filling three empty theaters with interesting plays. It would bring younger, culturally sophisticated New Yorkers back to Broadway, perhaps breaking down prejudices against the more traditional entertainment their parents loved. Such cross-pollination could work the other way, too, making it psychologically safer for tradition-bound audiences to try more innovative work.
The old Broadway is not dying. But it does require ever more expensive makeup to maintain the glamour, and there is no guarantee that an audience will always be there to pay the bill. Nor is it written in stone that every Broadway house will remain under landmark status, a city policy that effectively forces owners to accept a less-than-competitive return on their real estate. If and when the financial crisis does come, a low-cost enclave on Broadway could serve as a model for Broadway's salvation.

HEADLINE: A Prescription for Troubled I.B.M.

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
By all accounts, the International Business Machines Corporation is in trouble. Drastic measures are now in order if it is to keep its dominance in computers. Some would even argue that the time has finally arrived for it to drop its stubborn preoccupation with the mainframe, maybe even spin off its minicomputers.
Its ailing condition has become an obsession on Wall Street. I.B.M.'s earnings have been sliding for several years, falling to $5.8 billion last year, from $6.58 billion in 1984. The stock, once the darling of Wall Street and a symbol of stability, has never recovered from the stock market crash of 1987. It closed Friday at 96 7/8, down from a high of 175 7/8 just before the crash.
The company's efforts to reverse its fortunes have been greeted unenthusiastically. Just last week, I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, told a group of analysts that the company planned to induce 10,000 workers to leave the company, would take a $2.3 billion special charge to improve the company's finances and would spend up to $4 billion to buy back its stock. ''We are fully prepared to take further actions if dictated by economic or business conditions,'' he said, suggesting that things could get worse. 
When one I.B.M. watcher pointedly asked Mr. Akers if the company's senior management were not the real culprit for its financial malaise, the chief executive bristled. ''I believe that a management team is measured by its ability to deal with the problems, and I believe we are identifying the problems and dealing with them,'' he shot back.
Many financial analysts called for far more draconian measures: staff cuts of 30,000, or even 50,000 employees, among other things.
But technology experts have come to their own disturbing consensus. At a time of increasing global competition that is driven by technological developments, I.B.M. has risked its long-term position, preoccupied with meeting Wall Street's demands for quarterly results. They think I.B.M. can preserve its standing as the nation's supreme high-tech company and challenge the Japanese only by concentrating on innovation.
At the heart of I.B.M.'s dilemma is its seeming inability to pursue the most promising new technologies and make a clean break with technologies of the 1960's and 1970's, like mainframes, which are still the core of its business. It is this pursuit of new technology that has permitted companies scarcely more than a decade old like Apple or Compaq, to become multibillion-dollar enterprises, sometimes capitalizing on developments that I.B.M. had access to first.
What should I.B.M. do? Technology-oriented I.B.M. watchers prescribe strong action, but not Wall Street's brand of cost-cutting.
Here is one blueprint.
 
Stop Cutting Workers
 First, I.B.M. should drop its ''thousand cuts'' strategy for gradually shrinking its work force in the United States. I.B.M. chose this path rather than a layoff strategy in an effort to preserve morale. But recently departing executives say the strategy has backfired. Some of the company's best and brightest employees have accepted the inducements, and left. And many workers who remain are paralyzed by fear that voluntary actions might eventually be replaced by the involuntary cuts.
Rather than relying on random and voluntary resignations, I.B.M. would be smarter to slim down rationally, by spinning off unpromising product lines, like minicomputers.
 
Minimize the Mainframe
 I.B.M. should confront the reality that the era of mainframe computing is ending. Less expensive desktop computers may not eliminate mainframes any time soon, but they are dramatically slowing their growth. The expanded horsepower of microprocessors has enabled personal computers and work stations to handle applications from payroll processing to exotic document processing that were once possible only with mainframes. The company, therefore, would be smart to embrace the philosophy proposed several years ago by John Sculley, the chairman of Apple Computer Inc., who says he views mainframes mainly as storage peripherals, rather than power sources, for personal computers.
But I.B.M. faces a tremendous force of inertia in reorienting itself around desktop computers. As much as 50 percent of its revenues and 65 percent of its profits worldwide flow from its mainframe product lines.
 
Spin Off the Mini
 The company should spin off its AS/400 line and other minicomputer systems. Like mainframes, minicomputers are a dying breed, highly vulnerable to the cheap processing power of personal computers and work stations. But unlike the mainframe, which will continue to serve a vital role as a speedy librarian handling data storage and special tasks, minicomputers are headed for extinction. In fact, jettisoning the product line could slash more than $4 billion in expenses for the company without any loss in growth.
Take the AS/400 line. When introduced in 1988, the line enjoyed initial success by encouraging I.B.M.'s existing minicomputer customers to upgrade, but the business is now exhausted. And the introduction of ever more powerful new desktop computers will mean increasingly rough sledding for the line in the 1990's.
 
Stress the Desktop
 Instead, I.B.M. should shore up its weaknesses in faster-growing segments of the business, like desktop computing. The computer maker took an important step in the desktop direction earlier this year, when it put James Cannavino, an esteemed veteran of the mainframe division, in charge of both personal computer and work-station development.
And, wisely, I.B.M. over the last four years has invested heavily to become a low-cost producer of personal computers in an effort to fight off the onslaught of clones. Its share of that market has recently begun to bounce back.
But the company has bungled its efforts to compete in work stations, the industry's fastest-growing segment, because it was shamefully timid in exploiting a technology it developed that offered faster processing through simplified hardware design. The vaunted technology, known as RISC, for reduced instruction set computing, was pioneered by John Cocke at I.B.M.'s Watson labs in the mid-70's. As early as 1981, the company had working prototypes of the technology that were far faster than anything that existed.
Yet I.B.M.'s first commercial product based on RISC was a disappointment. The product, the PC/RT work station, was not introduced until early 1986 - after a dozen of I.B.M.'s toughest competitors, including Sun, Digital Equipment and Hewlett Packard, had already released their own RISC-based work stations and sewn up the market. Worse, many in the industry believe that I.B.M. intentionally watered down the work station's capabilities to keep it from cannabalizing sales of its other entrenched products, namely its minicomputers and mainframes.
Yet I.B.M. still has a chance to redeem itself. Early next year, it is scheduled to introduce a new family of work stations with powerful RISC capabilities. With speeds ranging from 20 million to 100 million instructions per second, the new line, code-named Rios, would be competitive with the very best machines on the market. Now, I.B.M. should price the Rios line aggressively, even if it does risk competing with its AS/400 minicomputer.
 
Take Gates to Task
 I.B.M. should shock the computer industry out of complacency and show that it is prepared to take risks on new technology by siding with Steven Jobs in his battle to break the stranglehold Microsoft's William Gates has on the desktop software market. No one in the computer industry packages technology more brilliantly than Mr. Jobs. And I.B.M. should take full advantage of its license to Mr. Jobs' Nextstep software, a innovative visual control panel. If the computer giant used Nextstep as the standard ''dashboard'' for all of its computers, its could spur and bring order to its far-flung designs.
But so far, the company has been sketchy about how it will use the software for fear of offending Mr. Gates, who has developed software for I.B.M. personal computers including a competing, albeit more bland, alternative to Nextstep, known as the presentation manager. To borrow a phrase that Kenneth Olsen, the president of Digital Equipment, used to describe the Unix operating system, presentation manager is ''about as exciting as a Russian truck.''
By endorsing Nextstep, I.B.M. could in a single audacious stroke declare its independence from Microsoft, which has slowed development applications for I.B.M.'s new desktop computer operating system by sending mixed signals about which program software developers should write for first.
 
Step Into Laptops
 I.B.M. must also step into the laptop and notebook computer markets. Already generating $2 billion a year, the business is growing by more than 40 percent annually. Once thought of as toys, or worse, as useful only to journalists, laptops now match virtually all the features of their bulkier, desktop cousins. In fact, many believe that the next generation of laptops, with their improved convenience and features, may even begin to displace desktops.
The recent purchase of the Zenith Computer Corporation by a French concern, leaves the Compaq Computer Corporation as the only major laptop player in the United States. But if Americans abdicate the market, they may ultimately lose the expanding desktop market as well.
For its part, I.B.M. has failed abysmally in the market; its offerings are heavier and less functional than most. Rather than losing precious time by developing a product internally, the company should license or purchase outright technologies needed to build state-of-the-art laptops now being developed by any of a half-dozen start-up companies in Silicon Valley. Because the Japanese still lead in portable displays, I.B.M. should embark on a crash research program in flat panel displays, monitors that are slimmer and lighter-weight than cathode-ray terminals. That work would dovetail neatly with the nation's need for high-definition television technology.
 
Bring Back I.B.U.'s
 To invigorate development efforts, the computer giant should bring back its Independent Business Units, or I.B.U.'s., the independent ventures formed to nurture new businesses. An organizational tool intended to foster entrepreneurial thinking within I.B.M.'s larger, slower-moving corporate structure, these units made it possible for I.B.M.'s ''wild ducks,'' the creative managers who chose not to ''fly in formation,'' to spread their wings. Both the I.B.M. Personal Computer and the new line of computer work stations evolved from these units, which at their peak numbered 15. I.B.M. has now disbanded all but two of them. Yet it has not had a blockbuster product since the personal computer.
 
Accept Open Systems
 Lastly, I.B.M. must abandoned its preoccupation with account control, under which it pushes proprietary products to lock in customers to its systems, and move quickly to put its open-systems house in order. Open systems, computer hardware and software combinations that meet generally accepted industry standards, are rapidly becoming the wave of the future. Just last month, the Open Software Foundation, an industry consortium attempting to form a new standard operating system, rejected I.B.M.'s AIX.
I.B.M. should now drop AIX and support the choice of the Open Software Foundation and A.T.&T., which are close to an agreement on a single operating system. If it doesn't, the computer maker will be locked out of open systems entirely, isolated with two closed systems, AIX and System Application Architecture.

HEADLINE: Japan's Loud Voice in Washington

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Toshiba Corporation of Japan was roundly condemned by Congress two years ago for illegally selling high-technology milling equipment to the Soviet Union for use in building quieter submarine propellers. Some lawmakers were so incensed that they even invited the news media to watch the sledgehammering of the Japanese company's products on the Capitol's steps. There was widespread talk of tough sanctions against Toshiba, aimed at the $2.5 billion a year in computers, cellular phones and other products it sells in the United States.
But last year, when Congress finally wrote the retaliation into trade legislation, Toshiba got little more than a slap on the wrist. The widespread perception in Washington is that the credit goes to Toshiba's corps of Washington lobbyists, including many former senior administration officials and Congressmen.
Toshiba spent about $30 million on its campaign, including fees to such luminaries as James R. Jones, a former Democratic Representative from Oklahoma who was chairman of the House Budget Committee and is now chairman of the American Stock Exchange; Michael D. Barnes, a former Democratic Representative from Maryland; the former Nixon White House officials Leonard Garment and Stanton D. Anderson, and William N. Walker, a former deputy United States trade representative. 
The Toshiba case illustrates what many in Government and industry see as a growing trend. ''In a word,'' says a study by the Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs, a unit of the State Department, ''the U.S. has been penetrated - not only by Japanese autos and VCR's, but by Japanese influence peddling at every level.''
Some critics of these efforts say there are long-term implications for Washington, where the lobbyists are influencing economic and trade strategy. For example, the lobbyists have been influential in blunting Government initiatives on behalf of American technology in such areas as high-definition television, where Japan has an acknowledged lead.
The lobbyists, however, maintain that they are maximizing international understanding and advancing interests of American consumers, who benefit from low-cost, high-quality Japanese goods.
In no way do they threaten American interests or security, said Mr. Walker. ''There are no state secrets anyone is giving away,'' he said. ''It is a process of trying to help shape policy in areas where there are many competing views. Mainly what we do is interpret what the U.S. position is for the Japanese and what the Japanese position is for the U.S. to maximize areas of understanding and minimize conflict.''
Nobutoshi Akao, an economics minister at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, says Japan is only doing what other countries do. ''If Japanese companies have a lot of influence, many American companies and foreign companies have similar influence,'' he said. ''It is a matter of the American system itself.''
Asked whether it is ethical for former senior American officials to work for the Japanese, he said, ''If the American legal system allows it, we are not in a position to say anything against it.''
It is true that most countries have long used lobbyists to influence legislation, regulatory actions and Presidential decisions in Washington, but none rival Japan in the depth of its pockets or the number of jobs it provides for former Government officials.
Awash in dollars from trade surpluses Japan has run with the United States for much of the past two decades, more than 250 Japanese Government agencies, industry associations and companies have hired lobbyists in the United States, according to a list in the 1989 directory of Washington Representatives, based on Justice Department filings. In comparison, the tally for Canada, the runner-up, was 90.
What is perhaps most troubling about Japan's wide-scale deployment of lobbyists is that the United States has no reciprocal influence in Tokyo. One American executive recalled that he once asked an official of Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry what would happen if his company were to hire a former high-level Government official to represent it in Tokyo. The official replied: ''It would not happen, but if it did we would pay him not the slightest heed. We would treat him courteously, but he would become a social leper.''
Japanese companies do use numerous lobbyists at home, but chiefly as fund raisers for political favorites and as gatherers of information about coming Government decisions.
And American companies that are well-entrenched in Japan, like the International Business Machines Corporation, employ Japanese lobbyists, but rarely get the services of former high-ranking officials. In Japan, such people are considered ''descendants from Heaven'' and usually join boards of Japanese companies or corporate- and government-sponsored research institutes instead. Some Congressional aides estimate that Japanese interests spend upward of $60 million a year on representation in Washington, four times the 1984 level. But it may be closer to $100 million, said Pat Choate, vice president of policy analysis for TRW Inc., a Cleveland-based electronics company, and author of a book on Japan's influence in Washington, to be published next year.
And direct lobbying is not the full story of Japan's growing clout. To win friends and influence people the Japanese also dole out $45 million on public relations, $140 million on corporate philanthropy and $30 million on academic research grants, according to a tally by Business Week.
And because of the ubiquitous and amorphous nature of Washington lobbying, which takes place at dinner parties, receptions, trade association meetings, Congressional hearings or simply on the telephone, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to assess a lobbyist's influence.
Yet with so many well-paid former American Government officials acting as eyes and ears of the Japanese Government or industry, Tokyo has unparalleled knowledge of what's happening inside the United States Government. Often the lobbyists will know the progress of an issue before mid-level Washington officials do.
''I have seen it over and over where a lobbyist will tell me of a decision well before it's filtered down to my level,'' said one mid-level Commerce Department official, adding, ''I resent it.''
A new ethics law signed last month should reduce the number of former high-level officials who return to Washington as lobbyists. The law, which covers members of Congess and their top staff members for the first time, includes a one-year ban on lobbying a former agency, and a two-year ban on matters for which an official had primary responsibility. It also bars officials who were involved in trade or treaty negotiations from any lobbying for a year.
Some members of Congress call for more draconian actions - notably Repesentative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio; Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan; Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina.
Despite those sentiments, the Japanese have been able to attract some of the most sought-after names in Washington as lobbyists and consultants, which is testament not just to their buying power but also to the cachet of those jobs.
Among prominent lobbyists with important connections in the Bush Administration is James H. Lake, whose firm, Robinson, Lake, Lerer & Montgomery, represents Mitsubishi, Suzuki Motors and the Japan Auto Parts Industry Association. He has been a close friend of Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter since they worked together in the Agriculture Department of the Nixon years. Mr. Yeutter is a former United States trade representative.
''Notwithstanding my friendship with him, I have never asked Mr. Yeutter to do anything that is not in the best interests of this country, or for that matter have I ever asked that of anyone else,'' Mr. Lake said.
Roderick M. Hills, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and husband of Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has had a long-term consulting relationship with C. Itoh, a major Japanese trading house.
Mr. Hills said his links with C. Itoh stretch back to 1982 when as head of Sears World Trade, an affiliate of Sears, Roebuck & Company, he tried to interest the Japanese company in an international trading venture. Of his relationship with the company now, he says, ''We're just friends,'' although his law firm, Donovan Leisure Newton & Irvine, represents the company in New York. ''Anything I do, I clear with Carla's general counsel first,'' he stressed.
Toshiba's success is only one illustration of the way Tokyo apparently gets value for its investment in lobbyists. Domestic auto makers are still smarting from an unusual decision by the Treasury this year, revising a Customs Service ruling. The result was a sharp cut in duties on imported vans and sport-utility vehicles.
It was a major victory not just for Japanese, but also West German and British manufacturers. Japanese companies had the biggest stake and took the lobbying lead. ''The Japanese papered the walls uptown and downtown on that one,'' a Senate aide recalled.
With its American face, the Japan lobby probably has become almost integrated into the fundamental structure of advice giving, consultation and governance in Washington. ''Quite literally,'' said Mr. Choate of TRW, ''people are being called on to provide advice to the Government or Congress who have some kind of financial relationship with Japan.''
One illustration is a recent Washington news conference on a report on ways to handle trade problems between the United States and Japan. The report was prepared by the Committee for Economic Development, a New York-based group of 250 business and academic leaders, and a similar group in Japan, the Keizai Doyukai. It called on American companies to make greater efforts to sell in Japan and on Japanese companies to buy more American goods, but it was not especially critical of Japan.
The American team that worked on the report was led by William D. Eberle, the former United States trade representative who is now president and half-owner of a Washington consulting firm, Manchester Associates, which has Nissan among its clients. The Japanese team was led by Nissan's chairman, Takashi Ishihara, who is also the chairman of the Keizai Doyukai. Neither in the report nor during the news conference was there any disclosure of Mr. Eberle's relationship with Nissan.
Mr. Eberle said in an interview that he worked on the project ''in my own capacity as a C.E.D. trustee'' and that he was among those taking the hardest line on Japan. He said everyone on the committee ''knew of my relationship with Nissan.'' He also said that ''because there is this anti-Japanese feeling building, things like this tend to get distorted.''
Despite these anti-Japanese sentiments, Japanese companies have numerous employees, customers and suppliers in the United States and have been able to mobilize them to help influence Washington.
This ''market power'' or ''leverage lobbying'' was a factor in the softening of the Toshiba sanctions. Toshiba brought to Capitol Hill executives of many of the smaller American companies that make data processors, personal computers and other products that depend on its components.
Another reason for Japan's growing influence may be less what Tokyo is doing than what Washington is not doing. Some legislators and academic analysts believe the United States suffers from the lack of foreign economic policy goals. Although there is growing recognition that the nation's future will be determined by how it fares in global economic competition, economic concerns are regularly being subordinated to military and political objectives. But in Japan, the goals of industry and Government are closely aligned, and the country appears to have a cohesive strategy of accumulating the bulk of high-paying, high-knowledge jobs of the next century, which is evident in its actions of the last decade and the instructions that go out to its army of Washington lobbyists.
''The lack of policy objectives,'' said Robert C. Angel of the University of South Carolina, ''has helped Japan manage the United States to achieve maximum benefits for Japan.''
 

 
JAPANESE MONEY IN ACADEME
Up to 80 percent of studies on United States-Japan relations at American universities and research institutions are financed, at least in part, by Japan's corporations, foundations or Government.
The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, in Washington, has a Nakasone chair, financed by Japanese foundations.
James E. Auer, the Pentagon's leading expert on Japan for most of this decade and now director of the Center for U.S.-Japan Studies and Cooperation at Vanderbilt University, is working on a study of defense-technology transfers between the two nations, financed by Japanese foundations.
Daiwa Securities granted $1 million to the Committee for Economic Development, a policy-analysis group, for studies in education.
Is the work of American scholars influenced by the source of their financing? It is a question being posed with increasing frequency as Japan has begun spreading some of the wealth from its trade surpluses throughout academe.
John W. Rosenblum, a Japan specialist and dean of the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration of the University of Virginia, said, ''I would like to think, and believe I have reason to think, that my colleagues have maintained an integrity and an arms-length perspective, even when some of their funding comes directly or indirectly from Japanese sources.''
But it is an issue ''that all scholars need to be attendant to because even the appearance of conflict of interest would be devastating to scholarship and to universities that support that scholarship,'' Mr. Rosenblum said. ''Any time an institution like mine relies on another institution, be it a country or company, for a significant percentage of financial support, it is reasonable to assume that it will face these kinds of conflicts of interest.''
''Everyone,'' he added, ''would benefit from fuller disclosure of the relationships that might shape the conclusions being offered.''
 
QUESTIONS ON CAPITOL HILL
Together with a number of other American econmists, Gary R. Saxonhouse serves on the advisory board of an economic research institute financed by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, but he also is a part-time economist on the President's Council of Economic Advisers and its chief Japan expert.
The position in Japan is unpaid, and the board meets only once every two years. Still the linkage has stirred questions on Capitol Hill.
Eight members of the House, led by Helen Delich Bentley, Republican of Maryland, recently called for a White House investigation. ''It is difficult to understand how any U.S. Government economist, making critical decisions on the future of this country, could participate as an adviser to any foreign government or foreign agency,'' they wrote. They said they were acting out of ''our deep concern over the United States losing the race in the high-technology field to Japan.''
The White House dismissed the complaint, noting, according to one official, that Mr. Saxonhouse's membership was ''irrelevant'' because of the infrequent meetings of the Japanese board. Mr. Saxonhouse is also a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.
The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Michael J. Boskin, had been on a similar board of an institute financed by the Japanese Ministry of Finance. To avoid a possible conflict of interest, he resigned before joining the Bush Administration. But as a part-time employee of the council, Mr. Saxonhouse is not covered by White House ethics rules, according to a council spokesman, Steve Landfeld.
Noting his 20-year background as a student of the Japanese economy, Mr. Saxonhouse said that in the course of his research he had developed associations with many Japanese scholars and Government officials. ''It is precisely because of these associations, my detailed knowledge of the Japanese economy, and my well-known and distinctive views on U.S.-Japanese relations that the Council of Economic Advisers sought to have me serve as a consultant with them,'' he said.
Mr. Saxonhouse has published widely quoted studies concluding that Japan is not protectionist. While Tokyo may tinker heavily with trade, the net impact on flows, he contends, is light. Japan's low level of imports, he argues, reflects such forces as economies of scale, distances from industrial competitors and a natural dependence on imported raw materials.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEW IN CHEMICALS;
Cushioning for a Recession?

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
All things considered, chemical industry executives should be pretty scared.
After all, the last few years have been a time of breathtaking profits for almost every commodity chemicals company. Their operating earnings shot up an average of 40 percent in each of the last three years as customers, from toothpaste makers and textile firms to other chemical companies, snapped up every drop of ethylene, propylene and other building-block chemicals. Last year some chemical plants ran as high as 97 percent of capacity, a level unheard of in an industry that has considered an 85 percent production rate as a sign of boom times. As supplies tightened, prices climbed. Things looked enough like they did in 1979 and 1980 to give industry old-timers an ominous sense of deja vu. Those glory years were followed by a global recession that for the chemical industry became the Great Depression of 1982. 
Once again, the ever-cyclical chemical industry is going into the down side of its curve. Chemical prices have been falling since May and demand is starting to slake. The housing and automotive industries, major users of chemicals, have already grown sluggish.
And with China riven by rampant inflation and political upheaval, the huge orders for thermoplastics and basic chemicals that many companies were expecting from that country have not materialized and may not anytime soon. ''Everyone in the U.S. was gearing up to large demand out of China, and we're just not getting it,'' said Theodore S. Semegran, a chemicals analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
Despite the forecasts of a general recession, the chemical industry is ebullient. Budgets for capital spending and for research are running high. No one is talking about cutting dividends or firing workers or shutting down anything except antiquated plants.
''There's no need for a bunker mentality because this industry is not as sensitive from an earnings standpoint as it was in the past,'' said Richard A. Stuckey, chief economist for E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
The industry seems in good shape to face a downturn. It is not bloated with capacity, productivity is high, and most companies have diversified into segments that are more recession-proof than commodities. ''The chemical industry will always be a cyclical industry, and anyone who thinks otherwise is not being realistic,'' said Nathan L. Zutty, group vice president for Union Carbide's Chemical and Plastics Company. ''But we've all learned how to deal with the cycles.''

Detroit's Slump Grows Worse

BYLINE: By STEVE DODSON

 BODY:
Auto sales were weak in November, with the Big Three American makers showing steep declines. General Motors decline for the month was 22.6 percent, while Ford was down 15 percent and Chrysler off 17 percent. There were sales gains for cars made at Japanese auto plants in the United States. Honda, for example, now has 9.6 percent of the American market and is approaching Chrysler' 10.3 percent share.
Chrysler put up for sale its military electronics unit and the Gulfstream unit that makes corporate jets. There were no offers yet but the two units are expected to bring in at least $1 billion. Chrysler said it would put the money into its auto business. . . Fiat will buy 49 percent of Maserati, resulting in a halving of Chrysler's 15 percent stake in Maserati.

 I.B.M. is cutting 10,000 jobs from its United States work force of about 216,000. Employees will be offered incentives to leave, and no layoffs are planned. I.B.M. said it would take a $2.3 billion charge against fourth- quarter earnings, partly because of the job cuts but mostly because of accounting changes.
McGraw-Hill will eliminate 1,000 jobs, or about 7.3 percent of its work force. The New York-based company owns Business Week magazine, the Standard & Poor's credit-rating agency and other information services companies.

 The unemployment rate edged up in November. The rate that includes the military was 5.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in October. The economy added 210,000 jobs last month, much more than expected, but the Government also sharply lowered the October jobs-creation number to 93,000, from 233,000. The huge change was attributed to difficulty in measuring hiring by schools . . . New-home sales were off five-tenths of a percent in October and orders for manufactured goods declined two-tenths of a percent in October, the second straight monthly drop . . Net consumer credit grew by $3.34 billion in October, the biggest rise in five months.

 M. Danny Wall resigned as head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, saying he had become the ''scapegoat for the entire thrift crisis.'' Pressures for his resignation increased with recent investigations of the downfall of Lincoln Savings and Loan of California. Mr. Wall has not been accused of wrongdoing, but critics were harsh about the regulatory handling of Lincoln, which is estimated to need a $2 billion bailout. Mr. Wall was also criticized for telling Congress throughout most of 1988 that the savings and loan situation was manageable without extra Federal money. Congress has since approved a $159 billion rescue program.

 Interest rates were the focus of the markets as traders tried to guess when, or if, the Federal Reserve would move to cut rates. Those expectations suffered when the Fed reported that a survey of its 12 district banks showed the economy was ''stable to modestly expanding.'' The report depressed stock and bond prices but they recovered somewhat on Friday's report of a rise in unemployment. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 16.42 points, closing at 2,731.23. But the Dow Jones utility average hit a record high during the week.

 A cable across the Soviet Union is planned by a corporation led by U S West, the regional Bell telephone company based in Denver. The fiber- optic cable will provide a new link between Europe and Japan. The Soviet Government and seven other international phone companies are partners in the project, which U S West said would cost $500 million. U S West also won a contract to build a cellular phone system in Budapest, Hungary, that will serve homes as well as car telephones . . . A private West German cellular system will be built by a consortium that includes Pacific Telesis, the Bell company based in San Francicso. The West German cellular market is estimated to have 60 million potential customers.

 Pennzoil has a stake in Chevron. The 8.8 percent stake was acquired in the last two months for $2.1 billion, Pennzoil said, adding that it was spending cash from the $3 billion settlement of its dispute with Texaco. Chevron, the nation's third-largest oil company, filed suit against Pennzoil and strengthened its ''poison pill'' defenses.

 Miscellanea. Mellon Bank is making the largest purchase of branches in banking history. The Pittsburgh bank will pay $335 million for 54 Philadelphia-area branches of Meritor Savings Bank, . . . Sales of Fisher- Price toys are off this season and the parent company, Quaker Oats, said the division could show a quarterly operating loss. But Mattel Inc. said it expected a 25 percent gain in quarterly sales, with dolls doing especially well. The Barbie doll is Mattel's biggest product.

HEADLINE: The Baby Bells Scramble for Europe

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The Baby Bells, long seen simply as providers of local phone service, have ambitions to go global. Last week, U. S. West Inc. reached agreements to lay the world's longest fiber-optic cable across the Soviet Union and build a cellular phone system in Hungary, a first for Eastern Europe. A consortium including the Pacific Telesis Group won a multibillion dollar contract for the first private cellular system in West Germany, beating out bids from five other regional Bell companies.
In fact, these new ventures are only the latest evidence of the Baby Bells' efforts to become international giants. Frustrated by restrictions in the United States that keep them out of many businesses and limit their rates of return on local service, they are scouring the world for new opportunities. And Europe presents the brightest prospects. As 1992 approaches and the European Community's trade barriers begin to fall, the telecommunications market is becoming bigger, more competitive and freer from government control. And American companies are finding that Europe's progress increases their potential, too. ''We are simply recognizing that the opportunities for growth are greater outside the United States than within,'' said Eugene Sekulow, president of the Nynex International Company. ''Our primary business is still here within our region, but the marketplace is increasingly becoming a global one and Europe is where we see the most potential.' 
Calling the seven regional companies babies belies their huge bulk, ranging from $9 billion to $14 billion in annual revenues. So far, foreign operations make up only a small fraction of their business - less than 5 percent for Pacific Telesis, one of the most aggressive venturers abroad. But executives at most of the Bell companies believe their European revenues will grow much larger.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has long had a sprawling worldwide network. A.T.&T.'s long-distance rivals, the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, also have extended their networks abroad. When A.T.&T. spun off the regional bell companies six years ago, they had only their local telephone operations.
But the Baby Bells are local no longer. Their incentive to branch out to Europe is great. Industry analysts estimate that the European market for mobile communications, including cellular telephones and paging beepers, could reach $9.7 billion by 1992. The demand for telecommunications services like stock quotes, electronic banking and travel reservations has a potential of $8.6 billion by 1992, and the market for networks that transmit computer data, $1.3 billion.
Most of the Baby Bells have approached Europe boldly, plunging into areas like cable television, computer services and fiber-optic cable. But one has remained cautious. The Ameritech Corporation believes that serving the Middle West carries far fewer risks than trying to span the globe. ''There are very high risks to understanding the marketplace, the cultural aspects and the strategic competitors,'' Gerald Mallik, president of Ameritech's foreign division, said.
The other Baby Bells, already earning close to their allowed returns from local telephone operations, are convinced that profits from unregulated businesses both domestic and international are crucial to future growth. In the United States, the Baby Bells have expanded into cellular telephone and paging services, computer maintenance, financial services, real estate and office equipment. But Government restrictions have prevented them from entering the businesses that they covet the most: telephone equipment manufacturing, long distance, electronic information services and cable television.
So the regional companies are targeting telephone markets across the Atlantic. For decades, European governments kept foreign companies from competing with domestic telephone monopolies. The huge privatization of British Telecom in 1983 and the progress of economic unification since then have produced a revolution in the telephone industry. Nations seeking the best, most advanced products and services, at the cheapest prices, are opening their telecommunications markets to competition.
''These countries are recognizing that they need state-of-the-art telecommunications to be economically competitive. They want to modernize quickly and many don't really care who does it,'' Charles W. Schelke, an analyst with Smith Barney said. ''The good news is that the United States has a knowledge advantage when it comes to telephone technology and services.''
The most fertile ground is in Britain, France and West Germany, which have allowed foreign companies to compete for licenses to provide cellular telephone service, beeping pagers and cable television. Other countries, especially those in Eastern Europe, are expected to follow suit.
European cable television licenses represent a prime opportunity for the Baby Bells to acquire franchises in high-income regions at much lower prices than they would cost at home, if that were allowed. Since most of the cable franchises are likely to be awarded city by city (unlike cellular franchises, which in Europe are national), the regional Bells have more opportunities to acquire licenses. The Southwestern Bell Corporation, for example, is helping to build new cable systems in the Liverpool region of England.
Investing in foreign cable systems allows the regional companies to gain experience in combining cable and telephone services. The cable contracts in Britain allow companies to provide telephone and television services over the same networks. And the Baby Bells plan to install fiber-optic cable, which can carry both telephone and video signals, in some European homes.
Regional Bell executives stress that their cable innovations are only one of the technologies they are trying out in Europe that they are forbidden from introducing in the United States. Many Bell companies plan to offer information services in Europe that they are restricted from offering at home. Although the United States has the world's most advanced telecommunications service today, they say, Europe could soon leap ahead. ''The United States does run the risk of losing some of our capability to other countries if we are kept out of these markets,'' said Edgar Brown Jr., president of Bell Atlantic International-Europe.
The Baby Bells also see a wealth of business opportunities in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries like East Germany, Hungary, and Poland, where dramatic political and economic reforms are being introduced. The companies want to participate in the overhaul of their antiquated telephone systems in exchange for sharing in the operation of, and the profits from, the new telephone networks.
Despite the unprecedented liberalization of Europe's telecommunications markets, many barriers remain. Europe continues to have local telephone monopolies that are traditionally owned by the governments, providing them with strong revenues. Few countries allow private companies to provide plain voice telephone services, as the Bells provide in the United States. Eastern Europe presents the additional problem of repatriating profits where currencies are not convertible.
The Baby Bells' success throughout Europe will depend on how well they manage a complicated web of joint ventures and partnerships with foreign companies. Strategic alliances are the standard mode of operating overseas. The regional companies need the infrastructure, marketing, distribution and regulatory clout of their foreign partners as much as the partners need the Baby Bells' technical expertise.
''Managing joint ventures from across the ocean is a difficult task because the partners all have different objectives and functions, there are cultural and language barriers and the physical separation,'' said David Wenner, a senior partner and consultant at McKinsey & Company. Half of all the joint ventures American companies form abroad eventually fall apart, he said, adding, ''I am not saying it's impossible, but it takes close communications and understanding.'' The American telephone company wants to increase shareholder value; the European government wants an infusion of new technology and competition to benefit consumers; and European companies want to secure their roles in changing markets, he explained.
Pactel won the German cellular license only by conducting delicate negotiations with the Government and affiliating with a plethora of German companies. It will be a tough enterprise to manage, said C. Lee Cox, a Pactel group vice president, ''but the rewards are well worth it.''
 
PACIFIC TELESIS
 
A Triumph in West Germany
 A consortium including Pacific Telesis brought home one of Europe's biggest prizes last week: a license to build the first private cellular telephone system in West Germany. The group plans to build a digital system to compete with the overloaded, outdated network run by the Bundespost, the national telephone and mail company. Analysts say the contract - in a prosperous, densely populated market ideal for cellular services - could be worth about $6 billion in revenues over 20 years. No wonder that five of the other six regional Bell companies also bid. The Pacific Telesis team is headed by Mannesmann A.G., a West German engineering and steel company.
Pacific Telesis, serving California and Nevada with headquarters in San Francisco, has been one of the most aggressive Baby Bells overseas. Besides cellular, the company has invested heavily in wireless communications, cable television and information services.
In Britain, Pacific Telesis has acquired interests in three cable television companies - East London Telecommunications Ltd., Peterborough Cablevision and Norwich Cablevision - that together cover regions of 750,000 homes. They plan to test a new telephone service to businesses and homes over their cable television lines.
As part of a consortium that includes British Aerospace, Pacific Telesis is competing for a license from the British Government to build a personal communications network. Personal communications is an innovative technology that would use radio waves to provide wireless, digital telephone and information services.
Pactel also is looking at wireless telephone opportunities - cellular, paging services or personal communications - that may arise as Spain, Italy, and West Germany open their telecommunications industries to competition.
In Asia, Pactel is part owner of a Japanese national long-distance company and has received permission from Judge Harold H. Greene, who presided over the breakup of A.T.&T., to take part in laying a fiber-optic link between the United States and Japan. In Bangkok, the company has a beeper paging service with 40,000 customers, and in South Korea, a credit-card verification business.
 
 
 
NYNEX
 
Bringing High-Tech to Gibraltar
 Nynex, which serves New York and New England, boasts of its overseas expansion as a way to improve service for its increasingly multinational business customers. ''We are forming strategic relationships with telephone service providers in other countries to insure that the services we offer in the states are available in Europe as well,'' said Eugene Sekulow, president of Nynex's international subsidiary.
In practice, Nynex's goals appear as varied as its services and locales. It has offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Geneva, Frankfurt, and London. Having acquired 50 percent of the Gibraltar Telephone Company, it plans to revamp the tiny British colony's antiquated system. Today, Gibraltar struggles along with a scratchy, distortion-prone network like the one the United States abandoned decades ago. Nynex intends to make the country a high-tech showplace, with fiber optics and other digital technologies, video teleconferencing and high-speed facsimile services. The company is convinced that Gibraltar, whose spot at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea is making it a growing center for international commerce and trade, will require vastly improved telecommunications.
In London, Nynex is a member of the Phonepoint consortium that introduced telepoint service in London this summer. Telepoint is known as ''the poor man's'' cellular telephone because of its low price and lack of ability to receive incoming calls. Useful only in concentrated areas, it allows subscribers to make calls within 100 meters of special antennas.
Among other Nynex ventures in Europe:
* An agreement with Scandinavian Telecommunications Services to supply business telephone features like high-speed data and facsimile transmission between Scandinavia and the United States.
* Consulting contracts to provide telephone network management for British Telecom and France Telecom.
* A deal to supply computer software to the British financial services industry.
* An effort, under negotiation, to improve on primitive telephone service in Poland and Hungary.
 

 
BELL SOUTH
 
Another ATlanta Multinational
 BellSouth seems bent on building an international network to rival the reach of its Atlanta neighbor, the Coca-Cola Company. BellSouth has more than 2,000 employees in other countries, with a variety of joint ventures and acquisitions. Most of these operations are in Europe and Latin America.
BellSouth's European interests include 4 percent of Compagnie Financier Pour Le Radio Telephone, or Cofira, a French company that won a contract last year to provide France with cellular telephone service. In Great Britain, BellSouth joined with Phillips N. V. and General Electric of Britain to compete for a license to provide personal communications services.
Beyond Europe, BellSouth owns 30 percent of Argentina's cellular phone system that went into service last month. In Australia, BellSouth is the majority owner of Link Telecommunications, the nation's largest private paging and telephone answering company. It is negotiating to provide cellular phone service, yellow pages, and telephone network operations and equipment in China, and it has a joint venture to supply India's public telephone company with computer software.
 

 
AMERITECH
 
Careful,Cautiousand Slow
 More than any other Baby Bell, American Information Technologies Inc., or Ameritech, has been cautious about venturing abroad. Gerald Mallik, president of Ameritech's business development unit, is much quicker to discuss the obstacles and risks than the opportunities. Most foreign telephone companies are government owned and subsidized, making them formidable competitors, he said. Many countries limit foreign ownership in telecommunications concerns or require partnerships with local firms - policies that limit the returns to foreign investors. ''Generally, there is a lot of money out there chasing a limited number of opportunities,'' Mr. Mallik said.
Mr. Mallik said Ameritech, based in Chicago, would rather concentrate on serving the Great Lakes region, with high returns but few rate increases, than spanning the globe. ''But this strategy should not lead one to believe that we have no interest in the international market. We are very interested, it's just that these activities are new to us and we need to develop skill and expertise in this area,'' Mr. Mallik said.
Most of the company's foreign investments have been only token ones. It joined Bell Atlantic and MAN A.G., a major West German industrial equipment firm, to compete for the West German cellular license. It has acquired small interests in a British voice messaging company and in a Japanese publishing concern owned by the Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Company.
 

 
SOUTHWESTERN BELL CORPORATION
 
Cable TV and Phones for Great Britain
 Southwestern Bell, based in St. Louis, has moved aggressively into the cable television market in Britain. The company has taken an equity stake in the Oyston Cable Communications Group, which is building two new cable systems, in the Liverpool and Preston areas of northwest England, to serve as many as 230,000 homes and businesses. Initially, the systems will offer data transmission services for businesses, bypassing local telephone networks. Longer term, the cable systems are expected to offer far more entertainment and telecommunications options, including banking, shopping, information services and video selection features that will have the effect of giving each viewer many of the choices of a video store.
Southwestern also has purchased an interest in an Israeli cable company, Golden Channels Ltd., that serves Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. ''We believe that cable television is a very natural fit with our expertise in network design, engineering, maintenance, service and billing,'' said Robert H. Glaser, Southwestern's senior vice president for strategic planning. ''An added plus is that there are no barriers to entry like in the United States, and we can offer both television and what we know best, telephone services.''
Southwestern Bell has also invaded the British market with its Freedom Phone division, a leading distributor of public pay phones, feature phones, and cordless phones manufacturered by several suppliers.
Southwestern, too, formed a consortium to bid on the West German cellular franchise. The company continues to hunt for other cellular and paging service opportunities abroad, as well as contracts for networks to process business transactions between suppliers and customers.
Southwestern Bell's domestic service area stretches from Arkansas through Texas and into Missouri.
 

 
BELL ATLANTIC
 
Going into the German Nations
 Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia and serving much of the Eastern seaboard, has targeted the affluent German-speaking markets - West Germany, Austria and Switzerland - with an array of high-tech products and services. .
The company opened an office in Dusseldorf, West Germany, in September to develop new businesses including telcommunications consulting, some innovative services that integrate computers and telephones, and computer software systems for telephone networks. In Munich, Bell Atlantic has a computer sales, leasing and maintenance company. It also bid for the West German cellular license as part of a consortium that included Ameritech.
In 1987, Bell Atlantic acquired the European divisions of Sorbus, a computer maintenance and data communications company, from Bell Canada International. Sorbus has operations in Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy.
Bell Atlantic also provides software systems for telephone companies in Italy and Spain and it is scouting out wireless telephone opportunities throughout Europe.
 

 
US WEST
 
U S West Becomes Europe East
 U S West, based in Denver, is leading the Bell companies into Eastern Europe. Just in the past week, U S West signed a deal with Hungary to build Eastern Europe's first cellular system. Then came word that U S West had agreed to lead seven foreign companies and a Soviet ministry in the laying of a fiber-optic cable across the Soviet Union. The 12,000-mile line - the longest fiber-optic cable in the world - would improve long-distance service in the Soviet Union and connect Europe with Japan. ''It would be the missing link in what is becoming a global fiber network,'' Reynie Ortiz, president of U S West International, said. Both projects require the approval of the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Strategic Exports, which limits the transfer of Western technology to the Eastern bloc. But the Bush Administration has considered trying to loosen some restrictions.
In Western Europe, U S West has invested heavily in cable television. The company has interests in seven cable television franchises in the Birmingham and South London areas of Great Britain, and owns part of Lyonnaise Communications, with cable networks in 13 areas of France, including Paris. U S West also is seeking to provide a personal communications network in Britain. In Asia, it belongs to a consortium that is building a cable network in Hong Kong.
Not every European project attracts U S West. It was the only regional Bell company that did not bid for the West German cellular franchise. Mr. Ortiz cited stiff competition and the high cost of preparing a bid. ''We are mainly interested in opportunities that show a lot of promise but have limited competition,'' he said. Analysts also mention U S West's disappointment last year at losing the French cellular contract to a consortium that included BellSouth.
U S West's network covers a large range - about 45 percent - of the mainland United States, from Washington east to Minnesota and south to New Mexico and Arizona. Analysts said the company's experience in stringing cable across frigid mountain ranges, barren deserts and vast plains helped clinch a deal in the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Light Is Trendy for China's Beer

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: QINGDAO, China

 BODY:
At the Qingdao Brewery, the vice director, Zhang Jianhua, held up a glass of Tsingtao beer and downed it with a smile.
''Americans have a misunderstanding that you get fat from beer,'' said the thin executive, back from a marketing trip to the United States. ''You can't get fat just from drinking beer. There is no fat in beer.'' 
He and two other scrawny colleagues say they are living proof that drinking a great deal of their comparatively heavy beer does not automatically bring an extra layer of flesh. Every evening the directors gather to taste the day's beer, and that usually means drinking at least two big bottles.
But for all the talk of beer not being fattening, the brewery, which has sold beer in the United States since 1973 and now supplies about 90 percent of the Chinese beer sold there, is hard at work on a new product - light beer.
Tsingtao's importer, the New York-based Monarch Import Company, says the lighter product probably will not be sold in the United States until late 1990 at the earliest, after it has been marketed in China and test-marketed in the United States. ''If you don't have a light beer, you forfeit a big chunk of potential business,'' said Michael J. Mazzoni, general manager of Monarch.
The move toward light beer seems to be a savvy one by one of the most savvy companies in China. Tsingtao has already redesigned its packaging and downsized its bottles to please the American market. Many of its top officials have traveled overseas, and at least one has studied beer-making in West Germany.
In the extraordinarily competitive imported beer market in the United States, it would be difficult, under the best of circumstances, for Tsingtao to significantly expand its sales. But the situation is complicated by obstacles facing Chinese manufacturers - a domestic credit crunch; a government that confiscates profits; a work force that is unused to international standards and often sees little incentive in diligence, and a relative lack of experience with foreign markets.
And, like other state enterprises in China, the brewery is struggling with an austerity program dictated by the central Government. China is now in the second year of a vigorously promoted three-year retrenchment, and a renewed emphasis on boosting exports makes American consumers a particularly important source of foreign exchange earnings for a company like Qingdao.
In addition, there is lingering international outrage at the repression of the democracy movement last June, although there is no formal boycott of Chinese products by American consumers.
The company does not admit to difficulties, however. Plant tours for visitors are confined to a sparklingly clean bottling production line set up with machinery imported from Germany, and extracting information is very difficult. It says only that its exports in general will show little growth this year.
Qingdao executives, like those at other Chinese companies, are unwilling to say much about anything. During a recent interview, officials sat sipping tea and beer and reciting statistics without notes, but they gave little hint of the company's aims or dilemmas.
The company says it has not been deprived of raw materials, although it admits it has had to pay higher prices. Executives say that sometimes their raw materials, like barley, are in short supply, and that they face stiff competition for the materials from collective and private enterprises that are sometimes willing to bid high prices. While they are granted a portion under quota at the low fixed price, they do not always get it, because the local or even national supply is short. This forces the brewery to buy raw materials at higher prices in the market or to use its precious foreign exchange on the international market.
Regardless of its export performance, companies like Qingdao are assuming greater prominence in China these days because the Government is trying to restructure the economy so that growth is driven by the state sector. For the last decade, China's economy has surged forward at an annual rate of about 10 percent, and in recent years, the greatest expansion has taken place in a sector composed of small and medium-sized collectives and even private enterprises, something that makes the Government uncomfortable.
The company voices support for the program, but it admits that the tightening of credit has created cash shortages. Loans, it says, have been ''limited'' - the company declined to say by how much - and payments for beer deliveries have slowed from local buyers also short of cash.
Nonetheless, the company expects to increase its pre-tax profits this year to the equivalent of $16.2 million, or about 22 percent more than the 1988 figure. The company also says it expects production to rise by only 3,000 tons this year, or less than 3 percent.
Since Qingdao is a state-run company, about half of its profits this year will be turned over to the state, a larger proportion than last year, leaving the company with the equivalent of $8.1 million, an increase of only 11 percent in after-tax profits over last year's figure. Typically, the better a company does, the larger the share confiscated by the state. As with most state enterprises, a large chunk of the brewery's profits is spent on bonuses for workers and other kinds of employee welfare, like housing.
Since the brewery's exports earn foreign exchange, most of which it turns over to the state for local money, it receives Government subsidies that sometimes come in the form of tax breaks. While Qingdao is extremely keen on exporting, its profit margin on exports is lower than on domestic sales because, it says, the market is so competitive and the costs are high.
The company exports about 60 percent of the beer it makes. The largest market is Hong Kong and Macao, followed by the United States with 10 percent of the company's overall production. Tsingtao beer is among the most visible Chinese consumer products sold there.
Imports of all Chinese beer to the United States this year through August have dropped 46 percent from 845,000 cases for the same period last year to 454,500 cases this year, according to statistics provided by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Volume for the month of July also dropped 77 percent over last year, while in May, the decrease was only 21 percent.
Monarch, Tsingtao's importer, says that high inventories and difficulties transporting the beer from China during the summer helped create the changes. It uses sales, rather than shipments of imports, to gauge Tsingtao's popularity. According to its statistics, sales of the beer in the United States have increased slightly from 1988 to an expected volume of 1.1 million cases in 1989.
In the United States, Chinese beer is sold mainly in Chinese restaurants of major cities, although it is distributed in many states. ''It's a curiosity beer that people might order because they're in a Chinese restaurant,'' said Allan Kaplan, a beverage industry analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''I don't think it's characterized as a high-quality brand beer that people must have because it's a fine beer.''

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEW IN CHEMICALS;
PRODUCTIVITY IS UP COMMODITIES RELIANCE, DOWN

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
In the late 1970's, chemical companies operated as though demand would never decline and prices would never stop rising. ''Everyone looked at the same tea leaves, predicted shortages and built at once,'' recalled William C. Kuhlke, vice president for polymers at Dewitt & Company, a Houston-based chemical industry consulting firm.
But when the bottom fell out of the world economy in the early 80's, demand slackened and a soaring dollar made exports even less attractive. The companies that had been selling everything they could process were suddenly not only selling as little as 65 percent of what they could make, but were forced to sell even that meager amount at prices that barely covered costs. 
The chemical industry learned a lesson - or so it seems. During the latest boom, plenty of new capacity has come on stream, but much of it was used to replace aging plants. ''Over the last several years, there's been greater growth in demand than in capacity,'' said William R. Young, a chemicals analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
But that could change. Several chemical companies both here and abroad have announced major new plants, which could lead to overcapacity in many commodities as early as 1992. In some products, like plastics, the industry is already selling all it makes. But in others, tight capacity is only temporary. For example, an explosion at a Phillips Petroleum Company plant in Texas in late October took off the market more than a billion pounds, or 19 percent of total industrywide capacity, of high-density polyethylene, which is used to make plastic bottles, stiff-plastic shopping bags and cable insulation.
But Phillips is expected to replace much of that capacity within six months, and several other companies have announced new plants. If prices continue to soften, those plants, along with several other commodity plants announced, may never be built.
Amoco, for one, has already postponed plans for a new olefins plant. ''There's been lots of talk about building more capacity for ethylene, polyethylene, ethylene oxide, and others, but you don't see many companies putting iron in the ground,'' said Mr. Zutty of Union Carbide.
Some of those plants may never have really been on the drawing boards. ''Often, companies will announce new plants as preemptive strikes to prevent others from building new capacity,'' said Patrick E. Baggett, an executive vice president of Chemical Market Associates Inc., a Houston consulting firm.
The companies most likely to build are those that need the output as raw materials themselves. For that reason, the Dow Chemical Company is almost certain to build new ethylene plants in Texas and in Canada. ''Even with the new plants, we will be net buyers of ethylene,'' said Enrique C. Falla, Dow's financial vice president.
And industry experts expect that the combination of new products and burgeoning global demand to quickly soak up any excess supply from other new plants. ''A simple thing like the conversion to plastic shopping bags or disposable diapers a few years ago made significant changes in demand that were hard to anticipate,'' Mr. Baggett said. ''This industry spends 5 percent of sales on research, so who knows what other products it will develop?'' Even so, the popularity of some of those products, like plastic shopping bags, can fade.
And who knows what countries will be the industry's major customers in the 90's? The United States will probably have a trade surplus in chemicals of close to $16 billion this year, and most economists expect the dollar to head downward again, helping exports even more.
Moreover, most American chemical companies have extensive manufacturing facilities overseas. ''Even if the U.S. goes into recession - and I don't think it will - the world economy is going to keep growing at about 3 percent a year,'' predicted Mr. Stuckey of DuPont. ''We're more concerned about whether this industry can meet the needs of the global economy than we are about temporary overcapacity.''

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: 1992 MEETS PERESTROIKA;
A New Europe Needs a New Currency

BYLINE: By FRANCOIS LAGRANGE; Francois LaGrange, an adviser to the the French Government, is vice chairman of Credit National in Paris.

 BODY:
The spectacular movement for democratization in Eastern Europe, with the highly symbolic collapse of the Berlin wall, will compel us as Europeans to seek a new order. German unification, a taboo subject until a few months ago, is becoming a realistic prospect. After Austria - a neutral country - it will soon be Hungary's turn to request associate status in the European Community.
The movement for democratization will not leave the Warsaw Pact unscathed. NATO will also have to evolve as the postwar Yalta order crumbles. A new European order is clearly on the agenda. 
In light of this, Europeans and people outside the region are asking if the goal of creating a single market, to be completed in 1992, will still be Europe's central program. The answer to this question must be a firm ''yes.'' In addition, the European Community must add to the single market program the economic and monetary union of its member countries. In this way, Europe will have the strength to deal with the rapid changes in the world.
It is commonly acknowledged that by launching the 1992 single-market project, Europe has gained new momentum. But however important this new momentum may be, the significance of the 1992 single market should not be overstated. That is because the individual countries of Europe remain autonomous and independent when it comes to control over economic and financial matters. The result is a conflict between growing economic integration on the one hand and fragmented political decision-making power on the other. This disparity between national and shared control cripples Europe's abilty to deal with the challenges of a globalizing world economy and a newly democratic Eastern Europe.
If Europe is firm in its goal of developing genuine economic and financial unity, it can only take place within the framework of a single currency. In the 19th century, the economic unification of Germany and of Italy was only realized after each of these countries created its own central bank. These central banks were then able to issue the German reichmark and the Italian lira, which were necessary in order to unify commerce within these countries. In the United States, the dollar is what made it a single market.
Today, with the purely national currencies circulating within the European Community member states, intra- and extra-Community trade is treated in an identical manner with respect to each country's trade balance and exchange accounts. Merchandise or services traded between Belgium and France - or France and Germany - have the same economic and financial significance as trade between France and Japan or the United States which are not community members. This means that trade still takes place in Europe as if the European Community did not exist. Every E.C. member country has to balance its accounts with the E.C. and the world.
This archaic and absurd situation handicaps all member countries and reduces their potential for economic growth. The United States does not have to take into account the balance of trade or different exchange rates between Texas and California or Michigan and Florida in its internal accounting. Europe should not have to either.
The advantages of a single European currency are clear: the disappearance of exchange operations between the economies of the 12 countries. Interest rates would be harmonized within the E.C. In addition, the European Currency Unit, the monetary unit of the single European market, would wield considerable economic weight and take its place alongside the dollar and the yen in managing the world monetary system.
Monetary integration would create a truly unified economic region, overseen by a European central bank system, somewhat analogous to the Federal Reserve. This would call for an economic union of closely coordinated budgetary, fiscal, monetary and even - to a certain degree - incomes policies.
Only a more integrated European Community - based upon a genuine economic and monetary union - will have the economic strength and united political perspective to welcome the democratizing Eastern European countries into its fold. Only an economically united Europe -leading possibly even to a confederation of European states - will have the strength to solve the problem of the reunification of Germany.
Since the days of the Marshall Plan, The United States has been a staunch supporter of the idea of a single, united Europe. The United States should continue to pursue this goal. A strong, united Europe will be a reliable partner for the United States in the quest for a new world order - an order in which both NATO and the Warsaw Pact undergo dramatic change.

HEADLINE: Perestroika Ole

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Nathan P. Gardels fails to support his assertion that Mexico's reform program amounts to selling off the ''national patrimony'' (''Perestroika Goes South,'' Nov. 12). Unfortunately, the move toward privatization is not nearly as extensive as he depicts it.
Mr. Gardels boasts that the number of state-owned enterprises have been reduced by 75 percent without noting that the reduction represents only 10 to 15 percent of the value of the state's assets, according to a study by the Mexican Treasury. 
Mr. Gardels marvels that only the railroads, electric power plants and extraction and trade of oil and uranium remain as the core of nationalization. But these industries - along with nationalized banking, telecommunications, basic petrochemicals and fertilizers, which he omitted - happen to represent the very infrastructure of the Mexican economy.
These industries are defined as ''strategic'' by the Mexican Constitution, and their privatization is strictly prohibited. President Salinas de Gortari himself has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of privatizing them. Yet unless they are privatized, it will be impossible for Mr. Salinas to establish the free-market economy he claims is his objective.
Unfortunately, without a political mandate, he has only nibbled at the state sector, reassuring the labor unions and other traditional constituents that he has given nothing away to the hated burguesia.
The limitations of Mr. Salinas's reform program, just like those of perestroika to which Mr. Gardels compares it, are nowhere more evident than in its failure to mitigate the acute misery in which the vast majority of Mexicans have lived since 1982.
Clearly, Mr. Salinas must privatize at least some of the money-losing, inefficient ''strategic'' industries, if he is to energize economic growth and satisfy pent-up consumer demand. And he must do so rapidly. In July 1991 elections will be held for a new Congress. This could turn into a plebiscite against the Salinas administration if he has not improved somewhat the lives of his 85 million fellow citizens.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
To Rescue the Thrift Rescue Plan

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOUR months ago, Congress swallowed hard and approved the largest Federal bailout on record, the rescue plan for the savings and loan industry that will spend $159 billion over the next decade. But already financial experts are warning that lawmakers are not finished with the problems of the industry.
They argue that the bailout legislation is seriously flawed. Basic causes of the thrift crisis were never addressed. The process of selling off sick S.& L.'s and their inventories of junk property is proceeding at a disturbingly slow pace. The reconfigured regulatory system is in disarray, and by 1991 Congress will have to put up even more taxpayer money. 
But even more unsettling, perhaps, are the questions being raised about whether the Government is actually capable of addressing the problems of the nation's financial system.
''It's amazing how quickly the problems with thrift bailout are becoming evident, and the magnitude at which they are growing,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria, Va. ''I think it shows that the political process just cannot do a good job in dealing with financial risk.''
Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, said Congress had constructed ''a Rube Goldberg device which is proving to be very, very difficult to get off the ground.''
The events of the last week offered little encouragement. The nation's top regulator of savings institutions, M. Danny Wall, who had been assured of his position through the middle of 1991, tendered his resignation as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. He said Congress had tried to make him a scapegoat for the industry's troubles and warned that it was demoralizing his agency.
The higher capital requirements created under the rescue plan took effect on Thursday amid predictions by financial experts that more than half of the nation's savings associations would disappear over the next few years.
And top banking regulators announced that the industry posted a $744 million deficit for the third quarter, primarily from losses on third-world loans and soft real estate markets in the Northeast and Arizona.
The core of the industry's problem was the intersection of the Reagan deregulatory environment and the resulting go-go banking environment, budget restraints that cut the regulatory staff and a willingness on the part of some members of Congress to yield to the demands of S.& L. executives. While the debate is still open as to whether reregulation or further deregulation is needed, those on both sides agree that it is essential to have enough examiners to enforce the existing rules.
What seems to bother analysts most is that while the bailout law established a mechanism that is meant to insure that a problem of similar proportions never happens again, the very structure may have the germ of another collapse.
First, they note that the legislation did nothing to revamp the nation's deposit insurance system, perhaps the primary cause of the savings crisis. The Government insures almost all deposits, especially at very large institutions, and this has enabled aggressive savings executives to take tremendous risks with depositors' money at Government expense. It has also meant that depositors have had to think very little about the soundness of the institution holding their deposits, thus imposing no private-sector discipline on the banking and thrift industries.
Some believe that the maximum deposit insurance has to be cut back from the current $100,000 level. Others, such as Mr. Ely, believe that the private sector has to assume more of the insurance risk. But the savings bailout bill did nothing, except to mandate a Treasury Department study which is due to be finished in 1991.
A second core issue is the existence of the savings and loan industry as a separate business, regulated by a separate agency. Many experts argue that the days of making money on 30-year mortgages is long past, that the traditional S.& L. is a dinosaur and that prolonging the industry's existence will only lead to higher failure costs.
Instead, the institutions that will prosper in the future will be modeled more after commercial banks and thus should be regulated by banking regulators.
Some argue that Mr. Wall's departure might hasten that process. Morale at the thrift office is said to be at an all-time low, particularly since the legislation removed several key areas of responsibility. And when the Congress looks at the need for more funds, probably in 1991, it might be willing to consider merging the two industries and their regulators.
''People have asked me whether now that Danny has gone will his successor be able to resuscitate the thrift industry,'' said Robert E. Litan, a banking expert at the Brookings Institution. ''I tell them that even if Paul Volcker were put in Danny's place it is not going to revive the industry.''
''Danny's successor should realize that it is his job to phase out this industry and this agency,'' Mr. Litan added.
But there are other problems with the legislation. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was given vast new responsibilities by the bailout legislation, including running the deposit insurance fund for the thrift industry and managing the day-to-day business of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency chartered to spend $50 billion to find buyers for dying savings institutions.
But some members of Congress are warning that the F.D.I.C.'s staff is now taxed beyond its limits, having placed some of its ablest staff members at the new agency. The concern is that an overburdened F.D.I.C. could lapse in its role as regulator of thousands of state-chartered banks.
Moreover, the political dynamics of the F.D.I.C. have changed. Until the bill was signed by President Bush on Aug. 9, the F.D.I.C. was almost entirely independent of the Executive branch, reporting only to Congress. But as manager of the resolution corporation, it now has to answer to the Treasury Department. This has prompted speculation that the agency's chairman, L. William Seidman, might be preparing to leave, rather than chafe under directions from Treasury.
''At Christmas cocktail parties in Washington, the conversation is that Bill has made the decision to leave,'' said Mr. Guenther of the Independent Bankers. ''This is the guy who we can afford to lose least. Seidman's departure would take a very wise head out of play at a very crucial time.''
Finally, analysts warn that the shortage of funds at the R.T.C., as well as a fear by Government bureaucrats of being criticized for making sweetheart deals, will mean that major sales of large insolvent institutions are not going to take place anytime soon, probably no sooner than the middle of next year.
''That means that from the time Washington recognized it had a problem early this year until results, you will have an 18-month hiatus,'' said R. Dan Brumbaugh, a senior fellow at Stanford's Center for Economic Policy Research. ''That is just too slow. And it's an indication that the Government just should not be in this type of business.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
For Aquino, Rescue Comes With Price Tags

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
AS they marched out of Manila's high-rise business district Thursday morning, recoilless rifles on their shoulders and bandoleers still strapped across their chests, the troops who had nearly toppled the Philippine Government were smiling and singing. Seeing the cameras, a few held their hands in the shape of a ''T,'' imitating referees calling a brief time-out in a closely contested game.
''As long as the cause is still there, it's not all over,'' said Capt. Danilo Lim, one of the many West Point graduates who led the biggest and most violent coup attempt yet against the nearly four-year-old Government of President Corazon C. Aquino. ''Look at this,'' Captain Lim demanded. ''Does this look like a surrender?'' 
In fact, it looked more like a reunion of old military classmates, which it was. Despite Mrs. Aquino's declarations of victory, it was not only impossible to judge winners from losers in the latest coup effort, in which 79 people died and more than 500 were wounded; it was also hard to tell which side some of the Government's leaders supported. By the weekend, Mrs. Aquino had linked the Philippines' Vice President, its chief opposition leader and an associate of the late Ferdinand E. Marcos to the attempt, and many of the military officers involved had disappeared into the hills and luxury homes around Manila.
No one believes that the few who were arrested will be harshly punished, largely because the Government fears alienating loyal military leaders who sympathize with the rebels' complaints, if not their tactics. Even Mrs. Aquino's closest aides said the Government was so weakened by the coup effort that another seems inevitable.
If anyone doubted that Mrs. Aquino was losing her grip on the ''people power'' revolution that ousted Mr. Marcos in February 1986, the events of the last 10 days proved it. By most accounts, without American air support at a critical moment, Mrs. Aquino's experiment in democracy probably would have ended. But that help vastly complicated the uneasy politics of the Philippines and did little to address the underlying sources of Mrs. Aquino's troubles: garbage that goes uncollected, telephones that don't work, rampant corruption and an economy that makes foreign investors nervous. The prospect of renewed instability makes all of those problems worse, as the rebels well know.
Most striking, perhaps, is how many Filipinos are now unconvinced that democracy is the answer to the country's crushing problems. When the rebels mounted their siege, no one rushed from their houses to rally support for Mrs. Aquino, whose popularity has been dropping steadily.
The quickest to sense this turn in opinion are the elite young officers of the Reform Armed Forces Movement, known as the ''R.A.M. boys'' and led by Col. Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan, a fugitive who led the 1978 coup attempt and is believed to have helped direct this one. The rebel officers view Mrs. Aquino as weak and indecisive - a widely shared view, even among many diplomats - though they have yet to articulate a clear ideology or alternative path. Most important, the officers see themselves as the best alternative power broker for the country.
In a rally of tens of thousands of supporters on Friday, Mrs. Aquino suggested that Vice President Salvador Laurel, who split from her camp several years ago, and Juan Ponce Enrile, a Marcos-era defense minister who also fell out with her, were among those egging the coup along, presumably to speed their own paths to the presidency. They issued murky denials.
 
One Reliable Weapon
Mrs. Aquino's fiery speech was intended to show that she too could fight. But in the midst of the coup attempt, she revealed that she had only one reliable weapon: the support of the United States, which used F-4 jets to put a ''cap'' on an air base captured by the rebels, who had already bombed Malacanang Palace while Mrs. Aquino was inside. The F-4's turned the tide without firing a shot. Even before the rebellion was put down, however, Mrs. Aquino began paying a price for this assistance, which only stoked the arguments of nationalists who say the root of most of the Philippines' economic and social troubles is overdependence on the United States. Mrs. Aquino has been fighting calls to kick out the American military bases here, and exploratory talks on renegotiating the leases were to begin this month. Now she is often cast as an American puppet, hardly in a position to drive a hard bargain with the Bush Administration.
The coup was also disastrously timed for the economy. Vital Christmas tourism is expected to suffer badly - and that at a time when foreign investors had only recently begun venturing back into the Philippines, convinced that the political scene was stabilizing and that the economy could keep growing at 6 or 7 percent a year.
Mrs. Aquino can no longer blame only the legacy of Mr. Marcos for the country's economic woes; he is dead and it is four years since he was in power. The R.A.M. movement - like the Communists and other anti-Manila factions - is betting she will fail to get Filipinos to focus on rebuilding the economy, and there are rumors that their next strategy is to systematically undermine economic life here. ''We have maybe a year or so to get it together,'' said one of her confidants. ''Or next time we won't be so lucky.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
At the Malta Meeting, West Met West, Too

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR President Bush, the summit meeting last weekend in Malta was not only a time to begin forging a new relationship with the East. It was also an opportunity for more clearly establishing Washington's role within the Western alliance.
During his meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev aboard the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky, Mr. Bush strived to assume the aura of global leadership that his critics have said is lacking. But he was careful not to appear to be dictating solutions to the Western allies. Indeed, the first thing Mr. Bush did when he got home on Monday was to call Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
It was after midnight in London, but Mr. Bush wanted to dispute reports in the European press that he had taken sides against Mrs. Thatcher in a debate over how fast European economic integration should proceed. Those reports were wrong, Mr. Bush said, and rumors of the demise of the ''special relationship'' were greatly exaggerated.
This week Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will go to Bonn and Brussels to discuss a NATO consensus on the question of German reunification. At the last minute he added London to his itinerary to try to ease Mrs. Thatcher's anxieties.
Mr. Bush also had to worry about how the summit meeting played back home. The Administration was criticized by conservatives who believe Mr. Bush gave more than he got at Malta. But Administration officials said they came away with just what they wanted from Mr. Gorbachev on Eastern Europe, arms control and the superpower relationship. Mr. Gorbachev assured Mr. Bush not only that he will not interfere in Eastern Europe, the officials said, but that he was actively encouraging the changes and happy with their pace so far. They said Mr. Gorbachev also indicated that he would not try to push the arms control agenda faster than the United States wants it to go. The only sour note, Administration officials said, was on regional conflicts like Central America. But even there, the tone was more conciliatory than in the past.
American officials said they had expected Mr. Gorbachev to express support for Eastern European reform. But, said one, ''It is one thing to sense it and quite another to hear it while you're looking the man in the eye.''
 
A Troublesome Proposal
Administration officials said they were astonished to see how much Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev agreed on Eastern Europe. They parted company when Mr. Bush expressed support for the eventual unification of the Germanys and Mr. Gorbachev did not. But there was not much anxiety over that point since the United States does not seem to want to accelerate the process anyway.
On arms control, Mr. Gorbachev made one proposal troublesome to the Americans, suggesting a ban on naval nuclear weapons. But he agreed to try to sign a treaty on strategic nuclear weapons next year. For his conservative audience at home, Mr. Bush noted that Mr. Gorbachev never challenged the ''Star Wars'' program.
The summit talks provided a fascinating glimpse into the superpower relationship at a time when the two countries' interests seem to intersect more and they can no longer count on dominating their alliances. American officials said they saw an improved economic relationship with the Soviet Union as serving two purposes: to demonstrate to Western Europe that Washington is doing its part to encourage change and to give Washington a toehold in the newly evolving arrangements between East and West.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Even in California, Finally, Real Estate Is Not Hot

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
CALIFORNIANS are begining to learn what Texans did five years ago and New Yorkers more recently: that what goes up in real estate may also come down.
Having sizzled long after the rest of the country had slowed, the California housing market has finally begun to cool off. The median selling price of existing homes was 3 percent lower in October than in September, according to the California Association of Realtors, and the pace of sales dropped, too, by 15 percent from last year. Experts cited the perception of over-inflated prices, cuts in defense spending and the recent severe earthquake as factors. 
But another development, or broad series of interrelated technological and economic developments, is also at play, some experts believe. Though most experts believe that local factors are still the main determinant in prices, some say the country's real estate market may be undergoing a fundamental change as new technology, expanding communications systems and ease of travel change the way the nation does business, adding to the housing price equation a new element that works to equalize market forces across the country.
More and more companies that have no real business reason to stay in a particular place are making a business decision to move to places where housing for their employees - or the employees they hope to attract - is more affordable.
David G. Shulman, director of real estate research for Salomon Brothers in New York, argues that the emergence of fiber optics, satellite communications, facsimile machines and airline hub-and-spoke systems has created a ''truly global village'' in which skilled employees ''can locate almost anywhere as long as they are 'plugged in.' ''
But others contend that such technology affects only a small portion of the economy. ''A fax machine doesn't replace a waterway,'' said Stan Ross, co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Company, Los Angeles-based accountants. ''You cannot replace fertile land with a telecommunications screen or direct contact in certain financial services with a computer message.''
As for California, experts are divided over whether the state is facing a lingering weakness in real estate values, as in New York and the Northeast, or just a small ''correction'' in a overheated market. But it appears for the moment at least that the nation is moving toward a kind of equilibrium in housing as the torrid markets on both coasts settle down and the long-depressed Midwest, particularly Texas, finally begins to pick up as companies see the virtues of cheap residential real estate.
''There is a relationship between what's happening in the East and the West,'' said Glenn E. Crellin, vice president for economics and research at the National Association of Realtors. ''Prices had simply gone up too rapidly for most people to buy. They're both going through some stabilization now. By contrast, the Midwest has become the most affordable region in the country.''
Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Economics at the University of California-Berkeley, discerns ''no relation at all'' between regional real estate markets. Housing in New York deflated by an unrealistic boom on Wall Street, he said, while the California market is more solid, with a diverse economy buoyed in part by large infusions of money from Asia.
Nevertheless, some experts see a diffusion of the population, driven by high housing prices. In California, for example, companies are not leaving the state so much as moving to its less expensive areas, said Christopher B. Leinberger, who owns the real estate consulting firm of Robert Charles Lesser & Co. He calls these places, like Ontario and Valencia in the outer orbit of Los Angeles, ''compromise locations.'' To the north, Sacramento, 80 miles east of San Francisco and with a median house 50 percent lower, is fast becoming an extension of the San Francisco area.
''In the labor-short 90's, where quality-of-life considerations and gaining access to workers will become increasingly important to corporate relocations, cities that offer both high quality of life and low housing prices are going to come out better,'' said Mr. Leinberger.
While bad news for sellers, the recent softening of the residential markets in New York, Boston and California is good news to industries that have been having trouble persuading skilled workers to relocate to those areas. Though West Coast prices had come down slightly of late, the California realtors group calculates that in October only 19 percent of Californians could afford the median priced home in the state at $194,000, compared to 47 percent of Americans generally in their home states.
Though the recent weakening has improved ''affordability,'' many business people say the high cost of living, along with the cost of complying with increasingly stringent environmental controls, is undermining the state's competitive position.
Robert Jackson, a planner for the McDonnell Douglas Corp., which does most of its commercial airliner production in Long Beach, Calif., said at a recent conference that his company faced a shortage of skilled labor, at least in part because the median house price in Los Angeles was 88 percent higher than in Seattle, home of McDonnell Douglas's chief competitor, Boeing. ''We have no intention of leaving,'' he said. ''But it's getting very tough.''

Holding Out

 BODY:
Socialism may be fraying at the seams, and glasnost, perestroika and compromise may be the words of the hour elsewhere, but Fidel Castro remains a purist. In a speech last week in Havana, Mr. Castro, who has been in power in Cuba for more than 30 years, expressed both a fierce support of socialism and an unease at being one of the few who do. ''If destiny assigns us the role of one day being among the last defenders of socialism in a world in which the Yankee empire has succeeded in embodying Hitler's dream of world domination, we will know how to defend this bulwark to the last drop of blood,'' he said. Mr Castro complained of the difficulty of building Communist states when others are tearing them down, and noted the possible consequences of a warming between the United States and the Soviet Union, which sends him so much support. ''From the crisis that has emerged in the socialist camp, we can only expect negative economic consequences for our country,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Taxi Industry Wins Again

 BODY:
In one respect, New York City's latest cab fare increase may be a blessing in disguise. It doesn't do riders any good, but it might remind Mayor-elect David Dinkins that if he means to serve the public, he has to fight the taxi cartel.
Mayor Edward Koch has tried repeatedly to weaken the city's industry monopoly. He came up with ways to increase the number of medallions -the artificially scarce, highly valuable licenses that breed inefficiency and corruption. But even that modest attempt died aborning. The city still has 11,787 medallion taxis licensed to pick up passengers - the same number allowed in 1937. 
A few other things are the same, or worse. It's still close to impossible to find a yellow cab outside of Manhattan below 96th Street. It's still a chore to get a cab in midtown during rush hour because there just aren't enough of them. It's still standard for cab drivers to bypass blacks.
It's also still standard for cabs to be in deplorable condition. A new inspection system may eventually change that, but right now, cab after cab is filthy, uncomfortable, even unsafe. Not enough have air-conditioning in summer; there's too little space between the back seat and the barrier, and that is often a collage of curling yellow stickers.
Good taxi service is impeded further by economics: the owners lease their taxis at such high costs that it's hard for drivers to make a decent living and almost impossible to attract skilled drivers. The Taxi Commission will soon start a better instruction course; still, many drivers, often struggling immigrants, don't know the city or the language.
The new fare increase will clearly hurt people who are forced to use cabs, especially the handicapped and the infirm elderly. The Taxi Commission insists the rise reflects true cost increases, but medallions still sell for $134,000 each, so the right to be in the taxi business is obviously worth a sizable investment, even at current fares.
The real problem, one that tinkering with fares can't touch, is the system of regulation. Protected from greater competition, taxi owners have a powerful incentive to resist providing better service and to push for ever-higher fares.
If Mr. Dinkins hopes to reform the industry, the goal must be to eliminate medallions altogether and let anyone who meets qualifications go into the taxi business. Those qualifications should include rigorous safety inspections and requirements for courtesy and non-discrimination - standards that should also extend to gypsy cabs and car services, which play an essential role in the boroughs but are largely unregulated.
Unless the Dinkins administration is willing to propound, and fight for, these thorough changes, it cannot claim to be interested in reform, only in submission to the industry. Once again, the public will pay more - and get less.

HEADLINE: Moscow Also Reconstructs Its Defense Thinking

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Is Moscow Cutting Its Military? Yes, by Necessity'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 17), Barry M. Blechman rightly points out that reductions in Soviet military forces diminish the threat posed to the West. But his failure to situate these cuts in a larger political framework of Soviet ''new thinking'' in foreign affairs yields an unimaginative and flawed policy prescription - to avoid reciprocal unilateral reductions.
Few analysts would dispute that economic imperatives are a prime motivating force behind Mikhail Gorbachev's initiatives. The burden of excessive military spending has already taken a tremendous toll on Soviet society and threatens to render the country a second-rate power. 
But to view Soviet actions solely as a response to economic hardship is to trivialize a fundamental shift in Moscow's conception of security manifested most vividly by abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine and strategic retreat from Eastern Europe. Moreover, the Soviet Union's unprecedented admission that its invasion of Afghanistan constituted a violation of international norms together with its constructive efforts to resolve regional conflicts cannot be plausibly explained by ''economic necessity.''
Having commenced the process of reconfiguring their forces toward less offensive postures, the Soviets have scored a conceptual breakthrough. Mr. Gorbachev understands security can be achieved only in tandem with the West. The present regime gives every indication it has learned the right lessons from history: menacing forces designed to deter aggression invite countervailing buildups that undermine security. Deterrence without reassurance is self-defeating.
The United States can and must respond with some new thinking of its own. There is a growing consensus that America's military-biased conception of security no longer corresponds to reality. Rather than just applaud Mr. Gorbachev for shifting resources from military to civilian uses, we should be implementing our own blueprint for unilateral force reductions. Not only will this strengthen the political position of detente-minded segments of the Soviet hierarchy; these savings might also be dedicated to restoring American economic competitiveness or improving our country's education system. United States security interests would be advanced on both fronts.

HEADLINE: Peace Without The Khmer Rouge?

BYLINE: By Winston Lord; Winston Lord was Ambassador to China from November 1985 until April.

 BODY:
For years, policy makers have faced an excruciating dilemma in Cambodia: How to forestall both the return of the Khmer Rouge and the acceptance of Vietnamese aggression. Now that Vietnam has largely withdrawn from Cambodia, the decibel level of the debate has risen sharply, reflecting legitimate fears that the murderous Khmer Rouge might re-enact the killing fields.
There is no worse outcome. But such fears, orchestrated by Hanoi, drive some Americans to conclude that we should acquiesce in the reign of the Heng Samrin-Hun Sen regime. This is better than rule by the Khmer Rouge - but the worst of the alternatives. Here's why. 
First, the regime leaders, including Heng Samrin and Hun Sen, are ex-Khmer Rouge members with Cambodian blood on their hands. They threw in their lot with Vietnam, not out of moral compunction but to escape Pol Pot's executioners. Second, the regime was created and propped up by Hanoi and still gets large-scale Vietnamese and Soviet support. It has shown no meaningful signs of independence. Must we condone Vietnam's invasion by conceding its hegemony in Indochina?
Third, the Association of South East Asian Nations, whose security is most at stake, opposes a Cambodia run from Hanoi and presses for a neutral, independent nation led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Why do stout supporters of the U.N. blithely dismiss 128 countries that have just voted, by the largest majority ever, to reject the regime in Phnom Penh?
Finally, the fiercely nationalistic Cambodians, despite their hatred of the Khmer Rouge, have resisted Vietnamese colonization for a decade. Given a choice, they would surely choose a Sihanouk-led government. If, however, they selected Hun Sen, it is better that he win by vote than by international fiat. When we favor elections, often under difficult conditions, in Central America, Eastern Europe and around the globe, why the double standard for Cambodia?
Before rushing to yield Cambodia to Vietnam's control, let us consider the other options. One is the current policy of the U.S., the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China and the international community.
It would allow the Cambodians to determine their own future through internationally supervised elections. This requires a transitional government led by Prince Sihanouk and including the forces of Hun Sen, the non-Communists and, unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge. They have powerful military forces that will not go gently into the night. Banned from any participation in a political settlement they will, with China's aid, prolong the civil war.
How can the Khmer Rouge then be shackled? Various measures toward this end have been put forward and have been endorsed by China - and even the Khmer Rouge.
Prince Sihanouk would head the coalition. The Khmer Rouge would be included; Pol Pot and others of his ilk would be excluded. All armed Cambodians, including the Khmer Rouge, would be regrouped in bases and disarmed; the cease-fire, segregation and disarming would be policed by a strong U.N. peacekeeping force. There would be free elections with international supervision; all factions would abide by the outcome.
We must assume the Khmer Rouge would grasp for power. And in coalions of bitter enemies, the thugs usually prevail. But the Khmer Rouge might be contained by cessation of Chinese aid, cooperation among the other three Cambodian factions and a large, effective international force.
Prince Sihanouk, who lost 15 family members to Khmer Rouge terror, subscribes to this scenario.
The issue of Chinese aid is central; without it the Khmer Rouge would be severely weakened. The U.S. has worked successfully to modify China's overall stance. Beijing has moved from solely supporting the Khmer Rouge, to backing the resistance coalition, to stipulating Prince Sihanouk as the genuine leader, to proposing specific commitments for controlling the Khmer Rouge.
I believe Beijing would agree to end its aid and constrain the Khmer Rouge as part of an overall settlement for a Sihanouk government.
Another approach is for the Sihanouk and non-Communist forces to dump the Khmer Rouge and join in a temporary alliance with the regime in Phnom Penh to organize the elections. The international community would have to insist that Prince Sihanouk be the real head, not the figurehead that Hun Sen and his backers demand. All parties would have to commit themselves to fair elections.
The incentives for the Phnom Penh authorities would be to gain international backing and to isolate the Khmer Rouge. Hanoi and Moscow might agree to a genuinely neutral Cambodian government to stave off a Khmer Rouge victory.
But this approach means continued fighting by Khmer Rouge, making countrywide elections very difficult. It would be hard to persuade China to halt its support for them, though we would point to the prospect of a Sihanouk government as a buffer against Vietnam, and Beijing may now be leaning toward limited rapprochement with Hanoi. We face these same problems, however, if we turn over Cambodia to Hun Sen - with all the additional drawbacks already cited.
Yet another alternative is Australia's suggestion for a U.N. trusteeship to replace the government and organize the elections. Prince Sihanouk apparently supports this general idea as a fallback.
This approach appeals in principle because it would dismantle the Hun Sen regime, serve as a further check on the Khmer Rouge and insure independent neutral administration of the elections. But it would be very complex to implement, and the Phnom Penh regime and Khmer Rouge are likely to oppose it.
Clearly any path is treacherous because the Khmer Rouge are treacherous. Reasonable people can disagree on the best route; no one should claim a monopoly on wisdom or morality.
But isn't it better to seek one of these three internationally supervised settlements and bridle the Khmer Rouge than to back one Communist faction against the other in an ongoing civil war? Isn't it better to strive for Cambodian self-determination, independence and neutrality than to impose a proxy government, reward aggression and fuel Vietnamese expansionism?

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Honolulu

BYLINE: By THOMAS KASER; THOMAS KASER is a staff writer for The Honolulu Advertiser.

 BODY:
Honolulu is an easy place to know and love if you give it half a chance. Some promoters call it a paradise, but it isn't. It is a city - commercial, expensive, noisy and tacky. It has traffic, drugs and street people. It also has abundant natural and manmade beauty, exceptional weather, exotic foods, friendly people, low unemployment, virtually no heavy industry.
Thirty years into Hawaii's statehood, Honolulu is still trying to shake its insular persona and become a cosmopolitan city. One reason the transition hasn't been easy is Hawaii's ethnic diversity. Everybody is a minority. In 1986 the state was 23 percent Caucasian, 23 percent Japanese, 20 percent part-Hawaiian, 11 percent Filipino and 23 percent everybody else. For better and for worse, everybody has a say. Public business tends to operate - excruciatingly - on a consensus basis, with its attendant slowness.
Honolulu has gone through two building booms since statehood and is currently in a third. Construction is also under way beyond the city limits. In the sugar cane fields west of Pearl Harbor, the state is promoting the development of housing, commercial centers, industrial parks and hotels. But tourism, not construction, continues to be the engine that drives Hawaii's economy. Record numbers of visitors have come almost every year since statehood. This year's projected total of 6.5 million - about 20 percent Japanese - should set another record. 
From December to March Waikiki beach is generally as crowded as midsummer. To get away from the crowds go to Diamond Head Beach, where walkways lead to the shore from lookouts near the Diamond Head Lighthouse, or a little farther out to Kahala Beach beyond Diamond Head. Winter is also the time of the big surf on the North Shore, especially near Sunset Beach.

HEADLINE: CARTER REDUX

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING; Wayne King, a Times reporter, was chief of The Times's Atlanta bureau during the Carter Administration.

 BODY:
When Jimmy Carter returned to his home in Plains, Ga., in 1981, after losing the Presidency, he was an all-but-shattered man. He was pilloried as the author of America's malaise and the architect of its economic stagnation, and humiliated as the remaining 52 American hostages in Iran were released the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office - after Carter's own rescue effort had died ignominiously in a remote desert in Iran. His personal finances were devastated: The thriving peanut warehouse he left in a blind trust when he went to the White House was $1 million in debt; he stood to lose his farms and perhaps even his house. What he had to look forward to after the Presidency, Jimmy Carter himself conceded, was a ''potentially empty life.''
But late one night, sitting bolt upright in bed, he said, ''Conflict resolution.'' And he told his wife, Rosalynn: ''I know what we can do with the Carter Center. We can have a place where people can go to resolve conflict.''
''I thought at first he must be sick,'' recalls Rosalynn Carter with some amusement. ''I've never seen him awake at night, even in the White House.'' 
The famous grin - wolfish or puckish, depending on one's view - is still there. So is the glacial temper, except these days it is aimed not at aides or the press. It was in full display last spring in Panama when he found that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, after allowing a free election in which his hand-picked candidate lost, decided to steal it back with phony tabulation sheets.
Furious, the former President stormed into the tabulation center, shoved several people aside, clambered onto the stage and thundered at the dozen distinguished Panamanians in the act of certifying the deceit: ''Son ustedes honestos, o ladrones?'' ''Que, que, que, senor?'' some responded, and Carter shouted again, ''Are you honest people, or thieves?''
It was Jimmy Carter at his Old Testament best. At a hurried news conference, he denounced the election as ''totally fraudulent.''
Several months later, in September, he was mediating peace talks between the Marxist-Leninist Government of Ethiopia and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, another Marxist group, which has been fighting for independence from Ethiopia since 1961. For the first time in 28 years, representatives of the combatants were meeting without conditions.
Then Carter was off to Nicaragua, at the invitation of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, to lay down ground rules for elections there next February. Carter also persuaded Ortega to allow 30,000 Miskito Indians, who had been living in Honduras and fighting the Sandinista Government since 1981, to return to their homeland in Nicaragua along with their exiled leader, Brooklyn Rivera.
It was also largely through Carter's intervention that President Mohammed Siad Barre of Somalia granted clemency in the fall of 1988 to eight political prisoners he had summarily sentenced to death. And it was also Jimmy Carter who, in conjunction with the International Committee of the Red Cross, implored President Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia in August 1988 to free 220 Somalian prisoners of war who had been incarcerated for 10 years. Within a month, all 220 were free.
Suddenly, after nearly a decade in the political wilderness, Carter was back and seemingly everywhere, running a kind of shadow State Department - with the advice, consent and even encouragement of the Bush White House.
If he was the wrong man for the time when he became President in 1976, Jimmy Carter seems the perfect man for the diplomat-without-portfolio post. Nowadays, the President who made human rights a legitimate foreign-policy concern is devoting more and more of his time and attention to ending internal conflicts that in the last few decades have killed, maimed and dislocated millions of people.
His insistence on operating from a higher moral ground, which most Americans took as self-righteousness when he was President, works in his favor when opposing combatants in a civil war have no one else to trust. His singlemindedness - exemplified in his attempt to resolve the hostage situation in Iran, which Americans viewed as a hapless obsession and yet another indication of how nothing seemed to work at the Carter White House - is useful when longtime and obdurant foes refuse to budge from their respective positions.
Today, there are about two dozen continuing civil wars or insurrections, each killing more than a thousand people a year, and Carter says he is better able to deal with such conflicts now than when he was President. (The United Nations Charter has no provision for intervention ''in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state,'' and the world body can intervene only if requested to do so by the government concerned or if it is given a mandate from the General Assembly or Security Council. Under these conditions, it is trying to broker peace agreements in Afghanistan, El Salvador and Nicaragua.) As a former President, Carter has considerable clout, but - with no official status in international affairs - he is not constrained by Administration foreign policy. ''I never profess to speak for my country,'' he says, seated in the living room of his home in Plains, ''although I always keep the State Department and the White House informed, and almost invariably I have their full support - certainly that has been the case since George Bush has been in office.'' That, he adds, was not always so: ''Quite often, my image and goals would be in conflict with those of President Reagan, and I didn't get any support from his ambassadors. In fact, sometimes they would deliberately put impediments in my way.'' In 1983, for example, he informed the State Department that he planned, as a private citizen, to visit Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Mexico. ''They objected strongly to my going at all,'' he says, ''saying there were security threats to my life, that the Governments would be embarrassed, and so forth.'' He went anyway. ''In Costa Rica, when I finally arrived there - I met with the contras in Costa Rica before going to Nicaragua - I found that the Ambassador had canceled all my appointments, all the appointments we had laboriously made, unbeknownst to me.''
And when he arrived in Peru, on his way to Argentina, ''I was informed by the American Embassy in Argentina that massive demonstrations were planned against me, that [President Raul] Alfonsin and his Foreign Minister had requested I not come. I checked with the Peruvian Ambassador, who said the report was incorrect. I flew from Peru to Buenos Aires and I found all those reports made to me by the American Embassy were totally false. Alfonsin and the Foreign Minister were eager and delighted that I came. We would go out in the street and crowds of people would gather around and clap and shake my hand. This was a difficult time for me to implement the policies of the Carter Center.''
The accommodation with the Bush White House derives in part from a thaw in the ideological chill that permeated the Reagan years, but also from a more pragmatic approach to world affairs under George Bush. Jimmy Carter is simply useful. (There is now a secure telephone on his desk in Plains for calls to Foggy Bottom and, occasionally, the White House.) ''Obviously, it's in our interest to have stability in the Horn of Africa,'' said a senior State Department official during the Ethiopian-Eritrean talks at the Carter Center, ''and a settlement in Ethiopia would contribute to that. Equally obviously, the United States Government isn't in any position to mediate the Eritrean conflict. So what Mr. Carter is trying to do down in Atlanta suits our interest just fine.''
Even Elliott Abrams, the implacable foe of almost anything that bore the imprimatur of Jimmy Carter while he was Assistant Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration, concedes it ''makes a great deal of sense'' that Carter is able to involve himself in conflicts other individuals and organizations are unable to intrude upon.
Abrams, a lawyer now in private practice, also cites what he calls ''the decline of these internal conflicts as an East-West issue.'' The possibility of a resolution to an internal conflict - in Ethiopia, for example - is greater if the conflict is not one in which the United States and the Soviet Union are engaged as proxy enemies. And these days, the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ''less interested,'' says Abrams, in maintaining involvement in the Ethiopian-Eritrean war or in similar conflicts around the world.
Today, Jimmy Carter, as a kind of court of last resort, is the first President since Herbert Hoover (box on this page) to play so active a role in world affairs after leaving the White House.
From the beginning, Carter did not want just a library - ''a monument to me,'' as he puts it. But with the decision to have an ''active'' center, he and Rosalynn Carter undertook the 18-month task of raising the $27 million the center ultimately cost.
Set on a hill where, Carter notes, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman watched the Battle of Atlanta, the Carter Presidential Center houses a staff of some 130 in four interconnected buildings that meld futuristic design with classical columns. A think tank and ''conflict resolution'' hub, the center is a sort of vest-pocket World Health Organization, miniature United Nations and ad hoc Department of Health and Human Services.
An integral part of the Carter Center is Global 2000 Inc., an international aid organization striving to eradicate various diseases and improve agricultural productivity in third-world countries. The health program - run by Dr. William H. Foege, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta - has targeted the Guinea worm, which incapacitates 10 million Africans each year, as well as river blindness, polio, measles and rabies. Led by Dr. Norman Borlaug - an agronomist who won the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for bringing the Green Revolution to India and Pakistan - the agricultural program is tripling corn and sorghum production among small farmers in the African nations of the Sudan, Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia, through the use of high-yield seeds and fertilizers.
The Presidential library and museum are operated with Federal funds, but the other activities of the center, budgeted at $16 million a year, are financed by public and private donors, including many average citizens, the Houston philanthropist Dominique de Menil, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and the Rockefeller, Ford and Hewlett Foundations.
Most of the money for the center's third-world programs comes from abroad: a donation from the Government of Norway financed the Eritrean-Ethiopian talks. The Bank of Credit and Commerce International, based in London, is another backer. A principal donor to the programs operated by Global 2000 is the Japan Shipbuilding Industries Foundation, whose chairman is Ryoichi Sasakawa, a 90-year-old Japanese industrialist who made his considerable fortune in speedboat racing, a major sport in Japan.
The Carter Center officially opened in 1986, but it began operations in 1982, in temporary Atlanta quarters at Emory University, which still operates the center in a sort of joint venture with the Carters. (The former President is also a Distinguished Professor at Emory, lecturing on such subjects as military ethics and conducting ''town-meeting forums'' for students, faculty and visitors.) Flanking the entrance of the center are framed photographs from the Carter Presidency. Along one wall of the reception area outside Carter's office are facial studies of him by Andy Warhol: the prominent Carter lips sharply outlined, eyes almost mascaraed.
Carter works in an airy office that looks out over a Japanese garden donated by Atlanta's Japanese-owned YKK zipper company. The garden has a pond in which the former President has been seen dipping a fishing rod in the company of his 2-year-old granddaughter, Maggie.
Much has been said about how the boyish President aged when he was in the White House (overnight, it seemed, he went from 55 to 65), but though the hair is thinner and all but completely silver, both Carter, who is 65, and the former First Lady, who is 62, look exceptionally fit.
Although more relaxed than he was in the White House, Carter remains a workaholic. At the Carter Center, where they have an apartment, the Carters are up by 7:15 in the morning, unless the pressure of events dictates an earlier hour. He has a granolalike breakfast concocted by his wife. The two of them run three-and-a-half miles when their schedule permits, and then both usually repair to their adjoining studies.
Rosalynn Carter's involvement in the work of the center - ''unfinished business,'' she calls it - is no less than the former President's. In the White House, she attended Cabinet meetings, and today their activities are still done in tandem. ''I like skim milk, Jimmy likes whole, so we buy milk with 2 percent butterfat,'' she noted in ''Everything to Gain,'' the book she and her husband wrote. It is a revealing passage. It would never occur to the Carters to buy separate but equal quarts of milk.
The Carters write their own speeches (they both have heavy speaking schedules) and books. He tends to make careful notes on things of importance. During the nine days of negotiations between the Eritreans and Ethiopians at the Carter Center, for instance, the former President - sometimes with the parties face to face, sometimes with them in different rooms with Carter shuttling back and forth - always tapped out on his word processor the precise wording of sensitive matters, and gave copies to each side, to avoid quibbling later.
He says he has not changed. ''It's interesting and gratifying to see the media collectively saying there is a new, different Jimmy Carter, managing the affairs of the Carter Center competently, not uptight, not trying to push his religion forward. But I haven't changed. As far as the press is concerned, there is a revision of perspective.''
But Jimmy Carter of today has an easier, more comfortable public presence. If he could remake his Presidency, what would he change, he was asked at a recent town meeting in Atlanta. He shook his head, his eyes twinkled, the grin emerged. ''I'd order another helicopter,'' was his Reaganesque response. Clearly, there has been a mellowing of his take on the abortive hostage-rescue mission.
And at the 10th anniversary reunion of some 2,000 Carter Administration officials and staff members in Washington recently, he said that he had been asked repeatedly by reporters to comment on Reagan's multimillion-dollar visit to Japan (the fee was $2 million). He said he had told the press he was reluctant to criticize another former President, ''But here, among friends, I can be more candid. And I can say, if any of you hear of another deal like that, let me know.''
There is among the Carter folk a sense of honorable expiation. Addressing the former President at the reunion, Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said, ''Whether in kindness to the homeless or the poor and dispossessed of foreign lands, or on behalf of political prisoners around the globe, you have carried the dignity and character of the American Presidency to high ground - on which is posted a sign: 'Not for Sale.' ''
''After eight years of greed, indifference to human suffering,'' he continued, the Carter Presidency was ''a Sabbath celebration.''
Carter himself was more restrained. ''When I look around this room at the tremendous crowd,'' he said from the podium in the ballroom of the Omni Shoreham, ''and think of what you have meant to the country, and the latent ability you have, I have one thought: Why don't we take over again!'' The crowd roared its approval. Carter came back to earth. ''That was my first thought. My second was just to express my deepest thanks.''
''I'm Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for President. I will never lie to you.''
It played. Jimmy Carter was elected the country's 39th President as America was recoiling from the imperial Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson and the corruption of Richard M. Nixon. America in 1976 was tired of it all: the artifice, the deceit, the misuse of power. But it didn't last. America probably still yearns for an imperial President - a Roosevelt - and if he is not that, at least one with whom the average Joe can identify - a Harry Truman or a Ronald Reagan. Jimmy Carter was none of these, even if he carried his own suitcase and banned ''Hail to the Chief.''
He was, and is, a man without pretense. A man who took himself seriously - perhaps too seriously. Erwin Hargrove, a political-science professor at Vanderbilt University and author of the 1988 book ''Jimmy Carter as President: Leadership and the Politics of the Public Good,'' calls Carter a ''man without a mask.'' And that, Hargrove believes, was part of his problem. A President needs a mask, an image; a President cannot be mere flesh and blood.
Ronald Reagan always kept up his side of the bargain - at no time did he let his mask slip. He got away with ''killer trees,'' and when he, in a futile peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, lost 241 American servicemen, he did not suffer a loss in popularity. Ronald Reagan was the hero of 100 Saturday-morning matinees; Jimmy Carter, the fumbling man of malaise, lusted only in his heart and fled from ''killer rabbits.'' Harry Truman didn't wear a mask, but he didn't need one. He also played poker - and the fifth that rounded out the foursome was often I. W. Harper. Jimmy Carter was a teetotaler, and his rectitude made people uncomfortable, as if in that very rectitude there was implied opprobrium. He made the three-martini lunch seem not just a tax dodge but something vaguely immoral.
Carter had many problems as President, some of his making, many not. The oil embargo was hard to foresee, but Americans blamed him for the long gas lines. We invented oil, didn't we? We blamed him for the endless agony of the hostages held in Iran. They called us the Great Satan, and we didn't do anything! And when we did, the helicopters crashed. What do you mean, the helicopters crashed? Above all, we blamed him for the terrible economic condition the country was in. What he could do, he did tentatively and too late. ''He got into a position of power not at a helpless moment,'' observes the economist Henry Kaufman, but rather at the beginning of an economic expansion when economic management can be effective. But the new President's reluctance to rein in the expansion for fear of inducing a new recession, combined with his own inability to calm the jitters of the economic community, led to what some called the ''20-20'' economy of 1980 - a prime rate and an annualized inflation index close to that figure.
By the end of Carter's first term in the White House, malaise was everywhere. Carter contends he never used the word ''malaise'' in the speech on the energy crisis he gave from the Oval Office in the summer of 1979. And that is true.
He said: ''The true problems of our nation are much deeper, deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages, deeper even than inflation or recession.'' What he saw was ''a crisis of confidence . . . a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will.''
Carter still thinks it is among the best speeches he ever gave. It outlined the conservation measures, alternative-energy initiatives and other measures that are likely the best longterm hedges against Arab oil dependency. But it was, unquestionably, a speech about malaise. And whatever he may have intended, most Americans took it as a hectoring speech, feeling that they were being blamed for the nation's problems - even for a crumbling Presidency.
Thus Jimmy Carter, whose vision of a better world may well have been ahead of his time, fell afoul of the immediacy of empty gas tanks and 20 percent interest rates and the image of blindfolded Americans enduring God-knows-what at the hands of fanatics halfway across the world.
Nonetheless, looking at the Carter Presidency in 1989, a historian may well find much to applaud. If nothing else, none of the American hostages in Iran were killed. The combined four-year budget deficit during the Carter Administration was $227 billion (the eight years under Ronald Reagan, $1.3 trillion). Furthermore, the Carter years were free of the conspicuous corruption - the Iran-contra and Housing and Urban Development scandals, the savings and loans debacle -that plagued the Reagan Presidency.
Carter also managed the Camp David Accord between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat, the Panama Canal Treaty and SALT II (although it was possibly symbolic of his growing political impotence that he failed to get Salt II ratified). And, indeed, it was his own negotiations that ultimately gained the release of the American hostages in Iran - but not in time to save his Presidency.
The carters concede their return to life in Plains after their eviction from the White House was difficult, not least because of financial problems.
When he assumed the Presidency, Carter put his profitable peanut warehouse in a blind trust. When he returned four years later, after three disastrous years of drought, the warehouse was almost $1 million in the red. Carter, typically, had been meticulous about keeping himself in the dark about the warehouse finances. Even today, when he talks about it, his face tightens and his eyes look pained. ''I couldn't believe it,'' he says quietly. ''It was a horrible shock. I didn't know what to do.''
What he did was sell the warehouse for $1.2 million, enough to pay the debt, with a modest cushion. The sale saved the Carters from the painful option of selling all or part of two family farms totaling 2,000 acres - or possibly the four-bedroom home, on 170 acres, they built in 1961 after several profitable years at the peanut warehouse.
Former Presidents don't starve; Carter's Presidential pension is $99,500. But with the warehouse sold and the farmland largely leased to farmers, he had no clear future. It was, he recalls, ''deeply discouraging.'' For a time, Rosalynn Carter, angry and shattered, consoled herself with the fanciful dream that her husband would run again and regain the White House while he, harboring no such illusions, maintained an outward cheeriness he concedes was artificial. By the summer of 1981, both had substantial book contracts, the concept of the Presidential center was forming, and the Carters began what they still like to call ''proving there is life after the White House.''
Duty, to them, is sustaining. Each year, they find the time to spend a week or so wielding hammer and saw on behalf of the Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit Christian enterprise based in Georgia that constructs housing for the poor and homeless at home and abroad.
The former President is also finance officer of the 130-member Maranatha Baptist Church (''Total received for 2 Sundays in October: $1,482.19''). He often mows the church lawn while Rosalynn Carter vacuums the carpets and the upholstered pews. And he teaches Sunday school when he can, which these days is perhaps once a month. ''The church is the center of our social life,'' he says. ''It's like breathing for us.''
Still, Carter can be snippish. When his Secret Service driver takes a wrong turn on a tour of Plains, Carter explains the route, then adds thinly, ''Or we could go where you want to go.'' But bantering over football scores is more the norm.
Plains, with a population of 653, has scarcely changed since the early 1960's, when Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter built their home there. In blue jeans, open-collared shirt and heavy workman boots, Carter is easy, chatty. At the small public-housing project where he and his wife lived for a year in 1953 after he got out of the Navy - broke - he observes that ''there was quite a stigma then to white people living in public housing. So there was no trouble getting in.'' The Carters started a fertilizer business, made $234 the first year, but the next year made more than $5,000 and so had to move out of the housing project.
When the Japanese millionaire Ryoichi Sasakawa visited the Carters in 1981, Carter recalls, he expressed consternation that a former President lived in ''such a humble cottage.'' Although it is hardly that, the four-bedroom brick bungalow looks as if it might have been built by a moderately successful small-town peanut-warehouse operator in 1961.
Today, of course, one is admitted through an electric gate operated by a Secret Service agent in a guardhouse (the agents occupy a leased home a few hundred yards from the Carter bungalow). The cat is named Misty Malarky Ying Yang. The Carters laid the pine floors in the attic themselves, for added storage, when they came back from the White House. They bought a 20-acre plot alongside a white-water stream in the north Georgia hills and built a log-cabin retreat there; Carter also built the furniture (he is an accomplished woodworker).
At the Kountry Korner restaurant, where lunch for four comes to $18, the regulars greet the Carters much as they would anyone else, with questions about the family and remarks on how good they look. The former President orders black-eyed peas, English peas, buttered carrots and pear salad, corn bread and unsweetened tea. Rosalynn Carter has the same, but no mayonnaise on the pear salad. Are they vegetarians? No, he says, ''but we haven't bought any beef or pork since we left the White House. But we eat fish and game that I kill, and we eat some venison. The Secret Service agents hunt on my place and they bring me venison, and I shoot turkey and doves and quail. The agents harvest about 30 deer a year from our land. That is, that I know about.'' The smile flashes.
''It holds down poaching,'' he says. ''Everybody knows the Secret Service has my farm leased.''
The day before, a Sunday, at the Maranatha Baptist Church, Carter took as his text the last chapter of the Book of Daniel, which he confessed he failed to understand completely, but which he told his class of about 50, most of them elderly tourists, is God's call to duty in the face of adversity.
''He is telling us, don't waste our time, don't waste our talents, don't waste our intelligence. We can have a faith that can transcend failure. . . . We can have an existence that has purpose . . . what do I want to achieve - to expand and strengthen the Kingdom of Christ?''
Afterward, he was asked if that sort of biblical admonition compelled him to continue to work 12-hour days, tirelessly circle the globe, talk far into the night with warring factions with neither side budging, only to awake with the next dawn to start it all over again.
Jimmy Carter smiled his face-splitting smile, as if it were all the greatest of fun, and said, ''Sure!''

HEADLINE: A LITERARY HIGH-WIRE ACT

BYLINE: By Marshall Blonsky; Marshall Blonsky teaches semiotics at Queens College and The New School for Social Research. He is completing a book, ''American Mythologies,'' for Oxford University Press.

 BODY:
THERE IS UMBERTO AND THERE IS Eco. Umberto is the author of ''The Name of the Rose,'' an experimental whodunit that overnight became an international best seller; Eco is professor of semiotics at the medieval University of Bologna. Umberto has now written ''Foucault's Pendulum,'' a novel that is seducing the American literary establishment but was at the center of a heated, yearlong critical debate in Italy. Some Italian critics believed it was a plotless distortion of history written by a buffoon who used his knowledge of publishing ways to manipulate the market. Others considered it the first novel of a new, global, collage culture. The American critics have deepened the ambiguity: Some have refused to consider ''Foucault's Pendulum'' a novel, but have praised it as a dazzling philosophical entertainment.
Eco, in love with history, is a medievalist; Umberto, the first in his family to attend a university, adores Flash Gordon and ribald jokes about Wonder Woman. Eco - the name means echo - is inextricable from his native Italy, his memories of hunger during the Second World War and his old school friends. He's also the first Italian writer of his generation to produce a truly worldwide blockbuster of a novel: ''The Name of the Rose'' sold 9 million copies in 36 countries. 
If readers go along with the critics' largely favorable verdict, the ''Pendulum'' will surpass the ''Rose.'' In America, six weeks after publication, there are 275,000 copies in print, and the book is high on the best-seller list. In just seven years, Eco has gone from a $4,000 advance for the ''Rose'' to a figure reported to be more than $1 million for the ''Pendulum,'' from an erudite linguistic scholar into a mega-celebrity on the cultural scene.
One night during a lecture tour in 1984, after an occasionally barbed dialogue with Susan Sontag before almost a thousand people at New York University, the novelist sat, withdrawn and silent, in a Greenwich Village restaurant, unwilling to participate in the animated conversation of the Harcourt Brace Jovanovich editors and publicists around him. ''The Name of the Rose'' had been published a few months before. He pulled from his breast pocket a French article about himself and handed it to me without a word. He wasn't bragging. It was simply a gesture to connect with someone from his past (I've known him for 15 years), to distance himself from the commotion around him. At the age of 52, he was famous and he was scared.
LAST JULY, WHEN ECO ARRIVED IN NEW YORK BEFORE TRAVELING to the Indiana University campus in Indianapolis, where he was to deliver one of the keynote speeches at the International Summer Institute for Semiotic and Structural Studies, I picked him up at the Gramercy Park Hotel and took him to the bustling Trattoria dell'Arte. The restaurant, designed by Milton Glaser, is nicknamed ''Il Naso'' because of its giant nose in the window and its noses of famous Italians from Dante to Jimmy Durante on a painting behind the bar. ''Yours should be there,'' I offer. He contemplates the two icons of Italian culture in silence, as if trying to figure out where he belongs.
Since our last encounter, he's thickened slightly at the waist. ''The Alitalia stewards know me and they spoil me - too many martinis,'' he sighs over antipasto. Even the Italian stewards are part of the Italian mama complex, members of the extended family that is so much a part of that culture.
He brightens briefly when he notices on the wine menu a Gavi di Gavi Soldati la Scolca. ''Ahh, I know the man who makes it - my neighbor in Piedmont.'' Another instance of the Italian national network.
Over the mixed seafood grill Eco informs me that he's about to buy a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village for his son Stefano, a 26-year-old New York University graduate student. ''And now I will have a room of my own instead of these impersonal, sterile $200-a-night hotel rooms,'' Eco says. ''New York is not an American city. It's a European, Mediterranean city that just happens to be on your side of the Atlantic.'' His owlish eyes sparkle behind his big glasses.
Eco is a cultural curiosity, equally mobile in the Old World and the New. He has shown up for dinner still dressed in his transcontinental uniform - jeans and a blue-checked Italian sportcoat. ''I began wearing blue jeans in the days when very few people did,'' he wrote in ''Travels in Hyperreality'' (1986), ''but always on vacation. I found -and still find - them very comfortable, especially when I travel, because there are no problems of creases, tearing, spots. . . . It's only in the past few years that I've had to renounce this pleasure because I've put on weight.'' He's less a victim of fashion than of the new middle-class esthetic of moderation, which frowns upon any sign of embonpoint. The days when a bulging waistline was an expression of European joie de vivre, the image of a successful bourgeois man, are over.
Eco's worldly manner belies his scholarly vocation. The world traveler drinking martinis on Alitalia - Eco flies business class - is a world-class scholar who was deeply influenced by Charles Sanders Peirce, the late 19th-century pragmatic philosopher whose work anticipated modern semiotics; Eco's doctoral thesis was on ''The Esthetic Problem in St. Thomas.'' Brought up as a devout Catholic, he was recently accused by L'Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper, ''of profanations and blasphemies, buffooneries and filth, held together by the mortar of arrogance and cynicism in which the man of letters in his lofty dignity delights.''
In December 1988, the Pope himself, two months after the Italian publication of ''Foucault's Pendulum,'' condemned Eco before an audience of 5,000 pilgrims as ''the mystifier deluxe,'' telling the pilgrims that human life ''does not move inevitably toward death and nothingness'' - a phrase taken almost verbatim from the ''Pendulum.''
''We - are - not - as - those - that - believe'' - Eco slowly pontificates, satirizing the Pope's pseudo-excommunication - ''that - there - is - no - truth, no fixed point in this world.'' He laughs. ''It was his job to say that, O.K., O.K. The whole affair was nothing but an invention of the newspapers that needed to have an Italian Salman Rushdie,'' he says, attempting to reconcile God and the devil. ''I received calls from English newspaper asking if the Catholics were hunting me and trying to kill me. They believed that the Catholic Church is like Khomeini, so I was obliged to defend and protect the Catholic Church against those Anglicans.''
Born in 1932, Eco came of age in the postwar years. During the war, his family fled to the countryside to escape the bombing. ''We were not poor,'' he said, ''yet it was impossible to find food. I am preoccupied with the new generation who do not know what does it mean starving during the war, starving, with my mother crying because she couldn't have flour, could not find the farina with which to make. . .'' The memory is too much, and he can't finish his sentence. (Even at this emotional moment language is paramount in his mind. On the verge of tears, he stops to ask: ''What is the difference between 'flower' and 'flour'?'') ''The generation older than mine was blasted by the war,'' he resumes his narrative. ''Destroyed. And we arrived on the scene - at the end of the war we were 13, 14 years old - young and innocent. We were the first generation that could take a flight to Paris. And once I used the expression: 'We are the avant-garde in Wagon Lit,' sleeping cars, because we went to our conferences by sleeping car, by airplane. It was so easy for us to be in touch with everybody. At the age of 23 I met Stravinsky. It was only 'Nice to meet you, sir,' but I met him. We were not people at the margins, we were in the center.''
Eco feels he was blessed by another catastrophe. ''You understand, I am 57 years old and I still hold power - aJU small power - in my university. If the generation younger than me had prospered, the generation of '68, I would be retired now. But they were destroyed by confrontation. Some of them became terrorists, some of them escaped to the East with an Indian guru. It was a tormented, tortured, disgraceful generation. So I am privileged because those ahead of me were destroyed by the war and those behind me self-destructed. I feel I have been a filthy opportunist.''
 
WE MEET AGAIN a week later at the president's house at Indiana University in Indianapolis. It's a 20-room mansion, formerly the home of the pharmaceutical tycoon Eli Lilly. Eco, alone in the house, feels uncomfortable and regrets that the campus is dry - ''a typical Anglo-Saxon bigotry.'' He also regrets that there are no ashtrays in the house. Before going to a cocktail party, he steps out on the balcony to sneak a smoke. ''The housekeeper doesn't let me smoke,'' he says in a warm, throaty Italian accent, drawing on his cigarette and contemplating the campus lawn in the vastness of middle America. ''And there's only a single beer in the fridge.''
A few minutes later, martini in hand, he's doing his Eco-shtick (I heard it 11 years ago) before an audience of charmed academics on the terrace of the chancellor's house next door. ''The French have admitted at last that the Gauloises are pure poison,'' he says, talking with his yellow cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth. ''You see, it's papier mais, corn paper. You don't need fingers to hold it. You can talk around it, blowing smoke all the while in front of you.'' He demonstrates. ''And from behind the smoke comes French philosophy, comes la semiologie, and some of them actually rolled the Gauloise around the entire mouth as they lectured. Sartre, Barthes could do it.'' For Eco, Sartre and Barthes are still alive, side by side with Madonna and Indiana Jones.
Eco was in Indiana for the 14th annual meeting of the Semiotic Society of America, an organization he helped to found. An adept at interpreting the signs and messages that drive our consumer society, he was distressed to learn that the audience for his keynote speech - ''The Semiotics of Fakes and Forgeries'' - would include not only members of the Semiotic Society, but also marketing types from something called the International Institute on Marketing Meaning.
''I don't like it and I feel embarrassed,'' he complains a few hours before his speech. ''Personally, even in my country, I have always avoided meetings like this. I prefer to feel free to criticize certain phenomena without being directly involved with their production. Mr. Nader does not sit down with Mr. Ford and I sit with Nader and not Ford.''
But that contradiction, too, yields meaning. Semioticians are sign-struck. To them, everything can be endowed with meaning - a sign. ''Not only are words signs,'' Eco wrote in the Times Literary Supplement in the fall of 1973, ''but also gestures, images, nonlinguistic sounds like the chimes of Big Ben. Obviously devices (such as flags) created by man in order to indicate something are signs, but so are, in ordinary language, the thread of smoke that reveals a fire, the footstep in the sand that tells Robinson Crusoe a man has passed along the beach, the clue that permits Sherlock Holmes to find the murderer.''
''We are not always interested in things insofar as they are immediately consumable but insofar as they can stand for something else,'' Eco explained to me one afternoon. ''You see here behind us old books,'' We were sitting in the lounge of the Stanhope Hotel on Fifth Avenue.
''It gives you the impression you are sitting in the library of an aristocratic mansion. Yesterday I had a look at the books. They're interesting books, but not so rare. The poems of Longfellow, the writings of Lord Chesterfield. You can pull out a book and read it but that is not the function of this small library. The management wants you to consider yourself a sophisticated traveler and not a tourist on a budget.
''You don't need a semiotician to understand this. The management understands it better than I do. The guests in this hotel read these signs perfectly. Everybody knows how to make love but sexologists study and classify and define the way people make love. A semiotician tries to find the laws of the universe of signs.''
Eco spontaneously applies his analytic eye to his own fiction. Some Italian critics consider this approach contrived, as if he had deliberately used his ''mysterious science'' to write a best seller. ''Before Eco,'' says Gian Carlo Ferretti, a professor of contemporary Italian literature at the University of Sapienza in Rome, ''the writer was a craftsman who handed in his text to the editorial machine while remaining outside it.'' Eco, because of his interest in semiotics and his years of editorial experience, is often accused of working from the mind and not from the heart. ''Eco is like an engineer who stays inside the machine because the knowledge of the machine gives him also the knowledge of the market,'' says Ferretti.
Teaching semiotics is as much a passion with Eco as writing is. ''I teach out of intellectual and biological necessity,'' he says. ''When you write, you make certain assumptions, you take for granted the reader understands your premises. Not so with students. They ask a question and suddenly disconcert you.
''With students you need to know more. Young people are exciting, they're challenging. When I was young, I was always the youngest of my group. Now, I'm always the oldest of my group. If I were now the youngest,'' he says, laughing, ''it would be pretty pathetic.''
In a way, it's his reading of cultural change that gave Eco the inspiration for the new novel. ''I started it when I realized that in many European and American bookstores, in the same shelves in which in the 60's were the works of Marx, Gramsci, Marcuse and Adorno, now there were books on the Age of Aquarius, on the New Age, on Indian philosophy, tarots and so on,'' he says. ''After an excess of political and economic interpretation of life, the so-called radicalism or Marxism of the generation of '68, there has been a collapse of such utopia, and many of these people went in search of something mysterious, supernatural and occult. There has been a turn of a whole generation, yearning for mystery, for revelation, for illumination. That's what 'Foucault's Pendulum' is about.'' Once the novel's concept was clear in his mind, Eco went scouting locations, like a film director. He made a pilgrimage, as he puts it, to centers of Templar esotericism in France and Portugal. ''And I spent nights and nights walking alone from 2 A.M. to 4 A.M. through Paris.'' To acquaint himself with the mental geography of his characters, ''I pillaged all the bookshops in at least 10 cities in Italy, France and America.'' He bought some 1,500 books on occultism plus 400 or so rare books - ''more than I used for the novel, but at this point I was caught by this new mania.''
''Foucault's Pendulum'' is figural - to borrow a term from the deconstructionist critic Paul de Man. It has a multiplicity of meanings. Eco says: ''The reader will recognize that my story only occasionally concerns three editors who publish occult books and could actually be three politicians trying to understand what happened in their country, three agents of the C.I.A., three philologists trying to decipher an old parchment, three archeologists trying to figure out where a stone came from, three psychiatrists dealing with paranoid people, three lovers obsessed by jealousy and constantly suspecting each other, or two lovers.''
They are also a composite portrait of the leading post-structuralist philosopher Jacques Derrida - ''Foucault's Pendulum'' is, among other things, a roman a clef. It was Derrida who insisted that a writer cannot control his writing, that a text - as writing is known in those circles - invariably takes on a life of its own, independent of the author's intention. ''Nothing expresses the final truth but everything is a symbol for something else and for something else and for something else,'' says Eco. As Casaubon, one of the maniac editors in the novel, puts it: ''I was prepared to see symbols in every object I came upon. . . . Our brains grew accustomed to connecting, connecting, connecting everything with everything else.''
THE BIDDING FOR the paperback rights took place in November. Given the high advance for the hard-cover, Harcourt originally demanded a floor of almost $1 million - too much for Warner, Eco's previous soft-cover publisher. Ballantine Books, betting on Eco, paid more than $1 million.
''It's tough, your second book,'' a Warner executive told me. ''The first time, Eco was this great literary find, supported by the publicity tour in which he was charismatic. The critics were afraid to say they didn't like the book. It would have showed them up. I don't think they're going to fall over themselves to love the new one.''
But they did. In a barrage of positive reviews, The Boston Globe, the Kansas City Star and The Village Voice were among the negative few. In England, however, more thumbs were down. Even Salman Rushdie, writing from his safe house somewhere in England, blasted the book. ''Foucault's Pendulum,'' he wrote in The Observer, is ''humorless, devoid of character, entirely free of anything resembling a credible spoken word, and mind-numbingly full of gobbledygook of all sorts. Reader: I hated it.'' ''It looked like the Ayatollah's attack on him,'' Eco retorts. ''Rushdie did the same to me. But some months ago, I belonged to a group of writers invited by The New York Times to defend the right Salman Rushdie had to express freely his opinion, and I keep going in the same direction.''
''Foucault's Pendulum'' is a didactic pseudo-encyclopedia explaining everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask about European culture and history. It gives you names, dates, events you never heard of before - signs of history and culture you can drop at work or at home - whether you understand them or not. Eco said, ''In Italy they published a dictionary of all the strange names and quotations in the novel'' - Dizionario del pendolo di Foucault.
''I don't think that the reader of the book should know the exact meaning of everything. Suppose I am a film maker and I show you a character walking in the dark in a castle holding only a candle, and you come to ask me: 'Would you put a lamp on the scene to illuminate it?' But why? If I wanted the scene to be dark it's because that darkness has a meaning. So if I want to overwhelm you with a lot of mysterious magic spells and names it's not because I presume that you are a scholar of the Warburg Institute. I want you to feel this unbearable, suffocating accumulation of strange and exotic and magic spells. The reader has to understand I am making puns of ideas and so I use an enormous amount of material some of which even I don't know.''
He was afraid the book's difficulty would sink it in America, and was alarmed by the big promotional compaign that his publisher had in the works. ''Please don't sell it as soap,'' he told his publisher, Peter Jovanovich. He went through the roof when he learned over the summer that Harcourt was maneuvering to get him on television shows like ''Today'' and ''CBS This Morning.'' Most writers would have rejoiced at a $250,000 promotion budget - three times what the best European writers get as an advance. Eco thwarted it.
''Not for modesty or for Franciscan heroism that I oppose big promotion,'' he insists, ''but because I know publicity can have a negative influence on critics. I told them, I reprimanded them, I was severe with them.''
And as Eco commanded, so it was done. ''Foucault's Pendulum'' was launched at the venerable Morgan Library and at the Jewish Museum in New York, where Eco debated Moshe Idel, among the world's leading cabalistic scholars, and in Washington at the Smithsonian, which sponsored ''An Evening with Umberto Eco.'' What did he want? I asked him the night he arrived in New York for his promotional tour. ''To be taken seriously,'' he answered. ''We are a Catholic civilization, which is exactly the opposite of what Max Weber told of the Protestant civilization. For the Protestant civilization, economic success is a sign of the benevolence of God, while for our civilization, poverty and suffering are proofs of his benevolence. Success, on the contrary, is the proof that God is ready to send you to hell.''
Avoiding this fate has been no easy matter. Carla Tanzi, the foreign rights manager for Eco's Italian publisher, Bompiani, has received a score of movie offers for the ''Pendulum,'' among them an offer from Dino de Laurentis for 600,000,000 lire ($450,000) and a 5 percent royalty, given as a rule only to the happy few. ''They're calling from Los Angeles,'' she said, ''and they haven't even read the book.''
''I'm not selling it to the movies,'' Eco declares. ''I want the book to stand on its own.''
Dwelling among contradictions - worldly fame and literary immortality, secular riches and academic monkhood - has made Eco's life an eternal pendulum, but he could also be seen as a synthesis of the commercial and the classic. His sensibility embraces the old and the new, Europe and America, guilt and appetite, traditional and popular culture, logic and fantasy, anonymous scholarship and center-stage celebrity. ''Listen,'' Eco says animatedly, ''Someone accuses Woody Allen, in one of his films, of taking himself for God. And Woody Allen says, 'Everybody has to choose his own models.' O.K. Every writer has to choose models, but that doesn't mean that one pretends to have matched the model.''
Eco has moved into a space that other writers of fiction have abandoned: the great master of Western literature. Yet as a communications expert, he's aware of the transitory nature of our cultural objects. The survival of the book industry depends on discovering the new, not on preserving the ''classic.''
Whatever its virtues and defects, ''Foucault's Pendulum'' is a book that makes large claims. Eco wants to establish a whole new tradition -the genre of all-inclusive, anything-goes writing. Alberto Moravia called the ''Pendulum'' ''a university lecture with a short novel inside.'' In the United States, reviewers have even decided not to apply traditional canons to the book. ''You may call the book an intellectual triumph, if not a fictional one,'' Anthony Burgess proclaimed in The New York Times Book Review. ''No man should know so much. It is a work not of the literary man but of one who accepts the democracy of signs.'' In Eco's imagination, highbrow and lowbrow merge. Durante and Dante: It's the post-modern choral style.
ONE AFTERNOON IN THE early fall, Eco is sitting on a couch in his new, still-unfurnished apartment in New York. His son's electric guitar and keyboard are on the floor by the window. The books are still in boxes. A toy King Kong is climbing a kitsch Empire State Building. Eco is in a relaxed mood. ''I remember that after graduation with my friend Furio Colombo'' - a critic and the chairman of Fiat U.S.A. - ''one evening in Milano at the age of 22, we said: 'We have finished university, we are starting new jobs but what do we really want to do with our lives?' And I remember to have answered:
'I want to make a book and a kid, because they are the only ways to overcome death, a paper thing and a flesh thing. Lovemaking alone, for all its pleasures, is stupid; nothing comes of it. But my death can have a sense if somebody survives me and continues. And I write a book, not to have a success now but with the hope that in the next millennium, it will be still at least in a bibliography or in a footnote. And if I like the success now, it's because probably it helps the book to survive.''

 BODY:

REBEL WITHOUT A CLUE. By Holly Uyemoto. (Crown, $17.95.) In this deceptive novel, adult concerns like power, fame, intimacy and mortality are tackled expertly, as is realistic dialogue laced with the macho accents of two male adolescents. But the writer is neither an experienced author nor a man. Holly Uyemoto, a 19-year-old who lives in northern California, delves into the flashy, sometimes fatal world of easy money, sex and drugs, and emerges with a terrific book. ''Rebel Without a Clue'' is a straightforward tale of the twisted lives of Christian Delon, a thoughtful teen-ager loafing away the summer after his high school graduation and mired in the sludge of the idle rich of Marin County, Calif., and Thomas Bainbridge, his best friend, who at 18 is the ''highest-paid male model in our economically disturbed world,'' a lanky youth with ''wide eyes the color of 7-Up bottles,'' chiseled cheekbones - and AIDS. ''I found myself scrutinizing him closely,'' says Christian, ''afraid he'd disappear right before my eyes. The enormity of the situation hadn't begun to set in but I knew that it meant sooner or later I would only see him in photographs and behind my eyelids. Suddenly I couldn't stop looking at him.'' Christian follows Thomas from brightly lit movie sets to Hollywood soirees attended by characters like a ''balding columnist'' wearing eyeliner and various ''acclaimed talents'' who ''lick mirrors and razors and each other's noses.'' Breaking this destructive cycle, Christian is left with hope for himself but only ambivalence for his dying best friend - a sophisticated ending for an admirable first novel.

DUCKS
By Helen Hodgman.
121 pp. New York:
Harmony Books. $16.95.
In the opening paragraph of ''Ducks,'' the Australian writer Helen Hodgman's third novel and her first to be published in America, 13 ducks become caught by their feet in a South London pond that has frozen overnight. Soon a big dog named Angst happens along and bites each duck off at the knees. 
The remaining duck stumps are a troubling image to Hazel, a 40-year-old unemployed widow, mother and divorcee, who is currently the live-in lover of Moss, a divorced mother, freelance designer and member of the Women's Design Collective, a radical feminist organization whose exact goals are never made very clear. Hazel is adrift - this much is certain - and the slaughtered ducks are a small sample of the chaos that surrounds her and everybody else in the novel. ''Ducks'' is made up of a series of vignettes, each roughly half a page in length, that encompass multiple points of view, numerous settings and several decades.
Besides Hazel and Moss, the novel's characters include Elvis, Moss's young son, who lives with Hazel and Moss; the Bogeyman, a junkie whom Elvis takes to be his father; Clarice, Moss's mother, a widow who is rediscovering sex; Harold, Moss's former husband, a devotee of a bizarre religious cult known as the Kali Kosmic Konsciousness (KKK); the Leader, the Lady Eleanor, Moon Baby III and a skinny witch named Sylvia, all members of the KKK; Mrs. Birtwhistle, Harold's dying mother; le Professeur de Judo and Lucienne, Hazel's former husband and her daughter, who live in Vancouver, British Columbia; Ted, Hazel's dead husband (before le Professeur de Judo), whose insurance compensation check sustains Hazel and Moss; Lark, Hazel's lesbian lover (before Moss and le Professeur de Judo); the members of the Women's Design Collective (Manny, Maureen and Sue, as well as Buster and Beulah, a lesbian couple with their own baby); Walter and Daphne, a businessman and his novelist wife; their children, Albert, Benjamin, Felix, Felicity, Dominic and Rupert; plus their aforementioned duck-eating dog, Angst. Add to these a trash novelist called the Southern Belle, Hazel's dead-but-animate mother, Johny Holy Joy, Martha, Marian, Renate, Miss Binns, Hooper and Iris Tatters, and you've got quite a cast.
The constant shifting between these characters' lives works for a while - an interesting sychronicity interweaves them, and the world becomes a timeless web that all its inhabitants are by necessity caught in - but the technique quickly wears thin. Characters are introduced and then dropped, so that by the time we get back to them we may have forgotten who they are or what predicament they're in. Also, few of the scenes are sustained for very long; just as we feel we might be getting our footing, another situation is hurled at us, involving yet another character. New characters, in fact, are still popping up three-quarters of the way through the novel, which is especially disconcerting in a book that's only 121 pages long.
The events in ''Ducks'' are equally frenetic. In addition to duck slaughter, the plot contains references to indecent exposure, child molestation, snuff movies, hard drug use, vandalism, artificial insemination, kidnapping, sadism, masochism, cult worship, nuclear bomb-wielding terrorists, a murder plot, gangrene, amputation, an actual murder, mayhem, cannibalism, gang rape by police officers, suicide, coma, euthanasia, death by cancer, death by accident, a Nazi concentration camp, hallucinations and goddess manifestation, not to mention a whole lot of sex involving a whole lot of people.
Of course, the chaos of modern existence seems to be very much the point here. But unfortunately, with so many people and so much going on, everyone and everything seems distant. It's impossible to empathize, especially when there's an omniscient voice looming over the prose, a voice that keeps making comments and wisecracks. Even a good spoof, if this is how ''Ducks'' is intended, needs to lay out a set of rules - at least implicitly - for the reader to follow. But ''Ducks'' doesn't seem to have rules. Does anyone need to read a novel to feel that life is random?
Ms. Hodgman's first novel, ''Blue Skies,'' cast the world in an eerie light; the setting, an arid suburb on the Australian island of Tasmania, seemed to reflect perfectly the values of its ultra-modern inhabitants, whose primitive urges kept burrowing through their smooth surfaces. Everything that happened to and because of these lost people was off-kilter, yet entirely believable and deeply felt. ''Ducks,'' while certainly off-kilter, never quite gets near enough to touch.
 
A VISIT FROM THE BOGEYMAN
 As she did every Sunday at 6.30, Moss telephoned her mother in Bournemouth.
Yes, she'd adore to have Elvis for a while provided she could call him David.
Moss put him on the train, keeping her fingers crossed that he'd not set light to anything. She needn't have worried. David wouldn't dream of doing such a thing. He loved to visit his Grandma's house. In particular he loved the high-ceilinged, silent sitting-room with hundreds of tiny glass animals on every flat surface. . . .
He enjoyed the afternoon walk they always took with the dachsie, down through the winding chines to the promenade, where they left Fritz to roam . . . while they went to their favourite tea-room.
The best part though . . . was coming back in the late afternoon, when he'd race ahead to open the front door . . . and run down the hall to the room where the creatures all waited dull with dusk for the moment he'd switch on the wall lamps. Then what an intricate shimmer of whispers would ring out as the room turned shiny and snug and Granny swept in, saying, ''Time for a sherry, I think,'' as though there were ever any doubt about that, or anything else in the world for that matter. . . .
Later he'd go upstairs to sleep in Mummy's old bed surrounded by the things he supposed she didn't want any more.
One night in this room Elvis dreamed a terrible dream of the Bogeyman all wrapped in knives and blood. His grandmother found him perched on top of the wardrobe, beyond reach and beyond tears. . . .
''But there's no such thing as Bogeymen, David. Surely Mummy's told you that?''
''Mummy doesn't know,'' said Elvis.
 
From ''Ducks.''

THE SECRET SPEECHES OF CHAIRMAN MAO
From the Hundred Flowers to the Great Leap Forward.
Edited by Roderick MacFarquhar,
Timothy Cheek and Eugene Wu.
561 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The Council on East Asian Studies/
Harvard University Press. Paper, $15.
Two Chinese texts for the day: ''It's good to have a bit of disturbance. Students making a disturbance is not equivalent to rebellion. . . . I say let them agitate to their hearts' content. . . . Make the process of the disturbance serve as an educational process, serve as a political course.'' And: ''The People's Liberation Army is for dealing with imperialism, not for dealing with the people. The People's Liberation Army is the son of the people. How could the son [of the people] ever oppose the father of the people?'' 
These observations, so poignant in light of the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in May and June and the subsequent Beijing slaughter, were made by Chairman Mao Zedong 32 years ago, in February and March 1957. Mao was trying to get support for what became known as the Hundred Flowers Movement, a broad-based airing of views on the problems facing China, which he believed would dissipate the tensions that had arisen since the suppressions of the Hungarian and Polish risings in 1956. The reassurances Mao offered to intellectuals, party workers and students, in many informal speeches and off-the-record discussions, had the effect desired. By the spring of 1957 the movement was in full swing, and a deafening chorus of complaints was surfacing in every available forum.
Unfortunately for Mao, the complaints were directed not only at shortcomings in the political, economic and intellectual life of China, but at the Communist Party as an entity, and at Mao himself as an authoritarian and incompetent leader. Bitter and chagrined, Mao backed off from his support of the Hundred Flowers and joined forces with more conservative cadres who had never wanted the campaign in the first place. By the summer of 1957 the party was conducting a full-fledged ''Anti-Rightist Campaign'' against those who had been most outspoken. At least half a million Chinese were punished for having answered the chairman's call.
Mao gave hundreds of informal speeches, containing phrases and thoughts similar to those quoted above, but very few of them made their way into the five volumes of his official collected works. For the Mao canon was too important to be left to Mao, and batteries of senior comrades and editors were at hand to tidy up his work, remove indiscretions and try to reach a point of view consistent with whatever the party line of the time happened to be. However, for over 30 years Mao was the most revered and most feared person in China, and his words were stored in countless ways by those who heard them - in secret party archives, internal memos, private notebooks, tape-recorded transcripts. When the young Red Guards were encouraged by Mao in 1966 and 1967 to lash out at the senior officials in the party, the bureaucracy and the educational establishment, they customarily ransacked the homes and offices of their victims. In the course of these raids, much confidential material came to light. Some of it was used as evidence against the senior personnel concerned. If the words were Mao's, they were transcribed by Red Guards and circulated in various published or informal ways, as evidence - if more was needed - of Mao's creative originality as a thinker. Occasionally bits of these collections reached scholars in the west and were translated there; two important examples were the pieces published by Jerome Chen in 1970 as ''Mao Papers'' and by Stuart Schram in ''Mao Tse-tung Unrehearsed'' (1974).
Now, in ''The Secret Speeches of Chairman Mao,'' Roderick MacFarquhar, a professor of government at Harvard University, together with Timothy Cheek of Colorado College and Eugene Wu, the librarian of Harvard's East Asian collection, have edited a remarkably comprehensive collection of these informal Maoist texts. Wisely, I think, they have chosen to focus on just two key events in China's recent history, rather than using a scattershot approach that would give a little taste of many topics.
Their focus on The Hundred Flowers Movement of 1957 and the Great Leap Forward of 1958 is particularly apt, because each presents such a different side of Mao's character and his approach to politics. The Hundred Flowers texts show Mao almost as a petitioner among his own people, ''a wandering lobbyist,'' as he described himself in a talk to army cadres in Nanjing. He is genial, relaxed, sharp in comment but open to give and take. The Great Leap Forward texts, by contrast, show a much darker side of his character - angry, impatient, visionary, uninterested in arguments that might have brought him back to earth.
Obviously, these texts, by such a major political actor, collected in such informal ways, raise complex problems of authenticity. Mr. Cheek, in an opening essay called ''Textually Speaking,'' confronts this problem directly, reflects on the pros and cons of the authenticity of different texts, collates various speeches from different editions with their variant forms and with official published versions where possible, and concludes the speeches published here are genuinely the words of Mao. Mr. Cheek knows the field extremely well and has had the help of an international array of Chinese analysts, along with the bibliographic skills of Mr. Wu (who directs an essay of his own to similar problems), so I accept this judgment, especially since Mr. Cheek is not dogmatic about the works in question and tells us when he has doubts.
As Mr. Cheek nicely phrases it, in Mao's earlier official collected works, Mao himself accepted the need for a ''consensual approach to his own deification,'' whereas in the official collections published by the Communist Party since Mao's death in 1976, one gets a kind of ''academic theology'' in which '' 'scientific,' linguistic and historical analyses seek to contribute to a living faith.'' In contrast, the Red Guard editions that never ceased praising Mao, ''genius'' editions as Mr. Cheek calls them, provide both ''a gold mine of political and psychological data for Mao studies'' and ''a cesspool of run-on sentences, obscure grammar, and simple nonsense for the translator.''
Three other essays by eminent China scholars help to give us a valuable set of contexts in which to read Mao's informal texts. Mr. MacFarquhar's opening essay, as one would expect from the leading expert on both the Hundred Flowers Movement and the origins and implementation of the Great Leap Forward, gives an excellent overview of Mao's state of mind as he argued with his senior party colleagues over the need for change and criticism at the center. Benjamin I. Schwartz gives a moving analysis of Mao's ''deep anxieties, soaring exaltations, injured pride, deep resentments, and unexamined complacencies.'' Mr. Schwartz concludes that the ideas behind the Great Leap were more central to Mao's being than those of the Hundred Flowers, and presented an apocalyptically utopian view of the fusion of his mind with those of China's masses (as opposed to the bourgeois intellectuals) that represented Mao's ''final spiritual resting place.'' Merle Goldman, looking at the Mao of the late 1950's from the vantage point of her deep familiarity with the manifestations of political and literary dissent in China, explains how the Hundred Flowers slogans sprang from Communist Party intellectual history - specifically, from an earlier 1951 Maoist analysis of the Beijing Opera tradition and from the roots of a historiographical academic debate that Mao refused to pass judgment on. She also shows how Mao was enraged with his propaganda chiefs and newspaper editors, and concludes, forcefully, that Mao comes across in these talks as ''contradictory, repetitious, and obsessed.''
What, then, are the central contributions made by this new collection to our knowledge of China? Perhaps the greatest is that they show us how much frank discussion was in the air during this strange period of Chinese history, and how difficult it sometimes was for Mao to get what he wanted despite his immense prestige. The final impression is that Mao felt so far above the fray, even while so grubbily absorbed in it, that he ceased to have any clear sense of the country's terrible suffering. People really had become ciphers to him, mere details on the way to some ultimate colossal goal. ''In the past during the revolution numerous people died without asking anything in return. Why can't it be like that now?'' Mao asked his senior colleagues in August 1958 as he discussed the Great Leap. Maybe they should think of letting the peasants have two days' rest a month, he ruminated a little later, but then at once modified the thought: ''during the busy season, rest a little less,'' he said, and eat and sleep at the work site too, to save precious time. ''This point should be written in the documents but not be talked about too much,'' he told his colleagues. Sometimes Mao's thoughts strayed to stranger zones: to great wide roads in every commune with no trees on their verges so that every road would be an airport; or to a world of Chinese so healthy that physicians would have no patients, and could go till the fields and do research.
Almost everything Mao was saying in 1957 was something students and workers wanted to discuss with their own Government in 1989. Perhaps most ironically, it was presumably Hu Yaobang, then directing the Communist Youth League, who tried to give Mao accurate information on student unrest. Hu Yaobang's own death in April 1989 was the initial spark that culminated in the June tragedy, even though the deeper causes had been smoldering a long time. As Mr. MacFarquhar says, this 1989 Tiananmen crisis ''would almost certainly have the same numbing effect on China's intellectual elite as the Anti-Rightist Campaign, and could deter rural and urban entrepreneurs and foreign investors.''
As we can now see, thanks to these texts, the paradoxes at the center of this Government were paradoxes that lay also at the heart of Mao's being. Or, as Mr. Schwartz puts it so beautifully in his essay: ''In the end, on the level of his final abstract vision, Chairman Mao may be not so much 'alone with the masses' as alone with himself.''
 
THE CHAIRMAN, UNEDITED
 One added richness in this strange and absorbing book is that if we so choose we can take any one of Mao's off-the-cuff draft speeches and then see how it compares with the final party version (if there is one). To do this in the case of one of Mao's most famous speeches, ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People,'' is a fascinating exercise. The history of this speech is more than usually devious, since Mao initially delivered it on Feb. 27, 1957, to a large group of nonparty intellectuals and bureaucrats, whom he was trying to persuade to join in the Hundred Flowers Campaign. It was not published at the time, to Mao's anger. But after he himself swung against the protesters, he apparently acquiesced in the publication of a totally revised version in The People's Daily of Peking on June 19, 1957. This latter version was doctored to make it appear that Mao wanted the Hundred Flowers Campaign to serve as a vehicle of class struggle, and that he anticipated trouble from the start.
The ''speaking notes'' for the original speech that have now surfaced bear almost no relation at all to the mood or content of the dogmatic and tedious June 19 version. The newly discovered version occupies 58 pages of ''The Secret Speeches of Chairman Mao,'' and there is a surprise on nearly every page. Some examples must serve for the whole: Mao's frank discussion of the troubles in Poland and Hungary, his sense that the people wanted two news agencies in competition with each other, his analysis of the way China's national bourgeoisie is not an enemy, his frank announcement that 770,000 Chinese were killed in the mass campaigns of 1950 to 1954, his portrayal of the constructive role of student protests in modern Chinese history, his analysis of problems in China's cooperatives and his estimate that in some areas 15 percent of the households were ''lacking grain,'' his mention that many Chinese now feel ''disgust with Marxism.'' Among other important things Mao discussed in February that never made it to the June text were the urgent need for birth control in China, the fact that 40 percent of school-age children had no schools to go to, and the fact that during 1956 China had been troubled by a mass of protests and strikes: 7,000 students protesting in 28 different cities, according to Communist Youth League figures, and 50 strikes conducted by urban workers, some involving over 1,000 workers, according to statistics Mao admitted were still incomplete.

A FIRST DICTIONARY OF CULTURAL LITERACY
What Our Children Need to Know.
Edited by E. D. Hirsch Jr.
with William G. Rowland Jr. and Michael Stanford.
Illustrated. 271 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company. $14.95.
The debate is not about Kermit the Frog versus the Three Little Pigs, Willie Mays versus Babe Ruth or investment versus savings. Some of these terms are defined in E. D. Hirsch Jr.'s well-presented new effort, ''A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,'' and some are not. The issue is really whether our primary educational focus should be on rote memory of certain facts - any facts - or on developing the tools and processes whereby students learn. 
This new book, which succeeds Mr. Hirsch's philosophic treatise ''Cultural Literacy'' and its successor, ''A Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,'' presents 21 neatly designed categories of terms, definitions and concepts in such subjects as American history, geography, the natural and physical sciences, mathematics, literature and mythology. Accompanied by photographs, line drawings and well-made maps, this compendium was compiled with the assistance of hundreds of teachers, administrators and parents from all 50 states. According to the author, it represents nothing less than 80 percent of what every child should know by the the end of sixth grade.
In essence, the Hirsch dictionary purports to add up to much more than the sum of its definitions. Not only does it propose to serve as a measuring stick for youngsters' store of culture-based knowledge, but it also pretends to serve as a vehicle for a successful life. The subtitle proclaims directly and emphatically that these are the facts that students ''need to know.'' The introduction elaborates, stating that schools are widening the gap between haves and have-nots by teaching skills rather than facts, thus sending a clear if misleading message to parents: If your child knows these facts, he or she will be part of the ''haves'' society.
Underlying this book is Mr. Hirsch's belief that the lack of a common knowledge base is widening the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged in our society. Joining the legions of critics of the schools, he paints a picture of an increasingly illiterate society with growing numbers of dropouts contributing to a growing underclass of have-nots. According to Mr. Hirsch, who teaches English at the University of Virginia, creating a body of facts, information and concepts that everyone learns in common would lead to greater ease of communication among all classes of people.
The problems Mr. Hirsch is concerned about are hardly new; they've been with us ever since the great wave of immigration at the end of the 19th century - ever since, that is, we became a truly pluralistic society. And the debate about how to achieve community amid diversity is not new either. Then as now, some argued for a set body of knowledge to be learned across the country, while others argued for a curriculum that was more locally determined and that took into account the needs and capacities of the learners. Then as now, educational reform was seen as the cure for social and economic ills.
Can we honestly put an entire country's economic shortcomings at the doorstep of our schools? Aren't there other major factors that have helped to create and in fact widen the gap between the privileged and underprivileged - factors like racism and the recent decline in funding for social programs, for example?
Mr. Hirsch also ignores a lot of what we know about how children learn. First of all, learning is active. Gone is the day when we naively believed that children were pure empty tablets waiting to be printed on, or empty receptacles waiting to be filled (to use two common metaphors). Children are active, curious, opinionated and selective. Tell a 7-year-old that a cloud is a mass of condensed water or ice particles (a term defined by Mr. Hirsch in the dictionary), and the child's eyes are bound to glaze over. But set up an experiment that demonstrates condensation, and the child is bound not only to become interested but to remember what condensation and clouds are all about. Experiencing the reality behind the concepts, an essential part of early learning, insures understanding and knowledge that becomes a part of the learner.
Second, learning is social. Children learn in the classroom through interaction with their teachers and with one another. This back-and-forth human exchange about the curriculum provides motivation and excitement, helps children to be engaged in their learning and supports them in their struggles to learn what they need and want to know.
Third, children come to school already knowing a great deal; they learn in many other places, and often they learn more profoundly there than they do in school. The confidence and self-esteem all children need in order to achieve and to become productive adults is more likely to develop in schools where their knowledge, their experiences and their cultures are respected and taken as a starting place for their schooling.
Addressing the issue of educational content without simultaneously considering processes whereby children learn creates an unnatural dichotomy. In learning, form and function are inseparable. Children need healthy, positive, common schooling experiences, in addition to a common curriculum core, if they are truly to acquire the kind of knowledge that will prepare them for the pluralistic society in which we live. Simply remembering the same facts will not produce a classroom of tolerant, curious and participatory citizens.
If one wanted to ignore Mr. Hirsch's assumptions and look specifically at the definitions, there is no end to the arguments that one could have. For example, under United States Geography, Arizona is defined as ''a state in the Southwest.'' Is this definition an appropriate indicator of cultural literacy? If one is to know what Arizona is, shouldn't one know a little something about it - that it is where the Grand Canyon is, or that it is populated, in part, by Navajos?
In sum, this dictionary is much less than it appears to be. Taken without its pretentious introduction and organization, the book is worthy of shelf space in the young reader's library - just as a specialized crossword puzzle dictionary is useful for the crossword game. But beware of considering it a trusty guide, index or dictionary for the pursuit of precise knowledge - for use by parent, teacher or child. And clearly, Mr. Hirsch's ''First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'' is not a necessary tool for a fulfilling, successful life.

Free Agency Sets Record for Number of Signings in One Day

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The trade mart never had a chance. Its cousin, the free-agent market, overwhelmed everything and everyone in its relentless path.
''With all the free agents out there, they dominated the discussions,'' Dave Dombrowksi, the Montreal Expos' general manager, said, reviewing last week's winter meetings in Nashville. ''You spend all your time talking to an agent, and you're mentally exhausted afterward. If you don't get him, you're frustrated on top of it and you have to regroup. Everybody kept saying they had to go back and regroup. I never heard that expression used as much as I heard it during the week. But it's true.''
Dombrowski and his fellow general managers had reason to feel overwhelmed. Last Thursday, 12 free agents reached agreement with teams for a one-day record in the 14-year history of free agency. With the seven free agents who accepted contracts the previous day, a two-day record was established. Twenty-four free agents worked out new contracts during the week. That, too, was a record. 
The date Dec. 7 has become the date to watch in free agency. Last year, 11 free agents gained new contracts on that date, only one less than the 12 who reached agreement on Dec. 7 this year. In 1987, the number was eight. On only one other day, Jan. 8, 1986, have as many as eight free agents signed new contracts.
Based on this year's frenzied activity, perhaps at next year's meetings the players' agents can set up the kind of booths that each year fill the hotel's exhibit hall, enabling vendors to show off their wares to visiting major league and minor league club officials. Instead of perusing uniforms, equipment and merchandise, general managers can negotiate contracts with the agents, strolling from booth to booth. At the front of the hall, a large scoreboard can keep track of the amount of money spent.
''It's like there's this giant credit card in the sky and everybody keeps drawing on it,'' Sandy Alderson, general manager of the Oakland Athletics, said.
The Athletics and the Expos were the teams hardest hit by free agency. The Expos lost three-fifths of their starting pitching rotation and are virtually certain to lose the outfielder Hubie Brooks, too. Three members of the Athletics signed with other teams, stripping the World Series champions of a significant amount of their depth. Gone are Dave Parker, Tony Phillips and Storm Davis.
''Obviously, we're affected to some extent,'' Alderson said. ''Each of those players played an important role for us last season. But we still have the nucleus of our team intact. The new economics will prevent us from keeping that nucleus unless we begin making choices now.''
The Athletics chose not to give Parker the two-year contract he sought (Milwaukee did), not to give Phillips more than perhaps $1.5 million for two years (Detroit gave him $4 million for three) and not to come anywhere near matching the $6 million Kansas City gave Davis for three years.
The Athletics re-signed Ken Phelps as a free agent to assume part of Parker's designated-hitter role. Barring a trade or a signing, Todd Burns could take Davis's spot in the rotation. They need a utility infielder.
Oakland's status in next season's American League West race could be determined more by the improvement of other teams than by any slip the Athletics may suffer.
The California Angels, who already had good pitching, added Mark Langston. If they could sign Mark Davis for their bullpen and Robin Yount for the outfield, deals that would sorely strain the giant credit card in the sky, the Angels would be formidable.
The Royals, with Davis joining the rotation, have strengthened their pitching, as they wanted to do, but Davis won 19 games with Oakland (despite a 4.36 earned run average) because of the team's strong relief crew (he averaged 5.5 innings per start).
 
Game Goes Round and Round
Eventually, general managers will get around to making more trades. When they do, Lee Smith will leave the Boston Red Sox and relieve elsewhere (Jeff Reardon has supplanted him). Tim Leary will most likely move into a pitching rotation other than Cincinnati's, maybe the Yankees'. Kansas City seems intent on trading Danny Tartabull.
Houston wants to trade Bill Doran, its second baseman, but clubs are wary of his back. The Astros offered Doran to Milwaukee for Glenn Braggs, but the Brewers would rather trade Rob Deer. Seattle is looking to trade Jeffrey Leonard, Atlanta has Gerald Perry to swap for a catcher and Baltimore would trade Phil Bradley for the right hitter.
 
Tigers Finally Succumb
The Tigers actually signed Tony Phillips to a three-year contract for $4 million? The Tigers signed Lloyd Moseby, another free agent, to a two-year contract for $3 million? The Tigers? Yes, the same Tigers who long have been one of the staunchest foes of free agency. Free agents and the Tigers always went together like pastrami and pizza. So why the sudden change in philosophy?
''It's not a change,'' Jim Campbell, the club's president, said. ''It's maybe surfaced a little more. We've always taken the approach that we consider each individual case at the time. We haven't signed too many free agents, but we've done things we haven't taken public. We made offers to Bobby Grich and Wayne Garland, but we never went public with it. Why? Because if you do, it might discourage the kid you might be replacing. I'd rather take a beating than have the kid think we're trying to replace him.''
Grich and Garland were among the first group of 25 free agents in 1976. The Tigers signed another of those 25, Tito Fuentes.
But their interest, public or private, in free agents was highly questionable. In the days when clubs drafted negotiating rights to free agents, the Tigers went for five successive years, 1978 through 1982, without drafting rights to anyone. After Fuentes, they didn't sign another free agent (from another club) until 1983, then not again until Phillips and Moseby.
''The Pettis deal woke them up,'' a man familiar with the Tigers' thinking said.
Tom Monaghan, the owner, and Campbell, the source said, recognized that the team, which finished with the worst record in the majors, had to be changed. Bill Lajoie, the general manager, asked how they could change it if they weren't going to pay players.
Gary Pettis was a prime example. The Tigers' busiest outfielder last season, Pettis was a free agent but defected to the Texas Rangers, who included a $160,000 signing bonus in his three-year, $2.66 million contract.
''The only reason they lost Pettis,'' the source said, ''was they refused to pay a signing bonus. They lost Pettis for a $160,000 signing bonus.''
The Tigers are suffering from famine in their farm system, and they cannot afford to trade the few marketable players they have. Once the realization sunk in that the team had a better chance of becoming worse than better, the Tigers began pursuing free agents.
''Money wasn't going to stop them from putting a competitive team on the field,'' the source said.
They signed Phillips first, snatching the infielder - he will play third base - away from the Yankees, whose trade with Cincinnati for Tim Leary fell through because of their inability to get Phillips. The Tigers tried to sign a first baseman, Kent Hrbek or Pete O'Brien, but failed in spite of their luxurious offers. They succeeded in their next quest, adding Moseby to their outfield, and they continue to survey the remaining field of free agents.
Reflecting on the $15.5 million offer to Hrbek, Campbell said, ''When you stop to think that we offered a kid three times more than Mr. Fetzer paid for the franchise in 1956 or 1957, it boggles your mind. But everything has gone up.''
Including the rating of the Tigers' connection to reality.
 
Gullickson Is No Ryan
A year ago the Houston Astros refused to give Nolan Ryan more than $1.2 million to extend his nine-year tenure with them. Not surprisingly, the remarkable right-hander bolted to the Rangers, where he surpassed the 5,000-strikeout plateau and pitched a series of near no-hitters.
Now the Astros sign a pitcher, Bill Gullickson, who has pitched in Japan the last two seasons, and they give him a guaranteed $900,000 and will pay him an instant $510,000 additional for a total of $1.41 million if he opens the season with them. Gullickson will also earn $13,000 for each start and $6,500 for each relief appearance. If he makes 30 starts, his bonus would total $390,000 for a neat package of $1.8 million.
 
Reds Look Down the Road
The Cincinnati Reds traded John Franco, their No. 1 relief pitcher, and continue to try to trade Tim Leary, one of their starting pitchers. The Reds wanted to find more late-inning relief work for Rob Dibble and thought it would be more harmonious to team him with Randy Myers than with Franco, the established veteran (Manager Lou Piniella saw first-hand that teaming Sparky Lyle with Rich (Goose) Gossage didn't work in the Yankees' bullpen in 1978).
The Reds, however, have other reasons for their trades. Franco was part of a significant contingent of front-line players who can be free agents after next season, and the cost of signing them all would be enormous. With Franco gone, the group includes Eric Davis, the team's No. 1 hitter; and Danny Jackson, Tom Browning and Leary, members of the starting rotation. The Reds can have Myers for three seasons before he can be a free agent.
 
SIGNS OF THE TIMES
 
In recent weeks, free agents and other players have signed contracts providing some of the biggest raises ever achieved in baseball. These have been the largest percentage increases, based on average annual value of their old and new contracts.

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Cunningham Still Hears About That Sweet Moment

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
This has been a particularly swinish season, even by the bullyragging standards of the National Football League. So many coaches and players have indulged in charges of cowardice, foul play and even bounty hunting that one amateur bacteriologist fears an outbreak of the dreaded ''Ditka virus.''
Fortunately, in the midst of this brutish business, one individual produced one scintillating play that saved the season almost single-handedly. Or single-footedly, in this case. 
Said effort took place last Sunday in a vital contest between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles, two old foes from the days when stalwarts played both offense and defense, if you can imagine that.
With the wind blowing garbage straight out of the toxic swamps of east Jersey, at right angles into the players' faces, last Sunday's game seemed destined to be decided by one epic play.
''That's the history between these two clubs,'' said Randall Cunningham, the Eagles' quarterback-historian.
That one play happened in the fourth period, after the Giants had pinned razzle-dazzle Randall on the 2-yard line. If this were a sport of versatility like soccer or rugby, one of the lads on the field would have had to boot the ball out of danger. But this is football, so one expected to see the quarterback trot obediently off the field and turn the punting over to an automaton.
But as the ball was snapped, one suddenly became aware that Cunningham himself was standing in the end zone. Before one could say ''Sammy Baugh,'' Cunningham had kicked a punt so pure, so true, that one suspected the network of providing sound effects: wooomp! Like a cannon.
The ball soared like something Roy Hobbs would have kicked if Bernard Malamud had made the Natural a footballer instead of a slugger-pitcher. It just took off, aided of course by the brutal wind, hypnotizing a young man named Meggett who wanted no part of that possibly radioactive object.
When it stopped rolling, the punt had traveled 91 official yards, third longest in history. Naturally, the Eagles won the game, after which the Giant coach, Bill Parcells, castigated young Meggett, his quarterback, Phil Simms, and a young lineman named Moore for allegedly having an anxiety attack that caused him to miss most of the game. Moore said it was the flu. Well, there's something going around this season. Ditka virus.
Since Sunday, Cunningham has discovered that everybody wants to talk about that collision between shoe leather and football leather. Quarterbacks, after all, don't do punts anymore.
''Yeah, everybody says, 'Good punt, good punt,' '' Cunningham admitted during a brief interlude from practice. ''I think it's one of those plays that people will remember, a play with special meaning.''
Cunningham should have been on the sidelines, talking with somebody in a baseball cap with a headset connection to coaches in the eaves. But John Teltschik had been injured, and Max Runager had been coaxed out of retirement, and Cunningham, once the nation's leading punter while at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, had been put in a state of ready alert.
''Before the game, Buddy told me he might want to run a fake punt,'' Cunningham said, referring to Buddy Ryan, the head coach. ''I said, 'Fine.' With the wind at our back, I signaled him that I wanted to punt.''
He had that increasingly rare instinct that he could get his team out of trouble one way or the other, like Larry Bird in a basketball huddle snarling, ''Just give me the doggone ball.''
''Everybody did their assignments,'' Cunningham said of the blocking. ''The snap came back and the wind affected it, made it dip real fast. I knew I hit it pretty hard, but it was not a good spiral and it wouldn't turn over.''
A baseball fan on the telephone asked Cunningham to compare the punt to a Reggie Jackson-Jose Canseco home run, sometimes referred to as ''getting all of it.'' Cunningham said, ''Gee, I don't know, I never played baseball,'' but he accepted the comparison to that rare tee shot when the golf ball feels that it might fly clear over Mount Blanc.
In a sense, that football is still airborne, sighted on every biff-bam-pow segment of the evening news, soaring like a runaway Sputnik or an eternal comet, in orbit forever. It gives us something to dream about when the going gets grubby, as it certainly has this season.
It was only a few years ago that Tom Boswell of The Washington Post gave us 99 Reasons Why Baseball Is Better Than Football. In these inflationary times, the list is now up to about 135.
In a sport always preaching teamwork and respect, Mike Ditka announced to the world that his Chicago team had quit a few games back. Joe Walton, the coach of the Jets, was offended when his running back, Freeman McNeil, was devastated at innocently destroying an opponent's knee.
The players have hardly been immune. Jim Burt, dropped by the Giants and picked up by the 49ers, said he would love to run over his old coach, Parcells, on some sideline, any sideline. Oh, yes, and Jim McMahon blew his nose at a reporter who had dared to ask him a question. That was a few months ago, but there has been no reaction from the Chargers or the league. Without instant replay, it appears, they are lost. Also, a Miami defender accused Ken O'Brien of the Jets of flinching at the goal line.
But far worse than a quarterback protecting his battered body was the crouch by the Players Association. After a few losses in court, the leaders announced that the association might decertify itself.
Another low moment came when Jimmy Johnson of the Dallas Cowboys, who combs his hair with buttered toast, said he had heard that Buddy Ryan had set a bounty on the Cowboys' quarterback and kicker. The N.F.L. says there's no proof of anything, but the two teams go at it again this afternoon and the league presumably has spotters all over the stadium to catch any bounty hits. Personally speaking, I'd rather see Randall Cunningham punt.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVE: Housing Rehabilitation;
The 'Turnkey' Approach Tried in Harlem

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IT is only one small building, but the transformation in progress at a vacant and rundown five-story walk-up at 460 Convent Avenue, at the corner of 150th Street in central Harlem, has something to say about the way gut-rehabilitated housing can be produced for low-income working people and the homeless in New York City.
The developer is Housing & Services, a nonprofit housing corporation. The builder is a small Queens contractor. The construction lender is the Atlantic Bank of New York. And the entity promising to provide the permanent mortgage for the 21 apartments when construction is finished is the State of New York, through the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
What is unusual about this project, as opposed to hundreds of similar ones being done for low- to moderate-income people in vacant, city-owned, tax-foreclosed buildings, is that it is being done on a ''turnkey'' basis: The project is guaranteed a permanent state mortgage of $1.6 million once it is completed to the agreed-upon specifications. The guarantee enabled the builder to obtain the construction loan. 
The ultimate owner, in this case, will be a nonprofit community corporation, the Genesis II Museum of International Black Culture. The beneficiaries will be 21 low-income families, 12 of them paying rent of $485 or $610 a month for one- or two-bedroom apartments, and eight paying welfare-rent allowances, currently $312 a month for a two-bedroom and $225 for a one-bedroom. One apartment is for the superintendent. The welfare families have ''very low'' incomes - under 30 percent of the median for the metropolitan area, or less than $10,000.
While this is only one small project, it is notable for the different approach it takes from the ones that New York City has adopted for a much bigger pipeline of housing it is gut-rehabilitating for the same income level of beneficiaries, including some who are in transitional facilities for the homeless.
The issues these projects raise have nothing to do with the availability of public money for the effort. In fact, more than enough money for production is already available from state and city sources to produce more units than the delivery system can effectively build. Delivery time is often interminable, especially in those programs designed and built entirely or in part to assist the homeless, and costs per unit are sometimes unacceptably high.
Facing a city-owned inventory of 53,000 vacant apartments when he took office as Housing Commissioner in 1986, Paul A. Crotty began to implement a $5.1 billion, 10-year housing plan that included efforts to recycle 53,000 vacant units. Under Mr. Crotty's successor, Abraham Biderman, 38,000 of these units have construction commitments or have reached the construction phase.
BUT a large part of the production is turning out to cost much more than expected. The original estimate for average hard costs - labor and materials - was $60,000 to $65,000 an apartment. But in the South Bronx, the 893 units that were contracted out to Lehrer McGovern Bovis as construction manager, with the Settlement Housing Fund as prospective manager, have been built to higher specifications and are producing hard costs of $90,000 an apartment, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development reports.
And 727 Harlem units, for which Tishman Construction Corporation is the construction manager and the New York City Housing Authority is the prospective manager, are turning out to have hard costs of at least $100,000 a unit.
The New York City Community Preservation Corporation, a bank consortium that is the principal construction lender for the vacant-building rehabilitations, has managed lower hard costs. Its technique, as an experienced construction lender for rehabilitations of both occupied and unoccupied buildings, has been to put owner-builders at financial risk of losing their profits if they do not finish within budget on time. If costs rise, the builder swallows the losses because the permanent loan, already committed, is fixed.
Over 15 years, the corporation has been construction and permanent lender for rehabilitations of 23,500 apartments, usually in occupied buildings. In the city's Vacant Building Program, one phase of the 10-year program, it is the financier as construction lender for 3,500 apartments being built or completed. Hard costs have averaged $56,000 an apartment.
The average city subsidy per apartment has been $36,000, usually in the form of a 1 percent loan. Rents are typically $150 to $175 a room a month, or $550 to $700 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. Consistency and uniformity in the development process have been essential for success, said Michael D. Lappin, president of the corporation.
He also says, and the state's turnkey project suggests it as well, that more low-overhead small builders can be drawn into the rehabilitation of city-owned buildings than have been so far. To keep costs down, they must risk losing profits if cost schedules are not met. After the job specifications are established, city reviewers should be out of the picture and the construction lender should supervise.
However, not many construction lenders are ready to accept the risks themselves. If there are cost overruns, who will bail them out if the permanent mortgage committed by the city, for example, is inadequate to cover building and operating costs?
Thus the state's turnkey approach may have limited application unless the state itself is ready to accept more risk through stronger guarantees to swallow cost overruns. The lenders will be timid, but Mr. Lappin thinks there is no shortage of willing builders. ''Initial concerns that there would not be a sufficient number of qualified builder-developers to undertake the projected scale of rebuilding of city-owned buildings have proven unfounded,'' he said.
According to builders, this can be achieved for very-low-income, debt-free housing, so long as the development process is free of bureaucratic delays and they get payments on dependable schedules and reliable construction specifications that are not altered during construction.
In Harlem, the state is experimenting with this approach in the Convent Avenue rehabilitation. The permanent-loan commitment of $1.69 million comes from appropriation of $128 million the Legislature set aside for turnkey gut-rehabilitations to benefit low-income people statewide.
The nonprofit developer, Housing & Services, evolved in 1987 into an independent concern to assist community organizations after years of work as an affiliate of the Vera Institute of Justice, with responsibility for finding housing for ex-offenders.
For the Convent Avenue project to work as a turnkey, said Claire Haaga, president of Housing & Services, the nonprofit developer needs site control from the city and an experienced, reliable contractor ''with whom we're comfortable working'' and a bank willing to provide construction financing. The budget, said Ms. Haaga, is tight.
The builder-contractor, Constantine D.& B. Ltd. of Queens., for a fee of $1.319 million, or $62,800 an apartment, will be obliged to complete the project within 13 months of the construction-loan closing this month with the Atlantic Bank. A hard-cost budget of $62,800 in a gut-rehabilitation is within the range of what the city and state agree is reasonable.
It has been possible for the small nonprofit developer with no equity assets to undertake such a project, said Ms. Haaga, largely because it had developed a successful relationship with an experienced contractor. The predevelopment period must be short - in this case five months - so the contractor can make realistic bids that will hold up by the time the construction loan was funded. Also, the contractor and construction lender must be confident of flexibility and quick decision-making from the developer during the construction process, she said. Adjustments are usually necessary.
On Convent Avenue, the total state mortgage commitment of $1.69 million, or $80,500 an apartment, allows $306,000 for soft costs, or $17,700 an apartment. This includes $5,700 an apartment for interest on the 11 percent construction loan, assuming the job is finished and turned over to the state in 12 months.
When projects drag out, total costs can go up ''another 20 percent easily'' - or to at least $100 a square foot, said Constantine Ioannou, president of Constantine D. & B. At $100 a square foot, it would cost the government $2 million to build 20 new debt-free apartments. Mr. Ioannou is a general contractor who has built market-rate condominiums in Harlem and is a regular customer of the Atlantic Bank.
When the construction lender has confidence in the contractor, it may be willing to make such a loan to a nonprofit developer that is not risking its own cash. But it will also need assurance that if there are cost overruns and the scenario fails, it will be able to foreclose and rent out the project at market rates sufficient to justify the loan. Without this assurance, the government probably will have to be ready to assume the risk, take over the project and swallow the loss.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Wallingford

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
INCORPORATED in 1670 on the same 39.6 square miles of the Quinnipiac River Valley that it occupies today, Wallingford is one of Connecticut's oldest towns and one of the most stable. The scent of its early agricultural economy still drifts downwind from the handful of remaining dairy farms where cows graze, withered cornstalks rustle in the wind and pumpkins dot the wintry fields.
Beginning in the 1830's, industrial growth focused largely on sterling silver and silver-plate manufacturing, giving Wallingford and its neighbor, Meriden, a monopoly on the country's silver production for more than a century.
After World War II the industry succumbed to competition from stainless steel and imports, and in 1986 the Wallace International Silver Company, the last of the major concerns, was bought out by the Syratech Corporation and moved to Syracuse.
A serious hole in the economy was averted over the last two decades by companies - among them Bristol-Myers, Northeast Datacom, American Cyanamid, Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation and Revere Aerospace - that settled into four new industrial parks and along the town's central north-south business strip between Route 15 and Interstate 91. 
The rest of Wallingford is residential, containing some 16,000 dwellings, of which fewer than 2,000 are condominiums.
From 1950 to 1970 the population doubled, to 36,000. Since then growth has slowed but is poised to take off again once the market improves because the town has more than 4,000 acres of vacant residentially zoned land. It also has comparatively low housing prices and a convenient location 10 miles north of New Haven, 25 miles south of Hartford and straddling I-91 and Route 15.
James McLaughlin, of McLaughlin Real Estate, whose company is one of 20 local real estate concerns, said ''the town can be likened to a shirt, with a collar that's half blue and half white.'' These days the white collars are gaining. ''More than half the buyers are from out of town,'' he said.
In 1986 minimum zoning in the eastern sector was increased to three acres as a protection for the watershed. This has forced the construction of larger homes at prices that local people can rarely afford. For the first time Wallingford homes are approaching the million-dollar mark and are finding buyers.
A 5-bedroom, 4,100-square-foot Tudor with a 20-foot-high, oak-beamed greatroom paneled in cherry, granite kitchen counters and marble and hardwood floors was recently sold for $900,000 by Geremia Development Corporation at its Turnberry Estates, a subdivision being built on Turnberry Road. ''In Greenwich this house would go for $2 million,'' Bryan Geremia, company president, said.
THIRTY lots on the 100-acre, cluster-zoned tract range from 1.5 to five acres. A three-acre vacant parcel recently sold for $225,000; a colonial was sold for $600,000 and a Cape Cod is available for $745,000. A million dollar-plus home will be built in the spring.
Twelve homes at Woodlands, a clustered subdivision of 58 lots on 75 acres off Mansion Road, have been sold for $330,000 to $410,000 with four bedrooms and up to 3,600 square feet. Homes at Countryside East off Pond Hill Road sell for around $240,000.
A 252-unit condominium complex called Judd Square, almost completed at 42 South Cherry Street, was converted from a century-old drapery-rod factory.
''The buildings are like the Rock of Gibraltar, with 16-inch-thick walls,'' said Theodore Lendler, a partner in Judd Associates, developers of the $20 million project.
Old areaways have been turned into landscaped atriums with access from common hallways. One- and two-bedroom units of 900 to 1,100 square feet are selling for $72,000 to $99,000 and the developers offer mortgages at 6 percent based on a 30-year amortization, with a balloon payment of the balance in 10 years.
A condominium conversion of 120 units by a local developer, Donald Ahearn, on Parker Street is called Parker Perry. The former wire factory, built in 1882, has units at $80,000 to $100,000. Mr. Ahearn also built a number of rental projects, including 112 two-bedroom units at The Towers, off Harrison Road. Prices average around $500 a month for 1,100 square feet.
There are also more than 200 resales, which are priced from $120,000 to $350,000-plus, with the largest percentage in the $150,000 to $250,000 range. Prices are more than one-third less than for comparable homes in Fairfield County.
While 1,200-square-foot, 30-year-old Cape Cods at $120,000 are too expensive for local first-time buyers, they are not for young people from other towns. Louise Denegre Josun, a Hartford lawyer, moved to a 100-year-old house on Fair Street three months ago with her husband, a teacher in New Haven. ''We grew up in Cheshire - now outside our price range and too suburban,'' Mrs. Josun said. ''Here we have parks, shopping, the library, all within walking distance.''
She hopes that her street will be included in a proposed historic district of 17th- to early 20th-century homes along Main Street, so far stalled because of homeowners' fears of restrictions. ''The Choate campus I think helps stabilize the neighborhood,'' said Mrs. Josun, which she described as ''taking a step back in time - a close-knit atmosphere with a sense of community. You don't get much of that any more.''
Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school where tuition, room and board are $14,800 a year, occupies 400 acres on Christian Street. Few local families can afford Choate, which is coed and the only private school in town, but the public school system, with 6,000 pupils in 7 elementary, 2 middle and 2 high schools is well regarded.
SIX years ago the town began a differentiated diploma program, in which high-school students may take more difficult English and math exams each year, qualifying them for a differentiated diploma, ''a certificate indicating that they have gone that extra step,'' said Clelia Tenerowicz, assistant superintendent for curriculum. About 65 percent of Wallingford's students go to college.
In a partnership with Bristol-Myers, the high schools run eight-week summer programs for advanced math and science students.
New Haven's theaters, restaurants and museums provide most of Wallingford's cultural and night life, except for concerts by the Wallingford Symphony Orchestra and theatrical productions housed in the Paul Mellon Center for the Arts on the Choate campus. In addition, the Oakdale Summer Musical Theater in Wallingford features concerts by such name entertainers as Julie Andrews and Kenny Rogers.
The newest gathering spot is a Super Stop and Shop supermarket that opened a few months ago on Route 5, where townspeoplemeet friends and socialize on Saturday mornings.
Golfers pay initiation fees of $4,500 and $7,500 respectively at the Wallingford Golf Club and Farms Country Club. The Farms Club also offers tennis and a swimming pool. Annual dues are $3,200 and memberships are for families only. At times there is a seven-year waiting list. Family dues at the Wallingford Golf Club are about $1,300, less for singles. Admission takes about a year. An 18-hole golf course open to the public on the grounds of the Pilgrims Harbor condominiums on Harrison Road charges $8 and $12 daily, depending on the day and time. Annual memberships are $1,000 to $1,300.
There is no charge for use of the town's 11 public tennis courts or for many of the 145 recreation programs, from belly dancing to hockey. Walking trails cover 15 miles through some of the eight parks. Scuba diving lessons at the high-school pool cost $80, swimming in the outdoor community pool - as big as two football fields side by side - costs $4 a season and aerobics with free baby-sitting is $35 for 40 classes in eight weeks.

Around 1900, when the girls outgrew their quarters, they were given a free site in Greenwich, establishing Rosemary Hall School for Girls. In 1974 the girls moved back, occupying a new Choate complex. Among the female graduates are the actresses Jamie Lee Curtis and Glenn Close. To mark its 100th anniversary in 1990, the school will dedicate a new science building donated by Mr. Mellon and designed by I. M. Pei.

HEADLINE: Taping Suit Perplexed By Who Was Wronged

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
HALF a dozen lawyers from around the state gathered at the Attorney General's Office in Hartford last month to open the book on a series of narrow legal questions that will reverberate in Connecticut through 1990 and perhaps beyond: How many people might have had their telephone conversations improperly recorded by the state police over the last 15 years? And how are they to be notified that they might have been wronged?
If a person was arrested by the state police and later acquitted, can sealed records be reopened to send the formal legal notices required under Federal court rules? Finally, how are all the groups of possible victims - from state troopers calling their wives or husbands to defendants calling their attorneys - to be divided for legal representation when the case finally comes before a judge?
Lawyers for both sides said the questions, although technical, will form a key framework for the civil lawsuit filed last month in Federal District Court in Bridgeport against the state police by the 200-member Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. Specifically, the questions will determine whether the case will become a class-action suit, and if so, what classes or groups of plaintiffs will be eligible to participate. 
The suit was filed after the state police taping system came to light during pre-trial testimony in a manslaughter trial in Waterbury in late October. It charges that the state police violated the United States Constitution by depriving defendants of an unfettered right to legal advice and the Federal wiretapping laws by taping other parties without their knowledge.
 
F.B.I. Takes a Look
The 982-member police force has also come under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's office, which has taken custody of tens of thousands of hours of tapes made at the 12 state police barracks in Connecticut. The State Public Safety Commissioner, Col. Lester J. Forst, has resigned under pressure from Gov. William A. O'Neill and the No. 2 official at the state police, Lieut. Col. John Mulligan, has been demoted.
Taping policies at four municipal police departments - Milford, Torrington, Wallingford and Willimantic - are also being scrutinized in the Federal investigation, and at least eight other local departments have been identified by the state as having the technical capability to record calls improperly.
Lawyers and state officials say that although much remains unknown about whether top officials violated civil or criminal laws, putting together the broad classes of people who may have had their rights violated will be an important first step in determining the extent of the taping.
''You've got individual troopers; you've got former troopers, retired troopers, dispatchers who are employees of the state police but not troopers,'' said Garrett M. Moore, a Waterbury lawyer who is representing the police troopers union in the class-certification discussions. ''Then you've got to look at those who have been arrested. You've got bail bondsmen, vendors who filled the soda machine at the barracks and called the boss to find out about the next stop. Stranded motorists. There are classes and subclasses.''
Lawyers involved in the discussions say the main variable in defining the groups is information. They said that although the police began taping telephone calls from police barracks in 1974, it is not known yet what records exist from that time or how many names can be culled from the files. Finding out how much information exists will also affect the cutoff date for the suit. In other words, will the suit cover callers taped from 1974 to the present, or from 1980 to the present, or some other date?
What could severely limit the flow of information are the state laws already on the books that are designed to protect some criminal defendants. For example, a person convicted of drunken driving who volunteers for an accelerated rehabilitation program has his record officially expunged of the conviction - that is, in fact, a key inducement encouraging people to take the option. Lawyers also said that although Federal court rules require personal notification if at all possible in class-action cases, some people would probably not want to come forward.
''Suppose a guy was arrested for solicitation in 1983 and never told his wife,'' said one lawyer involved in the talks who asked not to be identified. ''Now we send a letter, and she says, 'What's this?' ''
Another variable is knowledge. Under Federal wiretapping law, it is legal to tape telephone conversations if at least one party in the call knows the tape is rolling, a caveat that allows police agencies across the country to tape emergency 911 calls, for example, as long as operators know that while on the job, their conversations with the public will be recorded. That issue puts the state police troopers union in a special class, since the existence of the system was known within the force, and lawyers for the state are expected to argue that most troopers knew and are therefore ineligible.
Underlying much of the class-certification issue is strategy. Although lawyers for the state police declined to comment on the class-certification discussions, other participants said they thought the state would probably cooperate with the Defense Lawyers Association in defining at least some classes as broadly as possible.
 
Compromises Expected
They said they expected some compromise in restricting how far back in time to take the suit's coverage, but that the state would also have some motivation to avoid lots of individual suits by lumping as many plaintiffs as possible into this one case. Lawyers for the state police are from the Attorney General's office and from a private law firm retained by state insurers as co-counsel.
One lawyer who has so far filed two individual suits against the state police, John R. Williams, says he thinks such broad classes may benefit of state. Although the potential financial liability would increase with broadly defined classes, he said, many individuals can fall through the cracks, leaving the final number of plaintiffs lower than if the classes were small and intense efforts were made to notify all would-be participants.
''One of the problems with class-action suits is that it is often too difficult to notify everyone, so they cut corners,'' Mr. Williams said. For example, he said, newspaper notices, a common method of notifying people, would likely be missed by large numbers of undereducated people from lower socio-economic groups who comprise a disproportionate number of the those arrested by the police.
''People can get easily lost,'' said Mr. Williams, who plans to file two more individual Federal suits against the state this week on behalf of former criminal defendants. ''I hope that won't happen, but there's always a danger.''
 
Question of Intent
Regardless of who becomes involved in the suit, lawyers for both sides said the real crux of the taping issue will concern the question of intent. Under Federal law, a person who intentionally tapes a telephone call without the knowledge of either party is guilty of a civil offense punishable by a minimum $10,000 fine for each violation. If the person who made the tape is found to have had intentions to use the material for improper purposes - getting leads for criminal investigations, for example - the violation becomes a criminal offense punishable by up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
According to a report presented to Mr. O'Neill last month by the Attorney General, Clarine Nardi Riddle, the Chief State's Attorney, John J. Kelly, and Mr. O'Neill's legal counsel, Howard G. Rifkin, the state police essentially blundered and mismanaged its way through 15 years of taping policies to a point where some privileged conversations between lawyers and their clients were violated. But the report, based on 3,500 pages of memos and interviews with 14 past and present senior state police officers, said the police had no intent to use or abuse the information that the tape machines gathered.
Since the study was released, reports of taping by other police agencies around the country have increased the likelihood that Connecticut's story may not be unique. According to a report in The Hartford Courant, the state police in West Virginia has routinely taped telephone conversations between suspects and their families or lawyers for as long as 20 years. The article also said some local police departments in Georgia and New Mexico had been accused of improper surveillance of converations between lawyers and their clients.
In issuing the report on the taping practices of the Connecticut state police, Ms. Riddle stressed that it was not the final word on the case, because the other investigations were still in progress. Responses from critics of the report also indicated that its conclusions would continue to be debated. For example, United States Representative John G. Rowland, who is considered the front-runner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination next year, has already begun using the taping issue against Mr. O'Neill.
''It was not credible to have the administration investigating the administration,'' he said in a statement after the report was released. ''Who was responsible for this policy? We still do not know.''

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Ballot Questions Provide A Lesson For All

BYLINE: By Finn M. W. Casperson; Finn M. W. Caspersen, chairman of the Beneficial Corporation, is a member of the New Jersey Corporate Alliance for Intelligent Growth, a coalition of leading business organizations participating in public review of the proposed New Jersey State Plan for Development and Redevelopment.

 BODY:
RARELY receiving the intense attention focused on the vote for candidates, the outcome on ballot questions can be an equally telling test of the mood of the electorate.
Their mood was tested in New Jersey on Election Day by five important bond questions worth $890 million.
In this period of marked fiscal constraint and diminished public resources, voters decisively approved all five. The issues will pay for critical programs for the environment, including farmland and open space preservation and clean water, and for human services and corrections facilities. 
This sweeping affirmation shows solid support for government investment in long-term planning to meet needs that citizens see as clearly as their elected officials do.
The questions appeared on the ballot in plain language with no lip reading required, and the voters spoke loudly and clearly in their favor.
The result speaks emphatically to acute public awareness of the balance between public needs and resources, and the expanding private marketplace. It demonstrates that a public in possession of the kind of financial-impact information it needs and should have does not shirk from a commitment to the general good.
Taken together, the decisive judgment on the referendums demonstrates that New Jersey's public has a universal understanding of the impact of growth and sound policies to address them.
In every case, the bond financing makes only partial payment of the cost to accomplish all that needs to be done. Still, each bond issue addressed a significant public need, which implicitly or explicitly, and by more than mere coincidence, reflects aspects of the State Plan for Development and Redevelopment.
The plan is a massive and complex prescription for a state guide to growth.
In the spirited debate about the plan, the bond votes offer a lesson about participation by an informed public and its appreciation for the line at the bottom of public policy.
But where the bond issues told the public the exact cost and the conditions for spending the authorized funds, the plan lacks similar clarity. It sets out needs, obligations and policies without stating their cost.
At the heart of the plan lies concern for preserving as much of New Jersey as can be protected in its natural form. That is an overriding goal and a daunting task in the nation's most densely populated state.
A substantial unanswered question concerns the need for an accounting of the economic impact of the plan. Another concern is for public access to the process by which the plan is moving toward adoption by the State Planning Commission and its working arm, the Office of State Planning.
The plan will never go before the voters in a referendum like the bond issues. But parts of it may as it engenders new proposals to capitalize public policies.
The greater opportunity the public has to comment and to know that its comments are reflected in the final document, the greater chance the plan will have to gain public support.
Informed comment calls for information. The public needs to know what the costs will be to government and so ultimately to itself as individual voters and taxpayers. It is the kind of knowledge that the election showed the public can handle when it has the information.
To accomplish its goals for growth management, New Jersey is going to have to ask the voters to say yes to other bond issues in the future. Let's start to talk now about what they will do and what they will cost.

HEADLINE: Stormy Exchanges Over Fate of City Manager in New Rochelle

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
NEW ROCHELLE, the self-appointed ''Queen of the Sound,'' was delighted last summer when a publication crowned it the city with the best prospects in the state for economic success in the l990's.
The editors of the Empire State Report, which analysed conditions in New York's 20 largest cities, hedged its findings by saying that even ''a high-scoring city could be harmed by indecision or bickering.'' In New Rochelle today, that warning has a prescient ring to it.
Two weeks ago, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to suspend the City Manager, C. Samuel Kissinger, a l5-year veteran of city government. The Council majority charged that Mr. Kissinger had failed to keep Council members informed and to implement City Council directives, and had mismanaged David's Island, a proposed $1 billion luxury condominium development. 
 
An Injunction Is Obtained
Mr. Kissinger, who said he would oppose an effort to dismiss him, won a court injunction last Wednesday that barred the City Council from taking any further action on the matter until this week. Arguments in the case will be heard at 9:30 A.M. tomorrow, before Supreme Court Justice Gordon W. Burrows in White Plains.
The injunction prevented discussion of Mr. Kissinger at a special meeting of the City Council that had been called by Mayor Leonard C. Paduano for last Wednesday evening. The agenda for the meeting would have included Mr. Kissinger's rebuttal to the charges made against him by the Council and then a vote by the Council on a proposal to dismiss Mr. Kissinger as City Manager.
The effort to remove the City Manager was led by the outgoing Democratic Councilman, Robert Schaefer, who said his actions had been prompted by a recent auditors' report. The report criticized accounting procedures at the city's agency for affordable housing, the New Rochelle Neighborhood Revitalization Corporation.
The review found that $77,500 was unaccounted for and that lawyers' fees of $266,200 had not been paid.
Calling the Neighborhood Redevelopment Corporation ''horribly mismanaged,'' Mr. Schaefer blamed the City Manager. He said Mr. Kissinger's ''nonfeasance'' and ''negligence'' were ''adequate grounds for dismissal.'' Mr. Schaefer, who has served on the City Council for nine years, did not seek re-election in November.
But Mr. Kissinger's suspension has been strongly opposed by two of the five Council members - Linda J. Levine, a Democrat, and Don Zaccagnino, a Republican-Conservative - as well as an incoming Democratic Council member, Ruth Kitchen.
These three argue that the housing agency is the responsibility of the City Council. They characterized the suspension of Mr. Kissinger as a move for power by a lame-duck coalition and said the coalition was reacting more to the coming changes in the makeup of the City Council than to any substantive information.
These two Council members and Mrs. Kitchen have issued a joint statement promising to ''remove anyone forced upon us by this lame-duck coalition.'' But the current majority, which includes Mayor Leonard C. Paduano, a Republican; Dr. Francis. X. Judge 2d, a Republican; and Mr. Schaefer, believe they are empowered to hire a permanent replacement.
 
The Right to Fire and Hire
''At this late date, we probably won't find anyone top notch,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ''But if someone is found who is marvelous, why should I disagree?''
Mayor Paduano said, ''The charter says the Council has the right to fire the city manager, period.'' He added that the current Council also had the right to hire a new manager immediately.
''Mr. Schaefer has the duty to the day he leaves office to do what is right for the city of New Rochelle,'' Mayor Paduano said. ''Just because he has 30 or 40 days to go doesn't mean he can't think properly.''
 
'A Travesty on Government'
In their statement, the minority members of the City Council called the decision to remove Mr. Kissinger ''irresponsible,'' and its timing ''critically damaging'' to a city that is just beginning talks on its $60 million budget and has just installed a new Director of Development.
''This is a travesty on government,'' said Mrs. Kitchen, who ran in the November election on a platform of strong support for the city manager and received a l,500-vote plurality over her nearest rival.
''There was no question about where I stood with the voters,'' Mrs. Kitchen said last week. ''Bob Schaefer stole the mandate of the election. What a way to go out with a bang.''
The current bickering about the City Manager reflects the Council's own indecision and lack of direction, Councilwoman Levine said, as well as a response to constituents' frustrations. ''There has been little movement in New Rochelle for the past l0 years,'' Mrs. Levine said. She described the city as one in which ''a deteriorating downtown has continued to deteriorate while other areas have been overdeveloped.''
Traffic and density has increased along Pelham Road, one of the city's main arteries, and will increase more even though the tax base has not grown. Residents, she said, feel ''they have given up their peace and quiet and a place to park, while gaining little.''
The Council, in Ms. Levine's view, has felt pressured to accept developer's proposals without requesting changes. ''Several members feel if we don't accept the proposals as is, we won't get anything,'' she said.
 
Looking for Someone to Blame
With opposition from residents to such projects as the David's Island development and the expansion of the New Rochelle Mall, the Council members are looking for someone to blame, Ms. Levine suggested. But blaming the City Manager, she said, was ''wrong, completely.'' ''He does what his bosses, all five of us, tell him to do,'' she said. ''If we do not direct, he does not manage.''
''Our job is to set policy, and it's the City Manager's job to carry it out,'' Mr. Schaefer responded. ''For the last two years, I urged the City Manager to check the management procedures of the housing agency but he refused.''
Saying he had planned ''to fade into the sunset'' at the end of his term, Mr. Schaefer explained that ''when this report came out, we had to do something Mr. Kissinger should have done in the first place.''
 
Whose Responsibility?
The Neighborhood Revitalization Corporation, Mr. Kissinger said last week, is not his responsibility under the bylaws of the City Charter. ''If you are interested in my being involved,'' Mr. Kissinger said he told Mr. Schaefer, ''get a Council resolution passed; because without the authority, I have no responsibility.''
He planned to fight his dismissal, Mr. Kissinger said, because he is proud of his 15-year record as City Manager and because he likes the job.
In the last decade, he said, reviewing some his accomplishments,half a million square feet of new office space or rehabilitated commercial space was created in the city; 300,000 square feet of industrial space was renovated; and 700 new condominiums were built.
''Our bond rating has been maintained at A1, our financial house is in order and our government has operated without scandal,'' Mr. Kissinger said. ''I'm proud of my record, and I want to remain the City Manager.''
 
Support From Business
Mr. Kissinger has received strong support from the city's business community. Some business leaders said last week that they were concerned that the dispute in the City Council threatens the growing interest in development in New Rochelle and could delay a number of planned projects.
The city is involved in three major development projects. There is the proposed $1 billion David's Island condominium development off the coast, a $300 million urban-renewal effort in the vicinity of the present railroad station, and the $30 million expansion of the new Rochelle Mall. The mall plan includes a 12-screen cinema complex and a 188,700-square-foot office building; it was approved by the City Council last month.
Sidney Mudd has for l4 years served as president of the New Rochelle Development Council, an organization of business people that was created toform a partnership with the city in an effort to stop its economic decline.
''We are on the very threshold of many things that will make the development of New Rochelle finally come true,'' Mr. Mudd said. The firing of the City Manager would produce ''a chaotic condition and will set things back considerably,'' he added. ''Developers will look askance and say, there goes New Rochelle again.''

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN;
Caribbean Choices, Grand and Budget

BYLINE: By STANLEY CARR

 BODY:
For some travelers heading for the Caribbean islands and the Bahamas, the goal is a grand resort that in one way or another offers what is perceived to be the best: comfort, elegance, service and, for some guests at least, sports facilities that are either a few steps away or easily arranged. For others, just being where the sea water is 75 degrees when it's snowing up north may matter more than luxury.
The following survey of islands from Anguilla to Virgin Gorda focuses on opportunities for savoring some of the grandest - and most expensive - resorts and settling in at smaller hotels and inns where hedonism may be less well defined but where vacations are often enjoyed just as much at lower cost. Accommodations in the budget category are generally $100 or less a day for two, sometimes with meals included. The information here is based on information gathered from reports from the islands in the last few weeks and includes such upscale hideaways as Sandy Lane in Barbados, the Tryall in Jamaica and Guanahani on St. Barthelemy. Budget choices range from the Frangipani on Bequia in the Grenadines, the Sea Breeze on the Dutch side of St. Martin and Scout's Place on Saba. 
Not all the islands, of course, have major hostelries to match those on the busier islands. Little Saba, for example, is among places where rates for the most expensive are little more than relatively modest lodgings on other shores. The 10-room Captain's Quarters, one of Saba's most comfortable places, charges $110 a day for two, including Continental breakfast. Elsewhere in the islands, in some hotels, a standard room at around $100 may fit the budget category while a neighboring suite at the same resort may cost twice as much. Luxury, of course, is seen differently, so travelers with specific expectations should check with a travel agent or hotel before booking.
Some islands have had good news along with the memory - and its effect on the public consciousness - of Hurricane Hugo. Hugo may have blown away three months ago, but its aftereffects still hover. Just how much damage it will inflict on the high season, which begins officially next Friday, is difficult to predict. But many tour packagers, travel agents and vacationers now busy making reservations realize that only some of the islands were badly mauled by the storm.
The hurricane swept through the eastern Caribbean from Dominica to Puerto Rico. Other islands badly hit were the United States Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix), the British Virgin Islands (Tortola and Virgin Gorda), Guadeloupe, St. Kitts-Nevis and Montserrat, which at the best of times has fewer than 100 hotel rooms, although it has several rental villas as well. These islands (except St. Croix) and others have announced that many hotels will be open either at the start of the season or soon after, but not all their rooms will be available. Many are still being repaired or renovated. Vigorous cleanup operations on islands where there was severe damage have in some cases gone a long way toward regaining normal conditions.
They are the islands where air service is being improved this season. Direct or, better still, nonstop flights attract more visitors. Cayman Airways begins nonstop flights to Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands from New York on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from Dec. 15. Martinique and Guadeloupe are to have nonstop service from New York on Saturdays and Sundays starting Dec. 16. The carrier is Minerve Airlines, a French charter company that has been flying to the French Caribbean from Paris for several years. Grenada, an island recovering not from the storm - which roared north of it - but from its political upheaval in 1983, had a disappointment. American Airlines said it would start daily direct flights from New York to the island via San Juan from Jan. 31, then postponed the plan until June.
On islands that did suffer damage, there will be fewer rooms than usual, at least in the early part of the season. The Long Bay Hotel on Tortola, for example, had about 25 of its 48 rooms in service two weeks ago and did not expect to have them all in use until January. On St. John, the Caneel Bay recently reported that of its 170 rooms, 60 were in use. In St. Croix, where hundreds of homes were devastated, a few hotels are open and several plan to be by the end of this month, but few tourists are expected.
Tourist officials emphasize that most islands were either not hit by the storm or suffered only cosmetic damage that has been mostly repaired.
Unless otherwise stated, the room rates given in this report are for a double room per day. Many hotels also offer M.A.P (Modified American Plan), providing breakfast and lunch or dinner at an additional daily cost. Throughout the Caribbean, government room taxes are added to hotel bills and these vary from 5 to 10 percent. Some hotels also add a service charge, generally from 5 to 12 percent.

Overview
Weddings and tennis are talking points on this eel-shaped British colony close to St. Martin. Officials say there has been such a marked increase in nonresident marriage ceremonies that a store and a travel agency - the Sunshine Lady and Malliouhana Travel and Tours, both in The Valley, the main town - are acting as counselors and suppliers for couples arranging weddings and receptions. Ceremonies are held on beaches and in resorts as well as in churches. A fact sheet outlining marriage regulations and requirements has been issued by the tourist board.
The 16-mile-long island goes into this winter with tennis courts, including several lighted for night play, at 13 of the hotels. One of the larger resorts, the Cap Juluca, for example, now has three courts, and several smaller properties like Rendezvous Bay and Cinnamon Reef also have them. The growth in the sport has prompted a plan to run an island-wide tennis program, but it is likely to be a summer rather than a winter event. An inter-resort tournament for residents and visitors is scheduled for next July. Cap Juluca is planning to add a spectator court.
An official said Anguilla escaped serious damage from the hurricane and sent building supplies and light poles to Montserrat and St. Kitts and Nevis to help with repairs on those islands.
 
Accommodations
Cap Juluca, the clifftop Malliouhana - with its Moorish design - and Coccoloba Plantation, all with about 50 rooms, are among the island's grander places. At Cap Juluca winter room rates start at $395 a day, including Continental breakfast. The hotel will introduce two three-bedroom and three five-bedroom villas, each with its own pool, this season, renting at $1,100 and $1,700 a day. Pimm's, the resort's restaurant, has added 30 waterside seats. Malliouhana's daily rates start at $420 and Coccoloba's at $325. Coccoloba's rates include Continental breakfast. Both of these resorts have expanded their restaurants.
Among places with lower prices is the Rendezvous Bay, where hotel rates start at $100. It has just added two villas with rates from $175. Anguilla also has some family-run guesthouses offering accommodations without frills. Rates at the Inter Island, at Lower South Hill, which attracts many scuba divers and students, are $50 a day for one of its 12 rooms; rates at Yellow Banana, in Stoney Ground, also with 12 rooms, are $30, and at Casa Nadine, in The Valley, 4 rooms, $25.

Overview
Antigua and its small sister island of Barbuda (with 55 hotel rooms) begin the winter season with all its hotels and tourist facilities in operation despite the hurricane, which disrupted electricity and water supplies for a few days and blocked some roads. Repairs have been completed at hotels that were damaged.
A new restaurant and nightclub will provide added interest to visitors. The French Quarter on Runaway Bay, named from the New Orleans section, will offer Cajun Creole specialties as part of its menu. After dinner and continuing till sunrise, the nightclub will usher in some New Orleans atmosphere with jazz played by some of Antigua's finest musicians. A new hotel, the K-Club Resort on Barbuda, will also open its doors, offering 24 bungalows, a nine-hole golf course and two tennis courts.
Among older attractions are the restored Nelson's Dockyard, a base for modern yachtspeople, which also includes a museum and the Georgian Clarence House, the remains of Fort Berkely nearby and, in St. John's, Government House and the Cathedral.
 
Accommodations

ARUBA
 
521 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10175
(212-246-3030)
 
Overview
This Dutch island with an average winter temperature of 82 degrees has miles of white-sand beaches and dozens of natural sites such as Crystal Mountain (where attractive pieces of quartz may be found), wildlife preserves and caves containing murals painted by Arawak Indians more than 500 years ago. The main street of the capital, Oranjestad, has just been turned into a modern mall, eight blocks long, containing about 90 clothing, jewelry and other shops. A free bus serves the mall from most major hotels. At night, the high-rise resorts offer casinos, dancing and floor shows.

(212-758-2777)
 
Overview
The islands of New Providence and Paradise Island, known to most as Nassau and Grand Bahama (site of Lucaya and Freeport) include large tourist cities with big hotels and casinos. These attract most visitors to the Bahamas but the chain consists of more than 700 islands, most of them unihabited. In the Abacos, to the northeast of the more popular centers, the main island of Abaco and many smaller cays appeal to visitors usually more interested in fishing, diving and sailing than in the night life and shopping of Nassau and Freeport. To the southeast are the Exumas, more remote and less populated but with excellent fishing and spectacular reefs. On the smaller islands most hotels have no telephones or televisions in the rooms. Most of the communication is by radio.
 
Accommodations
Among the grand hotels is the Ocean Club (809-363-2501 or 800-321-3000) on Paradise Island, a bridge-span's distance from the lights of Nassau. The grounds are elegant with formal gardens and cloisters on the harbor side and white beaches on the ocean. The property dates from the 1930's when a Swedish industrialist began developing what was then called Hog Island. It was later bought by Huntington Hartford, the A.&.P. heir, who brought in the cloisters and had them reassembled and had the gardens planted in the tradition of Versailles. The pink hotel with 18-hole golf course and 9 clay tennis courts has 71 rooms and villas. Prices start at $190. Men should wear jackets in the dining rooms.
Harbour Island is a little community off the northeast coast of Eleuthera. Many feel its two-and-a-half-mile beach of powdery pink sand is the best in the Caribbean. Dunmore Town, one of the oldest communities in the Bahamas, looks like a small New England town in pastel with picket fences and gingerbread porches. The Pink Sands (809-333-2030 or 914-241-8770) faces 900 feet of ocean beach and sits on 16 acres of a tropical bird reserve. The 45 guest rooms are in a collection of stone or wood cottages spread thoughout the property. Pink Sands is low key for those looking to relax; coats are not required for dinner and children are welcome. There are three hard-surface tennis courts, and fishing, sailing and skin diving can be arranged. Bicycles and golf carts are the prime transporation and are available for runs around the two-square-mile island. Rooms with three meals range from $275 to $325 a day.
Windermere Island Club (809-322-2538 or 212-839-0222 or 800-237-1236) is on private Windermere Island, which is connected to Eleuthera by a bridge. The resort has 37 beachfront rooms or suites and 20 private villas on the beach, some with private pools. The resort offers tennis, water skiing, volleyball, windsurfing and barbecues on two beaches. Prices start at $320, breakfast and dinner included.
In the less expensive category is the Stella Maris on Long Island, 90 miles long and 5 miles across at its widest, at the southern tip of the Exumas. Here the pace is slow and the fishing and diving excellent. The Stella Maris (meaning Star of the Sea) Inn and Estates (809-336-2106 or 800-426-0466) sits on a bluff overlooking the ocean and offers 60 rooms in the hotel, cottages and apartments. There is swimming, sailing, deep-sea and bonefishing, cycling, boat cruises, tennis and weekly cave and cocktail parties, and the diving program is exceptional. Rooms start at $96; a two-bedroom villa for four people is $240.
In Georgetown on the island of Great Exuma the pace quickens considerably during regattas in the early spring when sailing yachts gather from all over the Bahamas. There another cheaper hotel, the Peace and Plenty (809-336-2551 or 800-525-2210), has 32 rooms overlooking the bay (a good vantage point for the races). Boats ferry guests twice a day to Stocking Island to swim and explore the beaches.
Diving and fishing (both deep-sea and bonefishing) can be arranged through the hotel. Rates begin at $98 a night.
The island of Green Turtle Cay is across the bay from Great Abaco and is home to the Green Turtle Club (809-376-2572). The 32-room hotel is a five-minute walk from the beach. Fishing and diving trips can be arranged at the hotel, and small motorboats are available to explore nearby islands. As in most of the restaurants in the area, dress for dinner is less casual (jackets not required) but reservations are a must. Most restaurants have only one sitting, and dinner is ordered when reservations are made. Room rates start at $140.
 
Transportation
From New York on Bahamasair (from Newark), T.W.A. and Pan Am (Kennedy) and Delta (La Guardia). Bahamasair flies from Nassau and Freeport to the Family Islands. USAir, Bahamasair, Eastern and Continental fly into the Governor's Harbour or Rock Sound airports on Eleuthera from either Fort Lauderdale or Miami.

DOMINICA
 
CARIBBEAN TOURISM ASSOCIATION
20 EAST 46TH STREET, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017
(212-682-0435)
 
Overview
This island of jungle-covered mountains that has always attracted nature lovers was hit by Hurricane Hugo. The Coconut Beach Hotel was badly damaged but is now open and accepting reservations for the winter. A number of other hotels, particularly in the north, were flooded, and roads blocked by fallen trees. The main devastation was to the farms: 70 percent of the banana crop was destroyed.
Bird watching, scuba diving and hiking are popular, and some visitors explore on rented jeeps and mopeds. Driving is on the left and steering wheels on the right, so it is necessary to take a driving test at the Police Traffic Department in the capital, Roseau, before being allowed to drive on the narrow roads. A new dive and water-sports center, designed to serve the entire island and expected to be ready for the season, is being built on the grounds of the Castaways Beach Hotel.
A $6 exit tax, payable in United States dollars, is collected at the airport.
 
Accommodations
Dominica's hotels are small and it does not have luxury accommodations. The Castaways (809-449-6244), 13 miles from Roseau, charges $100 for a double room.

Overview
Though manufactured goods have joined minerals and agriculture in the republic's economy, tourism remains the largest industry. The country occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola (shared with Haiti) occupies 18,700 miles and has a population of about 6.5 million. It boasts the most guest rooms in the Caribbean, more than 16,000, in hotels, inns and guesthouses.
The principal areas visited by tourists are Puerto Plata and Santo Domingo, which both have casinos, Sosua, Punta Cana, Juan Dolio, Boca Chica, Samana and La Romana. In the Puerto Plata resort area in the north, the casinos, beaches and skylift are among the attractions. Sosua, set behind a white sand beach, is a quiet town where in 1940 Jewish refugees of World War II were welcomed. Altos de Chavon in La Romana is an artists' retreat that has a branch of the Parsons School of Design. The Shrine to Our Lady of Altagracia is in Higuey, east of Santo Domingo, where pilgrimages are made by the faithful every Jan. 21 to honor this patron saint of the Dominican Republic. On Feb. 27, half a million people will parade for Independence Day on the capital's seafront boulevard, called the Malecon.
On arrival in the Dominican Republic, visitors must purchase a $10 tourist card and, on departure, pay a $10 exit tax, both in United States dollars.
 
Accommodations
Service tax of 10 percent plus government tax of 11 percent are added to room bills. In restaurants, 10 percent service tax and 6 percent government tax are added to checks. All-inclusive hotel rates usually include these taxes, but vacationers should ask before booking. Some of the hotels overlap both the grand and budget categories. In some places, a standard room could be classified as budget while the cost of a neighboring suite is far more expensive.
In the east of the country, on a white sand beach, is the Punta Cana Beach Resort. This secluded 105-acre estate beside a coral reef has 10 clay-surface tennis courts with day and night play. Visits are arranged to nearby working cattle ranches and Taino and Arawak Indian burial grounds. Nature walks and seaside horseback riding are also available, as well as wind surfing, sailing, snorkeling and water skiing. Deep-sea fishing and scuba-diving expeditions can also be arranged. Rates with breakfast and dinner range from $156 a night for a double room to $408 for a three bedroom suite. Reservations: I.T.R., 212-545-8469; 800-223-9815.
In the northern coast resort area, a quiet retreat 73 miles from the airport and 57 miles from town (a $50 taxi ride) is the Discovery Bay Club, an all-inclusive retreat in the fishing village of Punta Rucia. Set on a white sand beach, the resort has 28 air-conditioned rooms.

Overview
Expansions and improvements at some of the hotels and at recreational facilities continue as the island's tourist industry revives. In the first six months of this year, tourist officials say, stay-over visitors increased by 10 percent compared with the corresponding period in 1988. About 25 percent of visitors are from the United States.

Annandale Falls, a 15-minute drive into the hills from St. George's, now has changing facilities for those who wish to bathe in the pool under the falls. There is a snack bar and a garden featuring spices and traditional medicinal herbs. Entrance is free. Phone 440-2452.
At the interpretation center near the crater lake of an extinct volcano, Grand Etang, 25 minutes' drive from St. George's, displays illustrate flora and fauna, and video presentations show historic and other places of interest.

GUADELOUPE
 
FRENCH WEST INDIES TOURIST BOARD
610 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10020
(212-757-1125)
 
Overview
The French island continues its recovery from the disruption that Hurricane Hugo brought to all activity on the eastern end of Grande-Terre, the eastern wing of the butterfly-shaped island. Most hotels and guesthouses will be operating for the coming season, and six of the largest properties in Gosier and Bas du Fort have been open since shortly after the hurricane. Officials report that few beaches were damaged, and in some places Hugo even brought in added sand; the main and secondary roads are open; vegetation is regaining its tropical color; the golf course is in full operation, and cruise ships are calling at Pointe-a-Pitre. The tourist board can supply information on the conditions, including projected opening dates for hotels that have not yet resumed operations.
A French charter company, Minerve Airlines, is to operate two direct flights a week to Guadeloupe (and Martinique) from Kennedy Airport, starting Dec. 16. The French West Indies Sales Center (212-986-5092) can supply details.
Early in 1990, the world's largest and most technologically advanced sailing ship, Club Med I, will begin cruise trips from Guadeloupe. The 610-foot vessel has 201 cabins and two suites. The seven-day itineraries from Guadeloupe will stop at several islands including St. Martin and St. Barts. Prices for the voyages will range from $1,290 to $2,350 a person.
Guadeloupe's aquarium, the largest in the Caribbean, on the Place Creole just off the main highway outside the Bas-du-Fort Marina on Grande-Terre, has added a 21,000-gallon tank through which visitors can walk by means of a glass tunnel while watching sharks up to six feet long. The aquarium's 20 tanks contain species from all over the Caribbean. Admission is about $4.80, and $2.40 for children under 12. Hours are from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. every day. I.D. Tours bills itself as Guadeloupe's first travel agency to specialize in participatory tourism. It will arrange for visitors to take part in such activities as a fish-net haul with local fishermen, riding in an ox cart and meeting Guadeloupeans at home. Although the agency's operations were suspended temporarily because of hurricane damage, it now is offering partial service with headquarters at the St. Francois Golf Club and it can be reached by calling 590 88.41.87.
 
Accommodations
The only hotel with a deluxe rating is the waterside Hamak, with 56 rooms, in St. Francois on the eastern end of Grand-Terre. The vegetation on the grounds was badly damaged in the storm but the surving plants are now recovering their color. The hotel, which has a small airstrip, is across from the island's golf course. Rates for a room for two, without meals, range from $280 to $380 a day, plus 15 percent service and tax. The Meridien Hotel, which has been closed since being damaged in the hurricane, says that it is spending nearly $2 million on repairs and renovations. Reopening is planned for Dec. 21.
Among several small accommodations in the budget category is the seven-room Mini Beach, several minutes' walk from the beach at Ste.-Anne. It offers horseback riding and bicycles. A double room with Continental breakfast is $80 to $120. Another budget place is the Relais du Moulin, at Chateau Brun near Ste.-Anne. It has 40 rooms and charges $100 to $115 for two a day, including Continental breakfast.

Overview
Political turmoil, repression and violence have crippled the tourist industry of a country always admired for its mountainous beauty and unspoiled beaches. But while some hotels have closed down, other hotels and restaurants familiar to visitors in the past still cling to life. Club Med, whose Haiti Magic Isle facility is one of the most beautiful of their holdings, says that ''if all goes as we anticipate, we expect to open in the latter half of 1990.'' Club Med closed its 350-room Haiti club in 1987. It will reopen without modification, since a grounds staff has continued to maintain the property.
The Haitian Government closed its New York Tourist Office last year, but it was reopened this fall.
United States travelers require proof of citizenship and a round-trip ticket. Departure tax is $15. A recent law requires that money not be exchanged on the parallel market and that only the official rate of five gourdes to the dollar is legal. American currency can be used everywhere, but change may be given in local money.
 
Accommodations
Hotel Oloffson (509-1-3-4000), the darling of artists, writers and jet setters, is confident that adding two luxurious suites, one with an 8 by 8-foot mahogany bed, will attract its nostalgic former clients. This historic hotel is comprised of an imposing gingerbread mansion and cottages on the grounds, and it has a freshwater pool, two bars (one poolside) and a restaurant. Room prices remain the same the year round. A cottage with a queen-size bed or two double beds is $70 a night, double occupancy; suite, $120. The hotel recently installed a fax machine (509-1-3-0919). A resident troupe performs a folkloric show each week. The hotel's permanent art exhibit features 13 of the new avant-garde Haitian artists. Richard Morse, a Princeton graduate, Haitian musician and owner of the hotel, says he is determined to make the Oloffson regain its splendor. Reservations: I.T.R., 800-223-9815.
Hotel El Rancho (509-1-7-2080/4) has 105 air-conditioned rooms and a casino, and it is still considered the most luxurious hotel in Haiti, with its two pools, Jacuzzi bath and hard-surface tennis court (free during the day, $5 an hour for night play). A room with two doubles or one king-size bed costs $110 a night and a suite with a king-size bed is $200. Reservations: I.T.R., 800-223-9815.

Rooms run from $70 a night, suites from $80 to $110. The Kinam restaurant, a popular dining spot and open every day until midnight, offers Creole and French cuisine.

MARTINIQUE
 
FRENCH WEST INDIES TOURIST BOARD
610 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10020
(212-757-1125)
 
Overview
The scheduled airlines do not fly directly to the French island of Martinique from New York, but a French charter airline, Minerve, plans direct service on Saturday and Sunday from Kennedy Airport, beginning Dec. 16. Information on the flights can be had from the French West Indies Sales Information Center (212-986-5092).
A new, comprehesive admission ticket to most of Martinique's major museums, monuments and other cultural sites is now available for a single fee of about $5.50. Known as the TAC (Ticket d'Acces Culturel), it is valid for one year from the date of purchase and is available at the Departmental Historical Museum and the Transportation and Commerce Museum in Fort-de-France; the Volcanological Museum and the Historical Museum in St. Pierre; the Gauguin Museum in Carbet, and elsewhere.
A permanent exposition salon for art of all kinds, The Gold Dolphin, opened recently in the capital, Fort-de-France, at 7 Boulevard Chevalier-Ste.-Marthe. Also new is the art and gem gallery called Artibijoux, 89 Rue Victor-Hugo. Specializing in Haitian paintings - both traditional native and modern - the gallery also displays crafts, such as wooden- and wrought-iron sculpture, ceramics and decorative rugs.
Motorhome holidays have now been added to the vacation scene. Best suited to visitors who know some French, the camper vacation can be ideal for families with children. In Martinique, the vehicles are rented by West Indies Tours, Beauregard 97240, Le Francois (596- 54.50.71).
 
Accommodations
There are no really grand hotels on Martinique, but islanders consider Le Bakoua at Pointe du Bout to be the best. Its 140 rooms cost $230 to $308 a day. The largest hotel is the Meridien, with 300 rooms, and its rates, with Continental breakfast, are $221 to $271, although during the Christmas and New Year period the rate is $456 for two and guests are obliged to take breakfast and dinner.
Visitors find it difficult to book rooms beside the sea at under $100 a day, but the 24-room Diamant Les Bains on the beach in Diamant charges only $78 for two. The new Auberge de la Montagne Pelee in the mountains at Morne Rouge charges $42 for its eight rooms, and the 15-room St. Aubin, within walking distance of the beach at Trinite, charges $78.

MONTSERRAT
 
MONTSERRAT TOURIST BOARD
110 EAST 59th STREET, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10022
(212-752-8660)
 
Overview
The full force of Hurricane Hugo smashed across this mountainous, 39-square-mile island southeast of Antigua, and its inhabitants are still busy cleaning up rubble and repairing buildings. Damage to the electricity supply was so great that engineers decided to rewire the whole island, including the telephone system, and full restoration of services is not expected before the New Year. Many families have been illuminating their homes with kerosene lanterns. The water supply, officials said, was good in most areas.
Efforts to encourage visitors to reserve the rooms that will be ready this month have been hampered by the impossibility, until recently, of calling from the United States. The tourist board's office in Plymouth was destroyed, and the employees moved to new rooms with a different number - 809-491-2444 - in the government headquarters. ''We are still on the map,'' said Ernestine Cassell, director of tourism, in Plymouth. ''We originally feared that the island would not be able to accommodate tourists until mid-1990. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of the Montserratians, aided by teams of workers from all over the world, a number of badly damaged hotels expect to have rooms ready.''
 
Accommodations
The Vue Pointe, one of the main properties, plans to reopen a total of 15 rooms among its 28 cottages and 5 rooms this month. Public areas such as dining room and pool area escaped damage.
An opening date has not been scheduled for the other main hotel, the Montserrat Springs, but it hopes to welcome some visitors this season after a complete overhaul of its 6 cottages and 17 rooms.
The island has always had a variety of villa accommodations. The three Villas of Montserrat will reopen Dec. 15. Others planning to open this month include the Shamrock Villas and some properties managed by Neville Bradshaw Agencies.

PUERTO RICO
 
COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO TOURISM COMPANY
575 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017
(212-599-6262)
 
Overview
The island in the Caribbean with the most visitors (about 2.9 million during the year ended last June) is still recovering from the hurricane. However, although major hotels sustained millions of dollars in damage when Hugo thrashed much of the island Sept. 18, none were forced to close more than a few days and all are looking forward to a strong winter season. The two hotels suffering the most damage were the grande dame of Puerto Rico's tourist industry, the Caribe Hilton Hotel, and the Condado Plaza Hotel, which are separated by a small bay in the heart of San Juan's tourist area. At the Caribe Hilton, the ceiling of several public rooms on the second floor of what is known as the tower collapsed. The windows of some of the rooms in the tower blew in, the rain soaking rugs and bedding. Several trees in the gardens, including an Indian laurel that was planted when the hotel opened in 1948, were toppled. ''We brought in two 90,000-pound cranes to right the tree,'' said Raul Bustamante, the Hilton's general manager.
The hurricane forced the Condado Plaza into its fourth renovation in about two years. The top floor of La Concha Hotel was closed while the roof was repaired. Hyatt spent a fortune relandscaping the grounds of its Dorado Beach Hotel and adjacent Cerromar Regency Hotel.
The Luis Munoz Marin International Airport suffered about $20 million in damage, but neither of the two runways was damaged and a few planes resumed arrivals two days after the hurricane. The winds downed thousands of trees and ripped the leaves from others, which were left as bare as a New England forest in winter. But Puerto Ricans point out that nature rebounds quickly in the tropics.
 
Accommodations
With its crescent-shaped beach, two swimming pools and eight tennis courts, numerous restaurants and nightclub, the Caribe Hilton continues as the jewel of hotels in San Juan. For its 40th anniversary celebration, the Caribe Hilton has booked a Brazilian review into its enlarged and refurbished nightclub, the Club Caribe. High-season rates, beginning Dec. 18, are $200 a day for a single room and $260 for a double.
The recently restored Radisson Normandie Hotel alongside the Hilton was built in 1939 by an eccentric millionaire, Felix Benitiz Rexach, who loved all things French. The building was patterned after the superstructure of the French liner Normandie. From Dec. 23, the Art Deco-style hotel will charge from $140 for a single and $155 for a double.
About 20 minutes' drive from San Juan are the Cerromar Regency and the adjacent Dorado Beach, both operated by the Hyatt chain. They have 4 Robert Trent Jones-designed golf courses, 21 tennis courts and miles of beaches. The Cerromar has what it bills as the world's largest river pool meandering through its gardens. It features honeymoon, family, golf and tennis packages starting at $489, double occupancy, for four nights. Regular rates start at $235 daily at the Cerromar and $299 at the Dorado Beach.
In a more moderate vein in San Juan is the off-the-beach Excelsior Hotel where winter rates are $80 single and $107 double. Lower prices are also available at the 15 small hotels and inns called Paradores Puertorriquenas, promoted and sometimes owned by the government.
Parador El Guajataca is a 38-room hotel on the Atlantic outside the little town of Quebradillas on the north coast. Its long beach is too wild for swimming but the hotel has a pool and nice rooms. The rates at El Guajataca start at $57 for a single and $60 for a double. Across the island on the south coast, the Caribbean shore, is the Parador Villa Parguera, near Phosphorescent Bay, whose waters light up like thousands of fireflies when disturbed. The Parguera's rates are $60 for all rooms, double or single.
Hacienda Gripinas in the mountains outside the town of Jayuya is a 19-room inn with a pool and little else beyond friendly charm. The rates are $35 single, $40 double.
 
Transportation
From New York, Miami and Atlanta on American, Eastern and T.W.A. From Philadelphia: USAir Delta Airlines provides service from the West Coast. Pan American World Airways is scheduled Dec. 15 to resume flying in and out of Puerto Rico from Miami.

Overview
Although Saba, in the Netherlands Antilles, was a victim of Hurricane Hugo, it has made a good recovery, according to officials on the island. They say that tourist facilities escaped major damage, and that most private homes have been repaired. Already all of the remaining trees are covered with foliage, thus quickly erasing the damage done to the forested part of the island, a resident reports. All tourist facilities will be operating this winter.
Brigadoon, a new tourist restaurant in Windwardside, is open for business. It is owned and operated by Gregg Johnson. It would seem that the Johnsons have it this season as the Captain's Quarters Hotel will be operated from now on by Joe and Locky Johnson.
Saba's No. 1 attraction is diving. The three dive shops - Sea Saba, Saba Deep and Wilson's Dive Shop - are all preparing for an increased number of overnight visitors and a flow of day trippers from neighboring St. Martin. Because of the increased diving activities, a recompression tank has been acquired by the local hospital and will be operating by the end of the year. The Royal Netherlands Navy, which donated the four-person chamber, is providing technical and medical training for volunteers from the local diving community. The tank will be the only one of its kind in the Eastern Caribbean.
Saba prides itself on being the ''Unspoiled Queen'' of the Caribbean, and there is growing concern among the 1,000 islanders about overdevelopment. (Construction of a 25-room hotel, the island's largest, is expected to start in March. It will be managed by Sheraton.) This concern is tempered by the knowledge that Saba's limitations are its best assets. No beaches, no casinos, few hotels. Most visitors are divers, hikers, artists, writers and retirees. Although 25,000 visitors a year seems a lot for a five-square-mile island, Saba's island government is convinced that it can safely accommodate 50,000 visitors a year without doing damage. A Saba Conservation Foundation has been formed to preserve the island's beauty.
 
Accommodations
Captain's Quarters Hotel has 10 rooms and a swimming pool. Winter rates are $85 for a single room, $110 for a double, with Continental breakfast.

Overview
Visitors will notice many fallen trees, buildings that were severely damaged and a busier-than-usual downtown Christiansted, where an influx of Federal officials and business people helping with repair efforts has increased activity in recent weeks. Some duty-free stores have reopened in Christiansted. Frederiksted shops are not expected to reopen until the pier is ready to accommodate cruise ships, probably in late January. Most of the island's popular restaurants are open.
The island may not have power fully restored until early 1990. Hotels either have electricity or their own generators. By the end of December, 90 percent of telephones and all business phones are expected to be working. During repairs, phone service can be erratic. The St. Croix Hotel and Tourism Association has a toll-free number for people needing help with reservations: 800-524-2026.

Overview
Hurricane Hugo inflicted extensive damage to private homes and harbor facilities. Work has been going on since the storm and most of the damaged houses and tourist facilities have been repaired. St. Eustatius, or Statia, as this Dutch island is known, played a prominent role in supplying the rebels during the American Revolution. It paid dearly for this support as Adm. George Brydges Rodney invaded the island in 1781 and laid waste its Lower Town, the ruins of which are a major tourist attraction nowadays. Other attractions are a walking tour taking in the history of the island, the Historical Foundation Museum and the rain forest in the crater of the extinct volcano named the Quill. The eight-square-mile island has a population of approximately 1,800 people.
Among new developments, both in town, are the addition of eight rooms to the Talk of the Town, a bar and restaurant, and the reopening of Hotel Gloria, a small guesthouse that had been closed for several years.
There are two dive shops: Golden Rock Dive Center and Dive Statia. All dives are boat dives and include guided tours, tanks, weight and weight belt. Remnants of 18th-century harbor life can be seen by divers in the old shipwrecks, pieces of pottery, pipe stems and occasional blue trading bead.
 
Accommodations
St. Eustatius has two small hotels on the bay in Lower Oranjestad. The Old Gin House, a faithful reconstruction of an 18th-century building that once housed a cotton gin, charges $125 a person, double occupancy, with breakfast and dinner, or $90 European plan. Three people each pay $105 or $70. Rates at the Golden Era are $88 for two or $104 for three, European plan.
There are other small guesthouses and apartments, including the Henriques Apartments in town, with rates ranging from $15 a person a day.
 
Transportation
From New York, nonstop to the Dutch side of St. Martin on American, then on Winair. From Miami, direct flights to St. Martin on Eastern Airlines. LIAT and Winair fly to St. Eustatius from St. Kitts.

Overview
Most of St. John looks as if Hurricane Hugo barely touched it. Visitors will notice some missing palm fronds, but the island remains lush and green. Beaches are as beautiful as ever, as is the snorkeling and diving. With few exceptions, the island has full electrical power and telephones are working. Mongoose Junction, the shopping area a brief walk from the ferry dock at Cruz Bay, has added more shops, including jewelry and clothing stores. The Annaberg Sugar Mill ruins provide an insight into the island's history. No admission charge.
 
Accommodations
A 7.5 percent hotel tax is added to all rooms.
The renowned Caneel Bay (809-776-6111) suffered damage in the storm, but the resort is ready for the season. At least 60 rooms of the total of 170 are available, and 32 have been remodeled. All three restaurants will be open by Christmas. The Sugar Mill Restaurant was recently renovated, enhancing the character of the 18th-century building. Fresh seafood and pasta dishes are the specialties. Guests receive unlimited use of such facilities as tennis courts and sunfish boats. The rate for two people for seven nights, including breakfast, lunch and dinner: $4,130.
The 254-room Virgin Grand Beach Hotel (800-323-7249 or 809-776-7171) has landscaping that is difficult to match, and it survived the storm remarkably well. The contemporary design of the hotel and buildings complements the symmetry of the 34 acres of gardens. A quarter-acre swimming pool appears to blend into the nearby sea. The Fronds Restaurant serves Continental cuisine; two other restaurants are more casual. Wind surfing, tennis and snorkeling are available. The rate for two people for seven nights, including breakfast: $2,065.
For smaller budgets there is the 14-room Cruz Inn (809-776-7688), a gathering spot near town for St. John residents. Popular videos are shown Thursday and Saturday nights, and drinks are served at the bar nightly. The inn offers a comfortable West Indian-style ambiance.

Overview
The two-island nation - St. Kitts and its partner, Nevis, are separated by a two-mile-wide strait - was among Hurricane Hugo's casualties. But most accommodations plan to be open, at least partly, and several new projects are being constructed. Roads and airport are open and the ferry across the strait to Nevis is running. Among the hotels that were victims of the storm that swept away trees, plants, roofs and shingles were the Cliffdwellers, on Nevis, which was destroyed, and the Zetland Plantation, also on Nevis, which was badly damaged but may reopen with some new rooms in February.
On St. Kitts the storm delayed the completion of the seven-mile road, now open, that provides access from Frigate Bay to the southeast peninsula, which contains some of the island's best beaches. A spur road to Banana Bay and Cockleshell Bay is being built, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael O. Powell, said both sites have been purchased by developers who intend to construct resorts. One of the developers is Sandals, the group that operates all-inclusive resorts on Jamaica, and it hopes to start work at the site of the former Banana Beach Bay Resort in January. On Nevis, the Four Seasons group is building a resort with an 18-hole golf course at Pinney's Beach, where a noted beach was washed away by Hugo. An island official said that the employees on the Four Seasons site were released by the hotel to do reconstruction work after the storm and played a big role in Nevis's recovery.
Meanwhile, the two islands plan to capitalize on their opportunities for divers intrigued by sunken ships. One of the four dive operators, who lists a dozen wreck sites for visitors who care to explore them, said that until now most divers have been content to study underwater life and caves, including the series of coral grottoes on the west side of Nevis. The tourist board says official records list more than 390 ships sunk in their waters between 1492 and 1825.
 
Accommodations
On St. Kitts, Rawlins Plantation lost the roofs of 2 of its 10 cottages but reopened in November after repairs. The winter rate of $375 includes breakfast and dinner and afternoon tea. The Golden Lemon opened with 12 new cottage rooms this month. Double rooms, with breakfast and dinner, are from $285, and there are villas with pool from $380. A New Jersey bookseller, Art Keusch, his wife, daughter and son-in-law, will open Ottley's Plantation, a converted greathouse and separate cottages, in January with 15 of a planned 65 rooms.
Less expensive choices in St. Kitts are the Fairview Inn, a cottage complex with rooms from $88 to $98, and the Fort Thomas Hotel, overlooking the Basseterre Bay, which charges $85 and $95.
On Nevis, the 16-room Mount Nevis Hotel has been open without interruption and has added a water-sports facility with shops on Newcastle Beach. Rates for two are $170 and $210 a day. The Hermitage Plantation Inn, Croney's Old Manor, Golden Rock Estate and Nisbet Plantation are among the island's small inns opening their doors this month.
Budget: Pinney's Beach Hotel, within walking distance of Charlestown, the capital, has rooms at $100, or $150 with breakfast and dinner.
 
Transportation

Overview
Tourism is a major generator of foreign exchange and employment on this former British colony, which became fully independent a decade ago. Last year, tourist arrivals reached a record 214,000, compared with 202,000 the previous year. Expenditures by tourists also set a new mark, $125 million. The islanders call their home the ''Helen of the West.''
The southwestern town of Soufriere, 26 miles from the capital, Castries, boasts the towering twin cone-shaped mountains known as the Pitons (2,619 and 2,461 feet tall). Soufriere is also the home of the world's only drive-in volcano, the bubbling Sulphur Springs (actually remnants of former volcanic activity), which have been active for several centuries. Nearby are mineral baths that are said to be beneficial for respiratory complaints.
Throughout the 238 square-mile island are sites of historic significance, a testimony to the more than 150 years of military and naval conflict between the British and the French for possession of St. Lucia, which changed hands 14 times between the two powers.
New for this winter is a thalassotherapy center, which offers seawater massages, thermal jet baths, algae bubble baths, salt loofah rubs and Swiss needle showers. Situated 14 miles from Castries, it was opened recently as an extension to the 102-room all-inclusive hotel known as Le Sport. The hotel offers what it calls a body holiday, a program that promises adventure, fun and relaxation through a variety of indoor and outdoor sports and live nightly entertainment. The center includes an air-conditioned gymnasium and an aerobics studio.
 
Accommodations
St. Lucia boasts a range of luxurious, medium and low-budget hotels and guesthouses, more than 2,000 rooms altogether. Its accommodations this winter include the first phase of the Windjammer Hotel, at La Brelotte Bay, a 15-minute drive from Castries. The complex is a series of 16 hillside villas and suites designed to harmonize with the surrounding contours. Each villa features covered terraces and sundecks with private plunge pools and has television and casette players. VCR's are available on request. The Windjammer also offers tennis, golf, horseback riding, scuba diving, nature tours, sightseeing expeditions and special excursions for children. One-bedroom suites at Windjammer are $210 to $250 a night, while villas range from $300 to $390 (two bedrooms) and $450 to $490 (three bedrooms) a night.
Three miles from the city is the Cunard La Toc Hotel and Suites, more than 200 rooms classified in seven categories with rates ranging from $215 to $425 a night. Like Windjammer, La Toc is near the beach. All the finer resort facilities are offered with the hotel's compliments. Five tennis courts, an 11-hole golf course and water sports and instruction are available. All major hotels on St. Lucia present nightly entertainment, much of it with a local flavor that emphasizes the island's bilingual cultural heritage.
Among the several low-budget hotels is the redecorated Vigie Beach, across the street from Vigie Airport, with rooms ranging from $55 to $125 a day. Across the Castries Harbor is the 32-room Taipon Reef Hotel, close to La Toc, with rates between $60 and $65, including Continental breakfast. Its rooms are air-conditioned, and golf, tennis, pool and reef snorkeling are available nearby.

Overview
The Dutch side of the island shared with French St. Martin suffered some damage from the hurricane, but officials say life was back to normal after a week. Here, vacationers have a wide choice of resorts, some with casinos and nightclubs as well as tennis courts and boats, and the cruise port of Philipsburg is a center of duty-free shopping along Front Street. Major expansion is planned in the port, with construction starting next year on a new Great Bay Harbor that will eventually provide berthing space for nine ships instead of five. St. Maarten is negotiating with shipping lines to position Philipsburg as a base port for cruises.
Visitors will find some new eating places, including Alba (42100), an outdoor restaurant specializing in Italian dishes near the Treasure Island Hotel. It is open every day for lunch and dinner, and brunch with champagne is served on Sundays. Another, serving light dishes all day, is the Turtle Bar, which has its own boat dock, giant turtle and tropical fish pond on the Airport Road.
Housekeeping facilities can be rented through Simpson Bay Beach Rentals (201-438-6700), which has several houses in the western part of the island - two bedrooms and four bedrooms - that it says are larger and better equipped than the usual vacation villa. The rates, $275 a day for two bedrooms and $425 for four, include taxes, daily maid service and airport transfers. Another rental company, St. Martin Rentals (599-5-44330), lists more than 30 properties, including two-bedroom villas at $2,250 a week.
 
Accommodations
The Oyster Pond Yacht Club is near Dawn Beach at the eastern end of the island, and guests are advised to rent a car, since the area is somewhat remote. Oyster Pond has two tennis courts and a marina and offers fishing and water sports. There are two bars and a restaurant. The 20 rooms range from $150 a night, with Continental breakfast, to $390 for a tower suite with ocean view. A meal plan available with a stay of at least five nights is $40 a person a day, providing full breakfast and four-course dinner. No children under age 10.
On the western side of the Dutch sector is the Maho Beach Hotel and Casino, which has 240 rooms, all with air-conditioning and balconies and some with kitchenettes. There are three restaurants.

The cover charge is $10 a person; no minimum. Outdoors, include tennis (four courts) and water sports. The daily room rates range from $165 to $475.
Among the budget hotels are the 45-room Seaview, in the center of Philipsburg across the street from the bookstore that sells major American newspapers. There's a casino in the same building. Double rooms cost from $75 to $150 a day.
The small Sea Breeze Hotel, which has been in operation for a year, is close to Bel Air Beach. Breakfast and lunch are served. Rates for two are $65 to $75. A 5 percent government tax is added to all room rates; most hotels charge a 10 to 15 percent service charge.

Overview
Frequent visitors to St. Thomas will notice minor changes because of the hurricane, mostly a thinning of the foliage. But the island is green, its beaches clean. Hoteliers and others in tourist-related businesses were quick to make repairs. All but a few of the Main Street duty-free shops in Charlotte Amalie are open. Golf is available at Mahogany Run Golf and Tennis Resort. Three restaurants are not expected to reopen at least for the early winter season - Club Z, Fiddle Leaf and Frigate at Mafolie - but scores of others are ready, from roadside food stands to fine dining establishments. The owners of Fiddle Leaf hope to reopen at a new location in town.
All utilities were damaged by the storm. With the exception of a few isolated residential areas, the island is expected to have full power this month. Television is limited to selected programs, news and sports events on the local PBS station. Some hotels and bars have satellite dishes. Cable television is not due to return until late spring or summer. By mid-November about 80 percent of the island - including most hotels and businesses - had telephone service. It is expected to be fully restored by January.
Coral World, the aquarium-by-the-sea, unveiled its $1 million, 80,000-gallon reef tank last month. Its underwater observatory was damaged and some fish were lost in the hurricane, but everything was repaired and replaced in time for the grand opening of the new tank , which features a coral reef and surrounding sea life. Admission: $10; $6 for children.
Most charter boats withstood the storm. All-day sails, including snorkeling, lunch and beverages are available for about $65 a person, and plenty of deep-sea fishing charter boats are available.
 
Accommodations
A 7.5 percent hotel tax is added to all rooms.
The newest hotel on the island, the Elysian (800-343-4079 or 809-775-1000), which opened on Cowpet Bay Sept. 1, is also one of its smaller ones, with 66 rooms and suites (172 by 1991). All rooms are air-conditioned, have a large balcony, mini-bar and tropical-style bamboo and rattan furniture. Other features: room service and concierge. A health club and water-sports center will open in January. The beachfront Palm Court restaurant features New American and Continental cuisine with a Caribbean accent while the Courtyard Grille offers more casual dining near the free-form swimming pool and grotto waterfall. Rates for two for seven nights: $1,750.
Frenchman's Reef Beach Resort and Morningstar Beach Resort (800-524-4200 or 809-776-8500), the island's largest resort, has remodeled most of its 520 guest rooms and added extensive landscaping.

Overview
Hoteliers in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a nation of 32 islands and cays stretching south from the largest island, St. Vincent, are taking advantage of Government legislation aimed at encouraging the expansion of accommodations and construction of new properties. They are being given duty-free concessions to import building supplies and furniture. Most of the hotels and guesthouses have fewer than 15 rooms, and they cater mostly to the sailing set, although some visitors come just for the swimming and the islands' serene beauty. After St. Vincent, Bequia, a favorite stop for yacht people, is the largest, and the other inhabited ones are Mustique, Canouan, Mayreau, Union, Petit St. Vincent and Palm Island. Coral gardens with a wealth of marine life are close to the shores of most of the islands.
An 2,500-foot airstrip for light planes is being built in Bequia. On St. Vincent, the Sunset Shores Hotel has added 8 rooms for a total of 27. Wallilabou on St. Vincent's western coast has been declared a port of entry to facilitate southbound boats.
 
Accommodations
One of the most exclusive is the Young Island Resort, 200 yards off St. Vincent's south coast. Guests at its 29 cottages and suites, set along beach and hillside on the 25-acre enclave, take trips in the resort's two 44-foot yachts. Winter rates for two, with breakfast and dinner, are $295 to $495 a day.
On Admiralty Bay in Bequia, nine miles south of St. Vincent, the Plantation House Hotel stands on 10 acres of palm trees and fruit groves and has rose-colored cabanas with verandas as well as rooms - about 25 units in all - in the central plantation house. It also has a restaurant, tennis court and dive shop. Room rates are $210 to $240, including breakfast and dinner. Transfers are arranged from St. Vincent to Bequia by powerboat at a cost of $80 for two each way.
Mustique's only hotel is the Cotton House, where the 19 rooms come with breakfast, lunch and dinner and are priced at from $450 to $500. The 22-room Petit St. Vincent Resort on Petit St. Vincent provides winter rates on request; last summer the rate was $300 for two, including three meals.

Overview
The expansive white beaches and most of the tropical vegetation of Tortola, the largest of the islands, have returned to form following Hurricane Hugo, as has most of the tropical vegetation. Most of the B.V.I.'s 300 bareboat and 45 crewed yachts, which escaped the worst of the storm at moorings in sheltered coves, are back in service. Boats are a major ingredient of the tourist scene on Tortola and elsewhere in the archipelago because about 60 percent of visitor traffic is related to sailing. Sailors make visits ashore but spend most of their time on the water.
All of the island's hotels are open for the season. The only one of the seven badly damaged hotels in the B.V.I. that will not open this season is the sole hotel on Peter Island, about five miles south of Tortola. Dive operators on Tortola say that such wreck sites as the Rhone, a British mail ship that sank after a hurricane in 1867, have been made more interesting by Hugo, which shifted the vessel and revealed some bottles and other previously undiscovered artifacts. The Rhone broke in half and its steel wreckage, preserved on the sandy bottom off Salt Island, across Sir Francis Drake Channel from Tortola, is home to myriad species of fish.
Tree surgeons have been at work repairing the J. R. O'Neal Botanical Gardens. The site of the Mount Healthy Windmill in Brewers Bay, built more than 150 years ago, has just been opened to the public as a picnic area.
 
Accommodations
A five-minute boat ride north of Tortola, Guana Island Club offers 850 acres of undisturbed fauna, sand and seclusion. Small, whitewashed stone cottages on the site of a Quaker sugar mill plantation overlook the ocean from a mountain ridge. The island is a privately owned nature preserve with walking trails and undisturbed beaches at the exclusive disposal of guests. The staff stresses a family setting, from the rotating seating chart for meals to the evening Pictionary games and parlor rap sessions. Two tennis courts and water sports are available, as well as excursions to other islands. Weekly rates, including all meals, are $3,255 for double occupancy; $13,020 for the three-bedroom Grenada Villa; and $48,300 to rent the entire island for seven nights. There are accommodations for up to 30 people. Bar charges, motorboats and transfers to the island are additional, as well as 7 percent room tax and 12 percent service charge. The owners can be reached at 914-967-6050.
Back on Tortola, Prospect Reef Resort in Road Town offers a greater variety of activites, including in-house scuba center and charter operation, lighted tennis courts, pitch and putt golf course, Olympic-size swimming pool and private beach. The resort also has a grocery store, beauty salon and car rental business on the landscaped 40-acre estate. With 131 rooms, the resort offers a variety of accommodations. There are seven grades of rooms at daily rates (meals not included) ranging from $110 for a double to $360 for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom villa (800-356-8937).
Among less expensive properties is the Sea View Hotel (809-494-2483) at the western edge of Road Town. It sits on a hillside overlooking Road Harbor and has a small pool, bar and restaurant serving local specialties. Visitors should not expect luxury: none of the rooms have air-conditioning, though they do have ceiling fans and balconies. The hotel is within walking distance of several restaurants and the main ferry dock, the base for various interisland excursions. Daily rates at the Sea View range from $40 for a small bedroom for two to $75 for a studio sleeping three and $160 for a suite for four people (not including meals).
On the other side of the island from Road Town, in scenic Cane Garden Bay, Rhymers Cane Garden Beach Hotel (809-495-4639) offers some of the amenities of resort hotels at budget prices. Guests can windsurf, sail, snorkel or take a leisurely ride in a paddleboat. The beach bar and restaurant are lively night spots, as are nearby Stanley's, a popular steel band venue, and Quito's, home of a performer on the acoustic reggae guitar, Quito Rhymer.
Rooms include kitchenettes, television, air-conditioning and phones. Daily rates are $70 for two.
 
Transportation
Tortola is served by Air BVI, American Eagle, Eastern Metro and LIAT from San Juan and Air BVI from St. Thomas. Or by the Speedy's or Native Son ferryboats from St. Thomas, a 45-minute ride. Both charge $27 round trip.

Overview
Trinidad has opened a new $2 million cruise ship complex in Port-of-Spain, the capital, which is enjoying growing popularity as a port of call for Caribbean cruise ships. Among vessels now calling at the port are Cunard's Countess, cruising the Caribbean from San Juan, and the Stella Solaris of Sun Line, which includes the port and Tobago, Trinidad's sister island, in some of its combined Caribbean and South American itineraries. Several craft shops are now in place at the new cruise complex. And the devaluation of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar, now at $4.25 to the United States dollar instead of $3.60, may help visitors find bargains.
Also opening in time for the winter season will be an improved deep-water harbor and expanded airport at Crown Point in Tobago.
In Trinidad, the flora and fauna of the Caroni Wildlife Sanctuary, with its scarlet ibis, egrets and many other birds, is one of the island's many excursions, along with the Pitchlake and the Wildfowl Trust tour, which allows the visitor entry to La Brea Museum's gallery and history of the largest known deposits of natural asphalt in the world. There is also the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, housed within a petrochemical complex, where visitors see endangered species of waterfowl, migrating North American birds and many other species of wildlife. Another nature study tour favored by birders takes vacationers to the Asa Wright Nature Center nestled at 1,200 feet in the mountains of the Northern Range. One attraction there is a breeding colony of the nocturnal oilbird.
Visitors can go to the steelband yards, where musicians are tuning up for the carnival scheduled for Feb. 26 and 27. Along with the bands there will be new calypso tents in town where visitors may listen to the latest calypso songs in a runup to major competitions during the week prior to carnival. During the Christmas season, extending into January, there's a chance to sample such traditional foods as pastelles, pelau, roti, black fruit cake, ponche-de-creme, rum punch, sorrel and ginger beer as well as parang (musical) festivities. The island's biennial festival of classical and folk music in Port-of-Spain attracts thousands of competitors and is scheduled from March 5 to April 7.
In Tobago a major sporting event is the newly labelled B.W.I.A. Pro-Am Golf Tournament, formerly known as the Johnnie Walker Pro-Am, which takes place from Jan. 28 to Feb. 9 at the Mount Irvine golf course. B.W.I.A. is the national airline of Trinidad and Tobago.
 
Accommodations
In Trinidad, the 400-room Trinidad Hilton (809-624-3211), overlooking the city as well as the spacious Grand Savannah, home of horse racing, soccer and cricket events, tops the list among the luxury hotels. Its rates range from $120 (American) a day for a single room to $240 for a luxury suite. At carnival time, room prices start at $178.
At the other end of the city is the Holiday Inn (809-625-3361), with its revolving restaurant and bar on its rooftop and its pool with bar in the water. It's a short walk from downtown Port-of-Spain. Rates range from $90 a day for single rooms and $100 for doubles to $160 for suites. Breakfast and dinner cost an extra $30 a person.
There is a host of budget hotels and bed-and-breakfast outlets on the island, many of them in and around the capital.

Overview
Sport diving and snorkeling are major activities for visitors on these largely undiscovered and quiet islands, which are in two groups southeast of the Bahamas. They were bypassed by the hurricane. Admirers of the British colony talk of its many miles of uninhabited beaches, pure white or gold, and the tremendous visibilty under water. There are nine dive operators in the islands, two live-aboard dive boats and 15 hotels with diving packages. But its rustic atmosphere is beginning to change as more hotels move in, following the lead of Club Med Turkoise, which established itself on Providenciales, known as Provo, some years back. The club can accommodate up to 600, many of whom make use of the sailing and water-sports equipment provided.
A Sheraton Hotel, with 250 rooms, is scheduled to open on Provo on New Year's Day, and a Ramada resort on the same island is expected to be ready by February.
The colony's salt industry is being revived by a Florida company that is using mechanization to harvest salt on the island of Salt Cay.
 
Accommodations>
As yet, the Turks and Caicos lacks a grand tradition in hotels. Most accommodations are small. But Le Deck on Provo and the Kittina on Grand Turk are among the most comfortable. Le Deck, three minutes' walk from the Grace Bay beach, has 26 rooms. Room rates are generally $125 a day. The Kittina, on the water and within walking distance of Cockburn Town, has 43 units, ranging from oceanview rooms at $95 to suites at $140 and two-bedroom suites for $210. A full-service dive operation is affiliated with the hotel. One budget option, the Salt Raker Inn on Grand Turk, has installed telephone, TV and air-conditioning in many of its rooms; rates range from $45 to $105 a night. On Provo, the Mariner at Sapodilla Point has 25 rooms at around $95. Diving enthusiasts can live aboard the Aquanaut (800-348-9778), anchored off the town on Grand Turk. Rates for a seven-night stay, including unlimited diving and all meals, are $1,255 a person. The Aquanaut carries five passengers.
 
Transporation
From Miami to Providenciales and Grand Turk on Pan American. T.C.N.A.

Overview
A small mountainous island of 1,000 permanent inhabitants, Virgin Gorda has 1ong been known as a secluded haven of deluxe resorts. Hurricane Hugo ran up a bill of several hundred thousand dollars but caused little permanent damage.
The grottoes formed by huge granite boulders lining the island's southern beaches suffered minimal erosion during the hurricane. Locally known as The Baths, this attraction has been enhanced by the addition of a hillside bar overlooking the boulders and the ocean. However, the Spanish copper mine ruins were battered by the hurricane - a section of the top level was destroyed - and has been roped off in anticipation of repair work.
 
Accommodations
From formal dinners in the Polynesian-style seaside dining pavilion to the full-service yacht harbor, Little Dix Bay (809-495-5555) is one of the most elegant resorts in the Virgin Islands. The 500-acre property includes a white sand beach along Sir Francis Drake Channel, as well as a tennis complex with resident professional. Activities include horseback riding, water sports, tours to surrounding islands and nightly movies.
Octagonal cottages built on stilts offer living quarters with sizable private balconies. Not all of the accommodations are individual cottages, but all are equally comfortable. Each room overlooks either the channel or tropical gardens. The weekly rates are $3,465 for single and $3,955 for double. Several special plans offered, such as scuba, honeymoon and a combined vacation with the Caneel Bay Resort in St. John in the United States Virgin Islands A very private vacation is also available at Biras Creek (809-494-3555), which is on its own isthmus in North Sound. Reachable only by boat, Biras Creek arranges a taxi from the airport to the Gun Creek ferry dock. Dinghies are available to guests, as are bicycles to tour 140 acres lined with nature trails, gardens and two tennis courts. The hotel's private beach borders a small bay offering both water-skiing and wind surfing, depending on the wind conditions. The open-air dining room perched atop the castellated main building overlooks the seaside freshwater pool. The cuisine has a European flavor, including an excellent wine cellar and afternoon tea. The brightly decorated suites each contain a bedroom, living room and private outdoor shower. Weekly double occupancy rates, including all meals, range from $1,860 to $2,760.
The only hotel on the island with rates under $100 a night is the two-story Ocean View (809-495-5230), which resembles a low-budget estate house nestled in lush vegetation. The 12 guest rooms come with mix-and-match furnishings and ceiling fans. The hotel has a bar, restaurant, sundeck and small piano lounge and is across the street from the Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor, where guests can take advantage of the nightclub, grocery store and dive shop. Rates for a double room are $420 to $480 a week.
 
Transportation
From San Juan on Eastern Metro, American Eagle and Air BVI and from St. Thomas on Air BVI. Also from Tortola on Air B.V.I. Ferries run on some days from Tortola and St. Thomas.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 31, 1989, Sunday, Late Edition - FinalDecember 17, 1989, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
A listing of Caribbean islands on Dec. 10 omitted some B.W.I.A. flights from Miami. B.W.I.A. flies daily to Aruba and Curacao and twice a week to Martinique.
The listing also referred incorrectly to the status of a Sheraton hotel under construction on Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands. An opening date has not yet been set.
Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 10 about resorts in Jamaica misstated the locations of five Sandals properties. They are in various parts of Jamaica, not just in Ochos Rios.
An article on Nov. 19 about the Imperial War Museum in London misstated the date of the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. As several readers have written to point out, it will be on Dec. 7, 1991, not 1990.
A listing of resorts in the Caribbean on Dec. 10 misidentified a hotel on St. Barthelemy. It is Castelets.

HEADLINE: A Woman Blessed With the Gift of Compassion

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
BISHOP Rosetta Wheeler, head of the 80-member Mount Hebron Church of God in New Haven, ran her hand along her living room wall and gave thanks. She gave thanks for the chairs and the tables and the soft drink she held in her hands. She then told the story of North Carolina where, as a sharecropper's daughter, she picked cotton from dawn until dusk and went home to sleep in one bed with five of her sisters and brothers. One day, she said, she knelt in a ditch and prayed that she be given a better life.
''And God granted me this new life, and that's why I'm always giving thanks,'' she said. ''Because he rescued me from North Carolina. And I will never forget North Carolina.''
Bishop Wheeler, who this week celebrates her 35th year as the head of Mount Hebron Church of God, on Winchester Avenue, a Pentecostal church she founded, evoked such memories to illustrate why she became a consumate humanitarian. 
The recipient of numerous humanitarian awards, she began this holiday season by cooking several Thanksgiving meals from her kitchen which were then sent to the homes of needy families; indeed, she will continue that through Christmas. ''All my pots are big pots,'' she said. An enclosed patio inside her Hamden home stores boxes of donated clothes that she plans to distribute in the coming weeks to local families and to an orphanage her church sponsors in Haiti. A few days before Christmas she will place 300 toys for the neighborhood children under the Christmas tree at Mount Hebron, in the Newhallville section of New Haven.
Despite a series of ailments that have forced her to walk with a cane, Bishop Wheeler - the impetus behind 102 low-income Government subsidized homes in New Haven - has no plans to slow down. ''There's no alpha or omega to my work,'' she said. ''As long as someone needs me, I am willing.''
The Rev. Curtis Colfield, who heads the Immanuel Baptist Church in New Haven, one of the largest congregations in the city, with 3,000 members, has known Bishop Wheeler for 43 years. ''You won't find a better source of help than Rosetta Wheeler,'' he said. ''She's one of these rare, charismatic individuals who has the talent to take on an astounding number of projects and see them through.''
A meticulous dresser easily recognized by her wide-brimmed hats and long-flowing capes, Bishop Wheeler grew up on a farm outside Maxton, N.C., of 10 children. Describing herself as a born preacher, she recalled standing on a mound of dirt in the middle of a cotton field delivering a sermon to her brother Danny, who served as her congregation. ''And when I wasn't preaching to Danny, I was preaching to the birds or the farm animals,'' she said. ''I always had high spiritual aspirations.''
Later she supported her family by chopping and selling wood for $2 a cord. After saving money from running a vegetable and fruit stand, she moved to New Haven in the middle of the 1940's and lived with two uncles, both alcoholics. Finding the situation unbearable, she sought work through an unemployment office, where, for a day's work baby-sitting, she received $20. ''I remember looking at the man in the unemployment office as if he'd made some mistake,'' she said. ''I never in my life thought that anybody could earn that much money in one day.''
Soon after, she began a job as a live-in housekeeper for a heart specialist in New Haven. Within the next few years she completed high school and attended a night school program to qualify as a licensed practical nurse.
From there she moved to New York, where she attended Pentecostal church services and worked in a hospital. All the while, she said, she longed to become a minister. ''My wings were just too wide and the hospital corridors just too narrow for what I wanted.''
When she returned to New Haven in the late 1940's, she began missionary work, holding Bible study classes in the private homes of the elderly. Word spread about the young woman's oratorial talents and before long she was able to fill rooms to capacity.
In 1954, after eight years of teaching, she was ordained a Pentecostal minister. Along with her 100 parishoners she moved into a storefront building on Winchester Avenue and called the new church Mount Hebron Church of God. She furnished the church with chairs that she bought from a thrift shop and later found a pulpit. In the early days she shared her ministry with another pastor, who walked out after the two disagreed over the direction of the church. He took half the congregation with him. Bishop Wheeler recalled that the ordeal ''tore the church to cinders'' and that it took several years to rebuild the congregation.
''Pastoring a church is like riding a bus,'' she said. ''When you first get on, it's full, but by the time you get downtown, it starts emptying out. The only thing to do is turn around and start over again.''
 
A Refuge
From its beginning, Mount Hebron served as a refuge to its surrounding community. A year-round clothing bank was established where parishioners would hang the coats, shirts or dresses on a stockade fence next door for anyone to claim. Meals were cooked and delivered to the needy, and several parishioners took in foster children. Bishop Wheeler, who has four grown children of her own, counted some 100 children that she has taken care of over the years. ''I took them out of jails, off the streets and out of the arms of strangers,'' she said. ''We always tried to make room in our lives.'' In 1974, after serving as a minister for 20 years, she was ordained as one of the first female Pentecostal bishops in Connecticut. (In the Pentecostal, which has 3.7 million members, church, ministers and bishops are ordained regionally.) Despite her pastoral experience and her record as a community activist, many local clergymen rejected the ordination, arguing that the Bible never specified that women could be bishops.
''You could also argue that the there isn't anywhere in the Bible that says a woman can't be a bishop,'' said Bishop Wheeler, who is accustomed to defending her title. ''In other words, God is gender blind.''
Mr. Colfield of Immanuel Baptist recalled when she was elected the president of the Hill-Dwight Ministerial Alliance, the first woman in that post, in the late 1970's. The coalition of clergymen had been trying for months to get Government to build a large cooperative housing project.
 
'A New Place to Live
''After Rosetta was elected, several members quit because she was a woman,'' Mr. Colfield said. ''Others protested that the housing project would never get off the ground with her in charge. Then at the first meeting she stood up and raised the H.U.D. application papers over her head and shouted, 'Whether I do it with you or without you, I'm going to see that 72 families are given a new place to live!' and she did.''
Five years later, Bishop Wheeler, along with another Pentecostal minister, acquired the Government money to build another 20 duplexes two blocks from her church. The homes were completed in 1983. In 1987, Bishop Wheeler received the Humanitarian Award from the New England International Christians for Unity and Social Action; the award was accompanied by letters of congratulations from President Reagan and Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. She stores her plaques from the ceremony along with dozens of other service awards in a large cardboard box.
These days Bishop Wheeler spends much of her time trying to raise money for the Haitian orphanage sponsored by her church. One of her fund raisers is a banquet held every spring to honor women in their 80's who have served as foster mothers or have dedicated time to other areas of community service. This year's banquet honored 68 women and was attended by the Mayor of New Haven.
 
Requests for Help
During a recent Sunday service at Mount Hebron, a visiting minister sang with the parishioners, ''I am a soldier in the army of the Lord.'' Amid the sound of tambourines, cymbals and three-part harmonies, Bishop Wheeler, who has been known to chase drug dealers off nearby street corners, sat quietly behind the pulpit, her presence dominating the room.
In her hand she held a letter from a Polish man describing the grim conditions in his country and asking Bishop Wheeler if her church would sponsor his family, thereby enabling them to come to the United States. It was one of many requests she receives each week from people requesting her help.
A blueprint of the church she hopes to build rested on her chair. She carries it with her almost everywhere she goes, showing it to those who might be able to help her raise the $1 million needed to see the project through. ''It's got to get done,'' she said, acknowledging that it would not be easy.
A parishioner who overheard her responded: ''If she says it will get done, it will get done. Because if there's one thing the Lord gave Bishop Rosetta Wheeler it's a knack of getting things done.''

HEADLINE: A Shop Where Youths Learn to Work for More Than Money

BYLINE: By NANCY KENNEDY

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
IN September a submarine-sandwich shop opened here on Sussex Street. Every day since, the small restaurant and takeout business has attracted lunch crowds of St. Michael's Hospital employees and students from the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University across the street.
Behind the counter of Jersey Mike's, Newark teen-agers work at the grill, fill hoagie rolls and ring up sales. The scene is the same as in thousands of sandwich shops across the country.
In this shop, however, the teen-agers are not just paid employees; they are also in effect part owners. 
The venture is a cooperative effort by an array of government, social and business entities. Its intent is to break the cycle of poverty, drugs and despair that so often befalls inner-city youths, of whom roughly 1 in 5 is unemployed. If the shop is successful, it could prompt more such efforts in the city and, if organizers have their way, across the country.
''This is a marvelous opportunity for young people to acquire hands-on business experience operating their own retail store,'' Mayor Sharpe James said. ''It provides these young people with the chance to acquire skills needed to turn their lives around.''
It was almost two years ago that Barbara Bell, chief executive officer of the Newark Boys and Girls Club, began looking for a way to give the club's participants a taste of the business world.
''We wanted to reach out to the total child, not just pick up a corner of a child's life,'' Ms. Bell said. ''But in social work, we don't always have real-world experience to offer.''
The club's opportunity came when Ms. Bell met Steve Mariotti, a businessman and a former New York City schoolteacher. In the early 1980's, Mr. Mariotti founded a New York City-based charitable organization, the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, that provides underprivileged youths with business training.
Mr. Mariotti and Ms. Bell began planning for the involvement in business training of the Newark club, which provides educational and recreational programs for about 5,000 city children.
Besides the club, the plan included the participation of residents of the Ogden Street House, a state-operated halfway house for juvenile offenders.
''These are kids that have fallen into a trap, the drug trade, life on the street corner,'' said Peter Lisenco, coordinator of programs at Ogden. ''Nothing in their history had shown them that their life could be any different. Now we can instill hope and a sense of accomplishment.''
The final part of the plan was to find a business where the young entrepreneurs could use their training. A search led to Peter Cancro, a 32-year-old Wall Township businessman known for his interest in community service.
Mr. Cancro, the founder and president of Jersey Mike's, a franchise operation, offered to open the 26th Jersey Mike's store. In May, an 800-square-foot storefront on Sussex Street was decided on.
Antwan Dawes, the 17-year-old day manager of the shop, was there when they pushed open the door of the storefront, which in its last incarnation was a bodega. ''It was a mess,'' he said.
Over the next two months, a group of teen-agers fixed up the storefront, transforming it into the now-clean, brightly lighted Jersey Mike's. Mr. Dawes, who had at one time worked with his uncle in a construction business, pitched in with the others, building counters, painting, cleaning windows and preparing storerooms.
The group's efforts paid off. The employees piqued neighborhood interest by sending out menus and offering samples and coupons. Opening day brought a crowd. The newly trained staff sliced, sprinkled, wrapped and sold 80 sandwiches in the first lunch hour at the shop.
John Hughes, Mr. Cancro's training manager, said: ''After opening day, I told Peter, 'Let's close down all of our suburban shops and go into the urban areas!' We were all left with such a great feeling. The kids are so genuine, and they want to do a good job.''
Since the shop's opening, the business has consistently met its goal of grossing at least $1,000 a day, six days a week. Barring any unexpected downturn, the store hopes to report annual sales of about $350,000.
The City of Newark, through its Office of Employment and Training, recently approved a $100,000 grant for the shop.
When the shop becomes profitable, the Boys and Girls Club and the Ogden Street center will share in the profits, each retaining 40 percent. The remaining 20 percent will go into a fund for the Boys and Girls Club's Ready program, an early education enrichment effort. That program hopes to start businesses for children to benefit from when they reach employment age.
Half of the Odgen Street center's share - which represents 20 percent of the shop's total profits - will be distributed as monthly bonuses to the young workers, Mr. Mariotti said. It has not yet been determined how the funds would be allocated.
''If we had just paid wages, we wouldn't really have addressed the problem,'' Ms. Bell said. ''We thought they should also share in the profits.''
It is also planned that the youths will eventually be given at least 40 percent of the stock, which is now held by a corporation set up by the Boys and Girls Club. The details of the arrangement have not yet been worked out.
 
Classes Completed by 300
For the program participants, Mr. Mariotti has boiled down his Harvard business degree course work into 80 one-hour classes. Over the last two years, 300 Newark youths have completed Mr. Mariotti's classes, and 500 are now being taught by him. He also teaches the toughest of students - inmates at Rikers Island.
Though not all the program's participants get to work at Jersey Mike's, those who do are not pressured to move on. The program, however, does encourage participants to move up into management positions, with the goal of someday running their own businesses.
Mr. Mariotti works with the youths not employed at Jersey Mike's, helping them find jobs. Children as young as 8 years old are taught in the program, but employees at Jersey Mike's must be at least 14.
Even before the youths begin the program, they are well equipped with business skills, Mr. Mariotti said.
''Kids from the inner city, especially those who have worked in the drug industry, have more business experience than the vast amount of people,'' Mr. Mariotti said. ''They know about sales, marketing, business strategy and record-keeping. They have proved they have the mental toughness, the street smarts any entrepreneur needs.''
The high point of the training is a trip to a wholesaler, where Mr. Mariotti gives each student $15 to spend on items of his choice. When the young entrepreneurs find they can resell the items for more, their education comes into focus.
 
Seeing Themselves as Equals
''Kids in the retail drug trade or involved in car theft can make hundreds or thousands of dollars a day,'' Mr. Mariotti said. ''But I think they would rather earn $25 or $30 a day in legitimate business. It's not the money, but the fact that they've been left at the bottom of the hierarchy. When suddenly they see themselves as equal to other human beings, it's like lifting the Empire State Building off their shoulders.''
Mr. Dawes, a member of the class that began in July, bought $12 of candy at a wholesale store. Peddling the stock to his friends, he eventually pocketed $25.
The experience has been a turning point for Mr. Dawes, who recently finished his term at Ogden House. Today, his motivation to succeed is simple. ''I don't want to get into any more trouble,'' he said. Asked where he would be if he had not entered the business program, he quietly answered, ''Locked up.''
At the shop, Mr. Dawes began by working at the grill. He has been promoted twice in less than three months, becoming manager last month. In that time, his salary has increased to $7 an hour from $4 an hour. He works eight hours a day, six days a week. ''I've never worked as hard, but it's fun,'' he said.
He wholeheartedly endorses Mr. Mariotti's efforts. ''I learned a lot of good things about business in his class,'' Mr. Dawes said, ''how to make sales, how to open a store. He's all right with me.''
 
Getting a Chance at 17
And Mr. Cancro knows what it is like to be young and hoping for a shot at success. At 17, he was offered the chance to buy the original Mike's submarine shop in Point Pleasant, where he had worked since he was 14.
The problem was the $125,000 asking price and a 72-hour deadline. His family had no money, and bankers had no faith in a teen-ager who by law was not even old enough to operate the shop's meat slicer. Mr. Cancro finally found a believer, a former high school football coach of his who put up two-thirds of the money and persuaded investors to join him.
''I was 17 and a football coach gave me a shot,'' Mr. Cancro said. ''What inspires me is that 17-year-old.'' The Boys and Girls Club bought into the Jersey Mike's franchise with the backing of an anonymous donor.
For its part, Jersey Mike's has waived its usual franchise fee, which amounts to 5.5 percent of the shop's annual gross sales, a saving to the shop of about $20,000 a year, Mr. Cancro estimated. The franchise also provides training for each of the shop's employees and keeps a close watch on operations. There are weekly meetings with the store's management.
 
The Satisfaction of Working
''Working for your money can be one of the greater satisfactions of life,'' Mr. Cancro said. ''We want as many youths as possible to learn that before they think of other ways.''
Other ventures of this sort may depend on the support of corporations willing to put up the money for their start-ups. Wanting to see that come about, Mr. Cancro has been in discussions with several major corporations, including Coca-Cola.
Graduates of the entrepreneurship program are almost unanimous in their desire to make their own futures. Mr. Dawes has, for the first time, opened a bank account. ''I want to save for the future,'' he said. Some of the savings, he says, are earmarked for birthday presents for his baby daughter, who will be a year old on Christmas Day.
With his earnings, Mr. Dawes also helps to support his mother, with whom he lives. When asked whether he would like to own his own shop one day, he answered: ''Yes! Yes! Soon! I can do it. I know I can.''

 BODY:
HORSE racing may be the sport of kings, but in Westchester horseback riding is the sport of commoners, say the co-founders of the Westchester Horse Council, the equine industry's voice in the county.
''Horse people come from all types of backgrounds,'' said Elizabeth Bartholomew of Chappaqua. ''Secretaries on comparatively modest salaries own horses. Middle-class families own horses and so do heads of multimillion-dollar corporations. It's an egalitarian sport.''
John D. Baruc of New Rochelle, who has been riding in Westchester all his life, agreed. ''Mention horses and people think polo, but visit any barn on any given Saturday and what you'll find are recreational riders that represent a real cross-section of the population,'' he said. 
''It's the most democratic sport I know,'' said Mr. Baruc, adding that 70 percent of the horses in the county are used for recreational riding while 13 percent are bred for racing. The rest are either work horses or used for special projects.
Ms. Bartholomew and Mr. Baruc were instrumental in forming a Westchester County chapter of the New York State Horse Council in 1983, to address the problems facing professional and recreational horsemen. The New York State Horse Council is a nonprofit organization founded in 1906 to provide a voice for people interested in horse-related activities.
''What many people don't know is that Westchester is the greatest county of horse activity in the nation,'' Ms. Bartholomew said. ''For decades horses have added to the quality of life here and helped preserve open space.''
''They also produced more than $90 million a year for the local economy, the revenues generated by horse-related goods and services,'' Mr. Baruc said. But state agricultural officials have just released a report showing that the number of horses in the county has fallen by 36 percent, to 8,500, over the last decade, ranking Westchester second to Saratoga County among the state's 61 counties.
''Nationwide Westchester is known for its horses, and I'm sad to see us lose first place, although I'm not surprised,'' said John Xanthopoulos, owner of Thorobrook Farm in Harrison and the current president of the Westchester Horse Council.
''Developers want our land and are willing to pay sky-high prices for acreage,'' he said. ''In lower Westchester, especially, the pressure to sell is strong when offers of $500,000 to $800,000 for an acre of raw land are normal. My own farm of 4.2 acres on Kenilworth Road is surrounded by million-dollar homes. Developers come knocking on my door all the time, but I'm not selling out. I love the business.''
Mr. Xanthopoulos said that he spends more than $65,000 a year to maintain Thorobrook Farm, and that his costs are steadily going up.
 
How the Finances Look
''We charge $780 a month for boarding a horse, which is on the low end for the private barns,'' he said. ''Only the two county-owned stables, Twin Lakes and West Wind on California Road in Eastchester, charge much less. They charge $260 a month. But space is limited to 65 horses.''
Mr. Xanthopoulos boards 35 horses, and he owns another 35 horses at Thorobrook Farm that are used for lessons or leased to riders. He said that space for horses had steadily decreased in Westchester.
''We lost 70 to 80 spaces when Hillair Stable in White Plains was sold to a developer two years ago,'' he said. ''Eleven houses are planned for the site.''
The 58-year-old Boulder Brook Club in Scarsdale, now known as the Scarsdale Riding Club, is an example of what is happening in Southern Westchester.
''Boulder Brook was one of the best-known riding clubs in the country,'' Mr. Xanthopoulos said. ''Its stables once accommodated 150 horses. Now most of the land belongs to the Village of Scarsdale and has been converted into athletic fields and all that remains of the original club is a landlocked indoor rink.''
Stiff environmental laws, mandating the removal of manure in dumpsters every three to four days, have also added considerably to the cost of doing business.
 
Considering the Shovel Work
''What two years ago we shoveled and gave to the nurseries, now costs $500 to $700 every time we rent a 39-yard dumpster and deliver it to the nursery,'' Mr. Xanthopoulos explained. ''Now we are lucky if the nursery will accept the manure without charging an additional $50 to drop it off. Yet the nurseries use the manure - mix it with soil and then resell it for $30 to $40 a yard. Although our rising costs have to be passed along, there is a limit. We don't want to price ourselves out of the business.''
In northern Westchester, where large horse farms abound, one of the largest is the 120-acre Old Salem Farm in Lewisboro, owned by Paul Greenwood, a financial industry executive. Boarding fees at Old Salem Farm, including training the rider-owner, are $1,500 a month.
In terms of income, Old Salem Farm is a multi-million business. The farm has 70 boarding horses, trains riders and conducts horse shows regularly. Yet, said Mr. Greenwood, although the number of patrons steadily increases, mounting costs are also a concern.
 
Compensation Fees Up
''Our liability insurance went from $25,000 to more than $125,000,'' Mr. Greenwood said, adding that Old Salem Farm now has to pay 11.45 percent of each employee's salary for workmen's compensation - ''and that includes the 15 who work in the office.'' Businesses normally pay about .35 percent to cover office workers for workmen's compensation.
Mr. Greenwood suggested that the county could help the horse industry survive by coming up with a tax-abatement plan. ''We at Old Salem Farm pay the largest school tax in North Salem and yet no one goes to school,'' he said, by way of example. ''We pay the largest property tax and yet we don't require any of the services. I wish the county would consider putting us in a special category. It would help insure the future of horse farms.''
The county has already helped insure the future of recreational riding in lower Westchester by rebuilding the bridle path that runs along both sides of the Hutchison River Parkway, Mr. Baruc said.
''We have County Executive Andrew O'Rourke to thank for working with us on the preservation and rebuilding of the bridle path,'' he said. ''As part of the highway-renovation program, the state was all set to bulldoze the trail out of existence, but Mr. O'Rourke literally got on a horse and rode the trail and decided he'd work with us to save it for the riders of Westchester.''
Ms. Bartholomew noted that ''not only was the path saved from being cut up into little segments, it's now a safer trail with a better surface.''
''Riders now can go from Eastchester across Interstate 287,'' she said, ''and we have permission to continue on the trail through the Texaco property to SUNY-Purchase and Pepsico, and there's also talk of reconnecting with the Greenwich Riding Trail Association in Connecticut.''
The trails, Ms. Bartholomew emphasized, are for multi-recreational use, equally pleasant for bike riders and hikers.
''But the best place to ride in the world may be the new Rockefeller State Preserve Park in Pocantico,'' she said. ''There are 750 beautiful acres there. And room for everyone, including parking space for horse poeple who bring their horses in trailers. People not only ride there, they drive horses in pairs and do all sorts of terrific things.''
 
The Problem of Zoning Laws
Ms. Bartholomew attributed many of the problems of horse people to lack of uniformity in zoning laws. ''What we need are common zoning standards applied in the county,'' she said. ''Now, every municipality has its own zoning codes. People who sit on zoning boards don't necessarily care or understand the importance of horses to the county. It's really the fault of the horse-owning population for not taking a more active role on zoning boards.
''I don't believe that the horse population in Westchester has dropped 36 percent in the last decade. What I think is happening is that people don't report accurately the number of horses they own because they fear that zoning regulations will work against them. Horses add a lot to the quality of life in Westchester.'' Paul A. Schosberg agreed. Mr. Schosberg, head of the New York League for Savings in Scarsdale, and his wife breed thoroughbred horses on their Pine Lane farm in Lewisboro.
''When we moved to Westchester in 1970, my wife saw it as an opportunity to do something she had always wanted to do,'' Mr. Schosberg said, ''and that's breed horses. She grew up in Scarsdale and has always enjoyed riding. We were lucky enough to buy eight acres and a barn from a retiring equine vet. The breeding farm is mostly my wife's business. She upgrades the stock every year and the operation has been profitable most years.''
Horse farms, Mr. Schosberg said, are a way to preserve open space. ''Esthetically, in my mind, there's no sight better than miles of green pastures, white fences and grazing horses,'' he said.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
4 POWERS TO MEET ON GERMAN ISSUES

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The Ambassadors of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France will meet here on Monday to discuss the rapidly evolving relationship between East and West Germany, an Allied statement said today.
The four nations were prompted to hold the meeting, their first on the Berlin situation in 17 years, by the actions of Germans on both sides of the border. The Germans are rapidly taking practical steps that would make political and social unification possible while skirting political and legal technicalities and, in the view of several Western diplomats here, simply ignoring the prerogatives of the Allies.
The four nations, which occupied Germany after World War II, are still sovereign in both halves of divided Berlin and have not met formally together since 1972, when they signed the Quadripartite Agreement on the city's status that they had reached the preceding year.
 
A Modest Formal Agenda
The Allied statement today said the formal agenda would take up a suggestion made in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan when he was here to discuss improving the safety of air traffic routes through East Germany to the city, as well as the subject of sports and youth meetings. 
But the background to the hastily called meeting is the growing concern by all four powers that the rapid change in East Germany, whose Communist Party elected Gregor Gysi as its new leader on Saturday and will change its name next week, has set in motion a process of disintegration of the postwar European order that none of them can control.
Although Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is to arrive here Monday night, American officials in Bonn said he would not attend the conference, which will involve the three Ambassadors to West Germany - Vernon A. Walters of the United States, Sir Christopher Mallaby of Britain and Serge Boidevaix of France - and the Soviet Ambassador to East Germany, Vyacheslav I. Kochemasov.
All four nations have occupation sectors on German territory and in Berlin. In practice, they have delegated much of their sovereignty in Berlin to German officials, though legally West Berlin is not part of West Germany.
But today the Germans are much more likely to act without consulting their allies than they were in the past.
The most significant instance of this recently was Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outlining of a 10-point plan for German unity in a speech he made to Parliament late last month without any prior consultation with the Western allies.
According to officials in London and Paris, both President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were considerably annoyed at the lapse. Mr. Kohl said after this weekend's European summit meeting in Strasbourg that his discussions with the other 11 leaders had been ''complicated.'' They agreed on a statement recognizing the right of the German people to restore unity through self-determination, but within the context of existing alliances and state borders.
 
Regular Visits by Mayors
Since the East German border was opened on Nov. 9, hundreds of thousands of people have been pouring over to visit every day in what amounts to reunion, if not reunification, and between 1,500 and 3,000 a day decide to stay permanently in the West.
The changing realities are felt in ways big and small. Mayors Walter Momper of West Berlin and Erhard Krack of East Berlin have been visiting each other regularly since Nov. 9, and today they visited the outdoor Christmas bazaar near West Berlin's Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church together, signing autographs among the Christmas trees for a crowd that was half East Berliners, half West Berliners. On Saturday they will visit the Christmas market in East Berlin, off the Alexanderplatz.
Asked what the allies thought of such mayoral meetings, Mr. Momper looked puzzled and said: ''They'd welcome it. They could come down and drink a little mulled wine with us.''
The municipal authorities on both sides of the wall are now beginning to talk about ways to improve water and sewer service, increase the number of telephone lines, fight drug and currency smuggling, and cut sulfur dioxide emissions to reduce foul-smelling smog that repeatedly covers the city.
 
Allies Responsible for Berlin
But Allied diplomats in East and West say that legally the Germans cannot formally assert responsibility for Berlin as a whole. That is reserved to the Allies, who reaffirmed it most recently in the 1971 four-power agreement on the city's status.
Though they have delegated most of their rights to their respective German allies - West Berlin adopts West German law as its own, and East Berlin is recognized by the Soviet Union as the capital of East Germany - they jealously guard other privileges like sovereignty over airspace.
One Western envoy said privately that the United States was in danger of being dealt out of Central Europe if it did not soon assert a stronger interest in how things evolve here. ''The Germans are going ahead without us,'' he said. ''And in Washington we don't even seem to be aware of it.''
The difficulty is that the Allies have often sought to assert that interest, intruding in petty ways that are beginning to offend West Berliners not old enough to remember the days of the Berlin airlift in 1948-49, which enabled West Berlin to survive a Soviet blockade.
 
British Helicopter Evicted
A few days after the Berlin wall was opened last month, the British authorities sent a helicopter to hover over the western side of the Brandenburg Gate, in their sector, to make sure crowds there did not get out of hand. A senior British diplomat was talking to a reporter on one of those days when the telephone rang. ''It's the damned Germans,'' he said, ''telling me to get my chopper off the Brandenburg Gate.''
A Berliner flying into the city on British Airways the other day said: ''When Lufthansa gets permission to fly here, these planes will be empty. We'll remember how British Airways treated us all these years.''
Klaus Bolling, a journalist who lives in Berlin and formerly headed West Germany's diplomatic mission to East Germany, said: ''The Allied military attaches all behave at times like representatives of their national airlines. The Allies are being shortsighted.'' Only airlines in the hands of American, British or French owners can fly in and out of Tegel and Tempelhof airports in West Berlin. Lufthansa, the West German airline, has suggested to the East German authorities that Lufthansa and Interflug, the East German carrier, start direct services to the West from Schonefeld airport on the outskirts of East Berlin. The two lines have initiated direct connections between Leipzig and Frankfurt and between East Berlin and Hamburg, but the allies, who control the air corridors over East Germany, have been reluctant to grant them long-term rights.
As an economic interest, the allied monopoly on commercial flights to West Berlin is small potatoes compared with the possibilities that may soon open up for West German business in East Germany.
 
Business Trip to Dresden
Today, for instance, Lothar Spath, the Governor of the West German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, flew to Dresden with a delegation of West German business leaders, to discuss cooperation agreements, joint ventures and other practical steps with their East German counterparts. They were greeted by Dresden's Mayor, Wolfgang Berghofer, who said, ''The two German states will always remain the heart of the common European house.''
On Thursday, Helmut Haussmann, the West German Economics Minister, will arrive in East Berlin for talks with his counterpart, Christa Luft. The agenda includes East German plans for economic liberalization, West German help in rebuilding East Germany's transport and communications networks, and insuring the security of investment and joint ventures involving Western companies. Chancellor Kohl, who promised a ''completely new dimension of economic aid'' to East Germany if it moved toward democracy, is to meet with Prime Minister Hans Modrow in Dresden on Dec. 19.
But, the daily Der Tagesspiegel pointed out today, West German business leaders are already way ahead of them.
''For most companies - on both sides - the German question no longer seems to be an obstacle,'' the paper said. ''All of them have plans in the desk drawer for cooperation. Not arguments over technical terms but practical day-to-day steps will bring down the borders. 'Reunification' at the basic economic level has already taken place.''
 
Gorbachev Cautions West
MOSCOW, Dec. 10 (Reuters) -President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pledging that the Soviet Union will not allow harm to come to East Germany, has warned the West against taking advantage of the turmoil there.
In a speech to the Communist Party Central Committee, Mr. Gorbachev reaffirmed that Moscow would not interfere in the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and said all East Europeans had the right to decide their fate.
But he made clear that he considered any move toward German reunification destabilizing and that Moscow would resist Western attempts to push the issue. His speech was delivered on Saturday and published today in Pravda, the party daily.

HEADLINE: Raw and Bawdy, 42d St. Awaits a Big Change

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
Near the edges of Times Square, new office towers and hotels are climbing toward the gray winter sky - an image of progress wrapped in glass and steel.
But in the neon heart of the neighborhood, especially along 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, life and the skyline have been frozen in place as the delay in developing the area goes into its ninth year.
The area, traditionally a hub for everything from the legitimate to the marginal to the outright criminal, remains a gathering spot for runaways and tourists, for longtime shop owners and young immigrants, for theatergoers and security guards, for drug dealers and their customers. All this is bathed in the blazing lights of huge electronic billboards, movie house marquees and book stores that call themselves ''adult.''
 
'Exciting' and 'Disgusting'
''It's exciting,'' said Leonard Washington, a 14-year-old from the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. ''It has a lot of games and cheap movies. You feel protected because there are so many cops around.'' 
But for Marcia Bell, 37, who works in the area as a legal secretary, the bright lights illuminate decay - trash swirling down the street, streams of urine in the doorways, shattered liquor bottles on the sidewalks and legions of hollow-cheeked men whispering about drugs for sale as police officers stand nearby.
''It's the most disgusting seven minutes of my day,'' she said, describing her walk along 42d Street from her job to the subway. ''You're always stepping between the drugs and the money.''
The pace and face of Times Square could soon change. Work on a $2.5 billion 42d Street development project -delayed for years by court challenges - may finally begin by the middle of next year, according to the state agency overseeing the program.
''I think we're out of the woods,'' said Brian K. Kell, a spokesman for the New York State Urban Development Corporation. ''We think all the significant litigation has been decided.''
If the project goes according to the agency's vision, it should be substantially completed by about 1994, nearly 15 years after it was first proposed and opposed. #4 Office Towers Planned Under the plan, four office towers will loom over 42d Street, joining about 15 skyscrapers now under construction or near completion in the area. The more than 40 adult book stores and peep shows that dot Times Square will be swept away and nine once grand theaters restored.
By the time the dust settles, 20 buildings will have been demolished and more than 400 businesses displaced.
In the meantime Times Square remains what it has been for decades, a midtown carnival midway - both enticing and menacing.
Times Square is a crossroads above and below its streets, said William Kornblum, director of the Center for Social Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York City. Mr. Kornblum's graduate students once estimated the pedestrian traffic in an hour on 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues to be 3,600 people.
 
Heavy Traffic Underground
The traffic flow is similar beneath its streets. Five subway lines converge under Times Square, and more than 120,000 people a day hustle through the Times Square subway station, making it the second busiest in the city. Only the Grand Central subway station handles more people.
Above ground, people have long flocked to the area to sample its smorgasbord of restaurants, theaters and movie houses. Many of the nightclubs that were once common have long gone, but along 42d Street a customer can still see two first-run movies for the price of one.
''This is like a big social area,'' said Theo Butts, 20, a Bronxite, as he stood on the corner of 42d and Broadway, trying to decide which movie to see. ''There's a lot of different things to do here. We don't have this stuff in our neighborhoods.''
But Times Square is suffering, Mr. Kornblum said.
''Many parts of the city are getting more dangerous, and especially the segregated low-income parts of the city,'' he said. ''And the violence is spilling over into public places. That's Times Square.''
 
A Magnet for Crime
In 1988 an average of six to seven crimes a day were reported on 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
''I think it's probably worse this year,'' said William H. Daly, director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement. ''Criminals gather there to plan their forays into other parts of the city and into other parts of Times Square.''
What a difference a block makes. A yearlong total of 39 crimes were reported on 42d Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, Mr. Daly said.
Mr. Daly's agency was created 14 years ago to clean up Times Square by aggressively enforcing city building codes and business licenses. When it started, Times Square was overrun by the commercial sex trade.
''Forty Second Street has always been a naughty zone,'' Mr. Daly said. ''In the 60's it became a sex zone, a red-light district. Now the problem is crack and acts of violence.''
But he added: ''I would hate people to get a one-sided view, that it's all trouble spots. There has been a lot of progress over the last 14 years. But crack has really complicated our efforts.''
The commander of the Midtown South Police Precinct, Deputy Inspector George F. Brown, said robberies and assaults in the Times Square area were up in August, September and October.
The inspector said he had increased the number of officers patrolling the area in uniform, on horseback, on motor scooter and in plainclothes. He declined to say exactly how many more officers had been deployed.
 
A Narcotics Marketplace
In Times Square, there is little rest for the wicked or the good.
Even on a cold night and well into the next morning last week, drug dealers were out in force. They stood in packs on the corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue, hopping up and down to fight the chill, and in one's and two's along the street.
From darkened doorways that often glowed with the flicker of a cheap cigarette lighter at the end of a crack pipe, the dealers hawked their wares to almost everyone who passed, from middle-aged men in suits hurrying into the adult book shops to sandy-haired young men from New Jersey, looking for thrills and a little marijuana.
''We came over here to get some beers and maybe cop some weed,'' said a 20-year-old from across the river who said his name was Harry Kramer. ''Drugs rule New York. And this is the place to get them.''
It was shortly before 2 A.M. in front of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. As Mr. Kramer left to buy a can of beer, his friend, who refused to gave his name, said he wanted only to get out of the area in one piece. Minutes before, the two men had been chased across Eighth Avenue by an eager drug peddler.
''Another friend of mine got his butt kicked around here,'' the man said. ''They pulled out some guns and took his money.''
Indeed, violence is in the wind blowing through Times Square.
''The drug addicts come around the corner like thirsty warmongers,'' said Jeff McCalvin, 24 and unemployed, who said he ''hangs out'' on Eighth Avenue.
''Any unsuspecting cat they see, they attack,'' he said. ''They dive on him like the linebackers on the Giants.''
On Sept. 18 at 8:30 P.M. at 42d and Eighth Avenue, a drug dealer was shot and killed in a dispute with another dealer. On Nov. 25 a police officer, a suspect and a passer-by were wounded in a gunfight that started when the officer spotted a young man with a gun on Seventh Avenue near 43d Street.
Ali Nettles, 24, has been hanging out in Times Square for 15 years. He said money drew him to its dirty streets.
''Thousands and thousands of dollars can be taken from people who don't know what they're doing,'' Mr. Nettles said. ''There are all kinds of cons you can run on the tourists, on the foreigners. If you can't get a dollar down here, there's something wrong with you.''
 
'Anything for Money'
When the confidence games fail, Mr. Nettles said, many people, including himself at least once, turn to robbery.
''I just got out of jail for robbing somebody at the Port Authority,'' he said. ''But I only did that one time. I ain't a robber.''
Jeff Cohen earns his money not on the street, but behind the counter of The Funny Store, a novelty shop on Seventh Avenue a few steps from 42d Street. His family has operated the store since the 1950's.
Mr. Cohen said that in the last few years he had noticed a marked difference in the neighborhood. ''People are more desperate,'' he said. ''They'll do anything for money.''
His customers are tourists and teen-agers shopping for magic tricks and practical jokes. Plastic vomit is a big seller.
Mr. Cohen said he was opposed to the redevelopment project because it would put his family out of business. The Urban Development Corporation promises to help businesses relocate, but in the novelty trade, Mr. Cohen said, location is king.
''If you're on 18th Street and Ninth Avenue, it's not the same,'' he said. ''See the floor, it's worn out from people coming in here.''
Seven blocks away the floors of the new Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Hotel are like shiny ice.
The 765-room hotel, which rises 46 stories above Broadway between 48th and 49th Streets, opened Dec. 1. A week later its second-floor lobby was filled with guests waiting for rooms and a drink from the still unfinished bar.
Daniel Risi, the bartender, said he hoped the new hotel and other buildings going up in and around Times Square would rejuvenate the area.
''It won't end crime,'' he said. ''Like prostitution won't end. But the cleaner the area, the better it'll look and, who knows, maybe it'll attract a more sophisticated criminal.''
Down the street on Broadway near 46th Street, a Salvation Army captain, Andres Lugo, and a volunteer, Clark (Shorty) Erskine, stood guard around their red collection kettle. The night before two thieves stole the kettle from a 65-year-old volunteer. Mr. Lugo retrieved the empty kettle from the police.
On the corner, about a dozen young men circled a cardboard box playing a confidence game called three-card monte. Their laughter mingled with the sound of Captain Lugo's bell.
''They scare people away,'' Mr. Lugo said, pointing to the men on the corner. ''People don't want to pull out their money with them around.''
Mr. Lugo said the new hotels and office buildings made Times Square ''cosmetically nicer,'' but will do almost nothing to improve the lives of ''the little guys on the street.''
''I feed 150 people daily at our post on 47th Street,'' he said. ''It doesn't change. It doesn't get any better.''
 
And Now 'Zombies'
At 1:40 A.M. a dozen people were sipping hot chocolate and coffee in a narrow fast-food restaurant on 42d Street. Some of the men were talking loudly and flashing wads of cash - mostly $1 bills.
They talked about discos and guns and making money.
''Did you read about that dude in the paper the other day?'' one man asked his friends. ''He got busted with a whole bunch of ice.'' ''Ice?'' ''That new stuff,'' the man said, referring to a powerful smokable methamphetamine. ''What's it do to you?'' ''You don't want to mess with it,'' the man said. ''They say people walk around like zombies.''
Then the man walked slowly across the floor, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling. ''Is it like crack?'' ''It's worse than crack,'' he said. ''It kills more people.''
The men laughed and shook hands and then stepped into the cold, dark morning that had settled over Times Square.

HEADLINE: DENG CITES A NEED TO REPAIR U.S. TIES

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 10

 BODY:
China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, meeting the first high-level American officials to visit here since the June killings in Tiananmen Square, said today that the two countries must restore and improve their strained relations in the interest of world stability.
''We share common desires and common needs,'' Mr. Deng told Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President Bush, and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, American Deputy Secretary of State. ''In spite of the disputes and the differences between us, after all, Chinese-American relations have to be improved. That is something necessary for world peace and stability.'' 
Mr. Scowcroft replied that the United States agreed, ''and we are interested in working with you to promote that.''
The visit of Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Eagleburger was announced by the White House only after they arrived in Beijing early yesterday morning as special envoys of President Bush.
The Chinese have regularly said that relations with the United States, deeply strained since the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in June, could only be improved by American initiatives, and this daylong visit appears to have been such a gesture.
While the Chinese have focused attention on the visit with much pleasure and publicity, American officials have treated the affair gingerly, providing little information about the meetings or their substance.
For example, the official New China News Agency said tonight that Mr. Scowcroft had ''described his visit as positive, constructive and beneficial,'' but American officials showed no willingness to make such characterizations.
 
Steps Taken by Bush
After the Chinese killed hundreds of protesters in June, President Bush imposed an embargo on high-level exchanges, ordered some economic sanctions and suspended all military and civilian weapons sales to China.
He has also allowed Chinese students in the United States who fear reprisals on their return home to remain in America, an action that has drawn Chinese objections, most recently on Friday.
Mr. Deng, 85 years old, formally retired from his last official post last month, but he said it would be ''impolite and unreasonable for me not to receive a personal emissary of my friend President Bush.''
''I think we should say it is the common desire of our two sides to put an end as soon as possible to the disputes between China and the United States prevailing ever since June of this year,'' Mr. Deng added. ''Because we share common desires and common needs, I think in the end we can find a solution.''
Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Eagleburger left this afternoon for Tokyo to brief Japanese officials on the Malta talks.
An American official said only that the two days of discussions here had laid ''good groundwork'' for better relations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Li Zhaoxing, called the conversations useful and constructive.
''I think both sides are happy about the discussions,'' he said. ''Both sides expressed willingness to overcome their differences.''
 
The Nixon Relationship
Mr. Deng - working with the Nixon Adminstration, in which both Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Eagleburger held high posts - rapidly forged a close Chinese-American relationship as a counterbalance to Soviet influence.
Despite significant changes in the Soviet Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, including a conciliation of sorts with China, Beijing and Washington officials both seem happier to be on speaking terms again.
When Mr. Deng met former President Richard M. Nixon here a month ago, he accused the United States of having promoted the Chinese democracy movement and added that Washington had been ''involved too deeply.'' There were no such comments today. Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Eagleburger, though wary of commenting on the substance of today's discussions, did describe Mr. Deng as weaker and less able to concentrate than in his February meeting with President Bush.
''There has been some slipping,'' an official said. ''Deng was jovial as ever, but seemed to have some difficulty focusing on people. While he usually looks people directly in the face, his eyes sort of glazed over Scowcroft.''
The officials said that one of Mr. Deng's daughters sat behind him and retranslated the English with his native Sichuan accent, which created an echo effect, and that she touched him on the arm when it seemed appropriate for him to speak.
Mr. Deng began the meeting, the American officials said, by saying in Chinese, ''I'm so glad President Carter sent you,'' but corrected himself after having been nudged by his daughter.
 
Criticism by a Top Senator
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 (Special to The New York Times) - Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, today criticized the White House mission to China, saying the Administration should have waited until China improved its human rights policies before seeking closer ties.
''At the very time that freedom is sweeping through Eastern Europe, we should be sure the United States stands for freedom and democracy in Asia as well,'' Mr. Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, said in a prepared statement.

HEADLINE: Baker, in a Call to Shevardnadze, Asks Action on Central America

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Days after the Malta summit meeting, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d reiterated in an hourlong phone conversation with the Soviet Foreign Minister that Moscow must take stronger steps to stem the spread of Soviet-made arms in Central America, both men said in programs broadcast today.
Administration officials said Mr. Baker had told the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, at Malta last weekend that he wanted to call him later in the week to go over in more detail subjects that he felt had not been explored fully during the meeting; the summit sessions off Malta were curtailed by high seas and foul weather.
The fact that Mr. Baker spent almost the entire conversation on Thursday discussing Central America, a subject on which Mr. Bush had already gone into detail with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Malta talks, probably had as much to do with domestic American politics as United States-Soviet relations.
After the Malta meeting, many commentators and politicians in the right wing of the Republican Party criticized the Bush Administration for offering Moscow a broad array of economic incentives, apparently without getting anything in return. The criticisms focused on Central America, where Nicaragua and Cuba have reportedly been providing Soviet-made arms for the latest rebel offensive in El Salvador. 
 
A Political Price
An Administration official said that during the conversation Mr. Baker ''made it absolutely clear'' to Mr. Shevardnadze that there would be a political price for Moscow if it did not do more to insure that the Nicaraguan Government allows free elections in February and that Managua and Havana stop shipping arms to leftist guerrillas in Central America.
The official added that Mr. Baker had told Mr. Shevardnadze that the Bush Administration was, to some extent, going out on a limb in offering Moscow economic cooperation and that it could not continue to do this while the Soviet Union allowed its allies in Central America to support insurrections.
Mr. Shevardnadze, the official said, ''did not make any promises.''
''There is no deal here. But I think after talking with Baker he had a better appreciation of the problem.''
Asked about the conversation with the Soviet Foreign Minister on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Mr. Baker said that ''what he really said was this is something that bears some thinking, some looking at.''
''I went into a bit more detail on points that we have made before, that they need to do a little bit more leaning on their clients in Central America to stop these weapons from going to the F.M.L.N,'' Mr. Baker said, referring to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the Salvadoran rebel coalition.
 
'An Interesting Proposal'
The Baker-Shevardnadze conversation was not initially disclosed by Mr. Baker. He was asked about it today only after it was disclosed earlier by Mr. Shevardnadze in an interview on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' That interview, through an interpreter, was conducted Friday in Moscow.
''We discussed Central America,'' Mr. Shevardnadze told his interviewer, ''and some other questions as well, but mostly Central America. We suggested - and I think that it's an interesting proposal that should be seriously discussed - that talks should begin between Central American countries about reducing weapons generally, about having defensive sufficiency over there.''
''But that, I would say, is a long-term question,'' he added. ''I think at the present time, we must make sure that those agreements that were reached by the presidents of the Central American countries be implemented. Here, of course, Nicaragua, Honduras, the Soviet Union, and naturally, the U.S., have certain obligations and responsibilities. We must help that agreement to be implemented.''
Mr Baker spoke before he was to depart for talks this week in London, Berlin, Bonn and Brussels on the changes sweeping Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Congressman Is Seeking to Balance Constituent Jobs and Military Budget

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BREMERTON, Wash., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Guns and butter are pretty much the same thing in this small community on the western shore of Puget Sound, the home of one of the few Navy yards that can overhaul nuclear-powered vessels.
So it was more than passing curiosity that brought the local Navy brass and Bremerton's business leaders to the Officers' Club to hear Representative Norman Dicks tell how the thawing of the cold war and the reduced Soviet threat in Eastern Europe might affect the Navy's share of the shrinking Pentagon budget.
Across the sound, Seattle and Tacoma are enjoying commercial growth almost independent of the military presence here. Chang Mook Sohn, the chief economic adviser for Gov. Booth Gardner, said, ''The growth is well balanced because the Seattle region has been diversifying in trade and computer technology, and we are in a position to offset some of the potential defense cuts.'' 
 
Shipyard and Base Are the Keys
For Mr. Dicks's Bremerton constituents, fortune remains linked to the shipyard and the Navy's Trident base and Keyport torpedo station 20 miles north of here. The constituents are counting on their shipyard's unique role on the West Coast, and counting on the Trident subs being the last to go at the bargaining table if arms control proceeds more rapidly than anticipated.
''I see the Navy playing a major role,'' Mr. Dicks, a six-term Democrat, reassured his constituents. True, he said, the military construction budget had been ''savaged,'' but he had made sure the allotments would include $18 million for the first installment of a three-year package to upgrade repair facilities at the yard's Pier 4.
Mr. Dicks, a former linebacker for the University of Washington, is as aggressive on the House Appropriations Committee as he was on the football field.
On Capitol Hill, ''Stormin' Norman'' looks out for this state's interests as head of the Subcommittees on Defense, Military Construction and the Interior. He learned that part of his job at the knees of the masters, Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson.
For nearly four decades, they saw to it that few spending bills left the Senate without money going home for some highway, hospital, water project or military installation.
 
The Influence of the Elders
''Maggie used to say, 'Norm, don't ever let these guys get into new construction - overhaul and repair work, that's where you get stability,' '' said Mr. Dicks, who was Mr. Magnuson's administrative aide before he ran for Congress himself in 1976.
On broader questions of military policy, the 48-year-old Congressman's views on the military tend to reflect the conservative influence of Senator Jackson. Like the late Senator, Mr. Dicks has managed to create an an important role in this arena while watching out for the interests of the Boeing Company, the Seattle-based aerospace giant to which 1 out of 10 jobs in the state is related.
His district, centered in Tacoma, does not include Boeing, but 15,000 residents of the district work at Boeing, which is a principal subcontractor on the B-2.
As Mr. Dicks toured the district last week, he was blunt about the likelihood that the Air Force would be buying fewer than the 132 bombers originally envisioned, but he told the constituents that nearly 75 percent of Boeing's business was now commercial rather than military.
 
Economists Are Confident
Private economists say that at worst, cancelling the B-2 program would mean workers would be easily absorbed into a growing commercial market. About 7 percent of the workers in the Puget Sound region hold military-related jobs, says the Governor's economic adviser.
Tacoma is more concerned about the Fort Lewis Army base, home of the Ninth Infantry Division, and the McChord Air Force base, a military airlift center that may become home to the new C-17 transport.
The day Mr. Dicks spoke to business leaders in Lakewood, adjacent to the two bases, the local newspaper had a front-page article reporting that the Ninth Infantry had been singled out as the most likely for elimination.
Mr. Dicks phoned Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He reported later that no final decision had been made. But he told the business leaders he believed the Ninth was vulnerable. He said Army officials had led him to expect that some other division, perhaps one brought back from Europe, would be transferred to Fort Lewis to replace the Ninth. A Misdirected Focus? ''Inevitably, there is going to be a draw-down in the Army,'' Mr. Dicks said. ''I don't think we should look at this as something ominous even though we may have problems right here in the Sixth District. The economy is strong, and if we have to go through this transition, this is the best time to do it.''
Glenn Pascall, a Seattle economist and public policy consultant who has carried out studies for the state on the effect of the military presence in Washington, said that in some ways real production in Tacoma would boost the city's economy.
Mr. Pascall says that both Representative Dicks and retired military people in the district focus too much on a military-based economy and neglect private development. For example, he said, local business groups and politicians should be looking at the opportunity to convert McChord into a commercial airport if the Air Force decides to abandon it.
Mayor-elect Karen Vialle of Tacoma said that residents of Tacoma were used to worrying about the ups and downs of Pentagon budget-making. ''We really don't know what's going to happen,'' she said. ''We're relying on Congressman Dicks to manage these impacts.''

HEADLINE: More Republican Lobbying of H.U.D. Is Disclosed

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Several prominent Republicans and party supporters, not identified in Government files made public earlier this year, have acknowledged that they also lobbied former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and his aides on behalf of development projects, some of which received Federal assistance.
Their names expand the list of well-known Republicans who have benefited personally or obtained assistance for others under multibillion-dollar Department of Housing and Urban Development programs in the Reagan Administration.
The newly disclosed lobbying contacts also provide further evidence of a pattern under Mr. Pierce in which consultants and others with political ties figured in the department's awards process. As a rule, there is nothing illegal about the contacts, but lawmakers and Federal investigators have questioned whether money was awarded regardless of merit.
These lobbying efforts also appear to offer significant examples of how Mr. Pierce, who has indicated that he generally did not participate in the selection of projects to receive assistance, would become involved when called upon by political allies. 
 
Some Who Contacted Pierce
Among those now identified as lobbying the housing department or having been involved in its programs are the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, a veteran of the civil rights movement; Thaddeus Garrett, a longtime friend of President Bush, and David M. Barrett, who headed the organization Lawyers for Reagan in 1980.
Mr. Barrett was identified in H.U.D. documents. Mr. Abernathy and the others were identified in recent interviews with current and former agency officials.
Mr. Pierce's chief lawyer, Paul L. Perito, said in an interview that there was ''nothing illegal or improper'' in whatever dealings Mr. Pierce may have had with Republicans promoting housing projects. The meetings, he said, ''are typical of a Cabinet secretary.''
''Mr. Pierce made himself available to Republicans as well as Democrats,'' Mr. Perito said. ''There is no suggestion nor evidence that as a result of some meeting or as a result of some internal process within H.U.D., that Mr. Pierce received anything of value.''
 
Weeks of Lobbying
These are the newly identified H.U.D. consultants and aid recipients:
* Mr. Abernathy, who endorsed Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election, and whose anti-poverty organization received an agency subcontract, worth as much as $75,000, to provide economic analysis. But the organization's executive vice president said the group had so far received only about $3,000. The award followed weeks of promoting the organization within the housing department, the official said.
* Mr. Garrett, who was Mr. Bush's domestic policy adviser when Mr. Bush was Vice President, and who said through a spokesman that his consulting firm was paid about $9,000 for lobbying H.U.D. and other work on a hotel rehabilitation project in Akron, Ohio. The spokesman, Nicholas T. George, the general counsel for Mr. Garrett's firm in Washington, said that the firm spent dozens of hours over several weeks on the project, and that he was certain that Mr. Garrett's lobbying effort helped secure the $1.8 million grant in 1987. The firm would have received a total of $36,000 if the project had been completed, Mr. George said. But problems in removing asbestos from the site prevented completion.
* B. Melvin Hurwitz, who was a Congressional liaison for the Agency for International Development in the Reagan Administration, and who assisted The Woodlands, an affluent planned community near Houston, in obtaining a $200,000 grant in 1985 from one of Mr. Pierce's two major discretionary funds. H.U.D. documents show the money was used to build a firehouse and emergency treatment center.
Mr. Hurwitz, who was under contract as a lobbyist and legal adviser for an energy company based at The Woodlands, said he put in ''literally months and months and months'' pursuing the grant. And he said there was nothing surprising about the award, since The Woodlands was created in large part through the assistance of housing agency programs in the 1970's.
* Former Mayor Charles Evers of Fayette, Miss., a friend of Mr. Pierce's, said that shortly after a meeting with Mr. Pierce in Washington about two years ago, his city received a discretionary grant of $300,000 to rehabilitate low-income housing. ''I spoke to him as a Republican, and as a black man,'' Mr. Evers said in an interview. Mr. Evers and his successor said the money had been used wisely.
Internal agency documents also show that Mr. Barrett, a Washington laywer who is also a major housing developer involved in H.U.D.-related programs, met repeatedly with at least two senior agency officials in 1986 and 1987.
Federal investigators and news reports have previously identified a large number of prominent Republicans who participated as consultants or developers in H.U.D. programs, including former Interior Secretary James Watt, former Housing Secretary Carla Hills and Paul Manafort, a top campaign adviser to President Bush.
Earlier this month, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh opened a formal criminal investigation to determine whether a special prosecutor, known under Federal law as an independent counsel, should be appointed to investigate Mr. Pierce.
Mr. Abernathy, the former president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, is also the founder of an anti-poverty organization, the Foundation for Economic Enterprises Development, or FEED, that was hired as a subcontractor on a 1985 grant.
In an interview, Mr. Abernathy said that he created the foundation shortly after he endorsed Mr. Reagan's candidacy in 1980 and that the group hoped to establish job training programs for unemployed black youths. ''I was impressed with Reagan's talk about jobs and income for the youth of America, blacks in particular, and so we founded the organization,'' he said.
The foundation's executive vice president, James E. Peterson, recalled that he met with Secretary Pierce before the subcontract was awarded to the organization, and was initially told by the Secretary that H.U.D. would be unable to help.
''But I didn't give up,'' Mr. Peterson said. And later, he said, following conversations with top aides to Mr. Pierce, the organization was offered the subcontract, worth from $50,000 to $75,000, on a $280,000 grant intended to encourage the participation of minority businesses in Federal development programs.
The grant was awarded to One America Inc., a consulting firm. A former senior housing department official, who asked not to be named, said One America was directed by Mr. Pierce's senior staff to name FEED as a subcontractor. The head of One America, Elaine B. Jenkins, denied that, saying that she chose the organizationlargely because of Mr. Peterson's experience in poverty programs.
The relationship between One American Inc., a consulting firm that received the grant, and its subcontractor, FEED, did not end amicably. Mr. Peterson said the organization has only been paid about $3,000 from the subcontract, which required the firm to analyze economic conditions in selected areas. Mrs. Jenkins, said the organization did not deserve additional payments because it had not performed adequately.
 
Rent Subsidy Program
Mr. Barrett, who headed Lawyers for Reagan and was chairman of Mr. Reagan's 1980 transition team at the Securities and Exchange Commission, was a 50 percent owner in at least two Oklahoma housing projects that received rent subsidy guarantees from H.U.D.'s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program.
One of Mr. Barrett's projects in Tulsa received a $1.7 million contract in April 1987.
Mr. Barrett is a friend of Thomas Demery, Assistant Secretary for Housing under Mr. Pierce and one of the officials who directed the rehabilitation program. Agency records show that Mr. Barrett was also in touch with Deborah Gore Dean, Mr. Pierce's executive assistant at the department.
Mr. Barrett has not returned phone calls for comment. Mr. Demery said final decisions on the Tulsa project were ''not made by me,'' and added, ''I had never had any discussions with Mr. Barrett about Mod Rehab - period.''
A lawyer for Ms. Dean, Joseph A. Artabane, said his client did not do any favors for Mr. Barrett, ''none whatsoever.''

HEADLINE: Like a Godzilla Working the Forests of Oregon;
Why the Job Loss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It's always tricky to argue statistics, particularly when a source is not given and a point is being made.
Karen-Alicia Robertson asserts that ''four of every 10 dollars that Oregonians earn are made from the harvesting and cutting of trees'' without giving a source for her figures (''Oregon: Put Through the Mill,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 27). Ms. Robertson uses this statistic to imply that 40 percent of the jobs in Oregon will be lost if the remaining stands of old-growth trees in the national forests are preserved.
The truth, however, is that the real threat to timber jobs in Oregon is the timber industry itself, and the most telling statistics are these: in the last 10 years, employment in Oregon's timber industry has fallen by 20 percent while the amount of timber cut in the state's national forests has risen by 18 percent (i.e., according to the U.S. Forest Service, 18 percent more was cut in 1988 than in 1978, with fluctuations in cut levels, but a general rise in the years in between). 
There are two principal reasons for this, and neither of them is zealous environmentalists, as Ms. Robertson and the timber industry would have us believe. They are automation and the export of raw logs from private lands. According to a State of Oregon study, 3.5 billion board feet of raw logs were shipped from the Pacific Northwest to Japan in 1988 alone. That cost the region 37,000 jobs in wood processing.
The frustration and fear of Pacific Northwest logging communities are understandable, but their anger at environmental groups that have gone to court to block some timber sales is misplaced. Timber production is at an all-time high, higher than can possibly be sustained for long under any conceivable logging schedule.
The economy of the region will change no matter what anyone does now. Ms. Robertson scoffs at tourism as a replacement for lost logging jobs. Her numbers for Oregon's economy (42 percent wood products, 40 percent agriculture, 18 percent everything else) differ remarkably from the State of Oregon's own (6 percent wood products, 3.9 percent agriculture, 90 percent everything else).
No matter what economic figures you use, however, the fact remains that the ancient forests are almost gone, and whether they are saved or not won't make much difference for the future of logging jobs in Oregon. It will, however, make all the difference in the world for the northern spotted owl and numerous other creatures that require old-growth forests for their survival and for the trees themselves. We should save what we can now, while there's still time to do so.

HEADLINE: We Must Help Besieged Salvador

BYLINE: By Vin Weber; Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, is secretary of the House Republican Conference.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For more than a month, Americans have watched El Salvador turn ugly. Staring at the blood and chaos, Americans are now asking, once again, whether U.S. policy there is working. It is. Ten years ago, El Salvador was ruled by a military junta. Today, it is a working democracy that has held four fair elections.
Ten years ago, political killings skyrocketed to nearly 800 a month. Before the recent outbreak of violence, political murders - though still too frequent - had dropped to under 20 a month. 
Ten years ago, El Salvador's criminal justice system was in tatters. Today, the rule of law, though still uneven, is taking root.
Some in and out of Congress have pointed to the recent violence as justification for limiting or cutting off U.S. aid. Instead, the attack on democracy in El Salvador today makes our assistance even more critical.
U.S. policy has been successful in El Salvador because it has been bipartisan. And the continuing aid formula, which Ronald Reagan and Democratic leaders agreed to in the early 1980's ($3 in economic aid for every dollar in military help), has made a difference.
U.S. aid gave us the leverage to help El Salvador hold its first free election in decades, in 1984. And it has given us the leverage since then to help democracy last.
The proof: 56 percent of El Salvador's registered voters cast their ballots in 1989 (higher participation than our last Presidential election), despite widespread death threats from the rebels. International observers declared the election valid and the presidency changed party hands, peacefully, for the first time in El Salvador's history.
In fact, it is El Salvador's democratic success, not its failure, that motivated the latest rebel offensive. Watching their own influence decline as each election bestowed new legitimacy on the Government, the guerrillas concluded that they faced political extinction. Their surprise attack, like the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War, was designed to win a political victory even if it failed militarily.
We must not let that happen. The rebels showed their true stripes when they took American civilians captive at the Sheraton Hotel. Their reign of terror against small town mayors and sitting judges rivals that of the Colombian drug cartels. If there remained any doubt, the crash of a plane carring Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles confirmed that the rebels are being supplied by Nicaragua. Such incidents, considered alongside their boycott of elections, make the rebels' call for peaceful negotiations dubious.
The leftist guerrillas will succeed only if we draw the wrong conclusion from the cold-blooded murder of six Jesuit priests. Those who argue that we should eliminate aid say that the killings overshadow the progress of the last 10 years.
In fact, just the opposite is true. Cutting off aid would undermine the rule of law, weaken the Government and siphon power to the extremes on the left and right. The result would mean more, not fewer, killings.
Instead, we need to renew our support for El Salvador's criminal justice system in order to track down, prosecute and punish those who commit such crimes. Though that system is fragile, U.S. aid is helping to improve it. For example, not one demonstrator has been killed in organized marches since 1986, thanks to improved training for El Salvador's police force, paid for with U.S. funds.
Reacting quickly to the latest killings, El Salvador's President, Alfredo Cristiani, immediately called in a U.S.-funded special investigative unit. So far, the unit's members have been slow to interview military units, a step the U.S. has insisted they take. We need to speed up that process. But if we eliminate U.S. aid, the unit will evaporate, along with our best chance of controlling extremists.
Less-than-perfect democracies often must contend with political violence; more than 100 were killed in the recent Indian elections. Although violence has not disappeared in El Salvador, our policy is working. We must not forget the lessons of the last 10 years and abandon this fledgling democracy when its life is most threatened.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Bank Takeover May Imperil Other Realty Lending

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The Government takeover of New Jersey's largest savings institution last Friday could cramp the state's already ailing real-estate market by making other lenders more cautious about backing large housing developments and office projects, experts said today.
For home buyers, the collapse of the City Federal Savings Bank also will temporarily dry up one of New Jersey's largest sources of residential mortgages. And businesses that have already applied for loans from City Federal will be delayed as their applications undergo review by Government regulators who have taken the bank. City Federal, which has $9.8 billion in assets and $7.3 billion in deposit accounts, collapsed primarily because it had many real-estate loans in New Jersey, Florida and Texas that went bad, the regulators said. 
The savings institution is the second-largest to be placed in Federal receivership, after Gibraltar Savings of Los Angeles. The Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that was named the bank's receiver, now controls 280 savings institutions, including four in New Jersey besides City Federal.
The takeover had been expected for at least a month. Still, when Federal regulators appeared at the bank's headquarters in Somerset at 2 P.M. Friday, the region's housing and commercial office construction industries were shaken. ''I think every major lending institution in the state is taking a very, very cautious look,'' said Thomas J. Stanton, chairman emeritus of the National Westminster Bank, N.J., in Jersey City and chairman of the New Jersey Committee of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit agency that studies and makes recommendations on public issues in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. He said City Federal's problems would add to the hard times in the state's real-estate market since Wall Street firms began large layoffs after the stock market dropped dramatically in October 1987. There is a growing backlog of unsold condominiums and unleased office space.
Mr. Stanton said City Federal's insolvency would make other lenders even more reluctant to back new housing and office projects and could indicate that other savings institutions that lent money too freely will have troubles. ''Real estate goes in cycles, so I don't think this is going to be a big disaster,'' he said. ''But in the meantime, for some less strong institutions there are going to be real problems.''
City Federal, with 77 branch offices in New Jersey and an additional 28 in Florida, became a major investor in commercial and residential real-estate projects during the 1980's. But as the decade wore on, those investments proved to be riskier than anticipated.
By last Sept. 30, City Federal showed a third-quarter loss of $224 million, with $747 million in loans that were either past due or not paying interest.
One of the most visible of the bank's real-estate lending ventures is Port Liberte, a $750 million complex of 2,250 apartments and town houses on a system of man-made canals at the Hudson River's edge in Jersey City. About 360 of the units, and much of the canals, have already been built, but sales have been reported to be slow.
City Federal led a consortium of several financial institutions, eventually including National Westminster Bank, in financing Port Liberte. Mr. Stanton of National Westminster said some of Port Liberte's problems are shared by other projects around the state. During the economic boom years of the 1980's, cities and towns required developers of large projects to put in all the roads, sewers, water lines and other services at once, he said, even if the housing or office space was to be constructed in stages over many years.
''On a lot of those projects, as the economy slowed, developers stopped building, but they had to go ahead with all that infrastructure,'' he said.
 
Decline in Building Permits
According to the New Jersey Department of Labor, building permits for apartments and houses in New Jersey reached a peak of 57,074 in 1986 and have been dropping since. The most recent figures available show 40,268 permits were issued in 1988.
Mr. Stanton said lenders may now use different criteria for determining whether to back a project. ''When things were booming, you could look at where a project was located, the quality of the building that was going on,'' he said. ''Banks are now going to be looking at the strength of the builder rather than of the project.''
This could mean that small development companies and builders will find it far more difficult to obtain financing, while big companies with established records and the ability to withstand a prolonged economic slowdown will continue to attract funds.
''I don't think it's City Federal that is going to make them do that - I think they've started to do that already,'' said Peter S. Reinhart, senior vice president of K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, a leading builder. Mr. Reinhart, who is president of the New Jersey Shore Builders Association, said that City Federal had a small part of Hovnanian's overall line of credit but that he did not think the takeover ''will make a difference for us.''
 
Declared Insolvent
The takeover Friday meant that the bank was declared insolvent by the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which then appointed as receiver the Resolution Trust Corporation, an agency created in August to oversee institutions seized in the savings-and-loan rescue program.
Jack P. Shinn, an Illinois banker who until last December headed his own troubled savings bank, has been appointed chief executive of City Federal, now renamed City Savings Bank F.S.B. On Sunday afternoon, telephone operators at the bank's Somerset headquarters were already using the new name.
A team of 20 managers and 20 lawyers will assist Mr. Shinn as he reorganizes the bank.
Bank branches were open for at least part of the day on Saturday and Mr. Shinn said few depositors withdrew savings. He said that he did not expect a run on the bank on Monday but that preparations were being made just in case, with plenty of cash on hand.
''No one has to be concerned about insured savings,'' Mr. Shinn said. ''The new City Savings Bank even assumed all liabilities for uninsured accounts.''
 
No Loan Applications
Under Federal regulations, deposits in savings institutions of up to $100,000 each are insured. Amounts above that are not covered, but in this case, he said, such savings would be protected.
He said the only change that consumers would notice when business resumes Monday is that mortgage and personal loan applications are no longer being accepted. He said the bank would have to make sure it has enough assets to cover additional loans, but it could be a week before new applications are again accepted.
In the meantime, mortgages that have already been issued will continue to be serviced and consumer loans that are already approved and being processed will not be affected. But loans to businesses have been put on hold, pending a review, even if they have already been approved, Mr. Shinn said.
''If it's a good solid loan that produces a good asset, we'll go forward with it,'' he said, ''But that's something that will take more time to determine.''

HEADLINE: Spur Economy, 2 Civic Groups Urge Dinkins

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Two prominent business and civic groups, in a message to Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins, urged the new administration to stimulate the city's flagging economy.
In a report delivered to Mr. Dinkins over the weekend, the New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the city should adopt as goals for each of the next four years the creation of 15,000 private-sector jobs and one million square feet of new office construction - about the equivalent of a skyscraper - outside of central Manhattan.
To help reach what it acknowledged were difficult goals, the groups said regulations on development, especially those involving environmental reviews, should be revamped and tax incentives, including those for projects in parts of Manhattan, should be continued.
 
'Passive Approach' Opposed
Although mindful that the city will need new revenues to address drug abuse, AIDS, homelessness and other problems, the groups warned that increasing certain taxes would be self-defeating. They cited taxes on telecommunications, one of New York's strengths, and on energy, an already expensive commodity important to the financial services industry. 
''The city must avoid a passive approach which sees economic growth as the result of things beyond its control - interest rates, Federal trade policy, market swings or other factors which the city can only watch from the sidelines,'' the report said.
In an interview, Ronald K. Shelp, president of the partnership and the chamber, said the groups had sent the report to Mr. Dinkins because they ''believe the incoming administration has to realize that you can't solve the city's social problems without continued economic growth.''
Barbara J. Turk, a senior adviser to Mr. Dinkins, said, ''We agree that we need to encourage economic growth.'' She said some of the report's recommendations, including a more equitable state school-aid formula and more help for minority-owned businesses, were positions that Mr. Dinkins took during the campaign.
But one point of disagreement between him and the two groups is commercial rent control, which the Mayor-elect supports in some form. The report said such control would ''not only tend to discriminate against future tenants of business property, but also significantly reduce the confidence of the investment community in the long-term value of New York City as a site for such investment.''
Stanley E. Grayson, the outgoing Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said several of the ideas in the report, like a formal effort to recruit businesses from other cities to New York, had already begun.
Mr. Grayson said a goal of 15,000 new jobs a year was ''a good thing to focus on.'' But, he added, ''the question is how to get there.''
 
Dialogue Opened by Koch
In issuing the 12-page document, the chamber, which represents the city's business community, and the partnership, an affiliated organization of business and civic leaders, have joined in a dialogue with the emerging city administration that began when Mayor Edward I. Koch gave a speech to the City Club last month. Mr. Koch warned against several programs and policies supported by Mr. Dinkins.
Two weeks ago Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, suggested that spending in next year's city budget be limited to the level of this year's revenues, a drastic no-growth approach. He also suggested that the new administration consider deferring raises for city workers or negotiating modest increases that would be accompanied by cuts in the municipal work force through attrition.
As the city's economy, which expanded rapidly for much of the decade, cooled in recent years, its fiscal prospects have dimmed. With little or no job growth and corporate profits lagging, the city faced tax revenue shortfalls that in October prompted Mr. Koch to begin $200 million in spending cuts and to take other actions to balance this year's budget and reduce the deficit projected for next year.
But next year's budget, a preliminary version of which is due in February, a month after Mr. Dinkins is to be sworn in, is complicated by contract talks with city workers, lawsuits blocking the sale of the New York Coliseum site and growing fiscal problems in Albany, which could jeopardize aid on which the city is counting.
 
'New Cadre' of Managers Sought
Still, the chamber and the partnership said the new administration had an opportunity to recruit a ''new cadre'' of middle and senior managers with ''fresh ideas and new approaches.'' The groups offered to serve as a referral source for applicants from private enterprise.
At the other end of the work force, the report suggested that the Board of Education issue a ''Certificate of Employability,'' along with a diploma, to high school students who successfully complete a semester of work in addition to school. Such a certificate would reassure potential employers, the report said.

HEADLINE: From Prague to Fifth Ave., a Transplanted Salon for Czechoslovaks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM G. BLAIR

 BODY:
As their embassy mansion was in Prague, the spacious Fifth Avenue apartment of William and Wendy Luers has become a sort of salon, information clearing house and meeting place for people fascinated by what is happening in Czechoslovakia.
''You get hooked on this or that particular country and you can't get out of it and we are hooked on Czechoslovakia,'' said the 60-year-old Mr. Luers, whose final post as a career diplomat and specialist in Soviet and East European affairs was a three-year stint as Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Since 1986, he has been president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
During their years in Czechoslovakia, the Luerses became acquainted with many of the dissident intellectuals who have emerged as leaders of the Civic Forum opposition to the Communist Party, including Vaclav Havel, the playwright. 
 
Matching People With People
Of the American Embassy, Mrs. Luers, who is 49, said: ''We ran a hotel in Prague. We invited American writers to meet Czechoslovak writers and American painters to meet Czechoslovak painters, and so on.'' Now, they are doing the same thing from New York.
Since returning to this country, the Luerses estimate, they have helped organize visits to Czechoslovkia for 500 Americans from the cultural and business worlds.
In recent weeks, as the political pendulum in Eastern Europe began to swing dramatically from Communism to democracy, ''we've had four calls from American businessmen who are interested in investing in Czechoslovakia and need to know who to talk to there,'' Mrs. Luers said. Among other callers are journalists seeking to develop sources from the Luerses' wide contacts.
''Our friends in Prague know that if we send them somebody, they are to be trusted and they should see them,'' she said.
 
A Cultural Visit
One of the Czechoslovak dissidents, Zdenek Urbanek, a leading translator of Shakespeare and a close friend of Mr. Havel, has been staying with the Luerses since October, the start of a three-month cultural visit to the United States. It is his first visit in 25 years.
Last Thursday night, in their apartment across from the museum, the Luerses gave a reception for Mr. Urbanek that was attended by about 40 influential Americans and Czechoslovak emigres in the fields of art, education, architecture, business and the news media.
Before the reception, Mr. Urbanek, a 72-year-old widower who is fluent in English, told an early arrival that he had recently called Mr. Havel from New York and asked if he should cut short his visit and return to Czechoslovakia. ''He told me, 'No, stay there and represent us and explain to the Americans what's going on,' '' Mr. Urbanek said. And that is what he did, with a gentle warmth and sincerity that impressed his listeners and prompted questions from them on how best America could support his country.
''Money is a very useful thing,'' Mr. Urbanek began, to laughter, and then explained that the ''economy needs the first and very patient help from the West.'' He said that initially the ''most important instruction'' that Americans could offer would be in industrial management. Equally helpful, he said, would be advice on constitutional law and institutional development, ''even though the systems in Europe and America are very different.''
 
'Intellectual Dimension'
For Mr. Luers, his continuing absorption with Czechoslovakia and writing on his specialty provide ''the intellectual dimension'' to a new career that centers on ''raising money and running the business side of the museum.'' He believes that ''having a broader function'' is helpful to him as the museum's president.
Central to that broader function is the International Research & Exchanges Board in Princeton, N.J., known as Irex. For 20 years, it has been the main channel for scholarly exchanges between America and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Since 1986, Mr. Luers has been one of 15 nonsalaried members of a board that includes former Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and Vartan Gregorian, the president of Brown University and former president of the New York Public Library.
In the fall of 1988, Mr. Luers was chairman of the board's first United States-Czechoslovakia roundtable conference, held in Princeton, on political and economic affairs. He would have led the second conference, held this fall in Prague, but had to remain in New York to welcome President Bush to the museum during a visit.
 
A Weeklong Conference
Next year, the Luerses, Irex and New York University will be involved in a weeklong conference scheduled for March that is expected to bring about 60 Czechoslovak intellectuals, many of them Civic Forum adherents, to the university to discuss with Czechoslovak literature and culture over the last century with their American counterparts.
More immediately, the Luerses are planning to spend a week in Czechoslovakia between Christmas and New Year's. ''I want to get a close reading of what's happening,'' Mr. Luers said. ''Because of my knowledge of the people and the country, I can catch the subtleties that often escape in day-to-day journalism.''
The Luerses were last in Prague in August, when, Mrs. Luers said, they were hosts for a dinner at a restaurant called U Sedmi Angelu, or At the Seven Angels. ''Half the guests inside were from Civic Forum,'' Mrs. Luers said, ''and we were told that half the people outside were from the secret police.''
''We're going to do it again this time,'' she said, ''without the secret police.''

HEADLINE: Yale's Black Studies Said to Founder

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Yale University's black studies program, one of the oldest in the nation and long considered one of the best, is in disarray, professors in the program say.
As Yale is grappling with issues of racial representation on its faculty, the African and Afro-American studies program finds itself with holes in its roster and, the professors say, no clear sense of direction.
Its chairman, Edmund Gordon, announced his resignation in October, two weeks after a university committee criticized Yale's record on hiring and keeping minority professors and its commitment to affirmative action. Mr. Gordon cited frustration over delays in hiring faculty members.
Two other senior professors angrily cut their ties with the program this year, and its leaders have struggled to replace or cover for others who have been lured away by competing institutions. 
Gerald Jaynes, a professor of economics and African and Afro-American studies who will take over as chairman in January, said there had been a clear decline in the program's national standing.
 
'Far Ahead' 3 Years Ago
''Three years ago we were so far ahead of other institutions that we could have filled the first five slots in the rank,'' he said.
''One of the attractions for me to come here, as a straight economics professor, was the excitement of joining a large group of the most dynamic, creative scholars in Afro-American studies.''
But in the last few years, he said, that excitement has disappeared and the faculty is lacking a sense of purpose or direction.
Over the years, the number of students in the program has remained fairly constant. About 400 now take courses, and seven are majoring in the studies. The program has 11 professors, all of whom also teach in other disciplines. At one time the program had 15 professors.
Since its inception in 1968, the program has grown from a study of the black experience in the United States to embrace African and Caribbean cultures. It approaches all from a variety of disciplines.
General courses like ''Black Literature'' and ''Problems in Afro-American History'' have given way to ''Topics in Swahili Literature,'' ''Psychological Perspectives on African-American Experiences in the United States'' and language instruction in Hausa, Yoruba and Zulu.
 
Dissension Reported
This diversity breeds dissension, Mr. Jaynes said, as faculty members argue over what areas of study and the world should receive emphasis.
Even where the faculty is in agreement, the nature of the field poses problems, said Michael Cooke, an English professor who has taught in the program. Because black studies encompass so many different disciplines, the program must keep up with debates and trends in all, he said.
If disputes over emphasis and the demands of the field are unusually pressing today, they have been made far more difficult by the recent losses of faculty members in critical disciplines, including economics, history and political science.
Stanford, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Cornell and other universities have begun to draw off many of the best black studies professors, Mr. Gordon said.
Yale's losses are largely a function of its success, he said, observing: ''When people get here, they become targets. Other people go after them.''
 
Cornell Moves Ahead
Cornell University, which recently hired two Yale professors, is widely regarded as having surpassed Yale nationally in black studies.
Robert L. Harris Jr., director of Cornell's Africana Studies and Research Center, said it had built a strong base in the social sciences since its creation in 1969. ''We've balanced that off in the last three or four years by getting two great humanists from Yale,'' he said.
For John Blassingame and Adolph Reed, it was dissatisfaction with Yale, rather than the lure of another institution, that led them to resign from the program.
Mr. Blassingame, a history professor who was chairman of the program from 1980 to 1988, became embroiled last year in a long, bitter exchange with university officials after he said in a speech that ''affirmative action at Yale is but a fiction, equality only a name.''
 
Accusation and Denial
In his letter of resignation, which was published in the campus newspaper, Mr. Blassingame, who remains a member of the history department, accused administrators of trying to shackle the program.
The administrators vehemently denied that.
Mr. Reed, a professor of political science, also severed his ties with the program last spring.
Yale's need to fill these vacancies has brought to the surface a debate that has been going since the program's birth.
Because it is not its own academic department, the Afro-American studies program cannot unilaterally grant tenure to its professors. Instead they must also hold appointments in one of the traditional disciplines. Critics complain that this relegates Afro-American studies to second-class citizenship.
But Mr. Gordon said: ''I don't regard African-American studies as a discipline. I want professors of English, psychology, philosophy and history who favor a joint appointment.''
 
Debate Over Tenure
The danger of giving appointment power to the black studies program, he said, is twofold. For one thing, it might lead minority students considering careers in higher education to gravitate to black studies rather than to the older disciplines, thereby creating a kind of unintentional self-segregation.
''Alternatively there is the possibility that programs like this would be standing alone, commanding no respect from the disciplines, having no support from them,'' he said.
But Mr. Jaynes said Yale's system allowed qualified candidates for black studies to ''fall through the cracks'' between disciplines. He said he would support a decision to grant tenure appointment to the African and Afro-American studies program in special cases.
''This program is mature enough to make good decisions,'' he said.
Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the university's president, said he thought the program's disarray had been ''much exaggerated.''
He cited the hiring of one junior professor and the promotion of another in the past year as evidence that ''if you get past some of the noise and the static over the past year, the program is showing the sort of vitality that we want it to have.''
The possible addition of Edward Kamau Brathwaite, a professor of Afro-Caribbean culture at the University of the West Indies, next year would give Yale ''as strong a program as it's ever had,'' Mr. Schmidt said.
Mr. Jaynes said his aim would be to try to recapture some of the lost sense of mission and spirit in the program, to get the faculty thinking about what direction to take in the curriculum and to decide what appointments need to be made most quickly.
''The impact hasn't really hit yet,'' said Anita Wells, a senior who is majoring in the program. She said its problems would most affect younger students choosing a major.
''It's saddening,'' she added. ''But it's not completely in demise. It's going to take interested students and interested faculty to keep it going productively, but it's going to survive.''

HEADLINE: ON YOUR OWN;
The Inside Track for Winter Running

BYLINE: By MARC BLOOM

 BODY:
WHILE running in the bitter cold can be invigorating, your pace will be too slow to achieve gains in fitness. To get faster, you will have to run on an indoor track.
Track running can be beneficial year-round, but it is particularly vital when icy roads, high winds and heavy clothing prevent intensified training outdoors. The tedium of running laps forces you to train creatively, experimenting with speed work, as opposed to simply jogging through the season. 
There are at least a dozen indoor tracks in the metropolitan area from which to choose. They include those at the McBurney Y.M.C.A. (20 laps to the mile) and the West Side Y.M.C.A. (23.6 laps) in Manhattan, and the facilities at Columbia, Fordham, Princeton and Fairleigh Dickinson Universities. Pratt Institute in Brooklyn has an excellent eight-lap-to-the-mile track. Call first to check on availability and fees.
Try to train indoors at least once a week. It helps to have a partner. This way, you can take turns setting the pace, and you have someone to share the burden of the added stress.
Pack some warm clothing for your workout. Not all facilities are well heated, and some can get drafty. Also take an extra pair of running shoes. Some people do their warm-ups in training shoes, then change to a lighter model for the pace work.
Remember that speed work is a relative term. Essentially, it means running faster than your average training pace. Any running that causes you to push qualifies as a form of speed work.
There are four variables to work with: pace, distance, number of fast runs and rest between fast runs. Each element can be adjusted to modify or intensify a workout.
Give yourself at least an hour for your workout. Make sure you stretch first. Do more stretching than you would normally do. Speed work is unforgiving, and if your muscles are tight, you increase the risk of injury.
Then, jog a mile or two as a warm-up, leaving on your outer gear. Get the feel of the track, and stick to the outer lanes so you will not be in anyone's way. Also, the turns are not as sharp in the outside lanes, so these lanes are easier on your body.
After jogging, walk a couple of laps to relax and focus on your workout. Try to marshal all of your energy toward the task of running for speed, with economy. Take off your sweatsuit, change to lightweight shoes if you have them, stretch a bit more, and you will be all set.
Start off with four repetitions of a half-mile each. Run them at about a 10-kilometer racing pace. If, for example, you run 10 kilometers at 7 minutes per mile, then do your halves in 3:30. If you do not have race times to draw upon, run the halves at roughly a minute faster per mile than your typical training pace. A nine-minute miler would run the halves in 4:00 each.
After each half-mile, jog/walk for the same amount of time that it took you to do the run, with three minutes as a minimum rest interval. During each run, relax and develop a smooth rhythm; you should not have to fight your way through it.
Carry your arms close to your body, and move them up and back easily with fists unclenched. Your neck and shoulders should feel loose. Your legs should not shuffle, but glide with knees high.
Chances are, the first two half-miles will feel like a piece of cake. The third may be a bit hard. The last may bring on the feeling of rubbery legs. To finish keenly, aim for an even pace, not only from one half-mile to the next, but also within each half.
After the speed work, take a drink, walk a couple of laps, jog another mile or so, and repeat your stretching routine. Make your next day's workout an easy recovery run.
If you miss your time goals, do not be hard on yourself. The turns and tight confines of an indoor track result in slow times. And the smaller the track, the slower the times.
From week to week this winter, work with the variables to make progress. First, add to the number of fast runs, gradually advancing to eight repetitions. Then, run them faster. Finally, reduce your rest time. The runner starting with four 3:30 half-miles can have a goal of eight half-miles in 3:00 to 3:15 with a three-minute rest between each.
Mix in other distances as well. One week, run 440's; another week, 660's. Or, in the same workout, do a 440, a 660, an 880, a 660, a 440. This is known as a ladder or pyramid workout.
Eamonn Coghlan, world indoor mile record-holder, recommends the quarter-mile for speed work. He says the gentler pace of half-miles may not quicken leg action or turnover. To him, the ideal speed workout builds to six quarter-miles with a minimum rest interval of two minutes.
If speed work is not to your taste, you can still use an indoor track for your distance runs. Do not count laps; simply set your watch and run for a specified time. Midway, reverse direction to balance the stress.
And if you hear someone shout ''Track!'' from behind, move farther to the outside. Indoors, runners doing speed work get the right of way.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Chile Is Getting Independent Central Bank

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Dec. 10

 BODY:
In the first attempt in Latin America to free a central bank from Government control, Chile's central bank will begin functioning autonomously on Monday under a five-member board. The governing panel was named last week in a surprisingly harmonious agreement between the departing Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and a coalition of the expected winner of this week's presidential elections.
In a ceremony on Saturday that marked the freeing of the bank from control of the Finance Ministry, Andres Bianchi, the new president of the central bank, said the accord was a sign that ''as never before, there is very wide consensus in the country on the importance of keeping the economy in equilibrium.''
He promised that the board would cooperate with the next Government ''to assure that public spending does not exceed the limits imposed by the productive capacity of the economy and the available money.'' The central bank will direct monetary and exchange-rate policies and regulate the financial system. 
Those responsible for the step hope that removing the bank from the political process will help maintain monetary stability. In the past, Chile has had high inflation, a problem that is now causing turmoil in several other Latin American countries.
Mr. Bianchi, a 53-year-old economist who studied at the University of Chile and at Yale, has been the assistant executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, based in Santiago.
A man without political affiliation, he was the consensus choice of the Pinochet Government and of Patricio Aylwin, the Christian Democratic Party leader who is favored to win the presidency in Thursday's elections.
Mr. Aylwin leads a 17-party alliance that includes the Socialist, Radical and Humanist Parties. Polls give him a substantial lead over the two other presidential candidates, former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi and Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a leading businessman.
The appointment of two economists from the Aylwin camp to the new central bank board, along with two from the current Government, seems to indicate that the Pinochet Administration recognizes that Mr. Aylwin will be the next President.
Those from the Government are Brig. Gen. Enrique Seguel, who was president of the central bank for five years and has been Finance Minister for eight months, and Alfonso Serrano, an economist educated at the University of Minnesota, who has been the bank's vice president.
Also named were Roberto Zahler, an economist identified with the Christian Democratic Party, and Juan Eduardo Herrera, an economist affiliated with the Socialist-oriented Party for Democracy. Mr. Zahler, who did graduate work at the University of Chicago, has been working for the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America. Mr. Herrera, who completed advanced studies at Cambridge, has been in private business.
 
Criticism at First
Mr. Aylwin and his economic advisers initially criticized the central bank changes decreed by the military regime as an effort to hang onto as much power as possible and prevent the elected Government from having full control over economic policy.
But when the names of the directors were announced last week, there was universal approval from economists and others in the Aylwin alliance, as well as from businessmen and Government supporters.
Likewise, Interior Minister Carlos Caceres, who tenaciously negotiated between General Pinochet and the opposition, received universal praise. Mr. Caceres, a businessman who was named Interior Minister last year after General Pinochet lost a plebiscite intended to keep him in power, has been the primary liaison between the Government and the opposition in the transition toward democracy.
Alejandro Foxley, the Christian Democratic economist who is expected to be named Finance Minister by Mr. Aylwin, said Mr. Caceres, despite difficulties, ''persisted until he got the accord.''
Another man closely involved in the negotiations, who asked not to be identified, said the role of Mr. Caceres ''was incredible - without him it would not have been possible.''
 
Sending Clear Signals
Mr. Foxley said the Aylwin team's support for the new bank board was intended ''to give a clear signal to the country, especially the private sector, and to the international financial community, that when we say we are committed to working with private business and political groups that now support other candidates, those are not just words.''
He and other economists of the Aylwin alliance have sought to assure the country that once in office, they do not intend to retreat from the free-market economic program that has brought strong growth to Chile in recent years.

HEADLINE: Lackluster Season for Retailers

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
The 1989 Christmas shopping season is not exciting either retailers or consumers, as sales run even with or slightly ahead of last year, despite a wave of price-cutting.
''The shoppers are apathetic, they've cut back their discretionary spending and they're concerned about the future,'' said Walter F. Loeb, senior analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''I see a real gain in the season of only about 1 percent to 1 1/2 percent over last year.''
Some analysts noted that business in smaller cities is stronger than in urban centers, particularly since competition is less keen in the smaller markets. 
 
'Season Is Good So Far'
Herb Ross, president of Bonton/ Pomeroy, based in York, Pa., with stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, said: ''The season is good so far. We think our efforts to improve service in our 32 department stores, the extra sales help we put on and our increased attention to being in stock on basic goods have paid off.''
After a strong Thanksgiving weekend, retailers in New York and other big cities are trying a variety of techniques to head off a lackluster holiday season.
On Saturday morning, Macy's in New York held a three-hour sale from 8 to 11, with prices reduced 10 to 50 percent. Several days before, Bloomingdale's notified charge customers that they could buy any apparel for 25 percent off during a 10-day period. Abraham & Straus and Macy's have been holding one-day sales at prices of 40 percent off on some merchandise, and Lord & Taylor has been promoting price cuts of 20 to 50 percent. 50% of Annual Profits The holiday season is always an intense time in retailing, since it accounts for 25 percent of annual sales and 50 percent of profits. This year the anxiety has been heightened by the number of stores that are up for sale or in high-debt situations and have cut prices to generate cash flow.
Widespread price-slashing had been anticipated this year because of the number of store chains put up for sale, closing or under financial pressure. This wave of promotions developed early, even in the first weeks of November.
Walter Levy, a New York retail marketing consultant, commented: ''One of the season's phenomenons is that the stores for sale really must produce revenues to get good bids. So the Campeau, L. J. Hooker and B.A.T. Industries stores being sold are promoting considerably, and the competition must react.''
Bloomingdale's, for example, which the Campeau Corporation put up for sale in September, has been promoting ''very slightly more'' than last year, a spokesman said, in an attempt to revive slower departments.
Other companies put on the block are Saks Fifth Avenue, in New York; Marshall Field, in Chicago, and the J. B. Ivey Company, in Charlotte, N.C., all owned by B.A.T. Also for sale are Bonwit Teller, in New York, and Sakowitz, in Houston, owned by Hooker. B. Altman, also owned by Hooker, is closing its six stores, including its Manhattan flagship, with a two-month final sale, and the Miller & Rhoads department stores in Richmond, owned by Allied Stores, are going through a similar process. The inventory of the former Alcott & Andrews stores is being cleared out in a New Jersey warehouse.
 
'Very Slightly Ahead'
At Bloomingdale's, a spokesman said: ''We are very slightly ahead for the season compared to 1988. Business is proceeding according to our plan, which is that there would be minimal, almost flat gains in the first three weeks starting after Thanksgiving Day, a double-digit gain in the fourth week and a big single-digit gain the fifth week.''
Abraham & Straus, also owned by Campeau, was an exception among leading retailers in reporting excellent business. ''We are running above plan, with a 10 to 11 percent sales increase in our same stores,'' a spokesman said. ''That does not include our new store in Manhattan, which is doing very well.'' He said A.&S. had not increased its promotional efforts over last year. People in the trade noted that A.&S. had been successful in turning itself around in recent years.
''It's been good but not great, and we've had to promote reduced prices more than we expected,'' said Andrew E. Newman, chairman of Edison Brothers Stores Inc., a large St. Louis retailer that operates the Chandlers and Baker shoe chains and the Jeans West and J. Riggings apparel stores. He declined to give any figures.
 
'Not Exciting' at Stern's
Lawrence Stone, chairman and chief executive of the Stern's department stores in New Jersey and New York, said: ''The season so far is not bad, but it's not exciting, either. So far, in our stores more than one year old, we are running about even with 1988. Customer behavior is more price-driven than ever, and all the retailers are having price promotions.'' The Stern's stores are also owned by Campeau.
The Woolworth Corporation, one of the largest American retailers, had a strong November, and business since has been ''reasonably good,'' said Harold E. Sells, its chairman and chief executive. ''We expect the season to show at least a middle single-digit gain in our stores at least a year old, and it may be better than that.''
The season so far is ''not too strong but not weak, either,'' he said.
The low price inflation in general merchandise this year is expected to help retailers eke out a better Christmas, said Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Merchants Association in New York.
She said she expected the season to end with a year-to-year increase of 5.5 percent. With an inflation rate of less than 2 percent, that would produce a real rise of more than 3 percent. In 1988, the Christmas season ended with an 8.3 percent gain. With inflation of 3.1 percent, the real gain was thus 5.2 percent.
 
Inventories Are High
''Inventories are currently high at a good many stores, but these should be pared considerably with the many price-cut sales under way,'' she said.
Many retailers hope that the sales tempo will improve as the season advances and that the 31 shopping days in the season, compared with 30 last year, will produce extra business.
Last year, the holiday season got off to a slow start but business soared in the final week, giving many retailers a better season than they had expected.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
East Europe Tries a Mild Capitalism

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The mild capitalism emerging in Eastern Europe, though unthinkable in these Communist nations just a few years ago, is a far cry from the free-market economics practiced in the West - and will probably remain so for a long time.
Recently, millions of East Europeans have come out four-square for free markets. Yet the popular uprisings in Eastern Europe have focused mainly on dethroning the authoritarian Communist parties that have ruled for more than 40 years. Economic change is another matter, not yet addressed in East Germany or Czechoslovakia, and still in an early stage in Poland and Hungary. Among the Balkan states, only Bulgaria is responding to the pressure for change.
But already the major economic challenges confronting the Governments of Eastern Europe are clear-cut, and so are the social conflicts these nations will face in trying to make the wrenching transition from old ways to new, in the view of more than 15 economists and East European experts. 
 
Lifelong Job Security
The key decision, the experts agree, will be whether or how far to dismantle the centralized Communist economic systems and move instead toward free-market capitalism, with its private ownership and its potential for creating a society of winners and losers. Indeed, ideological support for Communism may be fading quickly, but not for two of its attributes: lifelong job security and equal incomes across most of society.
''The biggest issue is egalitarian income distribution. Only Poland and Hungary have had experience with haves and have-nots,'' said David Kemme, chief economist at the Institute for East-West Studies in New York.
The Eastern Europeans are being pushed toward market economics by what Josef C. Brada, an Eastern Europe expert at Arizona State University, describes as the breakdown of a bargain.
''People put up with the state systems because they perceived a kind of social compact where the state would provide a stable standard of living in exchange for exercising so much authority,'' he said. ''But the Communist Party could not keep its part of the bargain.''
Eastern Europe's experience underlines the stark contrast between state-run economies and free-market systems.
In the former, the state owns factories, farms, homes and buildings, and determines their use, parceling out a nation's wealth in the form of wages, investment, education, pensions, a weapons industry, public works and the like. The state guarantees jobs for most workers and sets wages, taking little account of differences in individual proficiency, so there is not much incentive, beyond one's conscience, to work, innovate or take chances.
Still state-run systems, however flawed, were able to channel Eastern Europe's resources into steel-making, autos, petrochemicals, weapons and other major industries after World War II. Despite persistent shortages of consumer goods, the various national economies grew and living standards rose - until the 1980's.
Since then, growth has averaged about 1 percent a year, or less than one-third the rate for East Europe in the two previous decades, according to PlanEcon, a Washington-based research organization.
The reason is that while state-controlled systems might be good at initially pulling a nation up by its bootstraps, they have failed to adapt to shifts in supply and demand, new technologies and changing circumstances.
 
Run by Bureaucrats
An economy run by bureaucrats and state orders is ill-suited to fostering high-technology industries, like computers and semiconductors, which depend on innovation and risk taking. These traits have been nurtured mainly in Western-style free-market economies, with their privately owned companies, securities markets and big incomes for professionals and skilled workers.
As a nation's economy grows and matures, it becomes less manageable by a state bureaucracy. ''No Government, anywhere, has the manpower or the skill to ride a complex, modern economy all the way down to the corner grocery store, anticipating people's preferences and requirements,'' said Robert Heilbroner, the economic historian. ''The markets do this better.''
The downside to free markets, of course, can be unemployment - relatively few jobs in the United States and Western Europe are guaranteed - and huge differences in income, a phenomenon that only Hungary and Poland among Eastern European nations have begun to accept openly, after a decade of experimenting with private enterprise.
Here is where the Eastern European nations stand in the process of reforming their economies:
 
Poland
Kicking Socialism Cold Turkey
Poland, with 38 million of Eastern Europe's 140 million people, seems determined to go the furthest in the direction of free markets. Since midyear, the Polish Government has been dismantling its socialist economy almost cold turkey.
Many state-owned companies are up for sale, with the possible buyers including management, employees or foreign investors. Lack of a buyer could force a money-losing company to close.
The selloff program is being held back in Poland and other Eastern European countries by such previously unheard-of problems as determining a proper selling price for a money-losing state company and raising capital in a nation that lacks private banks or bond and stock markets in which potential buyers can raise money.
But Poland is already suffering the inevitable consequences of its ambitious drive toward private enterprise. Even the staunchest advocates of the effort, among them Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist, acknowledge the developing hardships.
Unemployment could reach 5 percent by early next year, up from almost nothing now, said Mr. Sachs, who is an adviser to the Solidarity Movement and an architect of the Polish strategy. ''Disparities in income are becoming evident and they will be greater in the future,'' he added. ''Many people will make a lot of money; many others won't at all, and that could cause a backlash.''
Layoffs are becoming legal as a cost-cutting measure, as the Government cuts subsidies to steel mills, shipyards and other money-losing manufacturers - although the private sector cannot absorb the newly unemployed. What is more, price controls are being eliminated, a process that helped to create an inflation rate of more than 50 percent a month lately.
 
Pain of Inflation
Inflation is hard on Government workers with their limited wages. These public employees, paid less than $100 a month on average, account for 70 percent of the 19 million Polish labor force. Those in the private sector - mostly in farming, construction and light manufacturing -have more buying power, from profits, wages and other income more generous than Government pay.
The great hope of the Solidarity movement, which controls the Government, is that foreign investment will pour in, soon, to greatly expand the private sector and provide work for the unemployed. And billions in foreign aid from the United States and Western Europe will touch off a boom, raising everyone's living standard and thus making income disparities less noticeable.
''The cushion of foreign financing is essential to produce results and to avoid unrest,'' Mr. Sachs said. As a precaution, he advocates a Government safety net of unemployment insurance, job retraining, health care and the like - a system similar to those in most Western European countries.
But Poles appear to be accepting the creation of a society of haves and have-nots. Solidarity, which originated as a union movement and evolved into a political organization, no longer calls strikes to protest that one group of workers earns less than another.
Bartlomiej Kaminski, a professor of government and expert on Poland at the University of Maryland, noted the change on a recent visit to his homeland. ''I had not been back since 1980,'' he said, ''and what struck me was the acceptance of the inevitability of inequality. Everyone's looking out for his own opportunity to make money.''
 
Hungary
An Established Private Sector
Traditionally a more entrepreneurial, freewheeling society than its Eastern European neighbors, Hungary, with 11 million people, began adopting some free-market policies roughly a decade ago. Today, the private sector accounts for about 25 percent of Hungary's economic activity, said Paul Marer, an Indiana University expert on Hungary.
But in Hungary, selling off state enterprises does not have the same priority as in Poland. ''Some people think that in a short period, you can privatize a socialist economy, but it can't be done quickly,'' said Janos Kornai, a Harvard University expert on Hungary.
Short of privatization, the Hungarian Government has tried to make its huge state sector simulate free-market conditions. Many managers are elected by employees, as if they were shareholders, rather than appointed by the central Government. Instead of taking orders from a ministry, as they did under the old system, managers bargain with Budapest over production targets, price levels, capital investment and materials purchases. And they get bonuses for increasing profits, as do chief executives in the West.
In addition, many enterprises are organized as cooperatives, with autonomy to market their own goods and keep some of the profit.
Though some companies are up for sale, financing is a huge obstacle to privatization. Throughout Eastern Europe, banks are state owned, and governments, not bankers, decide which enterprises get loans. In Hungary, most money goes to state enterprises or to pay down a $20 billion foreign debt.
 
Seeking Venture Parnters
To overcome the shortage of funds, Hungary has aggressively sought out Western companies as joint venture partners, becoming the Eastern European country of choice for these arrangements. Magyar Posta, the telephone company, for example, signed a joint venture agreement last week with U S West Inc., the regional telephone company based in Denver, to build a cellular telephone network in Budapest.
Some state-owned companies are being sold to foreigners, or to a company's Hungarian managers, in Western-style leveraged buyouts, if the managers can raise financing abroad.
The General Electric Company, for example, announced last month an agreement to pay $150 million for a majority stake in Tungsram, a big light bulb manufacturer and exporter. And the Hungarian managers of Apisz, a paper company, tried to buy the company for $12 million, with Citicorp financing. But the Apisz deal was suspended, for reasons that underscore a major difficulty in selling state enterprises in Eastern Europe. The suspension came last month amid charges that Apisz's managers were trying to enrich themselves by buying the company on the cheap.
Part of the problem was that in a nonmarket economy, without competing buyers and sellers, the market value of the buildings and lands could not be determined.
Such problems convince many economists that privatization in Eastern Europe should proceed slowly, with some enterprises not sold at all.
 
Natural Exceptions
In Mr. Kornai's view, these should include the natural monopolies -railroads, airlines, telephone companies and utilities, now mostly state owned in Western Europe. Such enterprises, supplying necessary service without competition, set arbitrary rates anyway.
The Hungarian Government has gone far in allowing its citizens to establish private companies, although the entrepreneurs are still restricted in such things as how much they can borrow and how many people they can hire (fewer than 500 a company).
Most private activity is in farming, small machine shops, restaurants, retail stores, barbers, tailors, home construction, computer software and medical services. Small stock and bond markets have taken root to help with financing, and Budapest now has suburbs of expensive homes, with swimming pools and tennis courts, for the new business class.
''A basic issue in the whole reform process in Eastern Europe is giving up the notion of equity for all,'' Mr. Kemme said. ''The Poles and the Hungarians have gone further in this than the others. They are trying to convince themselves that there is some merit - some benefit to society - in the notion of unequal distribution of income, or just inequality.''
But if Hungarians are accepting inequality, they are doing so in part because they have managed to blunt the issue, Mr. Marer says. State employees earn $300 a month, on average, an income well below earnings in the private sector. But the majority of the five million people in the labor force earn extra money by moonlighting for private companies or selling food grown on garden plots.
 
East Germany
Strict Adherence To State Planning
East Germany, with more than 16 million people, is the wealthiest East European nation. Its work force is disciplined and well-educated. It benefits from a special trading relationship with West Germany. And it is regarded by many Western analysts as proof that a state-run economy fails to generate sufficient wealth in today's complex industrial world unless it is leavened with private ownership.
Until the current upheaval, East Germany was tenacious in preserving central planning, with all its trappings of full employment, free medical care, low-cost housing, free education and price controls that make the staples of life affordable even on East Germany's low wages.
Although East Germany produces an array of goods, relying as little as possible on imports, most state enterprises operate at a loss, requiring huge state subsidies. These subsidies, in turn, produced a $70 billion budget deficit last year, officials acknowledged last month.
But such losses are almost inevitable, economists say. East Germany's factory managers have been paid primarily to meet production goals set by the state, and they often hoard raw materials to keep their factories operating, sometimes forcing other plants to curtail production for lack of supplies. The managers' salaries are not tied to product quality or cost control or replacing old machinery.
East German investment, in fact, was cut back sharply in the 1980's to preserve cash needed in part to service a $20 billion foreign debt. The small amount that was spent went mostly to microelectronics and robotics, potential export industries.
When it comes to exports, in fact, East Germany's state companies, with all their shortcomings, can be quite efficient, managing to sell sophisticated high-quality printing equipment in the United States, for example - testimony that state planning works when it channels resources into priority industries, said Sam Bowles, a University of Massachusetts economist.
 
Chronic Shortages
The Government provides jobs for virtually everyone in the labor force of nine million people. And it keeps prices low enough so that Germans, earning an average of $100 a month, can afford all the staples, though there are chronic shortages of consumer goods.
In one sense, the wage is more than enough. East Germans, like so many consumers in centrally planned economies, often prefer to save part of their wages, rather than buy the available shoddy merchandise. This savings ''overhang,'' a common phenomenon in Eastern Europe, would produce a burst of inflation in East Germany if price controls were eliminated and borders were open to sought-after foreign consumer products, economist say.
If East Germany opens the door to foreign investment, West German companies, in particular, would probably purchase profitable enterprises, like the printing equipment plants, business executives say. But what happens to the thousands of people left unemployed when the unprofitable ones - the outdated chemical plants and auto factories, for example - are forced to close?
The unemployed could migrate to jobs in Western Europe. But the principal hope, said Irwin Collier, an expert on East Germany at the University of Houston, ''is that foreign investment will pour in, creating new businesses and jobs. No one knows yet whether this will happen; no one has dealt with the unemployment issue at all. The economic discussions are just beginning.''
 
Czechoslovakia
A Serious Threat Of Unemployment
The economic debate is also just beginning in Czechoslovakia, a nation of nearly 16 million people, where the Communist Party has just been dethroned, raising the prospect of some movement toward private enterprise, now almost nonexistent.
As in other Eastern European nations, public attitudes about reform are deeply ambivalent. A recent poll found 47 percent of Czechoslovaks want their economy to remain state-controlled while 43 percent want a mixture of state control and private enterprise. Only 3 percent favored capitalism.
Inflation is less of a problem in Czechoslovakia than elsewhere in the East bloc countries because, despite some shortages, the Czechoslovaks have managed to spend much of their income - the eight million workers earn an average of nearly $300 a month - on what is available in the stores.
''If prices were allowed to float, you would get maybe a 15 percent price increase the first year and then equilibrium,'' said Mr. Brada of Arizona State.
But the unemployment potential is great. Most of the labor force works in industry, principally at mammoth, behind-the-times factories that make steel, machinery, textiles, chemicals, shoes and vehicles.
 
Falling Behind Slowly
Central planning helps to explain why Czechoslovakia's heavy industry, which account for 60 percent of the gross national product, fell slowly behind the technology curve.
''Basically the managers of these companies are production oriented; they are rewarded for the number of items coming out the factory door,'' Mr. Brada said. ''Not much attention is paid to updating existing machinery or seeking new technologies. No one loses a job or a salary for this shortcoming.''
Yet in spite of the system, innovation has occasionally flowered in Czechoslovakia, as illustrated by the development of the jet textile loom, a world-class product. ''It was largely, if you will, an accident,'' Mr. Brada said. ''A small, self-motivated group somehow got interested and designed the loom. They managed to have their new machine produced in Brno, at a machine-gun and rifle factory. Weapons require exacting quality controls, and so did the loom.''
It has not been updated recently, however. The original design group is no longer active, Mr. Brada said.
Most of Czechoslovakia's products have been sold to the Soviet Union and other East European countries. But as these buyers withdraw and Eastern Europe turns to the West for goods and new technology, the new Government will be forced to make changes, seeking foreign investment and perhaps shuttering some factories.
''Whatever happens, the employment guarantee will end,'' Mr. Brada said.
 
Bulgaria
A Lot of Smoke, Not Much Fire
Among the Balkan countries, Yugoslavia is absorbed in preventing ethnic rivalries from splitting the country, and Albania remains an isolated bastion of Marxism-Leninism. Only Bulgaria has been embroiled in Eastern Europe's upheaval, installing a new leadership headed by Petar T. Mladenov. Though a Communist, he is regarded as more open to market reforms than Todor T. Zhikov, the man he replaced.
But Bulgaria is different from many of its neighbors - closer to Russia in culture than to Europe, still throwing off more income from agriculture than from industry, and willing over the last four years to experiment with diluting central planning.
Central planning brought heavy industry in the postwar period, converting Bulgaria from a rural country into a nation that supplied the computers used in the Soviet space program.
''Zhikov was fascinated with computers,'' said Michael L. Wyznan, a Bulgaria expert at Illinois State University. ''He channeled a lot of money into the industry and sent people to the West to study. Still, the computers are mostly West German and American models, assembled in Bulgaria. Only the Soviets would buy them.'' In theory, Bulgaria should be on its way to a free-market economy. A host of new laws, ordered up by the Zhikov regime, call for such capitalist devices as a commercial banking system, considerable autonomy for state companies and their partial sale to shareholders.
''But while the legal framework is there, central planning and state control is still the dominate feature,'' said Marvin R. Jackson, whose specialty at Arizona State University is Bulgaria and Rumania. ''Bulgarians say there is a lot of smoke but not much fire.''
 
Rumania
An Economy In Shambles
Through all the turmoil, Rumania has remained outwardly calm. Nicolae Ceausescu, among the world's most repressive Communist leader, even organized a demonstration last month in support of his regime.
But beyond the show, the economy is deteriorating rapidly and the nation's 23 million people live wretched lives, said Mr. Jackson, who said he received frequent reports from Rumanian contacts.
Food is rationed severely. The cities are without street lights. Fuel is provided to heat homes only part of the day. Hospitals lack medicine and other supplies, and public transportation in Bucharest is so dilapidated that getting to work is difficult.
Why haven't Rumanians reacted? No one is quite sure. The Ceausescu regime's police force is cited as one reason. And Mr. Ceausescu, in power since 1965, wins support by dispensing favors, mostly special access to consumer goods.
To Mr. Jackson and other experts, Rumania is an example of state planning run amok. Seeking self-sufficiency, the Ceausescu regime invested in steel plants, petroleum refineries and other heavy industries, borrowing abroad to do so.
And then Mr. Ceausescu, his nation near bankruptcy in the early 1980's, decided to pay the $10 billion debt entirely, and fast, rather than bargain for delays, as others in Eastern Europe did. Imports were halted and huge quantities of food were exported to raise the hard currency for debt repayment.
''The main problem with Rumania is that it tries to be too self-sufficient,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''This is the egomania of one man. Probably not since Stalin has economic policy been so centralized in one person.''

Old Train Tracks Provoke a Dispute

BYLINE: By Stephen Labaton

 BODY:
THOUSANDS of miles of land and hundreds of thousands of property owners and tourists may be affected by a case involving Patricia Preseault of Burlington, Vt., who says all she really wants is to grow trees and plants along a path on her property.
Since 1967, Mrs. Preseault and her husband, J. Paul, have lived on a patch of land near Lake Champlain with a majestic view of the Adirondack Mountains. When they moved in, the parcel also contained a 150-by-215-foot-long train path, part of an easement, or right of way, granted by the property owner in 1899.
Fourteen years ago, Vermont and the railway ripped up the tracks. Rather than returning the path to the Preseaults, the rail was turned into an asphalt trail, and whizzing bicylists and meandering pedestrians replaced the clamorous trains. Mrs. Preseault says she does not mind the traffic, but she and her husband want the property back, or at least some compensation if it is to be used by hikers and bikers. The action, Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission, is no small matter. 
Each year, about 3,000 miles of train tracks around the nation are abandoned, and how the Supreme Court decides the Preseault case could determine who benefits and who loses from the policy of converting unused rail paths into trails.
Thirteen states have joined with Vermont, the Bush Administration and a number of conservation and trail associations in arguing that there is nothing wrong with converting rails to trails. The Preseaults' supporters include several farm groups and the National Association of Realtors, which contend that since the original easement was for train tracks, the Government must compensate the Preseaults for the conversion. The case began nine years ago, when the Preseaults asked a Vermont court to decide who owns the strip of land. In 1985, the Vermont Supreme Court dismissed the action. It reasoned that only the Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates railroads, had the authority to decide whether the rail line had been abandoned.
Two years earlier, Congress had amended the National Trails System Act to increase the number of trails at minimal cost to the Government. The amendments gave the I.C.C. the authority to transfer rail easements to a local government or private organizations that would assume liability and upkeep. Based on the new law, the commission in 1986 approved a rails-to-trails conversion agreement with Burlington.
Lawyers for the Preseaults argued last month that the Federal law amounts to a taking without just compensation, which is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment. They also maintained that the rails-to-trails policy exceeds the commerce clause of the Constitution, because the professed interstate interest of the Federal Government - banking abandoned rail paths for possible use in the future - is a sham.
''The fact is, and everyone will admit it off the record, railroad banking for the future is a fiction,'' said Michael Berger, a partner at the Los Angeles firm of Fadem, Berger & Norton, who represented the Preseaults before the Supreme Court.
Lawyers for the Federal Government contend that the conversion to trails is an economical way to preserve the paths in case train tracks are again installed.
A unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York agreed, dismissing the argument that the rail banking was a sham and calling the preservation of the rail corridors ''remarkably efficient.'' The appeals panel also rejected the notion that the easement granted in 1899 was for the specific purpose of running only a railroad track.
Rarely has the Supreme Court struck down a law because it violates the commerce clause, and experts expect that if the Preseaults prevail, it would likely be on principle of eminent domain - that they have a right to be compensated for the seizure of their property. That would be only a partial victory because it would mean that the couple and others would have to continue to pursue their cases in the United States Court of Claims.
For his part, Mr. Preseault, a former pilot at Eastern Airlines who was told by the airline that his job had been filled when the pilots' union voted recently to return to work, says the case is a simple matter of being left alone. He disagrees with the National Wildlife Federation, the National Audubon Society and Natural Resources Defense Council, which want to preserve the trails for the public.
''They can't resist meandering off the bicycle path onto our property,'' he said, referring to the cyclists and hikers. ''We don't like being ornery people by asking them to leave. We turn out looking like bad guys. They ask 'What's the harm?' The harm is we lose all our privacy.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Uncertainty Keeping Anxiety High

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
In sharp contrast to the languorous close of most years, anxiety levels among credit market participants are likely to remain high as 1989 nears an end, and the source of their uncertainty is the Federal Reserve.
Virtually certain just weeks ago that the Fed would ease credit policy at least once, and perhaps twice, before the 1990's begin, the central bank's statements and actions since late November have only served to confuse participants about its intentions. And Friday's report on employment conditions in November, which many hoped would help clarify the economic outlook, did not live up to those expectations.
The report, which showed a larger-than-expected increase in non-farm payroll employment and a stunningly large downward revision in the October figures, left analysts with essentially the same view of the economy that was in place before the numbers were released. 
 
Weakness Is Seen
''To me the employment numbers confirmed that the economy is weakening, but they gave no sign we are falling apart so rapidly that we are on our way to a recession,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities.
''I think the Fed will respond by easing the overnight Federal funds rate to at least 8 1/4 percent,'' he added, ''but it is hard to tell when they will do it. From the market's perspective, the longer the Fed waits the more it hurts.''
Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm, said: ''By themselves, the employment numbers are not necessarily enough to prompt the Fed to move. But at least they insure the Fed will stay close to an easing move for the rest of the month. Almost any number that shows surprising weakness could be a trigger. That means we are likely to see considerable day-to-day uncertainty for the next couple of weeks.''
 
Policy Committee to Meet
At this juncture Mr. Kahan and others said that the most logical time for a further move by the Fed, which has pushed the funds rate down by 1.25 percentage points so far this year, to 8.50 percent, would be after members of its policy-making Open Market Committee meet in Washington next Monday and Tuesday.
''Christmas sales numbers are the key,'' said David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting firm. ''If the Fed sees reports from retailers showing that sales are weak, then they could ease after the Open Market Committee meeting.''
Apprehension about what the Fed will or will not do is a more or less constant condition among credit market participants. But the worry seems to have a sharper edge now because it is generally perceived that over the last month or so dealers have taken on big inventories of securities in expectation of another easing move.
A commonly used proxy for dealer positions, the overnight rate on repurchase agreements, appears to bear this out. Securities dealers use repurchase agreements as a way to finance inventories by temporarily offering their securities as collateral for borrowed money. The interest rate they pay on the borrowings is known as the repurchase rate.
 
Near Federal Funds Rate
Generally, overnight repurchase rates tend to trade at a slightly lower rate than the overnight Federal funds rate, often about 20 basis points, or hundredths of a point. But for the last few weeks the repurchase rate has traded at the same level or a slight premium to the Federal funds rate.
At the end of last week overnight repurchase agreements were offered at 8.48 percent. Meanwhile, the rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market was 8 7/16 percent.
''The fact that the repo rate has been trading so closely with the funds rate has been cited as evidence that dealers are long securities in anticipation of a rally,'' Mr. Crandall said. ''But a lot of those securities are Treasury bills.''
To accommodate the rise in short-term bills, Mr. Crandall said, dealers have hedged themselves in the futures markets and elsewhere.
According to his calculations, the supply of outstanding short-term bills peaked last week at about $260 billion. Over the summer, by contrast, there was only $200 billion worth of outstanding bills.
 
Less Pressure Expected
''In the next two weeks $19 billion worth of cash management bills will be redeemed,'' he said. ''That should take away the pressure on the repurchase agreement rate.''
If analysts are right, economic data due out this week, including reports for November on retail sales and consumer prices, may also make dealers breathe a little easier.
Continued poor automobile sales will likely crimp any big upward move in the retail sales numbers, which are due out Wednesday. And after rising by four-tenths of a percentage point in October, the producer price index for November is apt to show a much more modest rise of perhaps one-tenth to two-tenths of a percentage point. Lower food and energy prices are being cited by analysts as the reason for the slip.

HEADLINE: Honduran Leader Walks Out on Talks

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Tuesday, Dec. 12

 BODY:
A summit meeting among the five Central American Presidents was suspended late Monday night when President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras stormed out of the session after the dispute with President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua.
The Costa Rican Minister of Information, Jorge Urbina, told waiting diplomats and journalists that Mr. Azcona had abruptly returned to his San Jose hotel. After quarreling with Mr. Ortega over Nicaragua's refusal to drop a lawsuit it has filed against Honduras before the International Court of Justice regarding the presence of armed Nicaraguan rebels on Honduran soil.
Officials from the other four Central American countries expressed hope early today today that Mr. Azcona might be persuaded to return to the talks, although the five delegations were to return to their countries today. The sudden walkout appeared to highlight the most intractable point of disagreement in the regional peace process and it threatened to leave the five Presidents at an impasse in a moment that the sponsor of the peace process, President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, has described as the most tense and dangerous of the 28-month peace process. 
 
Subject of Friction
The court case, which has been used by Nicaragua to pressure Honduras to evict the contras from its territory, has been a subject of deep friction between the two countries, and an important element in recent peace negotiations. In August, Nicaragua agreed to drop the lawsuit in return for Honduran approval of an accord calling for the dismantling of the contra bases by Dec. 5, but the claim was reinstituted when the deadline passed with no progress on disbanding the contra army.
Diplomats who participated in the two-day summit meeting here said Nicaragua had attempted to use the court case to force Honduras to accept a new agreement demanding that American aid to the contra army be channeled through an international commission established by the regional Presidents. Avoiding Conflict With U.S. But Mr. Azcona was believed to have rejected that demand which would bring his country into direct conflict with the United States, which provides substantial economic and military support for the Honduran Government.
The second day of the talks Monday was overshadowed by sharp new concern over pre-election violence in Nicaragua, where a clash between Sandinista youths and Government opponents on Sunday left one person dead and at least 11 others wounded.
The Nicaraguan Government attributed the violence, which broke out at an opposition rally, to what it called terrorism by the leading anti-Government coalition, the National Opposition Union.
But a bipartisan group of American observers who witnessed the fighting said that it was deliberately provoked by Sandinista mobs, which have been used in the past by the Nicaraguan Government to intimidate and harass its opponents.
The American observers, sponsored by the Washington-based Center for Democracy, said the mobs used machetes, stones and other weapons to provoke an all-out fight with an opposition crowd estimated at 10,000 people. They asserted that continued violence would make it impossible to hold elections in Nicaragua in February.
''What we saw was an outrage,'' said one member of the group, Robert Beckel, who managed the Presidential campaign of Walter F. Mondale in 1984. ''There was no doubt among any of us at the scene that the violence was instigated by the Sandinistas.''
The attack on Sunday, in the town of Masatepe, south of Managua, followed more than six weeks of increasing election violence that opposition leaders and witnesses have blamed on Sandinista mobs. It has increased anticipation of a new report to be released this week by the United Nations officials assigned to observe Nicaragua's election process.
Officials familiar with the report say it will include detailed accounts of Government harassment of opposition marchers in recent demonstrations.

HEADLINE: Soviets Trying to Become Team Player in Mideast

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Asserting that it wants to be a force for moderation in the Middle East, the Soviet Union has moved away from a policy of confrontation with the United States and now indicates that it prefers partnership with Washington in the diplomacy of the region.
The casualties of the policy change, thus far, have been those Arab nations and factions - notably Syria and Libya - that once felt assured of unstinting Soviet protection as they embraced bellicose policies toward Israel.
But it is less clear who may become the beneficiaries of the new policy, as Arab nations seek to define their own roles in the new arrangements and Moscow confronts a serious obstacle to its quest for more influence: it does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. An improvement in relations with Israel is considered a prime goal of the new policy.
''If we are to play an even more active role in the Near East, of course we need to have representatives of our own in Tel Aviv,'' a commentator, Aleksandr Bovin, wrote recently in the Soviet Government newspaper Izvestia. 
Yet, despite a quickening dialogue with Israel, Soviet officials say that diplomatic relations, severed since the Middle East war of 1967, cannot be restored until the Israeli Government displays some new and substantive flexibility in the effort to bring peace to the region.
''The Russians have to come up with some positive development'' affecting Israeli attitudes before restoring ties, said Tahsin Bashir, a respected Egyptian political analyst. ''If they play with Israel alone, they will have no standing'' in the Arab and Muslim world.
Over the last two years, from Cairo to Teheran, Moscow's shift away from confrontation has been keenly felt in a patchwork of initatives that seem designed to spread its influence in the region while propping up Soviet national interests in general.
''I think the Soviets wish to have stability and not to have any surprises in regional conflicts,'' said Judith Kipper of the Brookings Institution in Washington, in a telephone interview. ''After Europe, the Middle East is the flashpoint.''
 
Arms and Diplomacy: 2 Powers' Approaches
In its details Soviet policy, particularly toward the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, remains sharply divided from that of the United States. And like Washington, Moscow continues to supply arms to regional clients as a means of cementing influence. ''Arms transfers play a very large part in Soviet diplomacy,'' said Ian Anthony, a researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
But on a broader scale, the Arab world increasingly faces the differences between Moscow and Washington, differences that have enabled the Arabs to trade on the superpower rivalry.
In February, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, set the tone for Moscow's desired new relationship with the Middle East. He toured Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and Iran in what American officials depicted as an attempt to play catch-up with Washington's dominant position in most parts of the region - both as arms supplier and as diplomatic center-weight.
''The policy of pushing each other out of the region has to be abandoned in favor of constructive cooperation for the sake of peace and tranquillity in the Middle East,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said.
The Soviet Union, the news-feature agency Novosti said in September, has ''abandoned the naive stance'' whereby ''a country whose ties with the United States were strained was considered a friend of Moscow.''
The Soviets, said Mr. Bashir, the Egyptian analyst, are ''matching their deeds to their rhetoric.''
Egyptian enthusiasm did not extend to Libya, which has bought billions of dollars worth of Soviet weapons, including Sukhoi 24 attack bombers, but which now feels threatened by the prospect of being at odds with its onetime sponsor.
Libya's press denigrated the Malta summit talks between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ''The rules of the international game will not change,'' one newspaper there said. ''The only difference between Yalta and Malta is the difference between the letter 'Y' and the letter 'M.' ''
 
U.S. Striped-Pants Set Is Less Than Delighted
Moscow's intention, according to Western officials, is to carve out for itself a far more influential role in an area dominated by the United States, using the language of cooperation as a lever. The overtures do not seem particularly welcome among some American diplomats, jealous of their influence in many parts of the Mideast. Earlier this year, moreover, Mr. Bush said that the Soviet role should be limited.
Yet, officials, diplomats and other analysts, both from the region and beyond, say that recent Soviet policy has produced a patchwork of changed relationships in support of the bid for influence.
Many Israelis are pleased. ''Israel can only benefit from the changes in Eastern Europe and Soviet policy. We've gotten more diplomatic relations, economic opportunities and an increase in Soviet Jewish emigration,'' said Yossi Olmert, a specialist in Arab affairs who has just become head of the Government press office in Jerusalem. ''There's no problem here for us. There's no taboo any more - people want to talk to us.''
Moscow has moved to a closer relationship both through permitting Soviet Jews to emigrate in large numbers and by direct high-level contacts. Foreign Minister Shevardnadze met in Cairo with his Israeli counterpart, Moshe Arens, in February.
The new warmth has spurred criticism from radical Palestinians like Ahmed Jabril, leader of the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command. Mr. Jabril has bitterly criticized the Soviet decision to permit increased emigration as being supportive of Israel.
Egyptian and mainstream Palestinian officials see benefits from a closer Soviet involvement in the region, advantages comparable to that from American participation.
Fearful of losing Arab backing, however, the Soviets have set conditions for restoring diplomatic ties. ''As long as Israel refuses to move forward for a real settlement and convening an international conference, what would the meaning of relations be?'' a Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister, Yuri M. Vorontsov, asked last week.
 
Paying Lip Service To Idea of a Conference
Israel opposes the idea of an international peace conference, and Washington is at best lukewarm to it. But in its official declarations at least, Moscow has maintained support for the idea, a central plank of Arab policy, without seeking to block the current American effort to establish a direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
In 1987, Moscow brokered a reconciliation of sorts between Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and hard-line opponents that re-established the P.L.O. leader's authority.
Mr. Gorbachev also urged Mr. Arafat to embrace the conciliatory policies agreed to a year ago at a meeting of the Palestine National Council, the P.L.O.'s parliament in exile, in Algiers. At that meeting, the P.L.O. said it recognized Israel's right to exist as a state in the region, renounced terrorism, and established an official dialogue with the United States.
Such moves contrast sharply with earlier Soviet support for radical positions and opposition to discussions with the United States.
''It is beyond doubt that the American-Soviet dialogue played a part in promoting the the official dialogue between the United States and the P.L.O.,'' Novosti said last month.
In Cairo, Mr. Bashir, the Egyptian analyst, said, ''We don't want the Soviets out of the Middle East. We want them to be in a cooperative mood.''
 
Syrians, With the Most To Lose, Learn to Adjust
But it is in Damascus that the shift in Soviet policy has been most keenly felt since Moscow let it be known that it no longer supported President Hafez al-Assad's drive for what he calls strategic parity with Israel.
Syria believes that Israel will not come to terms with the Arabs until the Arab world can match its military strength. For years, the Soviet Union withheld criticism of the idea, but this year it has begun to advocate a new military doctrine called ''reasonable defense sufficiency,'' according to Soviet and Western officials in Damascus.
This shift undermines Mr. Assad's strategy toward Israel, and Damascus has protested the fact that the Soviet Ambassador, Aleksandr I. Zotov, discussed the idea with Western reporters recently.
But the new policy is depicted by Soviet officials as reflecting a wider trend away from confrontation. ''Our military conception is now one of defense,'' the Soviet Ambassador in Cairo, Gennadi Zhuravlev, said.
Economic constraints have also persuaded the Soviets to remold their military policies toward clients which, like Syria, have run up big debts for which there is little prospect of repayment soon. Syria is estimated to owe Moscow $15 billion for arms purchases.
Soviet officials, however, say that there is no intention of abandoning Syria, their most prized Mideast ally, and the only one bordering Israel. Some Israeli assessments suggest that Moscow's arms supplies have been reduced, but, according to Mr. Anthony of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the change has mainly been in the kind of weapons that Syria has received.
''There has not been a decline in volume but a change in the nature of arms transfers to Syria,'' he said, citing as an example air-defense systems ordered after Israeli planes mauled the Syrian Air Force during the Lebanon war of 1982.
Diplomatically, Moscow has sought to use its relationship with Damascus to draw itself closer to the mainstream of Mideast diplomacy by arranging a reconciliation between President Assad and Mr. Arafat. That attempt, however, foundered in February on the deep animosities between the two men.
Possibly in response to the new Soviet attitude, and certainly in response to overtures from Washington, President Assad has opened more intensive contacts with the United States over the last year.
 
Potential Trouble Spots: Lebanon and the Gulf
Diplomats and specialists in Arab affairs see the closest convergence of American and Soviet attitudes occurring in Lebanon, where both superpowers have endorsed an Arab League peace formula that effectively legitimates the presence of Syrian soldiers and acknowledges Damascus's influence.
In the Persian Gulf, Moscow has traditionally taken the long view. But these days, the Soviet Union confronts a more direct geographic threat from the Islamic Government in Iran, which is seen as capable of sowing unrest among Muslims in the southern Soviet republics.
Its approach to Iran is thus far more closely geared to perceptions of national interest than to worries about cooperation with Washington.
For 10 years after the Islamic revolution of 1979, the Iranian leadership reviled the Soviet Union as much as it did the United States. But in February, Mr. Shevardnadze seemed to score a victory with a visit to Teheran that foreshadowed less hostile relations.
''Iran is on their border, and the Soviets have 70 milliom Muslims,'' said Miss Kipper of the Brookings Institution. The Soviet concern is that ''Iran won't exploit the situation on the other side of the border.'' Some see other processes at work. ''The Soviets are trying to keep a foot in both camps,'' Mr Anthony, in Stockholm, said of Moscow's policy toward the Arabs and Iranians confronting one another across the Persian Gulf. Since its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Soviet Union has emerged from opprobrium in the Islamic world caused by its fight with Muslin guerrillas there. It has pursued a new relationship with Saudi Arabia and maintained close military ties with Iraq.
''The Iraqi Army is almost totally dependent on the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Anthony said, adding, ''From the Soviet perspective, they don't want either Iran or Iraq to emerge as a dominant regional power.''
 
Soviet Missile Worries At a Time of Change
Concern by both Moscow and Washington over the region's volatilty has grown with the proliferation of ballistic missiles, a concern emphasized last week when Iraq said it had sent a huge rocket into space.
American analysts have said that the Soviets are also worried by the presence of medium-range missiles close to their borders at a time when similar missiles are being dismantled in Europe.
Heino Kopietz, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said that while sales of other weapons to Mideast countries by both the West and the Soviet Union would continue ''as a diplomatic tool, the interest in limiting missiles is shared by Moscow and Washington.''
''The fear in both capitals,'' he said, ''is that these missiles might be deployed or deployed more easily'' in the Mideast than elsewhere, and thus offer a more serious threat to stability.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Bush Versus Quayle?

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
When he surprised the world by choosing Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, George Bush said he wanted a Vice President just like he himself had been in the Reagan Administration - loyal, quiet and on the team.
When Senator Quayle surprised no one by accepting Mr. Bush's offer, he echoed the boss. That was just the kind of Vice President he wanted to be. Yes, sir. 
A year later, the relationship has not worked out quite that way. Or has it?
One can search the records of the Reagan Administration from beginning to end and find no example of Vice President George Bush ever speaking out so publicly and independently as Vice President Dan Quayle has been doing. Mr. Quayle, moreover, has been taking his own line on perhaps the most important subject of all - Soviet-American relations and how the President should conduct them.
Sounding just like the right-wing conservative he is, Mr. Quayle has warned strongly against ''getting caught up in the magnetic personality'' of Mikhail Gorbachev - just what many conservatives think Mr. Bush did at the Malta summit conference. The Vice President also castigated the Soviet Union for its totalitarian system, just after Mr. Bush at Malta went further than any President has in offering to do business with that system and to help it change and adapt.
In general, Mr. Quayle has taken a far more anti-Soviet, anti-Gorbachev position than anything said at Malta by the President, or than what seems to be the emerging Administration policy of working with Mr. Gorbachev for an improved Soviet economy, better Soviet-American relations and peaceful developments in Eastern Europe.
White House spin doctors first leaked the line that this apparent conflict between Mr. Bush and his Vice President was deliberate. Mr. Quayle was only doing what the President wanted - soothing the Republican right wing, which Mr. Bush seems to be in constant fear of losing. Thus, while he warmed up to Mr. Gorbachev at Malta, Mr. Quayle was reassuring the right wing that its views were still represented at high levels in the Bush Administration.
The Vice President himself has now ditched that approach. In fact, at a Manhattan news conference, he said there was ''nothing inconsistent'' with Administration policy in anything he had said since Malta. Mr. Bush wanted to see Mr. Gorbachev succeed, but also meant to conduct foreign policy in a ''cautious, prudent manner,'' he said. Presto! No difference.
If the White House spin-doctor leakage is correct, little harm has been done because the Soviets and other foreign nations are too sophisticated politically to believe that real U.S. policy is being expressed by the Vice President at home rather than by George Bush at Malta. The right wing, however, would have every reason to feel insulted and held in contempt - for its members also are too knowledgeable to think Mr. Quayle's line, rather than Mr. Bush's, reflects actual policy. Confirming Mr. Bush's worst fears, right-wingers might even resent such a condescending effort to gull them.
If Mr. Quayle, on the other hand, is to be believed that there's ''no good-cop-bad-cop strategy,'' then once again this Administration has suggested - as in Mr. Bush's multiple views on abortion - that words have no real meaning, voters have no ability to hear and understand them, and what's said yesterday can be undone by what's said today. If Americans are really being asked to accept that there's ''nothing inconsistent'' in Mr. Bush's and Mr. Quayle's words, we're all being treated with contempt.
Maybe that attitude is one reason Mr. Bush, violating all precedent and the common-sense rules of politics, has announced already that the inimitable Mr. Quayle will be his running mate again. Since no one can read the future, Mr. Bush's usual prudence and caution should have caused him to withhold that endorsement until nearer 1992.
But if you think words don't matter anyway, what's to lose? You can try to mollify the right wing by blessing Dan Quayle today, then give him the gate tomorrow, and gullible Americans will perceive ''nothing inconsistent'' in such cynicism.

HEADLINE: Lower East Side Group Sues H.U.D. on Project

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A group of Lower East Side residents sued the Federal Housing and Urban Development Department yesterday, contending that financing for a housing project there for the elderly was illegally approved because of political pressure from Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
The plaintiffs are seeking to stop the project because it would be built at the corner of East Ninth Street and Avenue C, which they are using as a park. 
Mr. D'Amato, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, denied that he had done anything improper. He said he supported the project because the city needed housing for the elderly.
The lawyer for the plaintiffs, Harry Kresky, said the lawsuit's claims were based on an Oct. 26 article in The New York Times in which David S. Burns, the H.U.D. economist in New York, said he had been improperly pressured to support the project.
The suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan seeks a court order to stop the H.U.D. financing and to halt the transfer of the city-owned land to the developer, Lower East Side Housing Coalition Development Inc., which is named as a defendant in the suit.

HEADLINE: The Rising Dominance of OPEC

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Reflecting its expansion into refining and distribution, Saudi Arabia's oil company has emerged as the largest oil company in the world, the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly said in its issue that was published today.
Three other national oil companies owned by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, those of Venezuela, Iran and Kuwait, rank fourth, fifth and tenth, respectively, the industry newsletter said.
The Saudi Arabian Oil Company, also known as Saudi Aramco, has always been a major producer of oil, as have the oil companies of other OPEC nations. But in recent years they have moved to become integrated oil companies that refine and market what they produce. 
 
Rankings Reflect Success
As a result, OPEC nations now refine more than 14.3 percent of the world's oil, compared with 8 percent in 1979. That shift in strategy has been previously noted, but the rankings issued today by the newsletter, which is published in New York, demonstrate how successful they have been.
While this trend would seem to contain potential dangers for major oil-importing nations, the Saudis and many other Persian Gulf officials have noted that their presence in Western markets carries with it an obligation to help promote economic stability.
''It is a sign of the times,'' said Gary Ross, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates, a consulting firm in New York. ''Inevitably the reserves of these OPEC countries are putting them in a position to be the major players in all aspects of oil markets. One might say it is the end of one era and the beginning of another.''
The most important conclusion of the newsletter's study is that the power and reach of what were once the largest oil companies, like the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, now No. 2, and the Exxon Corporation, now No. 3, are declining, primarily because their access to oil reserves is strictly limited.
 
Backed With Infinite Reserves
And the presence of OPEC national oil companies in world oil markets continues to grow and is backed with almost infinite reserves that are expected to last well over 100 years.
''I think what it tells us about the future of the world oil markets is that national oil companies from OPEC are going to be the dominant force of the 90's,'' said Thomas Wallin, a senior editor of the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly who participated in the study.
The industry newsletter said it had based its rankings on a detailed study of ''six basic operation indicators, including oil and gas reserves, production, product sales and refining capacity.'' It added that the rankings ''draw on data from about 100 firms worldwide, excluding Communist countries, for 1988.'' #128 Years of Production A chart shows that Saudi Aramco has at least 128 years of production from its enormous oil reserves, which are estimated at more than 250 billion barrels of oil. By contrast, Exxon, based on its current reserves of 7.4 billion barrels of oil, has only 11 years of production ahead of it.
Other OPEC giants with huge reserves include Kuwait, with 171 years of production ahead; Iran, with 110 years; Iraq, with 101 years; Libya, with 61 years, and Venezuela, with 80 years.
By contrast, Royal Dutch/Shell has reserves that will last 14 years, the Mobil Oil Corporation has 12 years of reserves ahead of it, the British Petroleum Company can go on pumping for 13 years, and the Chevron Corporation for 9 years.
Until a few years ago, reserves in the ground mattered little, and an oil company's weight was measured primarily by its financial reach and the distribution network of refineries and gasoline stations it had to get its oil, or oil it purchased, to clients.
 
Spread to Asia Predicted
Now, more OPEC countries have the money to expand their distribution networks and are acquiring refineries and gas stations from the largest established companies, in effect replacing them in many markets in Western Europe and the United States. Eventually that process will spread to Asia, OPEC officials say.
In recent years, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation has bought a vast refining and distribution network in Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and Italy, with a total volume of about 300,000 barrels a day.
Saudi Arabia has bought a large refining and marketing network by entering into a joint venture with Texaco Inc. last year on the East Coast of the United States, with a total refining capcity of 600,000 barrels a day. Venezuela has bought into the Gulf Coast of the United States and agreed to joint ventures in West Germany and Sweden with local companies.
Libya has slowly purchased a distribution network in Italy and a refinery in West Germany, joining Kuwait in entering the West European market directly.
 
Bigger Refining Role
Even as the OPEC nations increase their share of refining and distribution, the presence of large oil companies like Exxon, Texaco and Mobil is shrinking. Kuwait, for instance, purchased much of its West European network from what was the Gulf Oil Corporation, which was acquired in 1984 by Chevron.
Oil experts said the exclusion of Communist countries, most importantly the Soviet Union, from the study was of little consequence since Moscow's production ability has been declining. The Soviet oil industry is in serious trouble because of inefficient management, poor drilling techniques and lack of investment.
PlanEcon, a Washington-based consulting firm that specializes in the economic affairs of Soviet and Communist countries, estimates that the Soviet Union's oil production will drop this year by 300,000 barrels, to 12.15 million barrels a day. More importantly, says a PlanEcon economist, Charles Movit, Soviet oil production ''will continue to decline through the early 1990's,'' to around 11.6 million barrels a day, before stabilizing.
 
'Only 14' Are American
Among the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly's main conclusions is that ''companies from 34 different countries make up the top 50, with the historically dominant United States oil industry accounting for only 14.''
The study says 30 of the 50 largest oil companies are entirely state-owned or largely state-owned and ''they are getting better at acquiring downstream refining and marketing assets in consuming countries,'' like refineries and gasoline stations.
The state-owned oil companies include Petroleos Mexicanos, Indonesia's Pertamina and Algeria's Sonatrach, but by far the largest belong to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates and Libya. Those seven nations hold well over 70 percent of the world's reserves of oil and gas.

HEADLINE: BellSouth Terminates Pact With Lin

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The BellSouth Corporation agreed today to terminate its merger agreement with the Lin Broadcasting Corporation, whose board recommended last week that Lin merge instead with McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
The merger, which values Lin at nearly $6.8 billion, would reinforce McCaw's position as the largest cellular telephone company in the country.
Lin had asked BellSouth to terminate their agreement, which it accepted on Sept. 11. Some Wall Street analysts had predicted that BellSouth would come back with a new offer. 
But William O. McCoy, president of BellSouth Enterprises, said today that the previous offer, a non-cash proposal made in September, was the best it could do.
 
A Matter of Realities
In return for ending its agreement with Lin, BellSouth will receive $66.5 million.
In addition, McCaw will contribute $26.5 million to Los Angeles RCC's Inc., of which BellSouth owns 85 percent and McCaw 15 percent. The California company owns an equity interest in the Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Company.
''Our merger would have created the premier cellular company in the world, but such decisions ultimately must reflect economic and strategic realities,'' Mr. McCoy said.
McCaw's chairman, Craig O. McCaw, said BellSouth's announcement ''clears the way for us to complete our acquisition.''
After BellSouth's announcement, its stock price rose $1, to close at $54.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock of Lin and McCaw fell in over-the-counter trading, Lin by $2, to $122.25, McCaw by 75 cents to $38.25.
 
Dividend Had Been Planned
Under the Lin-BellSouth deal, BellSouth would have received 50 percent of the stock of the combined company. Before the completion of the merger, Lin would have spun off its television stations to stockholders and paid each shareholder a special dividend of $20 a share.
The McCaw-Lin deal calls for McCaw to buy 21.9 million shares of Lin. It already owns 5.1 million Lin shares and would end up with just over 50 percent of Lin's 53.9 million common shares.
In its initial bid, on June 6, McCaw proposed a buyout of all Lin stock at $120 a share, or a total of nearly $6.5 billion.
Lin and McCaw tried to negotiate an agreement, but when their talks broke down, Lin agreed to the BellSouth deal.
Lin, based in New York, has cellular telephone businesses in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Philadelphia and Houston as well as interests in broadcasting and publishing. McCaw, based in Kirkland, Wash., is the nation's largest cellular phone company, with a concentration in numerous smaller markets.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Issues Slip in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched lower in very sluggish trading yesterday, and market participants said that activity was likely to remain spotty for the rest of the month.
''There are some statistics due out this week that could generate some interest, but it will only last for an hour or two and won't produce a consistent flow of business,'' one Government bond trader said. ''Instead of looking forward to the next number, what people are really looking to is next year, when everybody's slate gets wiped clean.''
Among the reports to be released later this week are retail sales and producer price data for November. The retail sales numbers are expected tomorrow, with producer price numbers set to be made public on Friday. 
 
Jobless Report Inconclusive
Market participants are awaiting fresh information because the November employment report released last Friday failed to provide any compelling new insight about the health of the economy.
Many traders believe the Federal Reserve Board will not move to ease credit policy further until there are additional signs of weakness in the economy.
However, some analysts said the employment data did provide clues that were missed or overlooked.
''The economy is a lot weaker than the financial markets are willing to acknowledge,'' said Robert M. Giordano, a partner and director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
''The employment report says the economy is not growing this quarter. There is no dramatic downward pressure on the economy, but the weakness that has surfaced in certain areas of manufacturing is starting to spread. Right now, the Fed is a step behind the economy, and we think they will take one more step to ease policy before the end of the year.''
 
Funds Rate Eases to 8 3/8%
Yesterday the Fed chose not to conduct open market operations, and the rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market softened a bit from the 8 7/16 percent level it has occupied for the last few sessions. By late in the day the funds rate, the rate most closely controlled by the Fed, was at 8 3/8 percent.
Participants in the secondary market for Treasury securities said that trading was exceptionally slow, even for a Monday, often the slowest day of the week.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds were offered at a price of 102 3/4, down 2/32, to yield 7.88 percent. Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 3/8, down 2/32, to yield 7.82 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 31/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 7.76 percent. 6-Month Bills at 7.41% Rates on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills moved higher at the weekly auction yesterday. Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.60 percent, up from the 7.55 percent average rate at last week's sale. Meanwhile, bids on six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.41 percent. A week ago, six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.30 percent.
New issue activity in the market for investment-grade corporate bonds was highlighted by an offering of $200 million worth of 10-year notes by Texaco Inc.
The 9 percent notes, which mature Dec. 15, 1999, were priced at par, or $100, to yield 1.18 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 7 7/8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The issue is noncallable for life.
Traders in the secondary market for corporate securities said that prices of most issues were essentially unchanged at the end of a very quiet trading session.
The tax-exempt bond market also began the week on a very quiet note. Municipal bond traders said prices were little changed on the day.
With roughly $2 billion in new issues expected to be priced later this week, activity should pick up, municipal bond traders said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Foreigners As Owners

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Foreign ownership of United States factories, banks and other businesses has increased in recent years, but most fears about adverse economic consequences from foreign control are unwarranted, according to a study released today by a Washington research group.
The Institute for International Economics said that contrary to some arguments, the growth of foreign ownership had not translated into a loss of jobs for Americans and that foreign companies had paid their United States workers the same as domestic concerns. 
The institute argued against changing United States laws to block foreign investment, saying that even in the area of national security, foreign ownership was not of concern.
''Even with the recent growth in foreign ownership, foreign firms play a smaller role in the United States economy than in the Canadian and major European economies,'' wrote the report's authors, Paul Krugman, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Edwin M. Graham, a business professor at Duke University.
The study said foreign companies accounted for 7 percent of total United States employment in manufacturing in 1986 compared with 21 percent in France, 14 percent in Britain and 13 percent in West Germany. By contrast, foreign-owned companies employed only 1 percent of manufacturing workers in Japan.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Down; Rate Speculation a Factor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday against major foreign currencies in light trading.
Dealers said firm interest rates in West Germany, political changes in East Germany and speculation of further interest rate increases were supporting the mark at the dollar's expense. The dollar closed in New York at 1.7610 West German marks, down from 1.7705.
Also depressing the American currency were reports that the Federal Reserve sold dollars for yen as part of an effort to improve the trade imbalance.
''It's probably just a message, and the market as usual overacted,'' said Robert Ryan, senior trader for the Bank of New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose by 0.38 Japanese yen, to 144.65 yen. It traded at 144.47 yen in London, and at 144.375 yen in New York, up from 144.30 on Friday.
The dollar was weaker against the British pound, with sterling buying $1.5895 in London, up from $1.5793 late Friday. The pound fetched $1.5937 in New York, up from $1.5825.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's quotes, were: 1.5915 Swiss francs, down from 1.5970; 6.0200 French francs, down from 6.0485; 1,301.00 Italian lire, down from 1,304.00, and 1.16375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16225.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with those on Friday, were: 1.7660 West German marks, down from 1.7720; 1.5970 Swiss francs, down from 1.5985; 6.0370 French francs, down from 6.0565; 1.9950 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0000; 1,304.25 Italian lire, down from 1,306.50, and 1.1632 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1615.

HEADLINE: Devaluation In Argentina

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The Argentine Government announced a series of economic measures late Sunday night, including a devaluation of its currency, and banks and foreign exchange houses were closed today to give them time to digest the actions.
The Government devalued the austral to 1,000 to the United States dollar from the previous rate of 655 to 1, bringing the currency in line with its black market value. 
State-controlled gasoline prices were increased by about 60 percent, bringing the price of a gallon of regular gas to the equivalent of $1.44.
To help Argentines cope with the measures, the Government authorized December pay increases for public and private employees.
Unions, which had already been staging pay strikes, said the raises were not enough. Commuter train lines were halted today and court clerks pledged to renew their boycott that disrupted the judicial system nationwide last week.
The measures - particularly the pay increases and the devaluation -almost certainly will stoke inflation that has grown at triple-digit rates in 14 of the last 15 years.
The last economic adjustment, on July 9, devalued the austral by 54 percent, tripled public service rates and imposed wage and price guidelines. That helped bring monthly inflation down to 5.6 percent in October from 197 percent in July, but fueled labor unrest.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Rebound Is Predicted In Advertiser Spending

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg

 BODY:
Advertiser spending in the United States in 1989 has not kept pace with the increase in the gross national product, although it should rebound in 1990, said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting at McCann-Erickson. Mr. Coen, speaking yesterday at the annual Paine Webber media conference in New York, attributed the decline this year primarily to the normal post-Olympic-year drop in advertising and to sluggish newspaper advertising sales.
In 1989, when the G.N.P. rose 7.2 percent, without adjustments for inflation, advertising expenditures rose just 5.8 percent. Last year, the Olympics contributed to a 7.9 percent rise in advertising.
Mr. Coen predicted that in 1990 ad spending would increase 6.2 percent. ''We do see signs, under the surface, that ad demand is picking up,'' he said, citing factors like a slowdown in mergers involving consumer-products companies. ''A gradual return to the production and marketing of consumer products and services is setting in,'' he said in his report.
Overseas advertising expenditures continued to grow much faster in 1989 than domestic spending, Mr. Coen said, rising 11 percent when measured in local currencies.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Baker, in Berlin, Outlines a Plan To Make NATO a Political Group

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POTSDAM, East Germany, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Seeking to give some American direction to the rapidly changing events in Europe, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today outlined proposals for transforming NATO from a primarily military organization to a political alliance.
Mr. Baker's proposal, made in a speech to the Berlin Press Club in West Berlin, was part of the most comprehensive and detailed set of ideas to emerge from the Bush Administration to deal with the upheavals that are reshaping the European political landscape.
Mr. Baker said he hoped that his ideas for recasting existing institutions like NATO, the European Economic Community and the Helsinki process could help channel the ''peaceful revolution'' under way in Europe into a stable, democratic new order.
Mr. Baker, in his speech, also proposed that the United States and the European Community work together to strengthen their ties. He urged support for changes in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany and suggested that the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe be reshaped into a framework for ''openness'' between NATO and the armies of Eastern Europe. In addition, Mr. Baker repeated President Bush's views on German reunification. [Excerpts, page A18.] Directly after his speech, Mr. Baker slipped into a Mercedes limousine and traveled to East Germany to deliver another message in a previously unanounced round of talks with East Germany's Communist Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, as well as with several East German opposition leaders. 
Those talks were held in Potsdam, not far from the hall where Truman, Churchill and Attlee gathered to meet with Stalin in 1945 to frame Germany's postwar occupation, and they were made at the first visit of an American Secretary of State to East Germany. Potsdam lies just 20 miles southeast of Berlin.
While American officials would not say so explicitly, they left a clear impression that Mr. Baker's primary purpose in seeing Mr. Modrow was to do what he could to shore up his Government in the hope that it might survive long enough to conduct free elections now scheduled for May. In other words, after refusing to visit East Germany for 45 years because it was considered to have an illegitimate, unrepresentative regime, an American Secretary of State finally made such a trip. Officials also said that Mr. Baker wanted personally to urge the opposition to keep its movement nonviolent and to approach the issue of German reunification with sober restraint.
The Bush Administration seriously fears that the East German Government might collapse and force a disorganized, de facto unification with West Germany before either Germany's neighbors or the Soviet Union are prepared to accept it. Although he discussed the idea of visiting East Germany with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in a telephone call last Thursday, Mr. Baker only decided to go this afternoon after being assured by the American Ambassador to East Germany, Richard C. Barkley, that his visit would not provoke further instability.
Speaking to reporters after his one-hour meeting with Mr. Modrow, who is considered a leader of the liberal wing of the East German Communist Party, Mr. Baker said: ''I felt it was important that we have an opportunity to let the Premier and the people of the German Democratic Republic know our support for the reforms that are taking place in this country. We also wanted to make it very clear that we support the process of reform in a peaceful manner, and we are very anxious to see the process move forward in a stable way.''
Officials who attended the meeting said that Mr. Baker told the East German leader that if his country were to follow in the footsteps of Poland and Hungary, it could expect to receive a sympathetic hearing from the non-Communist industrialized nations should it seek economic assistance.
 
Modrow Is Reserved
Mr. Modrow was quite reserved when the two men emerged in a drizzle from their meeting at Potsdam's Interhotel, saying only that East Germany ''tries in its relations with the United States to be a stable element.'' Tipping his hat to Moscow, Mr. Modrow added that East Germany was also ''a building block in the ''common European home,'' which was how President Mikhail S. Gorbachebv describes his vision of a united Europe.
As dramatic as Mr. Baker's visit to Potsdam was - he made the 40-minute drive escorted by a bevy of West German and then East German motorcycle policemen, and crossed into the East over the famous Glienicke Bridge, scene of many East-West spy swaps -it was his Berlin speech which will likely have the more lasting impact.
In his speech, Mr. Baker emphasized that NATO would have to transform itself from primarily a military organization to more of a political alliance. It can do this by concentrating more on ''arms control agreements, confidence-building measures and other political consultative arrangements.''
In particular, Mr. Baker called for NATO to establish an ''arms control verification staff'' that would assist member governments in monitoring compliance with the conventional arms control agreement now being negotiated in Vienna by NATO and the Warsaw Pact, as well as future agreements that are bound to follow. NATO, Mr. Baker said, should also explore if it can play more of a diplomatic role in solving regional disputes.
 
On European Community
On the European Community, Mr. Baker said that as the 12 members of the E.E.C. became more political and economically intertwined after they merge into a single unified market in 1992, their organization will become the core of the new Europe. As such, it will be the main anchor insuring that any unified Germany remains in the Western camp, and the main magnet drawing Eastern Europe toward the free world.
Given that fact, Mr. Baker proposed that the United States and the community ''work together to achieve, whether in treaty or some other form, a significantly strengthened set of institutional and consultative links.''
American officials are increasingly viewing the new situation in Europe as an ideal way for them to get more of a foothold into the European Community and to get more of a say in its economic deliberations.
Mr. Baker also declared that if Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany adopt changes similar to Poland's and Hungary's, the community and the non-Communist industrial nations should support them as well.
 
Helsinki Act Considered
The Secretary of State suggested that the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which produced the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, consecrating Europe's postwar boundaries and establishing a common baseline for human rights, be transformed into a new framework for promoting greater openness and transparency between NATO and the armies of the East and, more importantly, into a vehicle for promoting free, multiparty elections throughout Europe.
The conference is the only organization that brings all of East and West Europe under one umbrella, said Mr. Baker, and, as such, it would be an ideal framework for providing practical technical advice to the East Bloc countries on how to make ''the transition from stalled, planned, economies to free competitive markets.''
Mr. Baker repeated that any process of German reunification should be consistent with the four principles outlined by President Bush in his speech in Brussels last week - specifically that reunification should emerge from a free vote in both East and West Germany, that it should come about gradually, that it should not involve any redrawing of German borders and that whatever new state might emerge would have to remain committed to both NATO and the European Community.
 
A Comprehensive Framework
While some of the ideas Mr. Baker laid out were not new, and others were not fully fleshed out, they nevertheless provided the first reasonably comprehensive framework for how the Bush Administration actually intends to go about trying to develop what the President has called ''a Europe whole and free.'' Whether events in Eastern Europe will slow down, or remain stable enough to make implementation of this framework possible in the coming years, no one in the Secretary's delegation dared to predict.
Before Mr. Baker made his speech, he met in the morning with the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and the Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Mr. Genscher then escorted Mr. Baker for a visit to the Berlin Wall and Potsdamer Platz, once Berlin's equivalent of Times Square, which is where the East Germans first began to erect the barbed wire that eventually grew into a cement wall.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Urges Legalization Of Crack, Heroin and Other Drugs

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
In a rare statement by a member of the judiciary, a Federal judge in Manhattan called last night for the legalization of all drugs that are now illegal, including marijuana, heroin and crack.
In a speech at the Cosmopolitan Club in Manhattan, the judge, Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court, called the war on illicit drugs ''bankrupt.'' He said 11 1/2 years on the bench had convinced him of the futility of sentencing criminals convicted of violating drug laws and the frustration of ''seeing our justice system overwhelmed by a social phenomena.''
Judge Sweet, a former Federal prosecutor, became the first Federal judge to propose publicly that illegal drugs be made legal, according to the Drug Policy Foundation. The foundation, an international nonprofit research organization in Washington, is devoted to exploring alternatives to the current national drug policy. 
 
Public Support by Others
The 67-year-old judge also joined the ranks of a small but growing number of former and present government officials, commentators and academics who have argued that the present policy, of aggressively prosecuting drug sellers and users, be reconsidered.
Others who are making this argument include former Secretary of State George P. Shultz; the economist Milton Friedman, who has received the Nobel Prize; William F. Buckley, the conservative columnist, and Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore. Legalization has been promoted most vigorously by Ethan A. Nadelmann, who teaches at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and who has been credited by public figures with opening their minds to the idea.
The White House and Congress have opposed the idea. The Bush Administration has said that legalization would be an ''unqualified national disaster'' and would create many more addicts. Earlier this week William J. Bennett, the National Drug Policy Director, accused proponents of legalization of advancing ''morally scandalous'' arguments.
When Congress addressed the issue last year, it passed an anti-drug law that declared that legalization would be an unconscionable surrender in a war in which ''there could be no substitute for total victory.''
 
Public Opinion Not Supportive
Public opinion appears to support that position. In a poll of 1,537 adults conducted in April by the National Opinion Research Center, respondents said by a ratio of 5 to 1 that marijuana should not be made legal.
Judge Sweet, appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978, was a Deputy Mayor of New York City under Mayor John V. Lindsay from 1966 to 1969. He helped supervise treatment programs for addicts.
He is considered by colleagues and lawyers who have appeared before him as bright, diligent and moderate, but not among the most influential of Federal trial judges. Nonetheless, his speech reflected the frustration of a number of Federal and state judges who, in recent interviews, said they have come to believe that too much reliance is being placed on the courts to solve the nation's drug problem.
Judge Sweet's speech at the Cosmopolitan Club was not a public event; only members of the club were permitted to attend, although the judge provided a text of his speech shortly before delivering it.
 
Comparison to Alcohol
The judge argued that illicit drugs should be treated like alcohol: they should be taxed and made illegal for minors. He added that if the drugs were legalized, drug use, like alcohol consumption, should take place outside of work.
While many of his arguments in favor of legalization have been made by others, the judge's remarks were nonetheless extraordinary, coming from one who regularly helps enforce the nation's drug laws and orders the incarceration of those convicted of narcotics possession and drug dealing.
The judge said that the enormous increase on the docket of criminal drug cases, which by law must generally be heard within 10 weeks of indictment, was forcing long delays in civil matters. The problem has become so severe, he said, that in September no juries were available in the Federal District Court in Manhattan to hear civil trials.
He proposed that the state set the prices of the legalized drugs and the amounts that could be sold, and set up or license outlets for their sale. People should be able to buy quantities ''at will,'' he said. But he added that no one without a doctor's prescription would be able to buy a lethal dosage at one time. The drugs would be made by pharmaceutical companies, he said, and any sales outside of the state-recognized system of distribution would be considered a crime, as it is with the consumption of alcohol in some states.
The speech did not address where the pharmaceutical companies would purchase the raw materials, like coca, which is now harvested mostly in the Andean nations in South America.
 
Present Efforts Found Wanting
Judge Sweet said that efforts to combat the spread of illegal drugs had failed to put a dent in trafficking or use. Instead, he said, these efforts had proved to be onerously expensive and had ''come close to causing foreign excursions, subversions and caused us to reconsider whether or not, as a nation, we wish to employ assassination as an expression of policy.''
''From Dionysus or Noah's vines on, mind altering by alcohol has been part of Western culture,'' Judge Sweet said. ''Not so marijuana, cocaine, heroin and crack. However, these substances, to a greater or lesser extent, and in varying degrees, do alter one's consciousness, one's view of the world. Even as alcohol dulls the suppressor and enhances one's view of oneself, cocaine gives a sense of exhilaration, heroin a glow, a warmth, and marijuana a sense of relaxation and ease. What then is wrong?''
The judge compared the current state of drug policy to the prohibition of alcohol earlier this century and said that the abolition of drug laws would eliminate the profit motive, the gangs and the drug dealers. He added that it would make it easier to identify and treat people with drug addiction problems, especially through the use of the almost $9 billion now going to criminal prosecutions and tax revenues generated from drug sales.
He said it would be illogical to legalize some mind-altering drugs while continuing to deny more potent or addictive substances, like crack.
 
Crack Would Be Legal, Too
''To draw distinctions on the degree of addiction may not be empirically possible, nor does it appeal to logic and symmetry. In my view, you don't outlaw 120 proof while permitting 80.''
He said research might soon yield an andidote to crack addiction, adding that the increasing numbers of crack cases flooding the family courts, where judges are being forced to supervise abandoned or crack-addicted children, ''demonstrates the failure of our present prohibition.''
''We should identify those at risk and reach out to provide alternative services and ultimately hope,'' he said. ''There is no present evidence that prohibition has, or will, break this vicious cycle of dependence and abandonment.''
The judge conceded that society must anticipate that legalization would lead to increased use of narcotics, as the repeal of prohibition initially led to greater consumption of alcohol.
''The gamble,'' he said, ''would have to be that addressing the underlying causes, providing safe narcotics and treating the users, would ultimately result in a healthier America. If it is otherwise, it will be because our citizens have lost the capacity to act affirmatively and to control their individual addictions.
''The present climate seems to me to be optimistic: there is an emphasis on health, diet and what one ingests,'' he said. ''If our society can learn to stop using butter, it should be able to cut down on cocaine. If it cannot, no prohibition can be effective.''

HEADLINE: Spending Can Be Cut in Half, Former Defense Officials Say

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Laying the foundation for a fundamental political debate, military experts from previous administrations told Congress today that the $300 billion annual Pentagon budget could be safely cut in half over the next decade because of the reduced threat from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
''By such a shift,'' said Robert S. McNamara, Defense Secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, ''we should be able to enhance global stability, strengthen our own security and, at the same time, produce the resources to support a much-needed restructuring of the economy.''
Lawrence J. Korb, an assistant Defense Secretary in Ronald Reagan's first term, agreed with Mr. McNamara's assessment. ''Such a development can have a dramatic impact on our economic well-being and our competitive position in the world,'' he said. 
 
Many Debates Lie Ahead
Mr. McNamara and Mr. Korb testified before the Senate Budget Committee in the first of what is expected to be dozens of Congressional hearings by many different panels over the next year on how to cut the military budget and how to spend the money that is saved.
A debate over how to spend what is being called the ''peace dividend'' is likely to be joined when Congress reconvenes next month. Many lawmakers and lobbyists for social causes dream of a windfall that would allow additional spending for education, drug control, housing and other programs. But economists in and out of the Government caution that the amount of new money available in the first few years will be modest and will be needed to reduce the budget deficit.
The witnesses urged today that Pentagon spending not be cut with a cleaver but rather be reduced gradually and systematically. And Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, warned, ''Those who are looking for an instant pot of gold at the end of the rainbow are going to be disappointed in the short term, for sure.''
 
Great Opportunity Seen
But today's hearing was pervaded by an atmosphere of great opportunity in the years ahead to make basic changes in the way the country spends its resources. Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the budget panel, spoke of ''this unique moment in world history'' and ''the dawn of the primacy of domestic economics.''
Mr. McNamara and Mr. Korb said they were not qualified to address how the billions of dollars saved at the Pentagon should be reallocated, but they had similar ideas on which Pentagon programs to pare. Both suggested average annual spending cuts of about 5 percent, or $15 billion, over the next decade.
Mr. McNamara, who is 73 years old and who writes and speaks widely on military and international affairs, suggested that arms control talks with the Soviet Union could lead eventually to a 50 percent cut in nuclear forces and conventional forces in Europe.
Meantime, he said, the Pentagon should reduce the number of aircraft carriers to 12 from 15 and scrap production of the B-2 bomber and railroad-based MX missile. He urged that work on the Star Wars missile defense system and Midgetman missiles be limited to research. He suggested that plans for the F-14 fighter plane and the Marine Corps' Osprey aircraft, which could take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane, be discontinued, and that the Pentagon be given blanket authority to close domestic and foreign military bases.
 
Buildup But No War
Mr. Korb, who is now director of the Center for Public Policy Education at the Brookings Institution, made similar suggestions. ''You've just had a wartime buildup without a war,'' he said, adding that ''the rush toward modernization of our strategic and conventional forces should be slowed down.''
Mr. Korb suggested that, by the turn of the century, active-duty Army and Air Force strength could be cut by half and active-duty Navy forces by about one-third.
While the hearing was taking place on Capitol Hill, President Bush was meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss the military budget for the next fiscal year.
An Administration official said last week that the President had decided to propose a military budget of $295 billion for fiscal year 1991, which begins next Oct. 1. That is the same as the budget in the current fiscal year, and it would reduce Pentagon purchasing power by 2 percent to 3 percent once inflation is taken into account.
 
Focus on Intelligence Data
At another Congressional hearing, Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for policy planning, confirmed that a new intelligence assessment, in preparation for months, concludes that the United States would have an earlier warning of a Soviet invasion of Europe than had been previously believed. , .
Earlier warnings permit less extensive, and therefore less costly, contingency measures. Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Congressional budget writers had been misled this year because the new intelligence estimate was withheld, perhaps inadvertently. Mr. Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, warned that the Pentagon faced a loss of credibility and deeper budget cuts if Congress felt it was not receiving accurate estimates of the Soviet threat.
Across the Capitol, Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the top Republican on the House Budget Committee, urged his colleagues not to overestimate the immediate effect of reduced military spending on the budget.
''Defense savings will help, but they will be small in the total scheme of fiscal affairs,'' he said.
Most authorities expect Congress to approve about $290 billion in military spending for fiscal year 1991. In the odd way budgets are calculated, that would mean a saving of $10 billion to $15 billion, because the figure is that much less than what would be needed to keep pace with inflation.
However, that is only one-quarter to one-third of the approximately $40 billion that must be cut from the budget deficit to meet the requirements of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law.

HEADLINE: More Pessimistic Dinkins Warns Of Fewer New Programs for City

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins, adopting the fiscal pessimism that a faltering economy has forced upon him, warned New Yorkers yesterday not to expect major increases in city services next year and said, ''Government simply cannot afford to do all that needs to be done.''
Speaking to nearly 1,000 business and civic leaders at a breakfast sponsored by the Association for a Better New York, Mr. Dinkins outlined a much more modest vision than the expansive one he had offered in his campaign.
In his most emphatic statements so far on the need for financial restraint, he echoed similar calls sounded by the Koch administration and a number of business people in recent weeks.
 
'Like to Think That I'm a Realist'
At best, Mr. Dinkins said, the city can strive to do about the same with less. ''We have run smack into a wall at a time when the need to increase services to meet the problems of drug abuse and AIDS, infant mortality and a crumbling infrastructure has never been greater,'' said Mr. Dinkins, who made such causes a centerpiece of his campaign. 
After the speech, Mr. Dinkins was asked if he was a fiscal conservative. He smiled and said: ''It's really a question of the circumstances at the time that one is talking. I don't call myself a fiscal conservative. I would like to think that I'm a realist, however.''
But some city officials said Mr. Dinkins's assessment still seemed too optimistic. Mayor Edward I. Koch, responding to reporters' questions, said that if tax revenues continued to decline, the city could not keep its budget balanced without real spending cuts or tax increases.
''I'll be watching to see how he does this,'' Mr. Koch said at City Hall later in the day.
At the same time, Mr. Koch said of Mr. Dinkins's comment that government could not do everything: ''Doesn't it sound like me? I think so. I wonder if the same people will attack him that attacked me for that statement.''
After his speech, Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that his goals were more modest than those described in his campaign.
''If I had the resources,'' he said, ''then I'd want to see to it that we had drug treatment everywhere, that we had job training for everybody. I'd want to expand the assistance for persons with AIDS and on and on and on. We don't have the ability to do that.'' The speech at the Sheraton Centre in midtown Manhattan was generally a broad appeal to lower expectations.
''The opportunities exist,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''It will take planning and cooperation. It will sometimes require that we sacrifice individual interests for the greater public good.''
Mr. Dinkins noted that the Koch administration has asked city agencies to identify possible savings of 1 percent in the current fiscal year and 4 percent in the year that begins July 1, and that certain agencies have been asked to reduce their capital budgets to hold down debt service. He said ''these tough targets will produce a list of options for us to consider.''
''The current administration is establishing helpful constraints within which we will set our own priorities as the budget process unfolds beyond January,'' he said, making his strongest statement on his intention to hold down spending, even at the expense of new programs he has supported.
 
Less Expansion Planned
Mr. Dinkins took pains to say that he envisioned eliminating planned increases in services, not layoffs or large reductions in existing services. ''Some of the things that a lot of us would like to get done are really expansions,'' he said. ''So the failure to expand in certain areas as opposed to cutting services is what I'm speaking of.''
Mr. Dinkins's acting chief of staff, Barbara J. Fife, said later that his comment about avoiding layoffs applied to the rest of the current fiscal year that ends on June 30. ''We haven't addressed the subsequent fiscal year yet,'' she said.
But Mr. Koch noted that the few discretionary increases in the current budget were for services like the police. ''With respect to enhancements that he would like to use to balance the budget, there aren't really very many,'' Mr. Koch said. ''I mean the enhancements are more cops, more funds for drugs. I doubt that he wants to eliminate those.''
Besides more police officers, Mr. Koch said increases in the work force involve correction officers and child-care workers, whose services are effectively required. ''So I don't see how he could save money by reducing or elimating those positions,'' he said.
The Koch administration has already begun to put in place $530 million in cuts, fee increases, a bond refinancing and other actions to close a budget gap in the current fiscal year, and state officials have predicted additional revenue shortfalls of up to $170 million in the city's $26 billion budget by June.
 
You Have to Say It First
One senior city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the outgoing administration believed real service cuts would be necessary. ''If I were advising him, he's got nothing to lose by the toughest possible talk now,'' the official said. ''If you can't say it, you can't do it.''
In the speech, Mr. Dinkins said: ''We will have to make some very difficult choices as we defer some plans for now. I do expect, however, to make modest but meaningful progress toward meeting challenges such as those presented by drug abuse, AIDS and homelessness. My job over the next four years is to restore our capacity to fully meet the needs of all New Yorkers.
''The key to this effort is our ability to attract and retain businesses, and to maintain a qualified work force,'' he added. ''A strong private sector is the engine that enables us to do that which we must do to serve our citizens.''
While the fiscal problems of the city today are not of the same kind and not as severe as those of the mid 1970's, Mr. Dinkins said, ''to succeed, we must come together as we did 15 years ago with the same spirit of urgency and resolve'' in cooperation between the public and private sectors.
 
Won't Give 'Away the Store'
Mr. Dinkins said the city must work to reduce crime and improve the quality of life, continue to provide low-cost financing for businesses, build affordable housing and fight for its share of state education aid to help finance its programs.
''Some believe that compassion requires giving away the store,'' he said. ''But let me assure you, as the chief executive of New York City, I wll use city funds as investments, and I will apply certain principles to my investment decisions.''
He then outlined five broad goals, pledging to invest money already earmarked for economic development in programs that build businesses and jobs; emphasize preventive programs that save money in the long run; implement the recommendations of a management study conducted for the Koch administration by private business people; seek more state and Federal grants, and show that offering better services can also save money.
For example, Mr. Dinkins said, people with AIDS who no longer need acute care are better served in intermediate care settings, which cost less.

HEADLINE: Beijing View Of the Furor

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 12

 BODY:
President Bush is taking something of a chance in the surprise visit to Beijing over the weekend by a special emissary: that the Chinese leadership will quickly reduce the repression that has followed the crushing of democracy protests in June.
The President's decision to send his National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to Beijing effectively broke his Administration's ban on high-level exchanges with the Chinese, and it has been sharply criticized in Washington as a kowtow to an unrepentant and unappreciative Chinese leadership widely despised for its killings of unarmed demonstrators.
Yet rather than a kowtow, some Western and Asian diplomats here say, the American move is likely to be interpreted by the Chinese as a gesture made from consideration and strength, and which will put the leadership under some obligation to respond to American concerns.
The Chinese are well aware of their unpopularity and isolation in the world, which extends from the West through the rapidly shifting socialist states, whose headlong abandonment of rigorous party control has been criticized by the Chinese. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union is regarded as a dangerous madman by Chinese leaders, who see him as a larger threat to party hegemony in China than any Western influence, diplomats say. 
 
Areas Where Bush Seeks Changes
The East Germans even welcomed the Dalai Lama recently, which is said to have caused near apoplexy here as the Nobel Committee prepared to give its peace prize Sunday to the exiled Tibetan monk for his struggle against Chinese rule.
The Chinese are also aware, that argument goes, that President Bush has received significant criticism for Mr. Scowcroft's visit and is bound to be hit with more as soon as Congress comes back into session. They also know that such criticism, which is founded on human rights, will not easily be stilled by the usual talk about China's importance to the United States for regional stability in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan, Korea and Taiwan.
And they are also cognizant that a true warming of relations and future visits by crucial figures like the Secretary of the Treasury, Nicholas F. Brady, and the Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, let alone by the Vice President or President, will depend on some form of quid-pro-quo response, however indirect, to answer Mr. Bush's requirements and needs.
American influence would also be required to free loans China needs from international agencies like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, or to allow the Chinese to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which Taiwan, its application on hold out of deference to China, is already qualified to join.
 
A More Blunt Washington
Areas where the President would like to see movement by the Chinese include a lifting of martial law, including in Tibet; a halt or at least a reduction in the pace of trials and executions of those who took part in the pro-democracy demonstrations; a return to normal contact with the Western embassies and a reduction of their enforced isolation; a resumption of the normal flow of information into China and of intellectual contacts, and two particularly American concerns: a formal halt in Chinese medium-range missile sales, especially in the Middle East, and a resolution of the problem of Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, leading Chinese dissidents who took refuge in June in the American Embassy and who are subject to arrest.
Geopolitics aside, an improvement in China's deeply tarnished reputation in America and in the West requires such moves, particularly at a time when changes in Moscow make the old arguments that a close relationship with China is vital to restrain an aggressive Soviet Union seem somewhat hollow.
Those issues are said to have been made clear to the Chinese in the weekend meetings, which non-American diplomats take as a sign that Washington is being somewhat more blunt and aggressive with the Chinese, who are in the midst of leadership struggles about the depth and nature of their relationship with the West.
Some Chinese, arguing for a turn away from the West, are comparing foreign influence in China now to the period of the Boxer Rebellion at the turn of the century, when the Empress Dowager, after years of enforcing Western privileges under the unequal treaties, gave her sanction to the cry: ''Destroy the oreigner!'' setting off an international invasion and march on Beijing.
 
Concern Over Tokyo's Reaction
Other diplomats are not so sanguine, however. Some mid-ranking American officials said privately that they were astounded and dismayed by the Scowcroft visit, which was closely held and meant the sudden return of the American Ambassador, James R. Lilley, from home leave.
Some worry that the intended message will not get across to Chinese leaders, or that they will take it as a gesture of Realpolitik-based support, no matter their past actions. Others said they feared that the visit would be taken as a green light by the Japanese to resume business as usual with China, diplomatic and commercial. There is also some concern that the visit will undermine the element in the party struggle that seeks changes, already on the defensive with the removal as party general secretary of Zhao Ziyang, simply by resuming public business with his rival, Prime Minister Li Peng.
There is a wide acceptance of the dictum of China scholar Jonathan D. Spence that outsiders cannot change China. But it is in the nature of American diplomacy to believe that China can, nevertheless, be influenced. President Bush, who feels he knows China after serving as an envoy here, has taken his gamble. But no one seems very clear about whether it will be a success.

HEADLINE: Thatcher Defends Refugee Policy

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today that forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong would continue, to deter other Vietnamese from fleeing to the colony in the hope of making their way to the West.
Mrs. Thatcher defended the Government policy in the face of criticism from abroad and discomfort at home after the first refugees were expelled under her policy yesterday. She was joined by her Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd. 
 
Lull Is Temporary
While Mr. Hurd said there would be no more deportations until the House of Commons held a major debate on the issue next Tuesday, he made it clear the lull was temporary. Indeed, he indicated that the Government was eager to talk with Vietnam about ways to return people at a faster rate.
Mr. Hurd stressed that the 51 people flown to Hanoi today did not qualify as refugees under international agreements. About 4,000 of the 57,000 Vietnames in detention camps on Hong Kong have already been through a screening and appeals process and are awaiting involuntary repatriation. Ultimately, as many as 40,000 of the 57,000 are expected to be deported.
''Illegal immigrants have to be returned to their country of origin,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a debate in the House of Commons. She added that the people of densely populated Hong Kong could not cope with the flood and were ''suffering greatly.'' Other British officials added that overcrowding in the detention camps had to be relieved.
The Government also came under attack from human rights groups like Amnesty International, which questioned the adequacy of the screening that determined which Vietnamese were really refugees who had fled their country for fear of persecution.
But in general, Mr. Hurd and Mrs. Thatcher shrugged off criticism. Other Western countries were unwilling to take the Vietnamese, and a nearly yearlong effort to persuade them to return voluntarily failed.
In the debate in Parliament, several politicians lashed out against the United States. Its war with Vietnam had played a big role in creating the economic misery behind the boat people crisis, and its hard-line policy against Vietnam since the war had only added to the misery, they said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Plans Summit Talks on Saving Children

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 12

 BODY:
A ''world summit for children'' is being planned here next September to mobilize money and resources to save the lives of 50 million children, who the authorities predict would otherwise die in the next decade.
The gathering has been scheduled for Sept. 26 and 27, and timed to coincide with the opening of the 1990 United Nations General Assembly, when world leaders traditionally gather in New York.
James P. Grant, the executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, known as Unicef, said in a recent interview that between 40 and 60 heads of state or government are likely to attend the session. He said invitations to the meeting would be issued later this month by leaders of Canada, Egypt, Mali, Mexico, Pakistan and Sweden, the sponsors. 
''This will be the first ever North-South-East-West Summit,'' Mr. Grant, said, adding that both President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev were expected to take part.
Mr. Grant said the goal of the meeting would be to obtain a top-level political commitment to save children in the 1990's, particularly through the redirection of military and defense savings resulting from the easing of East-West tensions and the winding down of regional conflicts.
In its annual report today, Unicef says that spending an additional $2.5 billion a year on proven health maintenance techniques would save the lives of 50 million more children under the age of 5 in the 1990's.
This would reduce the number of children dying each year from preventable diseases from some 14.5 million at present to about 8 million by the year 2000, the report says.
Unicef says that such a sum of money, while large, equals only 2.5 percent of the roughly $145 billion spent by developing countries on armaments each year and is equivalent to what the American tobacco industry spends each year advertising cigarettes.
Welcoming the meeting, Representative Tony P. Hall of Ohio, the chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Hunger, said today that it ''will focus on the most solvable of the world's problems. The rewards from a sucessful summit would be tremendous.''
Mr. Grant defended his goal of saving 50 million children's lives in the 1990's as technically feasible through inexpensive modern techniques to fight dysentry, diptheria and other diseases that are the main killers of young children in the developing world.
But he also argued that current efforts to stabilize world population and reduce human pressure on its resources would not suceed until infant mortality rates fall further in the developing world and parents are assured that their children will survive.
''Reducing infant mortality rates in the last decade of this century will produce lower rates of population growth in the next,'' Mr Grant said.
In its survey, titled ''The State of the World's Children,'' Unicef says governments of the developing world are now devoting half their annual resources to military spending and the servicing of foreign debts.
The report says that as a result the condition of children is deteriorating throughout the developing world as living standards fall and governments cut back on social spending in an attempt to make their economies more efficent at the urging of aid donors and international financial institutions like the World Bank.
In the world's 37 poorest countries, the report says, spending on education has declined by about 25 percent in the last decade.
Unicef also says the position of poor children is deteriorating in both the United States and Britain, despite a decade of steady economic growth. The number of homeless families is rising in both countries while in the United States the number of children living in poverty has risen by 3 million in the last 10 years, from 11 percent of the child population to over 15 percent today. In New York City, 40 percent of the children were found living in poverty.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Excerpts From Baker's Speech on Berlin and U.S. Role in Europe's Future

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the speech today by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d at the Berlin Press Club, as provided by the Federal News Service:
It is a great honor for an American to speak at this time in this city. For me and for millions of my fellow citizens, Berlin is the crucible of half a century of history.
Here we have seen clearly what elsewhere hid in shadows.
Here the ambiguous disclosed its true nature.
Here we made the choices and took the stands that shaped today's world. 
In 1945, pictures of a bombed-out Berlin brought home to us the terrible cost of war.
In 1948, the Soviet Union stalked out of the Four Power Control Commission and blockaded Berlin - the clear declaration of cold war.
In 1953, Berliners staged the first popular revolt against Soviet tyranny in Eastern Europe.
In 1961, the Berin Wall closed the last escape hatch from the prison camp of nations which Eastern Europe had become.
In 1971, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin epitomized the terrible dilemma of detente - the proposition that cooperation between East and West assumed the continued division of this continent.
Then in 1989, the most important event - certainly the most dramatic - of the postwar era occurred, right here in Berin. Eastern Europe: Berlin's Vital Role On Nov. 9, the wall became a gateway. Berliners celebrated history's largest, happiest family reunion. And all of us who watched these scenes felt, once again: We are all Berliners.
Once more images from Berlin flashed around the world, images that again heralded a new reality. This new reality has its roots in those older Berlin scenes - the scenes of West Berlin's dramatic postwar reconstruction; the scenes of Allied aircraft supplying a blockaded city; the scenes of American and Soviet tanks facing off at Checkpoint Charlie.
By standing together, in Berlin as elsewhere, Western nations created the essential preconditions for overcoming the divisions of this city, of this nation, and of this continent.
As these recent events have unfolded, the Soviet Union has shown a remarkable degree of realism. And President Gorbachev deserves credit for being the first Soviet leader to have the courage and foresight to permit the lifting of repression in Eastern Europe.
But the real impulse for change comes from an altogether different source: the peoples of Poland, of Hungary, of Czechoslovakia, of Bulgaria, and of East Germany. They have freed themselves. From the Baltic to the Adriatic, an irresistible movement has gathered force - a movement of, by, and for the people. In their peaceful urgent multitude, the peoples of Eastern Europe have held up a mirror to the West and have reflected the enduring power of our own best values. In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the first American Secretary of State, nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. ... Free Governments: Planning the Future Now, as President Bush stated last week, the task before us is to consolidate the fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the architecture for continued peaceful change.
The first step is for free men and women to create free governments. The path may appear difficult, even confusing, but we must travel it with understanding. For true stability requires governments with legitimacy, governments that are based on the consent of the governed.
The peoples of Eastern Europe are trying to build such governments. Our view, as President Bush has told President Gorbachev, is that the political and economic reforms in the East can enhance both long-term stability in Europe and the prospects for perestroika. A legitimate and stable European order will help, not threaten, legitimate Soviet interests. An illegitimate order will provide no order at all.
Free men, free governments, are the building blocks of a Europe whole and free. But hopes for a Europe whole and free are tinged with concern by some that a Europe undivided may not necessarily be a Europe peaceful and prosperous. Many of theguideposts that brought us securely through four sometimes tense and threatening decades are now coming down. Some of the divisive issues that once brought conflict to Europe are re-emerging.
As Europe changes, the instruments for Western cooperation must adapt. Working together, we must design and gradually put into place a new architecture for a new era.
This new architecture must have a place for old foundations and structures that remain valuable - like NATO - while recognizing that they can also serve new collective purposes. The new architecture must continue the construction of institutions - like the E.C. - that can help draw together the West while also serving as an open door to the East. And the new architecture must build up frameworks . . . that can overcome the division of Europe and bridge the Atlantic Ocean.
This new structure must also accomplish two special purposes. First, as a part of overcoming the division of Europe, there must be an opportunity to overcome through peace and freedom the division of Berlin and of Germany. The United States and NATO have stood for unification for 40 years, and we will not waver from that goal.
Second, the architecture should reflect that America's security - politically, militarily, and economically -remains linked to Europe's security. The United States and Canada share Europe's neighborhood.
As President Bush stated in May, the United States is and will remain a European power. And as he added last week, the U.S. will maintain significant military forces in Europe as long as our allies desire our presence as part of a common security effort. This is our commitment to a common future, a recognition of a need for an active United States role in Europe, a need even acknowledged by President Gorbachev. ... Arms Pacts and Peace: Conventional Forces In May of this year, President Bush suggested to his NATO colleagues that it was time to begin considering new missions for NATO.
For over 40 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has secured peace in Europe through both deterrence and dialogue with the East. Today, NATO is working in Vienna to build a new security structure for Europe, one in which the military component is reduced and the political is enhanced. This is NATO's first new mission.
A conventional forces agreement is the keystone of this new security structure. In May, NATO adopted President Bush's suggestion to seek such an agreement on an accelerated timetable. President Gorbachev has responded to this opportunity positively. And we have moved significantly closer to concluding an agreement limiting conventional armaments from the Atlantic to the Urals. ...
Today, I further propose that the Ministers of the 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact nations take advantage of our February meeting in Ottawa . . . to review the status and give a further push to the Vienna Talks on Conventional Forces.
As we construct a new security architecture that maintains the common defense, the non-military component of European security will grow. Arms-control agreements, confidence-building measures and other political consultative arrangements will become more important. . . . NATO will become the forum where Western nations cooperate to negotiate, implement, verify and extend agreements between East and West.
In this context, the implementation and verification monitoring of a conventional-forces agreement will present a major challenge for enduring security. . . .
I therefore invite allied governments to consider establishing a NATO Arms Control Verification Staff. Verification will remain a national responsibility. But such a new staff would be able to assist member governments in monitoring compliance with arms-control and confidence-building measures in Europe. . . .
As the East-West confrontation recedes, and as the prospects for East-West cooperation advance, other challenges for European and Atlantic security will arise. They point to NATO's second new mission. Regional conflicts - along with the proliferation of missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons -present growing dangers. Intensified NATO consultations on these issues can play an important role in forming common Western approaches to these various threats.
Third, NATO should also begin considering further initiatives the West might take . . . to build economic and political ties with the East, to promote respect for human rights, to help build democratic institutions, and to fashion, consistent with Western security interests, a more open environment for East-West trade and investment.
Finally, NATO may have its greatest and most lasting effect on the pattern of change by demonstrating to the nations of the East a fundamentally different approach to security. . . . The reconciliation of ancient enemies, which has taken place under the umbrella of NATO's collective security, offers the nations of Eastern Europe an appealing model of international relations. ... Role of European Community The future development of the European Community will play a central role in shaping the New Europe.
The example of Western cooperation through the European Community has already had a dramatic effect on Eastern attitudes toward economic liberty. The success of this great European experiment, perhaps more than any other factor, has caused Eastern Europeans to recognize that people as well as nations cooperate more productively when they are free to choose. The ballot box and the free market are the fundamental instruments of choice.
But the European experiment has succeeded not just because it has appealed to the enlightened self-interest of European producers and consumers. This experiment has succeeded because the vision of its founders encompassed and yet transcended the material. This experiment has succeeded because it also held out the higher goal of political as well as economic barriers overcome, of a Europe united. ...
As Europe moves toward its goal of a common internal market, and as its institutions for political and security cooperation evolve, the link between the United States and the European Community will become even more important. We want our trans-Atlantic cooperation to keep pace with European integration and institutional reform.
To this end, we propose that the United States and the European Community work together to achieve, whether in treaty or some other form, a significantly strengthened set of institutional and consultative links. ...
We suggest that our discussions about this idea proceed in parallel with Europe's efforts to achieve by 1992 a common internal market so that plans for U.S.-E.C. interaction would evolve with changes in the community.
The United States also encourages the European Community to continue and expand cooperation with the nations of the East. The promotion of political and economic reform in the East is a natural vocation for the European Community. That is why we were exceptionally pleased with the agreement at the Paris Economic Summit that the European Commission should assume a special role in the Group of 24 effort to promote reform in Poland and Hungary. ..
I am confident that creative new arrangements can be devised to encourage and sustain the process of political and economic reform in the countries of Eastern Europe, while at the same time preserving the integrity and the vitality of existing institutions. We need to offer the nations of the East hope, opportunities that can be seized as they take steps toward democracy and economic liberty. . . .
We see no conflict between the process of European integration and an expansion of cooperation between the European Community and its neighbors to the East and West. Indeed, we believe that the attraction of the European Community for the countries of the East depends most on its continued vitality. And the vitality of the Economic Community depends in turn on its continued commitment to the goal of a united Europe envisaged by its founders - free, democratic and closely linked to its North American partners. ... Germany and Berlin In a New Europe A new Europe, whole and free, must include arrangements that satisfy the aspirations of the German people and meet the legitimate concerns of Germany's neighbors. . . . At last week's NATO summit, President Bush reaffirmed America's long-standing support for the goal of German unification. He enunciated four principles that guide our policy. ...
One, self-determination must be pursued without prejudice to its outcome. We should not at this time endorse nor exclude any particular vision of unity.
Two, unification should occur in the context of Germany's continued commitment to NATO and an increasingly integrated European Community, and with due regard for the legal role and responsibilities of the Allied powers.
Three, in the interests of general European stability, moves toward unification must be peaceful, gradual, and part of a step-by-step process.
Four, on the question of borders, we should reiterate our support for the principles of the Helsinki Final Act.
President Bush concluded that an end to the unnatural division of Europe, and of Germany, must proceed in acordance with and be based upon the values that are becoming universal ideals, as all the countries of Europe become part of a commonwealth of free nations.

HEADLINE: Full Slow Ahead in Germany

 BODY:
''Wir sind ein Volk,'' proclaim the Christian Democratic party posters suddenly evident in Bonn: ''We are one people.'' That sentiment is so powerful that few West German politicians can resist it. But one people is not the same as one economy or one state. Once the rush of sentiment subsides, it will take time to work out the economic and political differences between the two Germanys. And the architects of a new international structure that can accommodate one Germany will need at least as much time. 
Gaining the needed time may not be easy, especially if East Germans are impatient. But there may be no more important task for statesmen on both sides of the Berlin wall. That's why it is so welcome that Chancellor Kohl of West Germany has slowed his rush to proclaim confederation, and that Secretary of State Baker has now spelled out America's reasons for Germany to proceed gradually.
How much time is there to manage the unification process? It is likely that economic differences will set the pace. West Germany's high standard of living draws East Germans west, but many still want the security of their Socialist safety net. With open borders, Bonn expects a large influx of East Germans eager for the better things in life, unless it does something now to encourage them to stay home. It intends to provide more subsidies.
They will be wasted, however, unless economic differences can be bridged. East Germans will have to decide what kind of economy they want. Opposition groups are eager to try democratic socialism, a mixture of Western-style markets and Eastern-style social welfare. Others will urge unification as the only way up the economic ladder.
Instead of facing up to these economic imperatives, Chancellor Kohl last week chilled East and West with a 10-point reunification plan. He included no timetable but seemed eager. He spoke of confederation, an idea that would doom two German states - and doom their continued membership in the separate NATO and Warsaw Pact alliances. That membership is necessary to reassure East and West during a time of transition.
What did Mr. Kohl have in mind? Domestic politics, it now appears. In a hurry to catch the tide of German sentiment, he consulted with no one outside West Germany, or even outside his party. That's why there is worldwide relief over his clarification backtracking on confederation. ''I am consciously not talking about confederation,'' he now says. ''Such a step raises questions we cannot answer today because of the fact that the two states in Germany belong to different alliances.''
Mr. Baker pointedly reminded Bonn that the Four Powers have authority in Berlin, and over unification. Even so, even if every government, East and West, concurred, the most important variable in reunification may still be the East Germans. At the moment they are angry, and small wonder. They have just learned about the excesses of the kleptocracy that ruled from elaborate villas. Their thirst for vengeance could breed violence.
The very volatility of their passions makes even clearer the need for everyone involved, in Germany and out, to work for gradual, orderly unification.

HEADLINE: No One Can Control Runaway Medical Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It has been several years since the diagnosis related group, or D.R.G., system of fixed reimbursement to hospitals began, and now Congress is contemplating an expenditure target plan to control physicians' fees within the Medicare program.
The basic mechanism of expenditure targets (E.T.'s) will place a ceiling on the money spent on a specific operation or procedure annually. Should the expenditures for a procedure exceed the guideline, the payment for each procedure would be lowered in the following year to remain within the limit. Both the D.R.G. and E.T. programs have meritorious aspects. But just as medical expenditures have risen rapidly despite D.R.G.'s, so the new system will not solve the problem. 
''The Limits of Medicare'' (editorial, Nov. 27), which supports the new plan's effort to control the problem, loses sight of the hidden weakness that will make it fail, just as previous efforts failed. Such commentaries generally desire that the American Medical Association and local peer review panels will discipline the medical community to control abuse.
Will it be the A.M.A., which has fought Dr. Arnold Relman's efforts to limit physician ownership of facilities that provide such expensive ancillary services as CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging? Dr. Relman's attempt to show the conflict of interest when physicians send patients to the establishments they own falls on deaf ears at the A.M.A.
Is the leadership to come from physicians who deliver without Caesarean section the babies of only some 10 percent of patients with previous Caesarean sections, although the evidence is clear that 60 percent to 70 percent of those women could safely deliver vaginally?
Will it come from a medical establishment that knows many hysterectomies, prostatectomies, bypass surgery and other operations are not necessary, but makes almost no effort to change the situation?
Is it to be in an environment that has almost excluded the time-honored morbidity and mortality conferences in which physicians, primarily pathologists, challenged other doctors to explain their actions?
In defense of the medical community, will it be young physicians who enter the ranks of private medical care with high ideals and high standards only to find themselves in an economic quagmire? With massive overhead expenditures in a highly competitive market, high standards begin to develop shades of gray when patients are seen that might be managed conservatively or by some immediate operative procedure.
The outcome of the expenditure target system will be the reverse of what the A.M.A. has stated. Physicians will not do fewer procedures because of lower reimbursement. Unethical physicians will do as they have done in the past. More unnecessary procedures will be done at a lower fee.
Thirty-seven million people receive no basic medical services, including prenatal care. As the costs keep rising, more and more people are likely to fall out of the economic safety net necessary to obtain services.
The ethical forces in the medical establishment are unwilling to take real action, and Congress appears unable to face the problem.
Medicine today is like a lifeboat sinking under the weight of a massively burgeoning budget. To stay afloat, we throw overboard the more than 37 million who cannot afford to pay.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Puts Off Final Vote on Toll Rises

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Under a barrage of public criticism and a threatened veto by Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has put off final action on a sweeping increase in bridge and tunnel tolls and the PATH train fare.
''It's on hold,'' a spokesman for Stephen Berger, the executive director of the Port Authority, said yesterday.
The 12-member Port Authority board was to have voted on the proposal tomorrow. But on Monday, the board chairman, Philip D. Kaltenbacher, told his colleagues that the toll and fare increases - along with the rest of the $2.9 billion budget for 1990 - had been taken off the agenda. 
He said the board wanted to give Governor Kean, Governor-elect James J. Florio of New Jersey and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York ''an opportunity to review further the facts and figures and alternatives.''
 
Florio Opposes Quick Vote
On Dec. 1, Mr. Berger announced that he would ask the Port Authority board to approve a $1 increase, to $4, in the $3 round-trip bridge and tunnel tolls, effective April 1. Also, the one-way PATH rail fare, now $1, would rise to $1.25 on December 16, 1990.
The postponement is for at least four weeks. By the next scheduled board meeting, on Jan. 11, Governor Kean's successor, Mr. Florio, will have been in office for five working days. Mr. Florio cautioned the board yesterday against voting on the toll and fare increase on Jan. 11.
''If it's going to happen on my watch,'' he said, ''I expect to be thoroughly informed so I can make a rational, balanced decision.''
''The options are more than just approve or disapprove,'' Mr. Florio added. ''It is also possible to suggest modifications.''
 
Kean 'Not Satisfied'
A spokesman for Governor Kean, calling the postponement of the vote ''appropriate,'' reiterated that Mr. Kean was ''not satisfied that the increase is justified.''
''He wants the same kind of detailed economic analysis that was offered in 1987,'' when Governors Kean and Cuomo approved the last increase, the spokesman, Carl R. Golden, said.
Mr. Berger's surprise announcement that he would seek the increases startled and angered many commuters. At the time of the 1987 rise, the Port Authority assured the Governors that no new increases would be needed until mid-1991 at the earliest.
Mr. Berger has said that an increase is needed now because of reduced revenues caused by a regional economic slump, rising costs, and a major refurbishment of Port Authority properties.
Mr. Cuomo's role in the postponement of the vote was not clear. Late yesterday, he issued a one-sentence statement in Albany that ''we agree that it was appropriate to withdraw the request and ask for additional information.''
The postponement is the second time in less than two weeks that a public transportation authority in the metropolitan region has bowed to public and political pressure over the issue of fares and tolls.
 
Friday Vote on Transit Fares
On Dec. 2, the New York City Transit Authority dropped a proposed 25-cent fare increase over the $1 bus and subway fare and said it would seek a 15-cent increase instead.
On Friday, the Transit Authority's parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is to vote on the revised bus and subway proposal. It will also vote on a proposed $4.60 fare for express buses - now $3.50 - and increases averaging 25 percent on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and Long Island Rail Road.
On Nov. 30, the Taxi and Limousine Commission approved an 11.5 percent increase in yellow cab fares.
In July, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, an M.T.A. agency, imposed a 25 percent toll increase for its six major bridges and two tunnels.
 
Either Governor May Veto
The Governors of New York and New Jersey have the right to veto any Port Authority board decision within 10 working days.
Mr. Kean's spokesman insisted that the Governor's desire to put off the vote pending receipt of more extensive figures was not designed to leave the decision up to his successor, Mr. Florio.
''It's not a factor at all,'' Mr. Golden said, noting that Governor Kean had approved two earlier increases. ''In 1987, the toll and fare increase was accompanied by a very detailed analysis by an outside agency. The Port Authority's latest proposal did not have that kind of information.''
Under Mr. Berger's proposal, round-trip tolls would go up on the George Washington, Bayonne and Goethals Bridges, the Outerbridge Crossing and the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels.
The new PATH fare would increase to $1.25 from $1, while discounts would be offered for the elderly and those buying multitrip tickets.

College Graduates Facing More Money and Fewer Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EAST LANSING, Mich., Dec. 12

 BODY:
College graduates next spring will earn more money but find fewer job opportunities, a survey of United States employers indicates.
Hiring will be down 13.3 percent compared to last year, according to the 19th annual survey by the University of Michigan's Career Development and Placement Services office.
The average starting salary for a graduate with a bachelor's degree will be $25,256, up 3.3 percent from a year ago. The expected starting salary for those with master's degrees in business administration will be $39,840, a 3.1 percent increase. Generally starting salaries will be $33,740 for master's degree graduates, up 3.3 percent, and $37,111 for graduates with doctoral degrees, a 2.4 percent increase. 
As in recent years, engineering majors will get the highest starting salaries for new college graduates, with chemical engineering leading the way at $33,380. Mechanical engineering ranks second at $32,256, while electrical engineering is at $32,107, followed by computer science at $31,389 and industrial engineering at $30,557.
 
Lowest Starting Salaries
The lowest starting salaries will be for graduates in human ecology-home economics, $18,157; journalism, $18,255; natural resources, $18,840; retailing, $18,909, and advertising, $19,662.
The survey released Sunday was based on responses from 479 employers in business, industry, government and educational institutions.
Patrick Scheetz, who directed the study, said reasons for the drop in planned hiring included limited growth in new business; mergers and buyouts; increased global competition, and slow turnover of current employees.
Industries that are expected to have large increases in hiring include public utilities, up 29.4 percent; metal products, up 24.2 percent; petroleum, 22.1 percent; construction and building materials manufacturing, 19.3 percent; and printing, publishing and informational services, 13.7 percent.
Those expected to have decreases included automotive and mechanical equipment, down 58 percent; electronics, 24.5 percent; government administration, 20.9 percent; aerospace, 20 percent; the military, 16.8 percent; and diversified conglomerates, 13.7 percent.
The survey also found that the greatest job opportunities are in the Southwest. Next best is the Northeast, followed by the Southeast, North-Central, South-Central and Northwest states.
In addition it found that employers requiring drug testing of new college graduates rose to 47 percent of those surveyed, up from 32 percent last year and 27 percent the year before. Testing for alcohol was required by 25 percent of those surveyed, up from 14 percent. Testing for AIDS was required by 4 percent of employers, a slight increase of 3 percent for the 1988-89 graduates.

BYLINE: By Edward B. Fiske

 BODY:
In Dylan Thomas's ''Child's Christmas in Wales,'' the poet recalls the ''useless presents'' that he and other youngsters used to receive, like books that ''told me everything about the wasp except why.''
The ''why'' question was one that came to mind frequently on Thursday, when representatives of the National Governors' Association and the White House gathered at a hotel in Washington to hear testimony on setting national goals for education.
High government officials in the United States do not usually sit around tables hammering out such goals in agriculture, commerce or other areas of national life. Why education? And suppose - as is likely - they do come up with a set of goals suitable for framing or putting on bumper stickers. What do they do with them? 
The governors' motivation can be explained pretty simply. They are scared to death about the quality of schools.
Like everyone else, they read those international studies showing that millions of American college students would have a tough time graduating from high school in Japan or West Germany. Unlike everyone else, governors are regularly reminded of the importance of good schools, not only for attracting business, but also for holding down the cost of social services.
Studies of preschool programs in this country and Europe have consistently found that money invested in early childhood education is returned many times over in the form of less need down the road for remedial teaching, law enforcement and health care.
''The governors realize that businesses in their states can't compete with low wages alone anymore,'' the education aide to the governors' association, Michael Cohen, said. ''You have to have a quality work force.''
For four years the association has been pushing an ambitious agenda of change, recommending, for example, that schools be given more autonomy in the way they are managed and parents more discretion in selecting their children's schools.
The governors' efforts received a boost when President Bush assembled them for an ''education summit'' in Charlottesville, Va., in September. Out of that came the Governors' Task Force on Education, with a mandate to formulate a set of national goals for education by February.
The hearings last week, the first public follow-up to the summit, gave groups like the Children's Defense Fund and the National School Boards Association a chance to contribute their views.
Chester E. Finn Jr., who headed educational research for the Reagan Administration, ruffled some feathers by telling the panel that -presumably excluding himself -they were listening to the wrong people. ''These people are the blob, the ones who gave you schools the way they are now,'' he said.
But a Presidential assistant for economic and domestic affairs, Roger Porter, came back with a plea for cooperation among parents, educators, business people and others, and ''a lot less finger pointing.'' And indeed, there was at least the appearance of consensus.
The expressed differences of opinion seemed to be more technical than philosophical. Not surprisingly, the politicians spoke more eloquently about measuring educational results than did practitioners like teachers and superintendents. When it came to the well-supported goal of assuring that every child is prepared for school, the governors seemed to be thinking in more ambitious terms than the White House. ''To the governors, readiness for school means physically healthy, not just intellectually prepared,'' said a staff aide.
The panel seems well on track to produce its list of goals. But how are they to be carried out? Frequent comparisons were made with John F. Kennedy's commitment to put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960's, a pledge that was made long before anyone knew how to pull that off. But that analogy only goes so far.
''Kennedy had a structure in place to do the job, and it was a Federal structure,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''We're talking about changing the behavior of people in a highly decentralized system.''
One obvious possibility is the issuing of an annual national report card showing how well schools are doing in relation to whatever goals are set. The problem here is that the technical means for measuring outcomes, like whether children can reason in a sophisticated manner, are still in the embryonic stage.
The president of the National Center for Education and the Economy, Marc Tucker, urged the panel to set up a ''quasigovernmental authority'' to keep the goals in the limelight and to refine and update them regularly. He also called for a national school-leaving examination that students would be required to pass to obtain a high school diploma. ''The trick is to create incentives to meet whatever goals are set,'' he said.
For the moment, though, the governors and the White House representatives have pointedly shelved the ''what next'' questions, figuring that they are akin to explaining why wasps.

HEADLINE: 18 Nations Ban Steel Subsidies

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The Bush Administration announced today that countries that provide two-thirds of the steel imported into America had signed agreements to end Government subsidies like low-cost loans and export incentive payments that help their steelmakers.
S. Linn Williams, the deputy United States trade representative, called the accords ''historic.'' He said it was the first time that any country had agreed with any other country to limit domestic subsidies.
The pacts were disclosed in connection with a two-and-one-half year renewal of an import quota program that keeps steel from signatory countries below 20 percent of that sold in the United States. They are the first steps in an ambitious Administration effort to negotiate a global prohibition on Government aid to all industries under the so-called Uruguay Round. The Uruguay Round trade talks with more than 100 countries began in 1986 and will end next December. 
 
Long-Standing Grievance
Myriad subsidies of products entering the United States are a long-standing grievance of American business, which welcomed today's accords.
The pacts with the 12-nation European Community and six other countries - Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Trinidad and Tobago - include commitments to prohibit subsidies for steel production, as well as to keep markets open for steel.
They also incorporate a mechanism for binding arbitration. Countries that violate the agreements face the threat of having their steel shipments to the United States reduced under the quota program. #1992 Expiration Date The agreements and the quota program itself expire on March 31, 1992, but the United States hopes by then to have the major provisions incorporated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's free-trade charter, as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations.
''We believe that these agreements will be the building blocks for progress in the round on eliminating trade-distorting subsidies and opening markets,'' Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said in a statement distributed as she was leaving for a series of meetings in Europe.
Foreign governments were willing to sign the accords because of a growing sensitivity to the rising cost of taxpayer support of industry. Ella Krucoff, an official at the European Community office in Washington, said that the community had had restrictions on steel aid in place since 1985 and that the new agreement ''goes along very well'' with these curbs.
For Brazil, Mexico and other developing countries, a cut in subsidies is a key element of programs of economic adjustment worked out with the International Monetary Fund.
Rejecting the American steel industry's demand that import quota protection be extended for five more years, the Bush Administration last July announced that the program would be terminated in two and one-half years, but that it would seek the subsidy-banning accords.
The Administration is continuing to negotiate with three more countries, Austria, Finland and Yugoslavia.
 
'Additional Discipline' Seen
The American Iron and Steel Institute, representing 25 of the biggest integrated steelmakers, said it was still worried that import market shares could rise sharply after March 1992, when the quotas are removed, but added that the pacts announced today should bring ''additional discipline'' over foreign steel subsidies.
The big steel companies are expected to monitor the agreements closely and bring violations to the attention of American trade officials.
The agreements ''are solid first steps toward market-oriented trade based upon enforceable commitments to eliminate steel subsidies and to open markets,'' said Frank R. Corral, chairman of the Steel Manufacturers Association, representing smaller, more specialized producers, known as minimills.
Jack Andresen, staff director of the House Congressional Steel Caucus, said he thought that ''pursuit of the international consensus is admirable, and hopefully they will create a level playing field for steel.''
 
Level Put at 19.1 Percent
Under the new quotas, the European Community and 16 countries have agreed to an overall restraint level of 19.1 percent of the domestic market. Countries that have not signed restraint agreements account for an additional 4.5 percent of the domestic market, based on 1989 import figures.
Under the first five years of the quota agreement, 17 countries and the European Community were held to 18.36 percent of the United States market. South Africa is the only country in the original quota group that did not negotiate a new restraint arrangement.
Of the quota countries, Japan is the big loser. It had been given 6.19 percent of the American market in the first five years. For the first 15 months of the new agreement its share is 5 percent. This will rise to 5.3 percent in the second 15 months.
Each percentage point is worth nearly one million tons of steel. 18 Million Tons in 1991 About 17 million tons of steel over all will be permitted into the United States next year under the new arrangement, rising to about 18 million tons in 1991.

Buyout Fever: The Patient Lives

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WITH Michael Milken under indictment and the market for ''junk bonds'' under water, ''leverage'' has become a four-letter word. Corporate buyouts constructed on pyramids of debt, goes the conventional wisdom, have weakened once mighty industries and deprived Washington of billions in corporate income taxes.
The latter charge seems on target: Interest payments to banks and bondholders, unlike dividends to stockholders, are tax-free to corporations. But the idea that leverage inevitably transforms aggressive, innovative companies into myopic, cash-starved basket cases is far from obvious. 
Much publicized failures, like Southland and Revco, have been matched by much publicized successes, like Metromedia and Safeway. That is why a new study by Frank Lichtenberg of Columbia University and Donald Siegel of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I., is so significant.
Using Census Bureau data from hundreds of plants, they measured the impact of leveraged buyouts on what many economists believe is the best gauge of efficiency. And strikingly, leveraged buyouts come out smelling like roses.
Leveraged buyouts, in which investor groups purchase companies with borrowed money, can sometimes be the cure for all that ails. A buyout narrows the division of interest between managers and owners, increasing executives' personal incentives for strong performance, typically stock options. Correspondingly, the penalties for failure, bankruptcy, or at very least, loss of managerial control, are also increased.
On the other hand, the big debts incurred to banks and bondholders narrow managers' margin for error - or bad luck. And that may force companies to cut back on research, to skimp on maintenance, or to sell off promising operations that suffer from an anemic cash flow.
Mr. Lichtenberg and Mr. Siegel measured what happened to some 1,100 manufacturing plants involved in leveraged buyouts worth $35 million and more between 1981 and 1986. And they compared the results with what happened to some 20,000 plants not involved in leveraged buyouts. The benchmark for comparison was ''total factor productivity'' - output divided by an index of the labor, capital and materials used in production.
On average, the rate of productivity change over the five-year span was 14 percent higher in the newly leveraged plants than in plants in the same industry that were not involved in leveraged buyouts. And where the managers themselves bought out the stockholders, the difference in productivity growth was even greater - 20 percent.
These figures should not come as a great surprise to those who see leveraged buyouts as an excuse to extort more effort for less money from line workers by threatening to close or sell off divisions. But according to the study, savings in labor have come at the expense of middle managers. On average, both hourly wages and total hours on the job increased after a company was bought out.
The record on research outlays holds similar surprises. Cash poor, the manager of a leveraged buyout has an incentive to risk the company's long-term prospects by cutting back on projects with a distant productivity payoff. But Mr. Lichtenberg and Mr. Siegel's findings suggest that the increased need for income is more than offset by a privately held company's discretion to plan beyond next quarter's earnings report.
Research and development spending as a percentage of company sales, they discovered, rose faster for the buyout companies than for others. So, too, did the proportion of engineers and scientists to the company's total labor force.
Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, points out an important qualification. The plants studied were involved in leveraged buyouts before 1987 - before investment bankers seeking BMW's had spread leveraged buyout fever to every nook and cranny of corporate America. It is possible, even likely, that the percentage of successes in the first wave of buyouts will not be matched by more recent ventures.
Still, the Lichtenberg-Siegel study is dramatically changing the character of the scholarly debate over leveraged buyouts.
Everyone agrees that stockholders have benefited from buyouts, realizing the full value, or more, from their assets. And everyone agrees that some people have lost jobs and Washington has lost tax revenue in subsequent asset shuffles. But this is the first attempt to measure the overall effect of leveraged buyouts on current and future productivity. And it represents a big victory for those inclined to give the benefit of a doubt to any market transaction between consenting adults.

Purchasers See Slower Growth

 BODY:
The association of the nation's purchasing managers has predicted that the United States will avert a recession in 1990, but that growth will be only moderate.
In its semiannual forecast, the National Association of Purchasing Management said economic growth would be weak in the first half of next year and then pick up. 
The purchasing executives also expressed widespread uncertainty about the economy, with the principal worry being the threat of recession or a severely slowing economy.
''There will be weakness in almost all the industries related to automobiles, and that includes steel, tires, plastics and electronics,'' Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of materials management for Pitney Bowes Inc., said at a news conference in New York. ''Also, housing-related industries will show some weakness next year, including lumber.'' Growth is expected in chemicals, pharmacueticals, food and beverages and paper, Mr. Bretz added.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar at a One-Year Low Against a Soaring Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
West Germany's mark dominated foreign exchange trading yesterday, strengthening on firm interest rates in that country and talk of a reunified Germany that helped sharply depress the dollar and other currencies.
In both New York and Europe, the dollar hit the lowest level since December 1988 against the mark, traders said. The dollar was quoted in London at 1.7335 marks, off from 1.7660 marks late Monday, and in New York at 1.73225 marks, down from 1.7610.
''The scenario here is that interest rates in Germany will stay firm, while United States rates are trending down because the economy is slowing,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a currency trader at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. ''It's not so much the dollar's weakness as it is the mark's strength. The mark is the place to be right now.''
The mark has risen sharply in recent weeks amid rapid political and economic changes in East Germany. Traders speculate that West Germany's economy will flourish, pushing interest rates higher, as boundaries between East and West diminish. High interest rates tend to support a currency.
The dollar also weakened against other major currencies in New York trading.
It traded at 143.97 yen in New York, down from 144.38 Monday. It dipped below 6.00 French francs for the first time since Dec. 16, 1988, finishing at 5.9185 francs in New York, down from 6.0200. And sterling rose to $1.6085 from $1.5937 in New York.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late quotes, included: 1.5732 Swiss francs, down from 1.5915; 1,284.75 Italian lire, down from 1,301.00, and 1.16255 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16375.

HEADLINE: Last Laps for East Germany's Olympic System

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Inside the Gymnastics and Sports Club of Berlin, life seemed as normal as ever today. A men's volleyball team practiced under the watchful eyes of its coach. A group of pre-teen-age boys played soccer, four-on-four. Five little girls pranced through the moves of a gymnastics routine they will perform Saturday as part of the club's Christmas show.
One would never know that outside the complex and beyond, a country was in the midst of political reform. Yet because East Germany holds sports so dear to its heart, those inside the club are not likely to remain unaffected by the changes, which continued today when all the officers of the national sports authority resigned, as expected. 
 
Old Way Losing Favor
''It cannot be the old way; that is too difficult, and our economy is not so good,'' said Hannelore Generlich, a former coach with national gymnastics teams who was working with the little girls.
In what form sports will continue is one of the more intriguing subplots of East Germany's current political mystery. As an interim coalition government grapples with new ideas five months in advance of parliamentary elections, sports leaders are debating how the future resources from the government might be applied.
While it is generally assumed that those in power will accede to public demands of more money for local and regional sports programs, some of East Germany's elite athletes are wondering if a reallocation of funds will damage the country's mighty Olympic factory. Only the Soviet Union and the United States have won more medals than East Germany has in the last six Olympics.
 
Unwilling to Recede
''If that is so,'' Ulf Timmermann said of a possible government cutback, ''then, yes, we will have some problems competing in the Olympics as we did in the past. But we will not give up this position voluntarily.''
Timmermann, the 1988 Olympic shot-put champion, is one of the Berlin club's most celebrated members. Speaking amid the grunts and groans of others at practice, his own workout ended, he reflected on the possible changes for the country's top athletes and the system that produces them.
In general, he envisioned only minimal, if any, retrenchment by the Government, and was thus not terribly alarmed over the possibility of major damage to the system.
Another of the club's elite athletes, Heike Hartwig, a former women's national shot-put champion, agreed, saying: ''Western athletes have shown us they can compete without so much government support. If we are put in that position, we can demonstrate our levels of performance.''
If budgets were cut back - a greater possibility if the Communist Party wins only minority representation in the May elections - Timmermann said sports authorities might be forced to consider reducing the number of sports in which the country would try to excel at the international level.
 
Truly an Elite
Until now, East Germany has always taken a lean approach to elite sports. Its national teams are composed only of athletes judged by coaches to be potential medal winners, unlike the United States, for example, which fills every available slot no matter what the athlete's chances for a medal may be.
Also, the East Germans de-emphasize many team sports, like ice hockey and field hockey, because a team can win only one medal. For that reason alone, Timmermann said, future austerity could force sports leaders to de-emphasize team sports in which the country has had success, like volleyball and handball.
In any case, he added, federations for all sports will likely investigate new ways to supplement whatever government subsidies they receive, as a safeguard against any shortfalls.
''Elite sports need other resources,'' he said. ''We now have a chance to earn much more than in the past. Marketing, for example. To now, there has been very, very little effort. Our national team has had only one commercial deal, with Adidas.
''But we can also have advertising on our shirts, signs in our stadiums. I am sure we can sign contracts with big enterprises to earn much more than we have before.''
 
Some Revisions Already Made
Some efforts are already under way. The track and field federation is considering raising money by allowing more athletes to participate in more Western meets. Timmermann said he and other East Germans had competed only rarely each summer on the Grand Prix circuit, which pays athletes according to their performances.
In the future, he said, an athlete would split the winnings with the federation. In the past, the federation has kept all the money, except for a small daily living allowance.
The soccer federation is negotiating with first-division clubs in Western Europe to transfer players on a limited basis. Such an arrangement is viewed by sports officials here as a way of discouraging talented players from defecting while generating revenues at the same time.
The transfer fee would be shared by the federation and the players, who would remain eligible for East German national teams.
The notion of one country's renting an athlete to another is not uncommon. But East Germany has indulged only once, in altered form, by allowing Katarina Witt, the Olympic figure-skating champion, to perform in Western ice shows.
While Timmermann and Hartwig acknowledged that they would enjoy any extra money from competitive or marketing endeavors, they stressed that in these uncertain times, supplemental income would better serve the system.

HEADLINE: Key Ideas Are All Divac Needs to Be a True Laker

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INGLEWOOD, Calif.

 BODY:
It was only in the days after the Lakers had selected Vlade Divac in the first round of the National Basketball Association draft last June that Mitch Kupchak at last got through by phone to the 21-year-old center in Yugoslavia.
''I spoke to the kid, which was interesting in itself,'' Kupchak, the team's assistant general manager, said at the time.
Divac, one of Europe's most heralded players and certainly one of the N.B.A.'s more intriguing selections, soon arrived in the United States, and it was then that the full scope of a language problem became evident, with many nuances.
''It's when he winks that you know he has no clue,'' one Lakers official said of Divac. 
''And if he says, 'Yeah, yeah,' more than once in a sentence, rest assured he's in trouble,'' said Mark McNamara, a backup center for Los Angeles and one of the many people who have both officially and informally tried to assist Divac in learning English and surviving in the N.B.A.
 
'Simple Verbs'
McNamara teaches from comparable experience, having played in both Italy and Spain and having spoken neither Italian nor Spanish.
''The people I could understand best were those who made the conscious effort to speak simply,'' McNamara said. ''Simple verbs, present tense, no slang. It can be a super hardship if you let it be.
''Vlade, though, is a wonderful imitator. It's amazing how well he copes. He can pick out key words, and though technically he may not know what the word means, he associates it with a play.''
The Lakers, for their part, have begun to associate the following words with the play of the 7-foot-1-inch Divac: ''naturally gifted,'' ''offensively explosive,'' ''potentially dominating.'' In 19 games going into last night's contest at Charlotte, N.C., Divac had averaged 8.1 points and 5.8 rebounds in just over 17 minutes a game, and along the way collected his share of assists and steals. Against the Hornets, whom the Lakers beat by 103-89, he scored only 2 points.
 
'Picked Up His Pace'
''His offense is clearly polished, and he doesn't even realize how good a defensive player he could be,'' said Mychal Thompson, the Lakers' starting center. ''And he's picked up his pace, gradually gotten the European style out of his game. He used to sort of lope down the court like a giant deer. Now, he's galloping like the rest of us.''
Vlade Divac (pronounced VLAH-day DEE-vatz) understood pretty early in life that, given his height, things stood to be different for him. He was born in the small town of Prijepolje, but left by age 12 to pursue his accelerated career in basketball. By 16, he was playing in Yugoslavia's senior league. A year later, he owned a gold medal from the World University Games. Three years after that, he had a silver one placed around his neck at the Olympics in Seoul.
Marty Blake, the director of scouting for the N.B.A., rated him the second-best player outside the United States after Sarunas Marciulionis, now with Golden State. Jerry West, the general manager of the Lakers, who were confronted with having to replace the retired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, thought Divac would go anywhere from 8th to 16th in the draft. As it turned out, Divac hadn't gone anywhere by the time the Lakers selected 26th.
''I came here because it was my dream to play in the N.B.A.,'' Divac said recently. ''I thought that in three or four years, I'd be a good player. My dream now is to play in the All-Star Game.''
 
No Comfort Zone
In a sense, Divac plays in an All-Star Game of sorts nightly, for the caliber of basketball he encounters game in and game out far outstrips that which he was accustomed to dominating. There's no zone defense to be played, no comfort zone to be found.
''Vlade is not the protypical back-to-the-basket center,'' said Pat Riley, the Lakers' coach. ''He needs seasoning, he's got to study both the game and the opposition. But he's a bright kid. And I haven't sensed any desperation or anxiety. He's learned enough of the terminology to understand.''
That terminology, of course, includes Riley's own personal lexicon of directives and labels, expressions like ''rip'' and ''power.'' Additionally, Divac has had to struggle on the court to keep on the same page as Magic Johnson, the Lakers' improvisational wizard of a point guard.
''He tries to make it easy for me,'' Divac said of Johnson. ''He's a good person first. And second, he's the best player.''
 
Speculation and Hope
Just how good a player Divac can eventually become is a matter of speculation and hope. Divac, who for a couple of days last summer fretted over reports that his deferment from mandatory military service had been rescinded, appears to be safe for at least the three years of his contract.
He has given up cigarettes, been married, relocated to an apartment in Marina del Rey and been assigned both a tutor and an interpreter. And, of course, his salary has increased exponentially, a fact of life that has helped cushion his ego's deflation.
''At first, it was hard, because my wife had English in Yugoslavia and she was ahead of me,'' Divac said earlier in the season. ''But now I am starting to put things together, and that is better.''
He couldn't have been welcomed any more warmly than he has been by fans at the Forum. They cheer his entrance and applaud his every point. ''I don't know, maybe they like me because I am a new guy in a new country,'' Divac said. ''But I don't really know.''
He has, though, come to conclude at least one thing. ''After four months, I have decided,'' Divac said with a smile and no wink, ''L.A. is my city.''

HEADLINE: SOVIET JEWS LEAVE AT A RECORD PACE, MANY FOR ISRAEL

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The number of Jews streaming out of the Soviet Union has reached a record. Not counting people departing this month, more than 62,500 Jews have left this year, surpassing by more than 20 percent the high of 51,320 set in 1979.
In recent years most Soviet Jews have gone to the United States. But because of immigration limits imposed by Washington recently, the number of Jews going to Israel has increased dramatically in recent months. As a result, Israel is bracing for its greatest flow of immigrants since its early days of independence four decades ago. #750,000 Over 6 Years Possible More than 11,000 Soviet Jews left in November - the first time the figure exceeded 10,000 in a month - and almost 2,000 of them arrived here, 10 times the number who came to Israel in January. The number of emigres is monitored closely by Israeli officials and the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, a nonprofit American group.
Early this week the Government projected that Israel might absorb as many as 750,000 Soviet Jews in the next six years, an addition of 20 percent to the nation's Jewish population. 
Although the projection may be exaggerated, several hundred thousand Soviet Jews have in fact requested Israeli visas, largely because they fear increasing nationalist turmoil in the Soviet Union and because of the American decision to admit fewer Soviet refugees.
 
Problems of Jobs and Housing
An influx even close to the projection would enhance Israel's sense of national identity after years in which more Jews have emigrated from the country than arrived, but it would also pose major problems for the country. It is accepted wisdom here that Israel is simply unequipped to handle immigrants in those numbers, and many Israelis resent such a migration at a time when unemployment is already high and housing already scarce.
But for Israel, the numbers are only half the problem. The people in this wave are different from other large groups of Jews to come to Israel or Palestine since the ''first aliyah'' from czarist Russia 100 years ago.
Most of the Soviet citizens coming now are not Zionists. In fact, they have little if any Jewish identity. And many people worry that their lack of Jewish zeal might make it more difficult for them to weather hard times in their new homeland.
Tugging sleepy children and overstuffed carry-on bags, about 65 of these immigrants arrived at Ben-Gurion International Airport in Lod just before dawn Monday. Like many other Soviet citizens stepping off planes that are landing here almost every day, these people looked startled, even a bit disturbed, as two dozen yeshiva students greeted them, chanting, clapping and singing traditional Jewish songs the Russians had never heard.
''This aliyah is different from the Soviet aliyah of the 70's,'' said Lizy Zlotnik, an Absorption Ministry official who handled paperwork on the new immigrants at the airport. ''Most of these people are very educated. These are Russians. They don't know anything about Judaism, and they don't really care about it.''
As part of the liberalization under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has made leaving the country much easier for the nation's 287 million citizens, including its estimated two million Jews. A new emigration law is expected to be enacted early next year, removing most restrictions on travel abroad. Some Soviet officials estimate that four million Soviet citizens will emigrate in the next few years. President Bush has already promised trade concessions to Moscow once the law is enacted.
Many of the new Jewish immigrants are leaving the Soviet Union ''because Russia is in turmoil, and they are afraid of what will be left for them when it ends,'' said Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the Jewish Agency, the quasi-Government organization largely responsible for settling immigrants.
 
Fear of Nationalist Movements
With all the assertive nationalist movements now spreading across the country, ''we are scared,'' said Leon Kostavitch, a 26-year-old engineer who had just arrived. ''It's dangerous to be there. The country is in revolution, and we don't know what's going to happen for us.''
''When the dust settles from all this turmoil,'' Mr. Dinitz said, ''it will be the minorities who suffer.''
In addition, there are unconfirmed reports from some immigrants arriving here of spreading anti-Semitism, particularly in Uzbekistan, the largely Muslim Soviet republic that is also home to about 250,000 Jews.
Israel and the Soviet Union do not have diplomatic relations, and for now the emigrants are flying to Bucharest, Vienna or other cities before flying on to Tel Aviv. But Israeli officials say the national airline, El Al, has signed an agreement with Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, to begin direct flights between Moscow and Tel Aviv early next year. The commercial agreement has not yet been approved by the Soviet Foreign Ministry, the Israelis say. But if and when it is, the number of Jews coming here is likely to grow even faster.
 
Concern About Lack of Zeal
Even with direct flights, it is not likely that all of the several hundred thousand people who have applied for Israeli visas will move here. But whatever the final number, the lack of awareness of Judaism among these immigrants creates ''some real challenges for absorption,'' said Natan Sharansky, a leader among Soviet Jews here.
Faith and Zionist zeal, most people here agree, help carry many of today's new immigrants through the difficult challenges and hard times that Israel almost invariably presents.
As he waited in line at the airport to register with immigration authorities, one of the arrivals, Oleg Finkelstein, a 24-year-old from Leningrad, said, ''I've never practiced Judaism, but I guess I'm interested in learning about it because it's what keeps the people of this country together.''
 
The Music Is Strange
For now, Mr. Finkelstein, like the others, had to be prompted to stand when the yeshiva students began singing ''Hatikva,'' the national anthem. When the yeshiva boys held hands and danced in a circle, singing ''Havenu Shalom Aleichem,'' one of the best-known Jewish folk songs and dances, hardly anyone in the group of new arrivals seemed to recognize it.
In most cases those people came to Israel because this is the country that invited them and for no other reason. They are simply looking for a better life and hope they can find it here. ''These are people who want to come and succeed in their work,'' Mr. Sharansky said.
Many might just as well have gone to the United States. But in September the Bush Administration, citing humanitarian, financial, political and bureaucratic concerns, set a ceiling of 50,000 on the number of Soviet refugees in each of the coming years.
 
Feast or Famine
Israeli officials warmly welcomed the American changes, knowing that the Soviet Jews who could not get into the United States would most likely come here.
But as the numbers swell, Mr. Sharansky and others are openly complaining that Israel simply cannot handle the flood. The nation is hard pressed to find housing and jobs, partly because of the economic troubles that the Palestinian uprising has helped to spawn.
''We don't like the fact that our Government isn't ready despite all our warnings,'' Mr. Sharansky said.
While Israel desperately wants Jews to move here to fulfill the tenet of Zionism that Israel be home for all the world's Jews, immigration from all sources has been at relatively low levels for years. Slightly more than 20,000 people moved here in 1980, but in most years since, the number has fluctuated between 11,000 and 14,000. In recent typical years, far more citizens have left than have arrived, a fact that deeply wounds many Israelis.
Though the number of emigrants is not known - most of them move to the United States illegally - the coming wave of Soviet Jews may tip the balance back at last.
The Soviet Jewish emigres counted so far this year give 1989 the highest total for any year since the National Conference on Soviet Jewry began tabulating emigration statistics in 1968. The previous peak, in 1979, occurred during the Carter Administration, when Washington and Moscow completed a strategic arms treaty before relations soured over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. An earlier period of relatively high emigration came in the early 1970's, during the Nixon Administration, in the so-called era of detente.
 
Better to Smile Now
As Israelis warmly welcomed the new arrivals at the airport on Monday morning, the yeshiva boys' organizer summed up the situation when he told his charges: ''The most important thing is to smile at them because you know they are coming and are going to have a lot of trouble. So smile now.''
But despite the smiles at the airport, Israel is involved in an angry internal argument over the resentment many people feel about the Government's efforts to find jobs for all the Soviet newcomers while thousands of longtime residents remain unemployed. The nation's unemployment rate stands at 9.1 percent.
Early this month, the Government started a classic Israeli political quarrel when it issued statistics showing that nearly half a million of the country's 4.5 million citizens are now living below the poverty line, $390 a month for a family of two.
With that news, the daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot wrote: ''Things that were whispered under the surface are beginning to burst through. A surge of Russian immigrants is about to arrive, and at least a few residents of the Jewish state, it is now clear, don't want them.''
Mr. Dinitz and others suggest that the arrival of well-trained Soviet immigrants will help the Israeli economy. But that could take years. And in the short term, at the airport, the newcomers have little idea what awaits them.
Mr. Finkelstein said he may not know much about Judaism, ''but I know how to work.
''I know if people want to work, then this country will find us jobs.''

HEADLINE: From Guns to Butter;
With Cutbacks Likely in Military Spending, Debate Will Center on Where Cash Will Go

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
No one knows how much money will become available or when. But a consensus has emerged here that improving relations with the Soviet Union will permit the United States to spend tens, perhaps hundreds, of billions of dollars less on the military in the 1990's than was believed possible only weeks ago.
The question facing the Bush Administration and Congress is: How will this windfall be allocated? The debate is likely to dominate American politics in the next decade.
Some, like Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, see the lessened need for military spending as an unparalleled chance to cut taxes and pump new money into the private economy.
Lobbyists for social causes say the United States has a golden opportunity to use what is being called the ''peace dividend'' to meet problems in education, housing, drug control and other areas that were overlooked in the hard-fisted Reagan Administration. 
Indeed, many who follow politics see this as a rare turning point, when the focus of policy making in America is dramatically shifting from an emphasis on the military to a concentration on social and economic issues.
''This moment in history,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, represents ''the dawn of the primacy of domestic economics.''
The debate will be joined when Congress reconvenes next month. Will a lack of design prevail as it did when new money came on the books as the Vietnam War wound down? Will the money go to those who shout the loudest or pay lobbyists the most or develop the most memorable slogans? Or will the politicians agree on a plan for distributing the windfall?
Many analysts wonder whether the politicians are up to the challenge. They observe that President Bush, who must chart the course, has shown little appetite in his first year in office for making long-range, controversial choices and that Congress has repeatedly failed the test of self-discipline.
''The word 'plan' has gone out of style,'' said Prof. James David Barber of Duke University, one of the nation's preeminent political scientists. ''What has happened in American politics is its drift to sentimentality and emotion, which substitutes for the facts that face you at the moment.''
 
Some See Squandering
Prof. Alan S. Blinder, chairman of the economics department at Princeton University, who is a student of Government policy making, is equally pessimistic. He said Mr. Bush and Congress would correctly identify that the money would be needed for highways, bridges, sewer systems, water projects and other areas where the nation's structures are crumbling. But he said he was confident the money would be spent not where it was needed most but in the districts of powerful members of Congress or in the parts of the country hardest hit by military cutbacks.
The Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said this week he would try to coordinate the efforts of lawmakers, but he conceded this would be difficult. ''Democracy,'' he said, ''is frequently an untidy process in which the interests of various sectors, both geographically and in terms of our economy, compete for limited resources.''
Many economists and politicans are trying to dampen the enthusiasm over the potential windfall. They warn that in the first few years the money saved will be needed to eliminate the huge budget deficit, and they caution that a recession would make moot the projections based on continued economic growth.
President Bush added his voice in this vein recently. ''When I hear now 'peace dividend,' '' he said, some people think ''if you cut defense spending by $10 billion, we can take that money and spend it on something else. They all have a wide array of programs. We can't do that. We've got enormous budget problems.''
But the amount of money available late into the next decade is likely to be sizable. Two military experts from previous administrations - Robert S. McNamara, Defense Secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and Lawrence J. Korb, an Assistant Defense Secretary in Ronald Reagan's first term - told Congress on Tuesday that the $300 billion annual military budget could safely be cut in half by the turn of the century. That anticipates a 5 percent, or $15 billion, reduction in Pentagon spending each year below this year's level, adjusted for inflation.
Other experts are not convinced that such deep cuts can be achieved, but they agree that absent a reversal in the world events, large reductions can be expected each year.
A $10 billion cut in the fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990, would, as the President observed, amount to only a quarter of the $40 billion needed to meet the requirements of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law. But if another $10 billion is cut each year, that would mean $20 billion in 1992 for other uses, $40 billion in 1994, $60 billion in 1996 and $100 billion in 2000.
The Government had a similar opportunity 20 years ago. From 1968, during the height of spending on the Vietnam War, to 1976, the military budget fell, in 1990 dollars, from $302 billion to $195 billion. The way it was spent was hardly noticed. Without a plan or a much public debate, most of the money went to increased Social Security benefits and Medicare payments.
More spending on Social Security and Medicare are not likely this time around. But there is no shortage of unmet needs.
Pressure has been building for years for money to meet the public health emergency of AIDS, to provide day care for working parents, to improve education, to help the elderly finance long-term care, to house the homeless and to address the many environmental problems. Almost without exception, economists believe the long-term prospects for the economy are dismal if the country and its citizens do not save and invest more money.
In addition, the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, has identified these ''unavoidable'' costs, among others, in the future:
* Repairing or replacing the nation's 240,000 deficient bridges will cost about $50 billion, and maintaining highways in their 1983 condition will cost an additional $315 billion. These costs are shared by Federal and state governments.
* Cleaning and modernizing the troubled nuclear weapons plants could cost between $100 billion and $130 billion.
* Modernization of the air traffic control system could cost $25 billion.
* Eliminating hazardous waste on military bases could cost as much as $14 billion.
* Tens of billions of dollars must be spent to upgrade the computers of the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies and to replace the Government's long-distance telephone system.
* It will cost more than $20 billion to repair the deteriorating stock of public housing and billions more to prevent privately owned, subsidized low-income housing from being used for other purposes.
Moreover, Senator Gramm is not alone in wanting to cut taxes. A cut in the capital gains tax rate, which President Bush and a majority in the House and Senate supported this year, could cost billions of dollars in lost revenue by the middle of the next decade.
Support is building in Congress for a more generous tax break for individual retirement accounts, at a cost of billions more. And the most vocal advocates of the poor are pressing for expanded tax credits for workers. To sort out these priorities and ''spend the money in the way it would be most productive for the nation,'' Professor Blinder said, ''we'd have to have especially skillful leadership.''
Will it happen? ''I don't see it coming from this President or this Congress,'' Mr. Blinder said.

HEADLINE: Zaire's Battered Economy Inspires Optimism

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
Western economists here say this country's long-moribund economy is showing promising signs of recovery.
Since January, Zaire, after years of mismanagement and political instability, has devalued its currency, put a brake on Goverment spending, trimmed civil servants from its bloated bureaucracy and increased tax revenues by tightening collection procedures.
These measures, and a perceived new readiness by Zairian officials to tackle their enormous problems with politically unpopular remedies, prompted the International Monetary Fund to assess Zaire's economic performance so far this year as positive and satisfactory.
''The program has been implemented effectively,'' said John Calvin Williams, the I.M.F. representive here, ''and it has already begun to bear fruit in a number of areas.'' 
For example, Mr. Williams said, since March Zaire's inflation rate has averaged 2.5 percent a month, down from nearly 9 percent a month in 1988. At the same time, he said, the spread between the official and the parallel market exchange has been been reduced to less than 10 percent.
For the first six months of this year, revenues from taxes and export receipts have exceeded expenditures, producing a small budget surplus, the first since Zaire gained independence from Belgium nearly 30 years ago.
''In this context, it's a fairly remarkable turnaround,'' said an African diplomat here, noting Zaire's near-legendary reputation for mismanagement, corruption and wasteful spending.
The optimism, however, is hedged with caveats. Western and Zairean economists and bankers say it is too early to well whether Goverment officials will stay the course. Although Zaire's economic perfomance this year has been impressive, the statistics have yet to be translated into better living conditions. Per capita income in Zaire, which is the size of the United States east of the Mississippi, is just $150 a year.
Analysts here are also concerned about whether the Government will be able to restrain spending in 1990, since it has already committed itself to a number of projects, notably constructing housing and convention space for a summit meeting of French-speaking nations. Costly celebrations are also likely next year on the 30th anniversary of Zaire's independence, the 25th anniversary of the governing party's founding and President Mobutu Seso Seko's 60th birthday.
In the early 1980's, Zaire's economy effectively collapsed. The causes were diverse: a slump in the price of copper, agricultural neglect and, by many accounts, seemingly endemic corruption.
After some hesitation, Mr. Mobutu threw in his lot with fundamental economic changes prescribed by the international monetary fund and carried out the program with dictatorial powers. He stuck to the I.M.F.'s stringent guidelines, including a string of devaluations. The value of the zire, the nation's currency, is an eighth of what it was in 1979.
''We were the I.M.F.'s best pupil,'' Pay-Pay Wa Syagasighe, the head of Zaire's central bank, said recently.
In 1986, however, Zaire abruptly abandoned the program, protesting that it had become a net exporter of capital to Europe and the United States. ''The I.M.F. programs cost us $2 billion in outflows against only $1 billion in inflows,'' President Mobutu complained in an interview last fall. Within months, however, the budget deficit skyrocketed, and inflation was back to 100 percent. Foreign investors began to flee.
Last May, after several months of protracted negotiations, the Government signed a new $253 million credit agreement with the I.M.F., under which it again committed itself to an economic reform program.
Analysts here say they have been especially impressed by Zairian efforts to crack down on fraud and abuse in the customs service.
An economist with an international assistance agency said, ''Everyone is being made to pay customs duties and taxes now, even the previously untouchable political elite, and that has never happened before.''

Aid to Poland and Hungary Pledged by Western Nations

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Western governments announced plans today to step up their economic assistance to Poland and Hungary as part of a 24-nation effort to help the two countries make the difficult transition from centrally planned to market economies.
Meeting at the foreign minister level, a Western task force on Poland and Hungary also held open the possibility of major aid packages for other Eastern European countries that opt for democracy and capitalism. East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia were mentioned.
The main decisions taken today involved completion of pledges to a $1 billion emergency fund for Poland, which is to be available for use early next year and approval of the idea of a $1 billion loan to Hungary, for which the schedule has not been determined. Many of the 24 governments are already giving aid directly to Poland and Hungary, but they also agreed to coordinate their assistance through the Western task force. 
Underlining the importance of outside help, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d noted that after political change has taken place in different countries, a new challenge emerges when ''the economies must put food on the tables and goods on the shelves of stores.'' And he added: ''Here is where we can help, indeed must help, if we are to meet the call of history.''
 
Fear of Unrest
The extreme difficulties facing Poland and Hungary were echoed in statements to today's meeting by the two countries' Foreign Ministers, who stressed the social costs and political risks involved in introducing such concepts as competition and privatization to economies that have been state-run for 40 years.
''We are resolved to carry out our program, even if its implementation generates social conflicts at the start,'' Hungary's Foreign Minister, Gyula Horn, said. But he warned that if it brought a sharp decline in living standards, ''the outcome may be a general wave of social unrest'' and ''mass support for conservative and retrograde forces.''
Poland's Foreign Minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, said, ''The results of our economic changes will be viewed by other countries in the region as either an encouragement or a warning.''
The idea of setting up the Group of 24 to help Poland and Hungary was born at the summit meeting of the seven major industrialized nations in July. Members of the Group of 24 include all European countries outside the Soviet bloc as well as the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, with coordination of aid put in the hands of the European Community.
 
More Food Needed
While Poland and Hungary were dealt with together on the grounds that both countries were simultaneously moving toward democracy, it was apparent to Western governments that the situation in Poland was most critical, particularly because of the fear of food shortages as winter approached.
The first priority has therefore been food shipments, with $385 million worth of food delivered to Poland this year by members of the Group of 24. The ministers noted today that new food shipments would be needed by Poland early in 1990, and they called for contributions. ''The urgent need for medical supplies was also recognized,'' they said in a statement.
The key pillar in Poland's medium-term program, though, is a $1 billion stabilization fund that, among other things, will enable Warsaw to carry out a daring program of monetary reform early next year, including making its currency convertible.
Although several governments have previously made pledges, the $1 billion target was only reached today. Along with a $200 million grant from the United States, contributions included a $250 million line of credit from West Germany, a $150 million loan from Japan, a $100 million gift from Britain and $100 million loans from France and Italy. Japan's loan marked its first participation in an aid program for Eastern Europe.
Stressing the urgency of Poland's need, Mr. Baker said it was important for the funds to be made available as soon as possible. He added that, over the next three years, the United States will provide a total of over $800 million in assistance to Poland and $80 million to Hungary.
The Secretary of State also announced that the United States would provide $200 million toward a $500 million ''bridge loan'' to tide Poland over until it completes negotiations on a $700 million standby credit from the International Monetary Fund. United States officials said an agreement between Poland and the I.M.F. was just weeks away.
 
Climate for Investment
Hungary, which is now seeking parliamentary approval for a tough economic program worked out with the I.M.F., was also given approval for a $1 billion adjustment loan already approved by the European Community. The loan, which is tied to conclusion of an agreement with the I.M.F., is aimed at sustaining market-oriented changes.
Other key elements in the Western aid package include granting preferential treatment to Polish and Hungarian exports, financing a vast range of management and technical training programs, stimulating new environmental protection programs and helping to create a climate for foreign investment. The total value of aid pledged so far, including both grants and loans, is around $814 million.
The somber tone of today's meeting was set by the Polish and Hugarian Foreign Ministers, who spoke early in the day and then withdrew so their proposals could be debated in private.
Mr. Skubiszewski said his Government planned to fight inflation by reducing the budget deficit, cutting subsidies and raising taxes. But he added, ''Unemployment, the extent of which is difficult to predict today, will make its appearance in Poland.''
The Polish Foreign Minister also said his nation had plans to privatize state companies and would for the first time create a stock market and a private banking system. Noting that the country needed relief from payments on its $38 billion foreign debt, he invited foreign creditors to swap debt for participation in Polish companies.
 
'Unpredctable Shifts'
While expressing gratitude for Western help, he said inadequate coordination of food aid had brought problems, with some countries sending food, like butter, that was not needed in Poland. He said he hoped future shipments would comprise mainly cereals.
Hungary's Foreign Minister emphasized the difficulties of abruptly transforming a state-run economy. ''The simultaneous effort to build a social and economic fabric of democracy may result in unpredictable shifts, which may undermine economic and social stability,'' he said.
Mr. Horn added that ''unpopular but necessary measures'' were being taken throughout the economy to maintain its credit-worthiness and to create ''a healthy property and enterprise structure.'' But he, too, complained about the burden of maintaining payments on the country's $10 billion foreign debt.
He stressed that Hungary had not misused this money, but he recalled that commercial banks made the loans in the 1970's for business reasons. ''In that period,'' he went on, ''the objectives of these credits were not aimed at transformation of the economic system or at the creation of democracy.''

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
Europeans Praising Baker Blueprint

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's blueprint for a new European order won generally favorable reviews today from European statesmen and commentators, but privately many officials predicted that Washington will have a difficult time putting its vision into practice.
In a speech in Berlin on Tuesday, Mr. Baker outlined the Bush Administration's view of what he called ''a new architecture for a new era'' in Europe. The thrust of his speech was to provide a series of ideas on how institutions like NATO, the European Community and the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe can be transformed in ways that will both enable them to adapt to the changing European landscape and help insure that this landscape changes in ways that won't wreak havoc.
A spokesman for Jacques Delors, the president of the community, said Mr. Baker's speech was ''right in line'' with Mr. Delors's thinking. A few miles away at NATO headquarters, Secretary General Manfred Worner said he was ''fully in line with Secretary Baker's political proposals,'' particularly a suggestion that NATO establish a new arms control verification staff. 
But behind the praise, many questions are being raised as to how the United States will go about carrying out some of Mr. Baker's proposals -not because those proposals are being seen as particular naive or wrongheaded but because they require such radical changes in long-established European institutions.
 
Repeat of Bush's Plan
For example, Mr. Baker in his speech repeated President Bush's four-point plan for German unification. That plan endorses German unity on the condition that it come about as a result of free voting in West and East Germany, that West Germany remain a member of the European Community and NATO, that unification is not accompanied by any enlargement of Germany's postwar borders and on the condition that it take place ''step by step.''
The problem, as Mr. Baker discovered in his talks in Potsdam on Tuesday with East Germany's Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, is that many East Germans are not in a step-by-step mood. As Mr. Modrow explained to Mr. Baker, the push for unification from East Germans is being driven not so much as nationalist impulses but by consumer impulses, not by visions of a grand Germany but visions of videocassette recorders.
''It is the East German consumer who is going to decide the fate of Central Europe,'' remarked a NATO diplomat. ''Baker outlined a very sensible framework for unification, but I don't know if it is ever going to implemented. East German workers don't want 'socialism with a human face.' They want capitalism. If people continue to leave at the rate they are, the infrastructure of the East German Government and medical system is going to collapse. It is not something you can stop with Government statements.''
 
New Missions for Alliance
As for NATO, Mr. Baker argued that because the Soviet threat is diminishing it must find new tasks to maintain its cohesion and relevance, it was time to begin discussing new missions for the Western alliance. NATO, he argued, has to be seen not as a transitory institution aimed at confronting a military threat, but as a good in itself, as a structure that binds Western Europe and the United States and gives a sense of shared destiny.
But that is easier said than done. Mr. Baker offered three proposals: That NATO establish an arms control verification staff that could help members monitor what are expected to be a wide range of conventional arms control agreement between East and West in the coming years, that NATO involve itself more in trying to solve regional conflicts and that NATO consider taking on some more political and economic responsibilities, like promoting free trade or free elections or environmental protection in Europe.
But for NATO to confront such issues its members would have to agree not only what they are against - a Soviet invasion - but what they are for. One NATO official said: ''We have lived off the Soviet threat for a long time. The question is, Is there life after threat?'' While NATO already has economic, environmental and scientific research wings that could easily assume some broader functions, the idea that NATO could get involved in tackling such thorny regional issues as the Middle East, southern Africa or Central America is viewed as unrealistic, given the conflicting priorities of the various members.
 
Ties With European Community
Maybe the most radical idea Mr. Baker offered was that the United States consider signing a treaty to significantly strengthen the ''institutional and consultative links'' between Washington and the European Community. Mr. Baker had several motivations for making this proposal. With the 12 members of the community due to merge into a single 320-million-person market in 1992, it is going to be a major economic and politial force in the core of any new Europe. The community will be responsible for anchoring a unified Germany in the West and attracting Eastern Europe toward free markets. Given that enlarged role, the Bush Administration wants to make sure that it has some formalized mechanism for influencing decisions before they are made.
At the same time, Mr. Baker is apparently trying to exploit the European desire to see America continue to play a role on the Continent to get a toehold into the European Community. As the community becomes a huge single market, the United States has to make sure that its trade interests are being protected, and its interest in areas like product standards in the European market.
Pulling off such an institutionalized arrangement, said one senior community official, would be ''very, very complicated.'' The community is getting involved in regulating everything from pesticides to telephones and if the United States sought private consultations every time a tariff was being raised ''we would need 5,000 people here,'' said one American official. More important, there would likely be political resistance, led by France, for anything that suggests Washington is becoming a de facto 13th member of the European Community. The French have tended to view the community as their vehicle for exercising influence throughout Europe and NATO as America's vehicle. American diplomats believe Paris still harbors the hope that one day ''NATO will wither away'' and the community will become the dominant political and economic force in Europe.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
Expert From Cold War Analyzes East Germany

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, Dec. 13

 BODY:
It was unusual and surprising for the Secretary of State to quote word for word and at some length from a cablegram by the United States Ambassador to East Germany, since such messages are customarily treated as secret by the State Department.
But the reading of the cablegram in Washington last weekend by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was an acknowledgment of the authority of its author, Richard C. Barkley, one of the State Department's few remaining specialists on German affairs, expertise that in the heyday of the cold war was held by scores of Foreign Service officers.
''Yes, everyone is surprised when a cable is quoted,'' he said in a brief interview on Monday. ''But I was pleased because I thought I was right.'' 
As dramatic changes sweep East Germany and raise the prospect of German reunification and a transformed Europe, Mr. Baker has evidently depended to no small degree on Mr. Barkley's perception of events as they unfold on the ground. A Western diplomat here said it was a recommendation by Mr. Barkley's Embassy that persuaded Secretary Baker to travel to the East to meet Prime Minister Hans Modrow in Potsdam on Tuesday.
When Mr. Baker disclosed the contents of Mr. Barkley's cablegram last weekend, he did so apparently to counter reports that the country might be turning so chaotic that there was a threat of Soviet intervention. The Ambassador wrote that ''despite the disorder born of change, the East German Government still runs, the people work and the economy produces.''
''Demonstrations continue peacefully amidst rumors of potential violence,'' it continued. ''The pace of this revolution is breathtaking.''
 
A 'Balanced' Ambassador
The language of the cablegram is the mark of the man, calm and collected, precise and concise.
''Balanced'' is how Dragan Rancic, the East Europe correspondent of the Yugoslav newspaper Politika, described Mr. Barkley. ''He is the man who makes you rich when you talk with him,'' he said.
Mr. Barkley, who turns 57 on Dec. 23, is the sixth American Ambassador to serve here since diplomatic relations with the Communist Government in East Berlin were opened in 1974.
This is his third tour as a diplomat in Germany, in addition to service in West Germany in the Army in the mid-1950's and study at the University of Freiburg. He entered the Foreign Service in 1962.
 
Only 8 Full-Fledged Diplomats
The American Embassy here is rather small, with a staff of 100 in a five-story building, but only 8 of them function as full-fledged diplomats at a time when East Germany is in the throes of its greatest political crisis since it was founded in 1949.
Still, it is probably a larger staff than that of the American Embassy that was closed in December 1941, when Hitler declared war on the United States. That building, situated two blocks west next to the Brandenburg Gate, was destroyed by bombs in World War II, and the land was sold to East Germany when diplomatic relations were opened.
Mr. Barkley, a native of Chicago, lives with his wife, Nina, and their 4-month-old child, Katharina, in an almost palatial red-brick house that probably belonged to an industrialist in the Niederschonhausen borough on the northern edge of the city.
The Barkleys have close contacts not only with past and present East German political leaders, but also with writers, artists, dancers and musicians. Unlike current and past ambassadors to Bonn or East Berlin, his German is fluent and finely nuanced.
Now, with East Germany on the American political map for the first time in a big way, the Barkleys have also had to play host to a half-dozen or so Congressional delegations, with more on the way. ''They have all been good,'' Mr. Barkley said diplomatically of the ones that have already been here.
Mr. Barkley graduated from Michigan State University in East Lansing in 1954 and later earned a master's degree in European history at Wayne State University in Detroit.
His Foreign Service postings have included Finland, the Dominican Republic and South Africa, in addition to Bonn and West Berlin.
Asked to describe the essence of his job, he replied: ''This is really unknown territory for most Americans, and we are just finding our way to each other. Most Americans are amazed and at the same time impressed by the resolve of the East German people.''

HEADLINE: Drugs in Atlanta: A Lost Generation

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 13

 BODY:
It was a decade ago that 29 young blacks, most of them children, died here in a series of murders that shook Atlanta to its core and transfixed the nation.
But after peering into the tiny coffin of 7-year-old Terrell (Tiger) Weaver last month, Louise Watley found herself thinking that what is happening now is even worse, not because of what is extraordinary about it, but because it is becoming routine.
''A child gets killed, people say, 'It's a way of life, another one gone,' '' said Ms. Watley, head of the tenants' group at the Carver Homes housing project here. ''They ask whose child it was and say there's nothing you can do about it. The missing and murdered children situation was horrible, but these drugs aren't costing us 30 children. They're costing us a whole generation.'' 
The latest statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation show Atlanta with the nation's highest crime rate, but there is no reason to believe its drug problems are much different from those of other big cities. What is different is the memories of a decade ago.
 
End of a Painful Period
The cases of the missing and murdered children, which played out from 1979 to 1981, ended in the conviction of Wayne Williams, son of local schoolteachers. He was found guilty in two murders and implicated in 24 of the 29 deaths. Many local blacks were not convinced Mr. Williams was guilty of all those crimes, but his conviction for the most part ended one of Atlanta's most painful periods.
''In both cases, the children are victims, helpless to defend themselves,'' said State Representative Mable Thomas. ''And in both cases, it just kept going on and on, no end or relief. The kids who should be living are dying too young, and we are helpless to stop it.''
In angry meetings last week, frustrated residents of public housing projects compared their plight now to the situation a decade ago. Some urged that the National Guard to be called out to protect them from rampant, drug-related violence.
Others sought a special police force for the 50,000 people, about 10 percent of Atlanta's population, who live in the city's 42 housing projects.
 
Victim of Random Shooting
Sometimes the victims are innocent children like Tiger Weaver, who was hit in the chest in a random shooting in what the police believe was drug-related violence on Nov. 12. Two other children and a teen-ager were wounded in the shooting. Two months earlier, a 12-year-old girl, Bricola Coleman, was raped and killed at her home in an apartment complex ravaged by drug use.
Sometimes the victims are youngsters in age only, like 16-year-old Michael A. Penix, who was shot and killed while trying to rob drug dealers in another apartment complex.
At least 12 youths under the age of 16 have been homicide victims thus far this year. Officials say it is difficult to be sure how many of those deaths were related to drugs, but the death toll is less than that of the era of missing and murdered children.
But the number of homicides this year is at a record high: 226 as of last week, compared with 146 in 1985.
Residents like Ms. Watley say the toll of killings, record numbers of child abuse cases and ruined lives dwarfs the trauma of a decade ago. And parents in high crime areas, accustomed to the crack of gunshots punctuating each night, do not need statistics to fear for their children.
 
'The Drugs Are Everywhere'
''I never let them outside here,'' said Lisa Jones, a 22-year-old mother of three who lives in the same project as Ms. Watley. ''I take them to my mother's to be outside.''
She remembers the fear of a decade ago, when she was a child, but says: ''This is worse. It's worse because the drugs are everywhere.''
It is also different because no one believes the problem now can be solved by law enforcement alone.
''You can bring in the National Guard from all over the U.S. and it won't do any good,'' said Jabari Simama, a member of the Atlanta City Council. ''We have to stop the demand by looking at the economic reasons why a kid would get involved with drugs. A Band-Aid can be put on cancer for so long.''
But that is little consolation to Ms. Watley when she looks at the basketball court where Tiger Weaver used to play, or sees the 13-year-olds running around with loaded pistols, or when she sees the children sent to school half dressed and unfed because their mothers are more interested in drugs than in mothering.
''When this started, the kids involved were the ones people expected to get in trouble,'' she said. ''But now it's the ones in Boy Scouts and the ones involved in activities in the community. They're all out there selling drugs. We've lost half a generation already. If we don't do something, we'll lose all of it.''

HEADLINE: Why Rush to Surrender on Drugs?

 BODY:
Federal District Judge Robert Sweet adds his voice to those who call for legalization of drugs, along with George Shultz, the former Secretary of State; William F. Buckley, the columnist; Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, and Milton Friedman, the economist. But the judge offers no persuasive new insights. Instead he demonstrates how frustration with the drug problem clouds common sense. 
Judge Sweet is exasperated by ''seeing our justice system overwhelmed by a social phenomena.'' Legalizing drugs, he asserts, would immediately relieve the burden on law enforcement and free billions of dollars for drug prevention and treatment. That's a superficially seductive argument that ignores fact.
Justice is overwhelmed mainly because, despite all the declarations of a War On Drugs, government hasn't begun to provide the necessary resources. In that sense, to call for legalized drugs now is to surrender without a serious fight.
But even if society had begun to fight, the argument for legalization remains deeply flawed. Its supporters acknowledge the need for regulation; they typically envision addicts lining up for drugs during business hours at a public dispensary. Such a system may be plausible for heroin. Addicts maintained on regular daily doses can lead normal lives. Thousands already do so on methadone. But the current besetting curse is crack, and crack is different. Addicts binge on it, rather than nodding off regularly. To satisfy crack addicts, a dispensary would have to be open at all hours, and serve all customers, no questions asked. To regulate supply would defeat the goal of reducing the law enforcement burden. Criminal gangs would rush to serve all who prefer to avoid the rules.
The alternative to regulation is free access to crack. But that would likely produce a surge of new addiction - and a health catastrophe.
Crack use causes paranoia, often violent, that continues after the drug wears off. Women reluctant to inject heroin are quick to smoke crack. As a result, crack has generated a horrendous wave of child abuse. The exchange of sex for crack by binging addicts spreads syphilis and AIDS.
All these ugly trends would grow dramatically if crack were more freely available. Promoters of legalization say maybe not. But there is little evidence to support so stupendous a contradiction of common sense.
In the end, Judge Sweet thinks legalization, and the shifting of money to drug treatment and attacks on broader social problems, could produce a healthier America. Yet drug treatment for crack remains in the primitive stages, and cures for broader social ills are far from clear. The judge bases his optimism on the current public interest in diet. ''If our society can learn to stop using butter,'' he says, ''it should be able to cut down on cocaine.''
That is an airy, remote response to the victims of crack: the underweight, addicted infant struggling for life in intensive care . . . the battered child awaiting a foster home . . . the deranged homeless man picking fights in a city shelter . . . the AIDS patient slowly dying in a crowded hospital ward.
Those who call for legal crack can do so only by averting their eyes from these realities, and from the first requirement of a War On Drugs: to fight.

HEADLINE: It's Time to Rethink U.S. Policy on El Salvador;
The Lesser Evil

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A major misconception in the debate over United States policy on El Salvador is the belief that cutting or conditioning United States aid will lead to takeover by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of El Salvador. Such a belief presumes that the Salvadoran military and right wing are so stupid that they would not move for a negotiated settlement of the war or would not meet the conditions of our aid if they thought that our aid cuts would seriously weaken their military position and cause them to lose the war. 
If the Salvadoran right-wing senses that its future in El Salvador depends on negotiating peace and respecting human rights, it will clean up its act. But what if El Salvador's ruling elite rejects United States requests for human rights and negotiations, and instead decides to fight on without our military and economic aid? I think we would have to face the fact of the eventual rise in El Salvador of a left-wing government similar to Nicaragua's government.
More important, I think we would have to face the fact that such a leftist regime would be a lesser evil for the Salvadoran people (and even for the United States) than continuation of an extreme right-wing regime that does nothing to relieve the wretched poverty of El Salvador's poor majority, that offers little to end the long, bloody (and for the United States, costly) civil war and that continues to carry out or at least to allow the brutal violation of its people's human rights.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Dithering in Moscow

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Do we want perestroika to succeed? Let's see when it took root.
In the summer of 1982, Moscow's military leaders where shocked into the realization that in a major conflict with U.S. armed forces, the U.S.S.R. was doomed to lose.
The unexpected fierceness of Afghan resistance and the subsequent U.S. arms buildup had already sowed the seeds of perestroika, but a specific event that dramatically showed Kremlin leaders the need for systemic modernization was the ''Peace in Galilee'' campaign in Lebanon.
New U.S.-built planes piloted by Israelis destroyed 80 new Soviet-built MIG planes piloted by Syrians, without a single Israeli loss. In addition, vaunted new Soviet tanks were mauled by superior Israeli-built armor. 
In this revealing clash-by-proxy between the superpowers, Western technology, training and tactics won overwhelmingly. When Brezhnev died a few months later, Soviet marshals backed Yuri Andropov's K.G.B. reform faction.
The push of technological necessity developed unforeseen momentum. The puppet regimes acting as a buffer on the Soviet Army's western front were too costly to maintain; 540,000 Red Army occupation troops have gone into a ''bastion mode'' to avoid conflict with freedom-hungry locals.
This momentum of change set American policy makers to agonizing over whether we should help Mr. Gorbachev.
Hawks have been saying we should let the Soviet system sink, because only desperation and deprivation will force the sort of radical economic change - private property, market prices, individual decision-making -that will insure the implantation of political freedom.
Doves, contrariwise, have declared the cold war over; they consider the continued occupation by the half-million Soviet troops, as well as continued support of warlike outposts of empire, to be mere vestigial remnants of a wished-away era. They want perestroika to succeed, lest its failure lead to reaction or Bonapartism.
George Bush, fearful of a potential ''who-lost-Gorbachev?'' charge, has sided with the doves. At Malta, he handed Mr. Gorbachev all the economic openings the Soviets have long desired, asking nothing. On top of that, he agreed to subordinate troop withdrawals to missile reductions. In return, the Soviet leader listened to his complaints about arms to Central America without getting angry.
The rationale behind the Bush largesse is that our generosity will encourage Moscow's best impulses, strengthening Mr. Gorbachev's hand against the meanies. We will not be propping up the Communist system, the dovish argument goes, but by offering trade and credit we will be weaning it away from totalitarianism.
This is the tactic called pre-emptive concession, part of the grand strategy of aggressive acquiescence. The Bush style is at least consistent, in operation both in Moscow and Beijing, which is more than can be said for critics who would kowtow only in Moscow.
Will this extension of trust deliver results? Will the Soviet Communist Party submit to political challenge, and will its failed central planners offer more economic freedom?
When events are in the saddle, answers arrive speedily. At the Congress of Deputies Andrei Sakharov moved to consider ending the party's power monopoly; Mr. Gorbachev was not ready and brushed him aside.
Well, say our doves, political competition would be too much too soon, encouraging ''instability,'' the new code word that frowns at striking while the iron is hot; first must come changes in economic philosophy.
That notion was promptly kicked in the head by Mr. Gorbachev's handpicked Prime Minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, who proudly declared ''the state is the owner of the means of production'' and outlined a Five Year Plan that enshrines central planning and blocks incentives for hard work.
This leap backward cannot be what Mr. Bush had in mind when he extended his offers of trade and aid. The fuzzy talk of ruble convertibility within an Eastern economic bloc already looking westward represents a failure of will by the Gorbachevites; they are paralyzed by the prospect of a loss of power and will not take the action necessary to save their nation.
Yes, we want perestroika to succeed - if, and only if, that means wresting power from a kakistocracy and vesting sovereignty in the people. If it means making the Soviet Union safe for cosmeticized Communism -if it means delaying and denying the worldwide surge for freedom that has so surprised the men who set it in train - we want perestroika to fail.

For Mayor-Elect, Belt-Tightening Ahead of Time

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
''My campaign,'' David N. Dinkins declared repeatedly as a candidate, ''is about change.''
Yet as Mayor-elect of New York City, the thrust of his appointments so far and of his reassuring remarks to the city's business community has been less about change than about continuity.
Mr. Dinkins's address Tuesday before the business and civic leaders who comprise the Association for a Better New York could have been delivered verbatim by his rival for the Democratic nomination, Mayor Edward I. Koch. The difference, Mr. Dinkins's advisers acknowledged, was largely one of emphasis and good intentions. His challenge will be to persuade his core constituencies that, for the time being, good intentions are going to have to be good enough. 
''They know that I care,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''I don't say to people, 'Pull yourselves up by your bootstraps,' failing to note that they wear no boots.''
Mr. Dinkins had campaigned as a soul mate of the downtrodden, suggesting that his candidacy embodied some hope, which was better than none. He also believed that, as a liberal, he was obligated to persuade business leaders that he would not bankrupt the city with social programs. Some supporters suggested that he bore an even greater burden because he is black. As a candidate, he conceded that some goals would be fulfilled not immediately, but by the end of his term. Even before his inauguration, he is soberly lowering expectations further.
''Government simply cannot afford to do all that needs to be done,'' Mr. Dinkins said Tuesday. He promised only ''modest but meaningful progress'' in dealing with drug abuse, AIDS and homelessness, causes that had been among the cornerstones of his candidacy. But what some people praised as his sensitivity to business concerns and fiscal realities was described by some others as a squandered opportunity.
''He told them what they wanted to hear,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center.
''Leadership would have been going to them and saying, 'I need you to help provide services because government can't.' ''
Mr. Dinkins did mention a campaign to recruit business and civic leaders to adopt public schools. He argued that investment in some drug treatment programs and residences for AIDS patients would prove economical. But the theme of his remarks to the business community was not to worry, which, in turn, worried some advocates who, Mr. Dinkins had hoped, might continue to support him on faith.
''I sure won't,'' said Robert M. Hayes, chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless. ''Obviously we can't have a bankrupt city budget. Just as obviously we can't have a mayor with bankrupt integrity who makes a promise and then says, 'I was only kidding.' '' Mr. Hayes cited support for targeted tax increases. He suggested that investing more in preventive services would require vision and courage, and that ''in the long run, such vision and courage will be seen as the prudent course.''
Mr. Dinkins's supporters predict that black New Yorkers, in particular, will be more patient and will appreciate even the stylistic contrast with Mr. Koch if Mr. Dinkins succeeds in apportioning immediate budget cuts fairly and in outlining a broader vision.
''Your approach to this budget is different from your approach to an administration,'' said Assemblyman Albert Vann of Brooklyn. ''Any reasonable person would recognize that, though New Yorkers tend not to be very reasonable.''
The Rev. Herbert Daughtry promised to hold Mr. Dinkins ''lovingly accountable.'' Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the hospital workers union, said the constituency that elected Mr. Dinkins was seeking ''an activist government'' and ''if things don't change, certainly people will be disappointed.'' Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, challenged Mr. Dinkins to define ''how he plans to do things differently with the money he does have.''
Mr. Koch likes to recall the elderly Brooklyn woman who pleaded with him to ''make it like it was.'' Mr. Dinkins's constituents, with less rosy memories, hope he will make things better. He has been Mayor-elect for only five weeks. He will not submit his own version of the city budget until spring. But at the end of four years, he was asked during the campaign, how should average voters measure him? ''Look at those things that I have said that I care about and that they care about,'' he replied, ''and see if I've made any progress in those areas.''
The campaign, Mr. Dinkins had said, was about change. The question facing Mayor Dinkins is when New Yorkers will say it's about time.

HEADLINE: Decline Seen In Home Prices In New Jersey

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Dec. 13

 BODY:
The days of steeply climbing house prices are over, and the 1990's could begin with prices dropping by as much as 12 percent, according to a report released today by Rutgers University based on three million house sales in New Jersey.
''This really is the end of a housing and economic era in New Jersey and the Northeast region,'' said Dr. James W. Hughes, a professor of urban planning who wrote the report with Dr. George Sternlieb.
The study, ''New Jersey Home Prices,'' confirms what anyone who has bought or sold a house or apartment this decade already knows: prices have gone out of sight. But the sheer mass of the data gives new insight into how the increases have profoundly changed the market in nearly every one of the 567 municipalities in the state. 
The authors said that although their data were drawn just from New Jersey the trends and general conclusions can be applied to the entire New York metropolitan region.
 
Cooling in Mid-1988
Using computers, the authors examined all house and apartment sales in the state from 1965 to mid-1988, a total of three million transactions. They show that although house prices here remained at or below national levels through the beginning of this decade, they soared starting in 1985.
From 1980 to mid-1988, the median sales price rose to $141,900 from $57,500, with many communities, among them Alpine and Saddle River in Bergen County and Mantoloking in Ocean County, exceeding that by hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Since then, however, prices have cooled considerably, with no increases seen. In some cases, there have been declines, a trend that could continue, depending on the economy.
Although the high prices eventually shut out many people from the housing market, the authors warned that the end of the decade of rapid appreciation could strand those who bought at the peak between 1985 and 1988. Significant social shifts could also develop, among them an increase in traditional forms of savings and a decrease in the number of moves that people make.
 
'A Super Piggy Bank'
''A house is not merely a home in America; it's a super piggy bank,'' said Professor Sternlieb, former director of the Rutgers Center for Urban Policy Research and now university professor at the school. ''We're starting to see some cracks around the end, but it still may be the best piggy bank around, if people just hang on.''
Professors Sternlieb and Hughes are working on the Rutgers Regional Report, a three-year effort to produce a statistical portrait of the New York, New Jersey and western Connecticut region. The immense record of sales transactions was collected by the state to determine the distribution of aid to municipalities. Professor Hughes said the information might be the most comprehensive record of home prices in the country.
Several forces were behind the drastic changes in New Jersey, Professor Sternlieb said, but it stemmed mainly from the 500,000 jobs created between 1982 and 1987 and the increasing demand for housing. Mortgage rates also declined to single digits, and Federal income taxes were cut. There was also something of a buying frenzy because buying a house came to be seen as a sure way to increase a family's equity.
 
Small, Prosperous and by the Sea
For many, it was. The community with the highest median sales price is Mantoloking, a borough of huge houses sandwiched between Barnegat Bay and the Atlantic Ocean that had 433 people in 1980 and an estimated 439 in 1987. It is the lone municipality in the state with a median sale price of $1 million. That is a 189 percent increase since 1985 and a 450 percent rise since 1980, when the median price was $225,000.
Mantoloking might be atypical because it is on the beach. But other towns in the 10 highest-priced communities show similar increases. In Bergen County, Alpine saw prices rise 530 percent in the decade, to $880,000, and Saddle River had a 340 percent increase, to $875,000.
In Essex County, the median price in North Caldwell rose to $341,250 from $123,500. Prices in Westfield, in Union County, climbed to $255,000 from $95,375, and in Weehawken, a township in Hudson County with the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel and several miles of Hudson River waterfront, the median price went from $55,000 to $230,000.
 
At the Lower End
Even those towns with the lowest prices, most of them huddled around the southwestern end of the state, an area of farms and small towns, saw a surge in the decade. From 1980 to 1985, Commercial Township, a community of 4,600 people on Delaware Bay, had the lowest median prices, rising to $18,000 in 1985 from $12,500 in 1980. By last year, however, its median sale had reached $25,000, pushing the town past Camden, whose median price of $21,250 is the lowest in the state.
Other major cities fared better, especially near the end of the price rise. From 1985 to 1988, Newark's prices increased 89 percent to $85,000, and New Brunswick's almost doubled, to $131,000.
The housing bubble burst after Wall Street started laying off stockbrokers in 1987. Companies started to cut back, the high prices made many corporations move employees elsewhere and the demand for housing eased. Houses that had sold in three months were sitting on the market for nine months or longer, and sellers began lowering their expectations.
Professor Sternlieb said house prices had already declined in spots and could drop 4 to 12 percent next year, depending on economic conditions will determine whether prices remain depressed.
 
Adjustment in Attitudes
The realignment could change the way that people think about housing, Professor Hughes said. Instead of stretching to buy as much house as possible and banking on appreciation, buyers may be content with less housing and put more money into savings accounts.

HEADLINE: Number of Poor in Boston Is Found to Decline

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The number of people living in poverty here declined in the economic boom of the 1980's, a study by a nonprofit organization has found.
But the study by the Boston Foundation concluded that many of those who recently made their way out of poverty are the most likely to be hurt by the economic problems that have produced a fiscal crisis in the state, leading to $500 million in cuts in government spending and talk of more cuts and taxes.
''This survey was done last fall and spring, at the high point of the Massachusetts economy,'' said the study's chief investigator, Dr. Paul Osterman, at a news conference Monday, when the findings were released. 
In programs to aid the poor, like job training and education, ''Boston and Massachusetts were among the most generous places in the country,'' said Dr. Osterman, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. ''But this population is highly vulnerable to economic downturns and is going to be damaged by the developments in state policies that we are seeing now.''
 
Level Called Understated
Advocates for the poor said the study might understate the amount of poverty because it did not include groups like the homeless and the elderly, which include large numbers of poor people.
People were classified as poor if they earned less than $14,500 for a family of four, which is 125 percent of the amount used in defining the Federal poverty line. The higher amount is used by many state and city agencies because it better reflects the cost of living in Boston. The Federal standard is $11,612 for a family of four.
The study was based on information gathered in interviews from November 1988 and April 1989 with 16,916 households located by making random telephone calls and by going door to door in selected neighborhoods. Figures from the 1980 United States census, adjusted to exclude the same groups, were used for comparison.
The study found that from 1980 to 1989, overall poverty among Boston families fell to 19 percent, from 23.5 percent. Among single parents, poverty decreased to 40.5 percent, from 60.5 percent, and among single individuals, to 5.9 percent, from 22.5 percent.
The breakdowns by race reveal the most about who was left behind as the economy flourished. Among white single parents, the poverty rate declined to 25.7 percent from 56 percent over the period. For black single parents, there was a decline to 35.2 percent from 59.9 percent.
For Hispanic single parents, the poverty rate increased, to 78.7 percent this year from 74 percent in 1980.
 
Groups Excluded in Study
The study, financed by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, which is sponsoring similar studies in five other cities, excluded college students, the elderly, the homeless, Asians and other ethnic groups who did not fall into the major categories. The exclusions meant that only about 387,700 of the 600,000 people living in Boston were reflected in the study.
''We excluded college students because there are so many of them,'' said the foundation's project director, Wendy D. Puriefoy. ''We excluded the elderly because so much work has been done on them, and the homeless because a great deal is known about them.''
Kip Tiernan, the founder of a women's shelter called Rosie's Place, said the study could not be considered a serious examination of poverty without including the homeless, the elderly and others.

HEADLINE: Easing Business Cycles: The Wichita Experience

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan.

 BODY:
This plains city of 300,000, which once boomed as a railhead for Texas cattle, runs these days on airplane production. But unlike the time of the Chisholm Trail, Wichita is far from a one-industry town, and its albeit bumpy ride in the 1980's illustrates a mix of forces that operate in today's diversified economy to blunt both boom and bust.
Confounding those who have repeatedly predicted an imminent lapse into recession, the United States economy has now been growing for seven years, more than three times as long as the average peacetime expansion and second only to the expansion from 1961-69 that encompassed the Vietnam War.
Although few if any experts would say that recession has been permanently banished from American economic life - indeed, some analysts see a slump already under way -many of them note that this remarkable stretch of sustained growth has coincided with some fundamental economic changes, like a larger role for the service sector and an increased international exposure for American business. These shifts in the structure of the American economy suggest that downturns have become fewer and probably less severe. 
 
Uncontrollable Events
Wichita's experience also provides an example of how statistics gauging a $5 trillion national economy mask a myriad of individual gyrations of growth and slump that are often more pronounced than in the nation at large.
Indeed, Wichita demonstrates that a city's fortunes, even allowing for the leveling effects of an increasingly service-oriented economy, owe much to the way uncontrollable or unforeseeable events affect its specific business structure.
''I describe our economy as a five-cylinder engine,'' Gerald S. McDougall, professor of economics at Wichita State University, said, referring to the city's five major industries -small-airplane manufacture, oil and gas, agriculture, military aircraft and the hospitals that make Wichita a regional health-care center.
The overall American economy, except for the second quarter of 1986, when there was a small and belatedly recognized decline in the gross national product, has expanded for 84 straight months. Even with the recent faltering in the manufacturing sector, many analysts say there is a good likelihood of continued growth. The odds, they say, have been considerably enhanced by the changes that have prompted a rethinking of the American business cycle.
Thus, instead of sharp boom-to-bust cycles, the United States economy in recent years has fluctuated within a more narrow range. ''It's been a series of mini-expansions and mini-setbacks within the national expansion,'' said Francis H. Schott, chief economist for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. This muted pattern, he added, is ''the key reason why the recovery has lasted seven years.''
 
'Rolling Readjustment'
Innumerable down-and-up Wichitas, in other words, have counterbalanced up-and-down Houstons, Peorias, Detroits and Spartanburgs in a process economists have come to call ''rolling readjustment.'' Indeed, only Florida ''has been completely free of having some sort of slowdown'' during the 1980's, said James F. Smith, an economist who teaches finance at the University of North Carolina.
Most specialists also commend the Federal Reserve for its conduct of monetary policy, particularly when it moved aggressively to cut interest rates at the time of full-blown recession alerts in late 1984 and mid-1986.
Here in Wichita, where manufacturing's share of the work force has fallen to 26 percent of jobs from 32 percent a decade ago, service jobs have increased sharply with the rise of industries like telemarketing and franchising and the growth of health services. It is true that some of this increase reflected a trend in which manufacturers began to contract with service companies to perform payroll, janitorial and other functions they formerly did for themselves. Still, the gain in service jobs helped minimize the pain when the light-airplane business went sour in the early 1980's.
Service jobs, while often paying less, are generally less subject to shifts in the business climate than production jobs.
 
A Manufacturing Boom
Despite its unusually diversified economy, Kansas's biggest city lagged badly in coming out of the 1981-82 national recession. It was jolted again in 1986 when the price of oil collapsed. Now, showing that economics, like politics, is intensely local, the city is enjoying something of a manufacturing boom even as American factory activity sags.
Wichita's main producers of small aircraft - the Beech Aircraft Corporation, the Cessna Aircraft Company and the Learjet Corporation -produce more such planes than the rest of the country.
The city also gets economic contributions from the 10 franchise operations that have headquarters here, including locally founded Pizza Hut; from the McConnell Air Force Base, and from the state university, which has 17,000 students.
 
'We Got Clobbered'
Growth was strong during the 1970's, skirting even national downturns, but just after that four of the ''cylinders'' conked out. ''We got clobbered,'' Professor McDougall said.
The market for small planes all but disappeared, plummeting 50 percent in dollar value - much more in number of units - between 1981 and 1983.
This debacle was the result of stratospheric interest rates, fears about fuel supplies and liability lawsuits, recession belt-tightening by corporate buyers and a product-cycle transition from pistons to jets.
Agriculture and oil and gas suffered here as elsewhere in the great disinflation of the early 1980's, when the Fed's credit-tightening to bring down inflation led to steep drops in commodity prices. Wichita's oil companies, most of them small and many with marginal properties, suffered disproportionately as prices tumbled below costs of production.
Even revenue from medical care slumped after the Government tightened Medicare reimbursements.
This left Boeing Military Airplanes, benefiting from the Reagan Administration's military buildup, as the only major expansionary force.
 
A Slow Recovery
Although Wichita's unemployment rate at its worst averaged 8.5 percent in 1982, a point below the national average, the early part of the decade was a grim period here and the city did not start to pull out of recession until about 18 months after the nation at large. Indeed, it was not until 1987 that employment here regained its pre-recession peaks.
The three small-plane producers, now employing 11,000 workers, appear to have been significantly strengthened by their takeover during the first half of the decade by outsiders who could finance research and development. Beech, now beginning to deliver its new Starship business turboprop, was acquired by Raytheon, while Cessna was acquired by General Dynamics and Learjet by Integrated Acquisitions, a Wall Street entity.
Wichita's vast Boeing operation is likely to get plenty of new commercial business to make up for any contraction in military spending, so the city finds itself well positioned for any new downturn.
''We've got a manufacturing base in the only industry in which the U.S. is still the world's dominant player,'' said Marvin L. Wynn, chief operating officer for Wi/Se, a city-county development agency.
 
Mood Is Cautious
But for all the signs of resurgence, including a continued assault by new developments and shopping malls on the wheat fields at the edge of town, the mood among Wichita's business people and shoppers is one of caution.
Retail sales have grown scarcely at all in recent years, after adjustment for inflation, and the baffled salesmen at Bulger Cadillac-Oldsmobile on down-at-the-heels East Douglas Street suspect that the lack of customers reflects much more than a hangover from the recently settled Boeing strike.
Roy Jones, retired from his truck dealership in nearby Hutchinson, was asked recently at the Towne East Square mall about his mood. Gesturing toward the stores, where his wife and another relative had disappeared, he said: ''There's belt-tightening. I told 'em not to buy anything.''

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
At Avis Europe, Solving a Puzzle

BYLINE: By Sarah Bartlett

 BODY:
WITH a palpable slowdown of debt-financed takeovers in the United States, Wall Street merger experts view the prospect of an integrated European market in 1992 and closer ties with a newly emerging Eastern Europe as providing their next frontier. Yet, as the recent experience of Avis Europe P.L.C. shows, acquisitions in Europe can present a dizzying array of problems and challenges that can have large effects on a deal's ultimate cost.
Until recently, Avis Europe was an independent company that had been spun off from its parent in 1986, when the rental-car concern underwent a leveraged buyout. This summer, a consortium of Avis Inc., the General Motors Corporation and Lease International, a Belgian company, decided to acquire the company in a $1.6 billion transaction. As a result, Avis now owns about 9 percent, G.M. 26 percent and their Belgian partner 65 percent. 
To acquire the company, and allow for a healthy increase in working capital, the consortium intends to arrange a permanent loan of about $2.5 billion, and therein lies the problem. The consortium's headquarters, and therefore the logical source of the debt, are in London. Yet British interest rates are around 14 percent, five percentage points higher than those in France and seven percentage points higher than those in West Germany, to name but two of the many other countries where Avis operates and where much of the income to service the debt will be generated.
There were other reasons to get the debt out of Britain. Among them was that if the debt was more equally distributed across the Continent and serviced with local currency, the consortium could minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations. ''There was a substantial benefit to getting the debt down to the operating entities,'' said Louis Perlmutter, a senior partner at Lazard Freres & Company, which structured the transaction. But that was no simple matter. Each of the more than 11 other countries has a different set of laws governing how much money can be transferred out of the country, how much debt can be assumed by a local subsidiary, and how much interest they will allow to be deducted from corporate taxes.
To be sure, as 1992 approaches, many of these corporate and accounting conventions are likely to become more standardized, and recent discussions about a common currency and central bank could ultimately lead to a far simpler deal-making environment. In addition, few European companies have the breadth of operations that Avis has.
Nevertheless, the acquisition of a company that operates in even two or three European countries will result in many of these same considerations, and in the interim period when many highly leveraged transactions are likely to be consummated, issues like those that Avis faced are likely to be similar for many other potential acquirers. ''These kinds of transactions will have increasing applicability in the future,'' said Charles E. Golden, the treasurer of General Motors. To facilitate the Avis transaction, Lazard designed a computer model to figure out the optimal placement of debt to minimize taxes, maximize the effect of lower interest rates and avoid running afoul of corporate laws on currency and dividend outflows.
To help unravel the puzzle, Lazard worked with its London cousin, Lazard Brothers, and the Paris office of the law firm Debevoise Plimpton. In addition, local tax and legal consultants were hired in many of the countries where Avis operates. The solution arrived at, after nearly 10 weeks of analysis, was the equivalent of 10 leveraged buyouts.
Of the $2.5 billion permanent financing that the consortium is in the process of arranging, about 80 percent will be placed outside Britain. Besides the high interest rates there, the low corporate tax rate in Britain limited the amount of interest that could be deducted. In Britain, the corporate tax rate is 35 percent, compared with 42 percent in France and Portugal, 46 percent in Italy and 50 percent in West Germany.
On the other hand, there are laws in West Germany, for instance, that limit how much a local company can borrow in relation to its own earning power. Similarly, when Lazard tried to plan for a subsidiary to send dividends or earnings back to the British parent, it faced a host of different withholding tax levels. In Spain the tax is 20 percent, but in Portugal and Belgium it is only 15 percent.
''Every time we solved one problem, four others arose in other jurisdictions,'' Mr. Perlmutter said. He would not put a figure on how much Avis ultimately saved by spreading its debt across Europe, nor was he willing to divulge how much Lazard charged for providing this service.
Europe may indeed be the land of opportunity to American corporations and Wall Street deal makers. But if the experience of Avis Europe is an example, aspirin would seem to be one necessary ingredient for a successful deal.

HEADLINE: GATT Talks With China

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Chinese delegates were asked numerous questions about their economic policies as GATT member states reopened talks on Beijing's bid to rejoin the world trade forum, officials said today.
The working session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this week is the first since Beijing crushed China's pro-democracy movement last June. 
The Chinese Deputy Foreign Trade Minister, Shen Jueren, said his country's three-year program to control high inflation had not changed the direction of the economic overhaul begun a decade ago.
Other delegates questioned him about the role of the private sector, price policies, changes in import licensing systems and the availability of foreign exchange.
The United States, the 12-nation European Community, Canada, Australia and Switzerland were prominent among the questioners, the officials said.
The exchanges occurred at a private two-day session of a GATT working party that has been considering an application by China submitted for membership three years ago.
China was a founding member of GATT, which sets rules for about 80 percent of world trade based on free-market principles. It quit in 1950 after a Communist government came to power but it applied in 1986 to regain its seat. It now has observer status.

The deficit in the broadest measure of the nation's trade shrank 29 percent in the third quarter, to $22.69 billion, the smallest trade gap in almost six years.
The Commerce Department said today that the current account deficit narrowed by $9.40 billion from a second- quarter imbalance of $32.08 billion. The third-quarter deficit was the smallest since a $20.9 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1984. 
The improvement reflected a big jump in the overseas earnings of United States companies. But economists, who noted that the earnings rise mostly reflected a weaker dollar, said the report did nothing to change their view that the nation's trade deficit will remain stuck at a high level through most of the next decade.
The current account, also known as the balance of payments, measures not only trade in merchandise but also trade in services, the category that includes investment earnings between countries.
 
Surplus in Services Sector
For the third quarter, the services category registered a surplus of $8.72 billion after posting a $1.66 billion deficit from April through June, the first services deficit in three decades.
But the services swing from deficit to surplus was attributed almost totally to changes in the value of the dollar. In the third quarter, the dollar was declining, meaning that the profits that United States earned in foreign currencies were worth more when translated into dollars.
The big swing in services helped offset a small increase in the merchandise trade deficit, which climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent to $27.75 billion in the third quarter, and a rise in foreign aid and pension payments, which climbed 27 percent, to $3.66 billion.
Analysts predict that the services account will dip permanently into a deficit sometime early in the 1990's, reflecting the fact that the United States is now the world's largest debtor nation.
The nation's net debtor position stood at $532.5 billion at the end of last year and is expected to worsen by an additional $100 billion this year.
Through the first nine months of this year, the current account deficit was running at an annual rate of $113.55 billion, down modestly from $126.55 billion in 1988.

HEADLINE: Changes On Benefits In Texas

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Texas lawmakers approved changes on Tuesday in the way benefits would be assigned to workers for job-related injuries and deaths, with business groups and insurers triumphing in a long feud with trial lawyers and union officials.
The fallout from rising insurance rates, coupled with growing underwriting losses reported by many insurers in Texas, had dampened the state's economic recovery and was a factor in forcing some businesses to expand beyond state borders. $1.41 Versus $1.22 Insurance companies have reported increasing underwriting losses in the state, paying out $1.41 in claims and expenses for every dollar of premium received from employers in the last five years, compared with $1.22 nationally. 
''In the long term, these changes should help stabilize the system,'' said Nick Huestis, a vice president for workers' compensation issues at the Texas Association of Business, a lobbying organization in Austin. ''In three or four years, we hope we will get significant rate reductions.''
Senator Carl A. Parker, a Democrat who led the opposition to the new law, told The Associated Press that the changes would prevent many injured workers from obtaining fair benefits. Another opponent, Senator Kent Caperton, also a Democrat, said before voting that the bill was ''evil, wicked and mean.''
Soaring medical expenses and the unusually active involvement of trial lawyers in settling benefit disputes contributed to what in 1990 will be a fourfold increase in yearly premiums paid by businesses in Texas since 1983, to $4 billion. 25% of Settlements In other states, lawyers are involved in 8 percent of benefit settlements. In Texas, the figure is more than 50 percent. Trial lawyers in most states receive 15 percent of settlement payments; in Texas they receive 25 percent.
Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill, which would also restrict access to jury trials by workers, employers or insurers to issues related to how state-appointed mediators ruled in a case.
Under the current law, the administrative ruling could not be reviewed by a jury, and disputes were tried by lawyers as if a state-appointed mediator had never heard the case.
The Texas system also pays unusually low benefits to severely injured and permanently disabled workers, compared with benefits in other large industrial states. The new law, which takes effect in January 1991, raises the maximum weekly payment to $416, from $238, for such workers, as well as for widows and orphans of workers killed on the job.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increased By 0.8% in November

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In a report providing some reassurance that economic expansion will continue into 1990, the Commerce Department said today that retail sales climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, the biggest gain since August.
But while this was a bigger and broader advance than was generally expected, economists noted that it was accompanied by revisions showing poorer sales than previously estimated for September and October. The November gain thus resulted almost entirely from the reduction in the earlier two months, and was therefore more illusory than real, preventing any outbreak of enthusiasm about the holiday sales period.
''I don't read a lot of strength into these numbers,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''The image of the consumer is that they're not doing much.'' 
Tending to support this view was a separate report today from the nation's auto makers showing that sales of cars made in the United States fell 28 percent in the first 10 days of December from the 1988 period.
 
Responding to Bargains
Nevertheless, various analysts took some comfort from November's sales figures, which did at least suggest that consumers continue to spend when offered bargains. The rise, said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, ''may indicate that consumers are responding strongly to price discounts'' that have become prevalent in the Christmas shopping season. With incomes rising and inflation subdued, he said, ''fears of a poor Christmas season should abate with this report.''
This, in turn, suggested that the Federal Reserve may be a bit less eager to take its next step toward lower interest rates, a move that is still widely expected to occur in the wake of next week's meeting of its main policy-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee.
The increase in November's sales embraced both durable goods -those expected to last at least three years - and nondurables, with drugstores the only category showing a decline.
 
Durable Goods Up 0.7%
Durable goods were up seven-tenths of 1 percent over all from the October level, as building materials climbed 2 percent, gains at auto dealers were five-tenths of 1 percent and sales at furniture stores rose 1.6 percent.
Among nondurables, which rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, gains at general merchandise stores were seven-tenths of 1 percent; at food stores, eight-tenths of 1 percent; at both gasoline stations and eating and drinking places, nine-tenths of 1 percent, and at apparel stores, 2.4 percent. The decline at drugstores was one-tenth of 1 percent.
All except furniture and food stores, however, posted sales declines in October, which is now shown to have suffered a 1.3 percent overall decline instead of the 1 percent drop initially estimated.
September's advance was pared back by the Commerce Department today to three-tenths of 1 percent, from seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Sales for November, at $144.56 billion, were actually slightly below the $145.29 billion now established for September, adjusted for seasonal and holiday differences but not for inflation.
 
'Still Rather Sluggish'
Last month's sales were 3.6 percent above those of November 1988, but analysts noted that sales fell slightly in real terms - when adjusted for inflation - because consumer prices over the last year have risen by about 4.5 percent.
''Retail sales this year are still rather sluggish,'' said Brian S. Wesbury of Stotler Economics, in Chicago, commenting on today's results. But he also said he took some comfort in the fact that the consumer could at least be enticed with price cuts.
''It seems like everything in America is on sale,'' said Mr. Wesbury, who said he had expected discounted prices to erode retail sales in November but who now say lower prices served instead to enhance sales.
If so, this suggests that consumers may have begun heavy holiday shopping earlier than usual this year, perhaps setting a pace that cannot be sustained and leading to December disappointment.
 
A Sampling of 3,200
The department's survey of retail sales is based on 3,200 sampling units - retail chains, individual stores, restaurants, auto dealers - that supply their results by mail or phone. Many, however, base their bookkeeping on weekly intervals ending on Saturday, so for November the department had to estimate results for the final five days of the month.

HEADLINE: New-Home Completions

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Completions of new homes fell by 3.5 percent in October, to an annual rate of 1.31 million units, in the second consecutive monthly decline, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
The department also revised September's decline to 5.5 percent, to a rate of 1.36 million units, from a previously reported drop of 9.3 percent. 
The figures offered further evidence of weakness in the housing market, with both home construction and sales at a sluggish pace.
Economists predicted the housing market could get a lift if mortgage rates came down further, but so far buyers have been reluctant to purchase homes and builders have been cautious about starting new projects.
The department said October completions were 13.5 percent lower than in October 1988.
Completions of single-family homes rose 2.7 percent, to an annual rate of 978,000 units, while multifamily dwellings fell 18.1 percent, to 334,000 units.
Housing completions were down in all regions, falling 7.6 percent in the Northeast, 2.7 percent in the Midwest, 1.9 percent in the South and 4.4 percent in the West.

Yields Flat Or Off a Bit

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market mutual funds surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were unchanged to slightly down for the week ended yesterday.
Noting that the economy remains sluggish, analysts say they expect money fund yields to continue their slow descent for the next few months. They also see the Federal Reserve determined to check inflation but in no hurry to ease short-term interest rates. 
But Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's, said he believes a rising unemployment rate going well into the first quarter of 1990 will force the central bank to act more decisively. 7-Day Yield Off 5 Basis Points Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market mutual fund declined 5 basis points, to 8.21 percent, while the 30-day yield, which usually lags behind market activity, fell 3 basis points, to 8.26 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Assets of taxable funds fell by $49.4 million, to a total of $361 billion - a small decline compared with previous weeks.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios declined by a day, to 43.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that were surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, the Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market fund again had the best return, with a yield of 9.13 percent, down a basis point from last week and 92 basis points better than the average yield this week.
 
Rise in Tax-Exempt Assets
Tax-exempt assets increased $705 million, to $71.7 billion, as the average seven-day compounded yield remained unchanged at 5.71 percent. For investors seeking a taxable equivalent, that rate means the yield would be 7.91 percent for those in a 28 percent tax bracket and 8.52 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
Three funds tied for top performer in the tax-exempt category this week. The Evergreen Tax-Exempt Money Market fund, the General California Tax-Exempt Money Market fund and the Calvert Tax Free Reserves Money Market fund all posted a 6.28 percent return, down 5 basis points from a week ago and 57 points better than the average.
By contrast, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed the average yield for a bank money market account was down 2 basis points, to 6.35 percent, while the average yield for a six-month C.D. fell 3 basis points, to 7.98 percent.
For C.D.'s with longer maturities, yields were also down. A one-year C.D. fell 4 basis points, to 8 percent, and a two-and-a-half-year C.D. fell 2 basis points, to 7.96 percent, with the five-year certificate off 3 basis points, to yield 7.96 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Higher as Dow Rises by 8.96 Points

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
The stock market moved higher yesterday in more active trading, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.96 points, to 2,761.09.
Advancing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declining issues, 791 to 734. Volume on the Big Board climbed to 184.7 million shares, from 176.8 million on Tuesday. 
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.02 points, to 352.75, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.57, to 195.01.
 
'A Filtering Process'
''The market continues to go through a filtering process whereby quality and high-yield issues continue to attract retail and institutional money,'' said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management in Princeton, N.J.
''Specifically telephone, oils and utilities are exhibiting strength on good cash flow and high yields,'' he said. ''These issues also are generally recession proof.'' The Dow utility average yesterday hit another record, rising 1.82 points, to 233.46.
Mr. Barbanel pointed out that technology stocks continue to be under pressure, partly on expectations that the market share of Europe companies will grow.
Digital Equipment dropped 2 3/8, to 82 5/8; I.B.M. fell 1 1/8, to 95 7/8; Motorola slipped 5/8, to 57, and Hewlett-Packard dipped 3/8, to 45 3/8.
Oil issues, which had been strong on Tuesday, were mixed yesterday after an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, Richard Pzena, removed ''buy'' recomendations on seven stocks. Mr. Pzena said oil prices were likely to decline by $2 to $3 a barrel in the next few months from their recent price of $20.50 a barrel.
Exxon slipped 1/2, to 50 3/4; Royal Dutch Petroleum slipped 3/8, to 76 3/8; Texaco dipped 7/8, to 56 1/4; Philips Petroleum was unchanged at 25 7/8; Unocal added 1/4, to 30 7/8, and Amoco was off 3/4, to 54 7/8.
Traders said stocks also received an early spurt from a larger-than-expected increase in November retail sales of eight-tenths of 1 percent. Many economists had expected zero growth for the month. October's increase was revised downward to 1.3 percent from a decline of 1 percent.
Woolworth gained 1 5/8, to 63, and J. C. Penney rose 1 1/4, to 72 1/8, as both benefited from the retail figures as well as a strong buy recommendation from Kidder, Peabody & Company, analysts said.
Tomorrow the merchandise trade figures for November and producer prices report will be released.
The Chemical Banking Corporation was the most active stock, slipping 5/8, to 31 1/2, on a volume of nearly 3.1 million shares.
UAL was the biggest point loser, falling 8, to 168 3/4. Traders attributed the drop to expectations that no new deal for the airline holding company would result from yesterday's meeting of the UAL board.
The drop in UAL, and other airline stocks, helped depress the Dow transportation average by 8.54 points, to 1,203.59. AMR was off 3/4, to 64; Pan Am slipped 1/4, to 2 5/8, and USAir eased 3/8, to 35 3/8.
Actively traded blue chips included A.T.&T., up 1 1/2, to 46 5/8, and Philip Morris, up 1/4, to 43.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index edged up 0.64, to 378.05, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index added 0.71, to 451.14.

HEADLINE: Aerospace Decline Seen

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Aerospace Industries Association today predicted a moderate decline in sales in the 1990's because of cuts in United States military spending as East-West tensions ease.
The trade group said in a year-end report that civilian and military aerospace sales were expected to grow this year by 5 percent, to $120.6 billion, but that industry profits would fall by 13 percent, to $4.3 billion. 
''I do not minimize the impact on our industry of the defense spending cuts we know are coming,'' the association's president. Don Fuqua. said. ''We are braced for heavy weather.''
Mr. Fuqua said 1990 sales would rise to $137 billion. But, he added, there will be a decline in military spending in the next decade that will be only partly offset by increased civilian sales.
''We do not expect an impact of catastrophic dimension but rather a moderate decline in real inflation adjusted sales volume, with gains in nondefense business offsetting to a considerable degree the indicated reductions in defense business,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in very light trading again yesterday, as dealers shrugged off a report that suggested that consumers, who account for two-thirds of the economy, remained active last month.
Market participants pushed prices lower immediately after the Commerce Department disclosed that retail sales rose by eight-tenths of a percentage point last month. The gain was much higher than most Wall Street analysts had been anticipating.
Closer inspection of the numbers disclosed that much of the buying was related to Hurricane Hugo and the earthquake that shook Northern California, and therefore could not be viewed as truly representative of consumer buying patterns. Perhaps more important, analysts said, was the fact that retail sales figures for the previous two months were both revised downward. 
''The revisions to the September and October figures were so negative that they really drained the amount of gain recorded for November,'' said Neil M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''Once you slice through the numbers, the headline of up 0.8 percent loses a lot of its power.''
 
Traders Seem Unimpressed
Traders also seemed unimpressed by an anemic sales performance by Detroit in the first 10 days of December. The nation's auto manufacturers reported yesterday that sales during the period fell a steep 28 percent, to a 5.5 million annual rate.
''That number overstates the weakness,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''But if they get any weaker, they will have to start listing sales individually.''
Mr. Fine and others said the real import of the sales figures lay in future production and employment levels in Detroit. ''You will see a lot more plant closings and layoffs'' in the first quarter of 1990, said Ram Bhagavatula, chief financial economist at Citicorp Investment Bank.
Still, some market participants said the retail sales numbers might have been strong enough to persuade the Federal Reserve Board to delay any further easing of credit policy.
 
Easing at Fed Expected
''After today, you have to maybe look for the Fed to ease sometime after the first of the year,'' one government bond trader said. ''Things seem to be going O.K. for the Fed, and I would guess that they might want to take a look at the December employment report before they move again.''
Yesterday the Fed gave no sign it intended to change its current policy course, and Treasury securities remained mired in the narrow trading range they have occupied all week.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 102 26/32, up 3/32, to yield 7.87 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 13/ 32 late yesterday, up 1/32, to yield 7.81 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 2/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.72 percent.
As expected, the Treasury announced late yesterday that it would sell $10 billion worth of new two-year notes on Tuesday and $8 billion of four-year notes on Wednesday.
The two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.71 percent following the announcement. The four-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.73 percent.
Treasury bill rates rose again yesterday, extending an advance that has persisted all week.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.67 percent, up three basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bills were offered at 7.43 percent, up five basis points. And one-year bill rates rose two basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.25 percent.
Elsewhere, United Parcel Service of America Inc. made its first foray into the public debt markets yesterday, offering $700 million of debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
Demand for the issue was so strong that its size was increased from $500 million. The funds will be used to finance the company's expansion overseas.
The 8 3/8 percent U.P.S. debentures, which mature April 1, 2020, were priced at $99, to yield 8.467 percent, 58 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/8 percent 30-year Treasury bonds at the time of pricing. The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Late Tuesday Secured Finance Inc., a special-purpose company set up by the Kroger Company, offered $450 million worth of bonds backed by commercial mortgages. This is the first time that commercial properties of a single company have been used to back a public debt offering in the United States.
The 9.05 percent bonds, which are backed by a guarantee from Financial Security Assurance Inc., were priced at $99.75, to yield 9.08 percent, 1.25 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 7 7/8 percent ten-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. The BT Securities Corporation, Salomon Brothers and Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as co-lead managers for the underwriting, which is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade and tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light yesterday, traders said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Decline Sharply As Soviets Reject Changes

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices fell sharply yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York as the Soviet Union rejected changes that many investors had hoped would lead to a gold-backed Soviet currency.
Futures prices of silver and platinum also plunged.
Separately, heating oil for delivery in January rose for the 11th straight trading session. 
Gold futures fell $9.80 to $10.80, with the contract for delivery in December settling $9.80 lower at $408.10 an ounce; silver finished 12.8 cents to 13.8 cents lower on the Comex, with December at $5.544 an ounce.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures sank $13.70 to $14.10, with the January contract settling at $504.70 an ounce.
From mid-October through late November, gold soared from near $360 an ounce to almost $420, partly on speculation that the changes sweeping Eastern Europe would include a move by the Soviet Union to back its currency, the ruble, with gold.
Such a move would greatly increase the value of the ruble on the world market, where it is now almost useless, so the Soviet Union could improve its trade with other countries.
A gold-backed ruble was apparently not discussed by the Soviet Parliament yesterday, but they rejected other radical economic changes. That disappointed gold traders who had hoped for some strong indication of change, analysts said.
''There's been a lot of speculation but so far not anything done, and I think that's kind of frustrated people,'' said Stephen Platt, metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ''People were looking for something out of the Politburo.''
James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, said the gold selloff also appeared linked to the persistent rumor that the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had offered to resign.
January heating oil futures surged on the New York Mercantile Exchange following the American Petroleum Institute's report late Tuesday of an unexpectedly large reduction in American stocks of petroleum distillates last week. Extremely cold weather in Europe and the United States has kept demand for heating oil strong. Other energy futures were mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 12 cents higher, with January at $20.77 a barrel; heating oil was 0.60 cent lower to 0.66 cent higher, with January up 0.66 cent at 67.96 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.10 cent to 0.20 cent lower, with January at 51.93 cents a gallon.
