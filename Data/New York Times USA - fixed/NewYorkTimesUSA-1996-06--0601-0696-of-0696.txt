HEADLINE: Dole Campaign Plans an Attack On Clinton's Economic Record

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Bob Dole's campaign advisers say they are planning a stepped-up attack on President Clinton's economic record, having concluded that despite low unemployment and inflation there is enough anxiety among voters about job security and stagnant incomes to leave the Administration vulnerable.
Their strategy, the advisers said, would be to argue that Mr. Clinton does not deserve credit for the ways in which the nation's economy is performing well, and should be blamed for tax increases and spending policies that they contend have undermined economic growth, creating a climate of insecurity and forcing workers to run harder just to stay in place. 
 The advisers said the economic campaign would begin in earnest this fall, after Mr. Dole announced his own economic policy package, probably about the time the Republican National Convention is held in San Diego this August.
Mr. Dole, the party's likely Presidential nominee, is expected to embrace a tax-cutting package as the centerpiece of a "pro-growth" economic platform, although he has yet to decide on details.
If the Dole campaign follows through on the plan to attack Mr. Clinton's economic record, it would be seeking to turn to its advantage -- or at least to neutralize -- an issue that the Administration has long considered one of its strengths.
The President often boasts of the economy's performance in creating more than eight million jobs since he took office, most of them paying good wages. He says the current combination of low inflation and unemployment with steady growth is one that no other Administration has sustained since the 1960's.
Democrats said they viewed the Dole camp as shifting away from a strategy of hoping that the economy would weaken this year, which has not happened, to one of asking whether this is the best the economy can do -- a question they said they are happy to debate.
"If they want to go head to head on the economic record, let's rock and roll," said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to the President.
While Mr. Dole regularly criticizes Mr. Clinton for raising taxes and for not being truly committed to balancing the Federal budget, he has only occasionally articulated broader economic themes.
The former Kansas Senator has spoken only in passing about such issues as corporate downsizing, and has offered few specific prescriptions for improving the nation's long-term economic performance or addressing worker anxiety.
Mr. Dole's advisers have floated a variety of proposals in the last two months, including an across-the-board tax cut and incentives to increase savings and investment.
While Mr. Dole is likely to adopt some form of tax cut, neither he nor his aides have given any indication of how they could cut taxes without calling for politically unpopular spending cuts or undermining Mr. Dole's longtime reputation for fiscal rectitude.
And while the candidate's advisers clearly see political opportunity in the anxiety felt by workers, they are likely to avoid any direct attacks on corporate America for laying off workers; instead, they will probably focus on broader issues of how to allow the economy to create more jobs.
Formulation of Mr. Dole's economic plan is being overseen by Vin Weber, a former Minnesota Congressman who is coordinating the campaign's overall policy development with Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was White House chief of staff under President Gerald R. Ford.
They are synthesizing research and ideas from a group of informal advisers that includes Senators Connie Mack of Florida and Robert F. Bennett of Utah; Robert Lighthizer, a former Senate aide who is now a Washington lawyer and Dole campaign official, and a group of economists whose work is being coordinated by John Taylor of Stanford University.
Mr. Dole met with Mr. Taylor last week in California to discuss policy ideas, campaign aides said.
Mr. Dole has at times appeared uncomfortable in pressing economic themes. Last February, in the New Hampshire primary campaign, he said he was surprised that jobs and trade had become such big issues. Battling to save his candidacy from the early successes of Patrick J. Buchanan's populist economic themes, Mr. Dole engaged in some tentative corporation-bashing over the issue of downsizing, but then dropped it.
If Mr. Dole's own proposals remain in flux, however, his campaign has already settled on the themes it will use against Mr. Clinton: that although the nation has enjoyed some economic successes in the past few years, they are largely a legacy of Republican policies from the 1980's, and that the nation has been robbed of its full growth potential by the President's 1993 tax increase and his refusal last year to sign the balanced-budget legislation that was passed by the Republican-controlled Congress.
"It's no mystery what's holding America back," Mr. Dole said in a speech in Michigan earlier this month, one of just a handful he has devoted to economic themes. "It's the wrong-headed, outdated, liberal policies that can all be summed up in one word: Clintonomics. And you know, one of the most amazing things about the present Administration is they actually boast about the anemic, substandard growth their policies have created."
A top adviser to Mr. Dole said a full-scale attack on Mr. Clinton's economic policies would be delayed until after the Republican convention to allow Mr. Dole time to finish developing his own package and to avoid "frittering away" an issue that the campaign believes can illustrate the differences between the candidates.
"The economic issues will be a core part of the fall campaign, and Dole's economic package will be, if not the centerpiece of the campaign, then a central element in the positive agenda of why he wants to be President," said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"What we have is an economy that has created enough jobs and is strong enough that the conventional wisdom is that Clinton is less vulnerable on the economy than on other issues," the adviser said, adding:
"What the research we've been doing indicates to us is that there is a significant amount of economic anxiety out there -- not just among blue-collar and the more vulnerable members of the work force, but anxiety that is spread among women and men that does not discontinue when you hit the middle class. There is no question that the anxiety is such that the incumbent is vulnerable."
In addition to tax cuts and fundamental changes in the tax system, the Dole campaign is considering programs to encourage more savings, speed the budget-balancing process, slash government regulation of business, create incentives for more job training programs and overhaul the education system.
"We have the ammunition to undermine Clinton's commitment to growth, to tax reform and to less spending," said Senator Mack, who has been arguing for months that worker anxiety gives Republicans an opportunity to take a more aggressive stance on economic issues.
"That's one reason the Dole folks look forward to that kind of debate," he added. "They sense vulnerability."
In a memorandum last month to summarize the views of Mr. Dole's economic advisers, Mr. Taylor, the Stanford economist, laid out an argument that acknowledges the positive aspects of the nation's economic performance, but denies the President any credit for it.
"Thanks to economic policies put in place in the early 1980's to reduce inflation and keep it low, the U.S. economy is now experiencing, back-to-back, the two longest peacetime expansions in its history," Mr. Taylor wrote.
He said the first expansion begin in 1982 in the Reagan Administration and the second in 1991 after a recession during the Bush Administration.
The most pressing problem now, Mr. Taylor wrote, is a long-term trend of declines in productivity -- output per worker or per hour of work -- which most economists agree is the most important determinant of overall economic growth.
In the Clinton Administration, he said, productivity growth has fallen to new lows, resulting in weak wage growth and a declining savings rate.
Earlier this month ,in an economic debate sponsored by Dow Jones, Mr. Lighthizer said: "We think this is the worst recovery on record, in terms of G.D.P. growth, in terms of productivity growth, in terms of wage increases. The fact is that this economy is good for some people. It is not good for most people. It is clearly worse than it was during the Reagan expansion."

HEADLINE: BOMBING IN SAUDI ARABIA: THE SAUDIS;
Bombing Attack Raises Questions About Stability of Saudi Government

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The bombing attack against an American target in Saudi Arabia could not have come at a worse time for the ruling royal family, coinciding with a vacuum in the Saudi leadership and increasing opposition to American influence in the kingdom.
After a stroke last November, King Fahd lost much of his short-term memory, but he can still vividly remember stories from his childhood. "He moves in and out of lucidity," a senior American intelligence official said. "He'll be in the middle of a meeting and all of a sudden will say, 'Where am I? What am I doing here?' " 
 After the stroke the King briefly handed power to Crown Prince Abdullah, his half-brother and designated heir. The Crown Prince began to run the day-to-day operations of Government, but without the authority to make major policy decisions.
These tensions within the ruling family have made it more difficult to deal with an increasingly militant opposition, which argues that the conservative Islamic kingdom, which strictly enforces Islamic law, is not Islamic enough.
It is not known whether Tuesday's attack was carried out by Saudi Arabia's growing Islamic opposition or inspired by a foreign power.
But the assumption of the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is that the truck bombing is linked to a similar attack last November on an American military compound in Riyadh, the capital.
"This is the time for decisive decision-making and that's precisely what the Saudis don't have because there is no decision-maker," said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a private consulting firm in Washington, and an expert on the kingdom. "Even though the succession is clear if Fahd dies tomorrow, he is not dead yet. So who runs the show?"
Early this year, for example, when Crown Prince Abdullah tried to pay Saudi farmers at least part of $2.8 billion in subsidies the Government owed them, he was blocked by other family members who thought he was overstepping his authority.
Prince Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz al-Saud, the Minister of Defense, and Prince Nayif bin Abd al-Aziz al-Saud, the Minister of the Interior, both of whom are brothers of the King, were particularly incensed, according to people close to the royal family. The result was that in February, King Fahd announced that he was better and that he was resuming control.
The Administration plays down the significance of King Fahd's illness.
"The King did call Clinton yesterday, and my understanding is that it went well," said Ray Mabus, who recently left the post as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia to work on Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign. "Fahd expressed his condolences and said he would spare no effort in tracking down those responsible and punishing them."
But Mr. Mabus acknowledged that since the King was speaking in Arabic through an interpreter, it was hard to judge just how lucid he was.
Other American officials say Prince Abdullah is essentially in charge of the kingdom. They point to the fact that it was he who agreed to a request from Mr. Clinton to help finance the arming and training of the Bosnian Army, contributing $50 million to the effort. He has also filled in for the King in recent months in various Arab summit meetings.
Although the Saudis believed initially that the November attack, which left five Americans and two Indians dead, could only have been carried out by a foreign enemy like Iran, Iraq or the Sudan, it turned out to have been home-grown. Four Saudi citizens were arrested in connection with the attack in April and beheaded a few weeks later.
All four were in their mid-20's, had limited education and worked at low-paying jobs in Riyadh. In confessions, which read as though they had been dictated and may have been coerced, three said they had fought on the side of the Muslim rebels against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan, where they received religious, weapons and explosives training. One said he had fought on the side of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government in the Balkans.
The men also acknowledged ideological links to well-known Islamic extremists abroad, including Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman living in the Sudan, and the Islamic Group, which has tried to overthrow the Egyptian Government for four years.
The Administration was dismayed by the swiftness of the executions, which eliminated any opportunity to further interrogate the four men to determine whether there may have others involved and who may have financed and organized the plot.
Although there is no proof yet, the Administration is concerned that Tuesday's bombing may have been carried out in retaliation for the executions and that opposition to the Saudi Government may be much more serious than was previously thought. That raises the question of the continued American military presence in Saudi Arabia.
The kingdom cracked down on internal opposition in 1994, arresting some Islamic leaders and expelling others. But it has failed to address the basic problems that contribute to the discontent: mounting unemployment, a population explosion (75 percent of the population is under the age of 30) and rampant corruption, particularly within the royal family.
The United States, which is identified closely with King Fahd, is an easy and visible target.
"By striking a blow at a U.S. military target, you're attacking the Saudi regime," an American official said.
The fact that the bombing was aimed at an American military target and not at a Saudi oil installation suggests, to some experts, that the attackers may want to challenge specific policies of the Saudi Government, not overthrow it.
"Damaging the oil sector would damage more than the Government." said Mr. Zanoyan. "It would damage the country."

HEADLINE: BOMBING IN SAUDI ARABIA: THE OVERVIEW;
Saudis, Aided by the F.B.I., Seek Blast Clues

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, June 26

 BODY:
Surveying the ruins left by a blast that tore the face from an eight-story apartment building in a military complex here on Tuesday night and killed 19 American servicemen, American and Saudi officials insisted today that the attack would not diminish their close military cooperation.
The enormous explosion, which officials said was significantly more powerful than the bomb that demolished the Oklahoma City Federal Building in April 1995, left bathtubs and mattresses dangling from a structure rent open as if it were a doll house. It blew out windows a half-mile away, and wounded hundreds. 
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who interrupted a Middle East peacemaking trip to fly here and survey the damage, declared the blast "a direct and deliberate attack on the citizens of the United States and our friends and allies."
Twenty-four hours after the explosion, neither the motive nor the identity of those responsible was known, and American and Saudi officials said it was too soon to speculate about who would have carried out the attack, at the largest air base in Saudi Arabia.
American officials said a team sent by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was already moving in to assist Saudi investigators search for the clues that might identify who was behind the blast.
But they emphasized that the Saudi authorities would take the lead in the inquiry.
The bombing, the second aimed at American military personnel in Saudi Arabia in seven months, compounded an atmosphere of uncertainty in the country at a time when King Fahd has been weakened by a stroke and the leadership is contending with mounting internal dissent. [Page A11.]
Both Mr. Christopher and Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Minister, vowed that the attack would not deter their two countries from their extensive military cooperation, which has brought thousands of American service personnel to bases here as part of an effort to contain the threats posed by Iran and Iraq.
Visibly moved as he walked through broken glass and concrete rubble as dusk fell this evening, Mr. Christopher said, "It's a very bleak day for all of us."
All 19 people killed in the attack were Americans, and all were apparently inside the building at the edge of the sprawling compound just after 10 P.M. on Tuesday when a man stopped a fuel truck packed with explosives just outside the perimeter fence. The man then climbed into an accomplice's vehicle, leaving a fused bomb to erupt four minutes later and dig a crater 30 feet deep. Because of confusion at the scene, the initial death toll was reported to be as high as 23.
Similarities between Tuesday's attack and the bombing last November of a United States military compound in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, which left five American civilians and two Indians dead, prompted suspicions of a possible link. Tuesday's blast came despite or perhaps in retaliation for the public beheading last month of four Saudis who confessed to having carried out the November attack.
A telephoned threat to the United States Embassy in Riyadh after the executions vowed venegeance for the four killings. Today a man called the London-based Arabic language newspaper Al Arab and claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack in the name of a previously unknown group. He vowed that it would carry out similar attacks unless the Saudis expelled all American and other foreign troops "occupying the holy Saudi land."
Other early theories pointed toward Iraq and Iran, whom the United States and its allies in the region have sought to isolate by a policy of containment backed by military might.
The only mission of the Air Force unit whose personnel bore the brunt of the attack is to patrol the skies over southern Iraq to enforce strict United Nations-backed provisions put in place after the 1991 Persian Gulf war to protect a Shiite Muslim minority.
Among the threats received by the United States Embassy in Riyadh and consulates since the November blast have been crude drawings implying that that bomb was only a beginning.
For the last six weeks news of the drawings has been placed on a recorded message for the attention of callers to the embassy.
Yet while that message has urged American citizens to exercise caution, it avoided sounding outright alarm. Even this morning callers heard an assurance that "threats of this nature are not surprising given the security threat in this region."
Tuesday's bombings followed repeated warnings that American targets in Saudi Arabia might again be hit by such a blast, and accounts provided by military officials here raised early questions about whether adequate security measures had been taken.
While armed United States military personnel backed up by guard dogs patrol extensively inside the Khobar Towers compound, the officials said jurisdiction outside the perimeter fence, where the powerful bomb exploded, is left to the Saudi civil police, who maintain a less visibile presence.
Prince Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Minister, appeared to acknowledge that there might have been shortcomings in that system, saying at a news conference this evening that "from every tragedy, there are lessons."
But officials from both countries took pains to insist that the attack would do nothing to affect a military partnership that has endured for decades and which both regard as vital to maintaining security in the Persian Gulf region.
Only since the Persian Gulf war have the Saudis allowed the United States to base military personnel in the kingdom in substantial numbers. The increased visibility of the Americans has become a focus for criticism by Islamic conservatives who regard the Western influence as corrupting.
Brig. Gen. Terry Schwalier of the Air Force, the commanding officer of the 4404th Air Wing and its arsenal of nearly 70 F-15's, F-16's and other warplanes, said he had been satisfied with the protection provided by the Saudi police.
And as Mr. Christopher visited a military hospital to which many of the more than 400 wounded were taken, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, said of the explosion, "I think it's an attack on U.S.-Saudi relations, and it will not succeed."
Altogether, doctors at King Abdulaziz Armed Forces hospital said, the wounded included more than 250 Americans, 100 of whom were taken to the hospital. About 65 were expected to remain there overnight. The less seriously wounded included 147 Saudis and 118 Bangladeshis, many of whom were workers in the compound and were cut by flying glass.
American military officials said the glass had broken as a wave of pressure unloosed by the bomb passed through the compound, shattering windows and toppling furniture.
Tonight the site was eerily quiet as search efforts came to a halt, with everyone accounted for. Water from the nearby Persian Gulf had already formed a small lake at the bottom of the bomb crater.
From Washington today, there were signs that President Clinton might seek to turn the tragedy to a gain. Leaving for a meeting in Lyons, France, of the world's big industrialized countries, Mr. Clinton said he hoped to use the gathering to rally support for measures aimed at combatting terrorism and those who support it.
Mr. Christopher, who began his day with meetings in Cairo aimed at pursuing the quest for Middle East peace after the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel's Prime Minister, also sought to make a more enduring point after he hurried here to look first-hand at the consequences of terrorist violence.
"We and our friends around the world will not be intimidated," said Mr. Christopher, who stopped to see Mr. Netanyahu in Israel on Monday and who met this morning with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. He vowed "to defend peace and those who take risks for peace."

HEADLINE: Storming the Showroom Citadels

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN 

 BODY:
WERE Hercules around today, he would have many, many new labors: toxic-waste dumps to clean, monster budget deficits to wrestle, rogue twisters to tame. And if he had recently acquired a sofa, he might be faced with a task that has foiled many a mortal: buying 30 yards of fine fabric without the help of a decorator.
But for consumers flying solo, shopping for designer fabrics like those in glossy magazines need not require epic fortitude, as I discovered over the course of several weeks in several neighborhoods. 
 Intrepid souls have a range of options, from the workaday decorating departments in places like Janovic Plaza and Gracious Home, right up to the more stylish upholstery-and-decor shops that will guide them from start to finish.
For those who really know what they want, there are the high-end showrooms, where fabrics can cost as little as $20 a yard or as much as $2,000. Economic pressures on these fabric houses have helped pave an unofficial path for consumers to the linens, ducks and velvets of their dreams. Their hallowed "to the trade only" policy is beginning to crumble.
 
Behind the Chintz Curtain
If an unscientific but determined exploration of the legendary Design and Decoration Building recently by a decorator-less bachelor looking for 30 yards of cotton velvet was any indication, even the most haughty will not turn consumers away from a little browsing.
Christopher Kennedy, who manages New York's most prominent design center, at 979 Third Avenue near 58th Street, described the building's new gentler, kinder snobbery: "We're trying to make it a nicer place to get thrown out of."
The policy hasn't changed much since the building opened in 1964: showrooms can admit casual customers but will not sell directly to them. Their preferred customers are professionals who return day after day, week after week. And who have threatened in the past to boycott any showroom that does sell retail. (Many showroom owners, as well as Mr. Kennedy, say it is an open secret that certain showrooms in the D & D building are indeed selling to retail customers.)
For amateur decorators, the good news is that the official policy doesn't really matter. While no one made overtures to sell me fabric, nearly all showrooms were happy to furnish the name of a buying service, decorator or upholsterer who could easily arrange a purchase, either for a fee or a percentage above net price. That would have been considered design heresy five years ago, said Arlene Hirst, a senior editor at Metropolitan Home magazine.
"People have lots of other places to shop," she said, "and showrooms have learned that they have to court the public."
Showrooms are not as exclusive as they once were, especially those that overexpanded in the late 1980's to accommodate the expanding upper-middle class.
"The middle market is drying up," said Christopher Hyland, who has a showroom of specialty fabric on the 17th floor. "Twenty-five years ago, if someone earned a high salary they could put their kids through prep school and college and put damask on the walls. Today, you can barely put the kids through school. We're talking about 80 percent of the population having almost 30 percent less buying power."
Garry Greenberg, the owner of Beckenstein Home Fabrics on Orchard Street, a business that acts as a liaison between consumers and showrooms, agrees. "The mid-to-high-end customer -- my customer -- is definitely off," he said. "I hear the same thing from all my vendors in the D & D Building, that business is off by as much as 30 percent." But he and Mr. Hyland say the high-end manufacturers are not suffering.
On my midday expedition in and around the D & D Building, even the most famously imposing names in fabric -- Clarence House, F. Schumacher & Company, Manuel Canovas, Brunschwig & Fils, Donghia, Osborne & Little -- seemed easily accessible for anyone with the gumption to walk past the supposedly mandatory sign-in books that keep out the fainthearted (most professional decorators do not sign in).
Once inside, things were even easier. Almost all the showroom employees were friendly and extremely adept at suggesting durable, subdued and inexpensive fabrics suitable for my tastes, even if they wouldn't quote exact prices. This was a pleasant surprise since showrooms often say they don't want to sell retail because their staff members are not equipped to answer hundreds of naive questions.
One less-than-friendly exception was Scalamandre, a few doors down from the D & D building, at 934 Third Avenue, where a representative was not happy to hear that I was not a decorator nor was I sure that I planned to hire one. And she was not amused when I told her that all I wanted was a way to buy 30 yards of fabric. When I asked for a ballpark figure on what her leopard-print silk-cotton-viscose velvet might run me, she had had enough.
"You're going to upholster a sofa in that?" she asked, clearly appalled.
Hercules, meet Scalamandre.
But at the showroom of F. Schumacher & Company, at 939 Third Avenue, a showroom employee went so far as to furnish an "800" number, which, when called, offered the telephone numbers of seven sources in Manhattan that could order the house's fabric. One of these, the International Design Supply, on Houston Street, said it would charge 15 percent to 20 percent above the showroom's net price. (Traditionally, decorators charge clients 30 percent to 50 percent.)
The Donghia showroom in the D & D building was to me the most cordial, with enthusiastic employees and even mini-samples of house fabrics that I could take home.
Such services circumvent the need to print up fake "decorator" business cards, a trick of the non-trade. Should you be tempted, know that most showrooms now ask for more professional evidence -- a resale number -- before they will sell.
But Mr. Hyland says that getting the fabric is only half the battle, and that the margin for error with costly materials is great. He thinks the glut of how-to magazines and television shows has created a can-do consumer culture that is deceptively shallow.
"Having a surface knowledge of something is not enough," he said. "Arguing against using the trained designer is like arguing against trained nurses in hospitals."
Ms. Hirst of Metropolitan Home, who favors a system in which anyone can buy from showrooms at retail prices, says designers are adapting to changes in the industry by billing for fabrics at cost and then charging clients flat fees or hourly rates for their services. "What younger designers are selling now is their talent, not access to the D & D," she said.
Thad Hayes, 40, a sought-after decorator who bills this way, agrees. "The days when designers just sold access are over," he said.
Scalamandre is trying to keep a foot in both camps. This fall, the luxury fabric house is opening four retail stores to replace its Silk Surplus discount outlets. Bob Bitter, a principal of the company, says the new stores, called Berenzelli Fabrics, will be edited-down, ready-to-wear versions of Scalamandre, with 150 to 200 fabrics priced less than its couture line (forget the tassels).
 
Getting the Whole 9 Yards
Scalamandre may be reacting in part to the success of ABC Carpet & Home, on Broadway at 19th Street, which renovated its vast second floor two summers ago as an antidote to trade-only showrooms. The store recently added casual collections, with dozens of bolts of colorful cottons, at around $20 a yard.
"I could even bring clients here," said Mr. Hayes on a recent excursion around the more than 3,000 bolts of fabric. "The selection is incredible, and what's really important if you're shopping for fabric for a sofa is that you can see what a lot of the fabric will look like. You can't do that with sample books."
Their strength is in cash-and-carry: While silk-and-cotton damasks are $103 a yard, an ABC spokeswoman said that the median price for fabric was $30. The house specialties, Italian chenille velvets, paisleys and jacquards, are $38 to $75 a yard.
Being surrounded by yards of luxurious possibilities, accessible to the touch, made the atmosphere more interactive than the showrooms. Most of the merchandise is in stock, and ABC will upholster furniture and or make slipcovers.
The great strength of Richard's Interiors, a tiny shop at 1390 Lexington Avenue at 92d Street, is its dressmaker's-shop air of authority. Walls are decked to the neufs with full-scale window treatments for the decor-impaired. Behind little desks piled with swatches and order forms, hard-as-laquered-nails staff members trade sarcastic battle stories about dealing with haughty D & D personnel. They will shop there with you, but they can also provide an overwhelming number of sample books from nearly every Manhattan fabric showroom requested. They offer prices 20 percent to 25 percent above net.
"I would feel the most comfortable here if I were a consumer," Mr. Hayes said.
Le Decor Francais, at 1006 Lexington Avenue near 72d Street, is patterned after shops in France or England, where no widespread "to the trade" policy holds. A small, bright, stylish store, it has 500 to 700 fabrics imported from France, some of which are also available in the D & D building.
While the employees call their fashionable selection and in-house upholstery services a welcome alternative to hiring a decorator or dealing with fabric showrooms, their advice left something to be desired during my recent visit. When asked for a simple fabric for my sofa, they suggested several wildly bright and graphic patterns that would look more at home in a Miami penthouse than in my small, dark living room.
 
The Bare Threads
Gracious Home and Janovic Plaza offered rather standard fabric selections from several showrooms, including Schumacher and Kravet, and the selection in their sample books was meager compared with that of Richard's Interiors and ABC. Both stores lacked an atmosphere that was conducive to fantasizing about decor.
But employees at both stores said they were well versed at maneuvering through the D & D building, selling fabric at 25 percent to 30 percent over net prices. Gracious Home designers can also go to showrooms customers to shop for fabric, at $75 an hour. Both stores do upholstery.
International Design Supply, at 50 East Houston Street, near Mulberry Street, has thousands of mid-cost fabrics from places like Kravet and Robert Allen. Employees will also shop at some D & D showrooms for clients, adding for 15 percent to 20 percent to the net price.
"It's great for someone who lives downtown," Mr. Hayes said, "but the industrial atmosphere really seems better geared to professionals. I really would only go here if I knew exactly what I wanted."
 
Looking Ahead
The future may hold even more options. This week, the Merchandise Mart in Chicago (which was bought by Christopher Kennedy's grandfather Joseph Kennedy in 1945) opened a design-buying service in conjunction with Bloomingdale's. Customers can meet store designers in the market and shop with them -- at retail -- charging purchases to their Bloomingdale's card. Asked whether he thought the service would work in New York, Mr. Kennedy would only say, "All the parties are interested and are watching this very closely."
But for some, the tried-and-true method may be best of all: leave all the headaches to a decorator. "The truth is that decorators save people money," Mr. Hyland said. "If only I had $1,000 for every client I heard come in here who said, 'I wish I'd gone to a designer first instead of trying to do this myself.' "
Ask Jane Nicholas, a record industry executive who scoured the D & D building and all the discount houses for fabric to cover a Jean-Michel Frank sofa bought at Palazzetti. Finally, with the help of a designer friend, she bought red-and-gold chenille with a distinctive medallion pattern at Mr. Hyland's showroom.
But the story was just beginning. Following the bad advice of a fabric designer who said she would consult on upholstery for a fee, Ms. Nicholas purchased too little fabric: her adviser forgot to tell her that the intricacy of a fabric's design might require extra fabric. By the time Ms. Nicholas discovered her error, the Italian factory had moved on to a different dye-lot. Then, they closed for vacation.
Nine months passed before she got the sofa home. Looking back on the ordeal, which was not an uncommon one, she had one piece of advice.
"If I could do it over again," she said, "I'd hire a decorator."

HEADLINE: In Health Care's New Era, Catholic Institutions Link Up to Compete

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
More than 30 Catholic hospitals and nursing homes in the New York region are banding together in a new health care network intended to help its members compete in an era of managed care and to strengthen the church's mission of treating the poor.
The Archdiocese of New York is expected to announce today the formation of the Catholic Health Care Network of New York, which will serve 2.5 million patients a year from Staten Island to Poughkeepsie. 
 The new network is the latest in a flurry of hospital mergers and consolidations, prompted by cuts in Medicaid reimbursements and cost-cutting pressures from insurers and health maintenance organizations.
The move was hailed as a sign that the Roman Catholic Church, whose health care agencies are praised for their high quality and relatively low cost, was determined to secure a place in the quickly shifting terrain of health care.
"I don't see this as a desperation move but as an affirmation," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, an independent philanthropic and health services research organization in New York City. "They have affirmed that they will be long-term players in delivering health services in this city."
The 9 hospitals and 22 nursing homes in the new network will share medical information by computer and, to save money, will jointly purchase major new medical equipment. Other possible cost savings could come from the creation of a single medical laboratory, which would replace individual on-site labs, and the joint contracting of laundry services.
"The primary goal of our network is to promote the Catholic health-care ministry," said Dr. Mary Healey-Sedutto, the network's executive director and chief executive officer. "But to that end, we realize that we must do everything that we can to maintain the viability and solvency of our institutions."
Officials said they had no plans for layoffs or reductions in hospital and nursing home staffs. However, the network's two sponsors, the Archdiocese of New York and the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of New York, will bring in a team of executives to identify services for potential consolidation.
The biggest financial benefit will arise from the network's strengthened position in negotiating contracts with health-maintenance organizations. All but one of the network members are in the 10-county region of the Archdiocese of New York, providing geographic reach along with a wide range of services and medical specialties.
Dr. Sedutto said the network was close to signing potentially lucrative contracts with two major managed-care companies, which she declined to name while negotiations are pending. Each company represents several hundred thousand people and would give the new network a flat annual fee for each covered patient.
In the past, under a looser alliance that had existed among some 40 Catholic health care institutions in the region, health-maintenance organizations would pick and choose hospitals for inclusion in their plans. Now, according to Dr. Sedutto, no one will be left out of major deals.
"Through the network, we will be able to negotiate contracts with managed-care companies that are inclusive of all our institutions," she said. "That helps us with our ultimate objective, which is serving the poor in all of our communities."
In New York City, as in the rest of the nation, Catholic health agencies have traditionally served a disproportionate share of poor people. In some of the archdiocese's hospitals and nursing homes, more than half of patients are on Medicaid, the Federal insurance program for the poor. And as many as 90 percent of outpatients in some places, such as St. Clare's Hospital, are on Medicaid.
The flagship of the network will be St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village. The network will be affiliated with the New York Medical College in Valhalla. Other hospitals in the system include Calvary Hospital in the Bronx, Bayley-Seton Hospital on Staten Island and St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers.
Dr. Sedutto said she expected the network to grow in the future, with the possible addition of health agencies outside New York and even secular health-care institutions. But the members would have to share, in the words of John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, the "values of the church -- charity, justice, respect for life in all its stages and special concern for the poor."
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 174 hospitals and nursing homes throughout the metropolitan area, applauded the archdiocese's plan.
"This is a solid effort at positioning the Catholic-sponsored institutions in a fashion that can achieve enormous economies of scale and reduce costs and produce highly competitive services," he said.
The archdiocese's effort to become more competitive could not be more timely. On Monday, New York State's rate-setting system is scheduled to expire. Under the current system the state essentially sets all reimbursement rates for patients on Medicaid, as well as those who are privately insured. But starting next week, hospitals will have to negotiate with insurance companies on the prices for services.
Hospitals have increasingly sought to join ranks in recent months, either in loose affiliations or formal mergers. Earlier this month, New York University Medical Center and Mount Sinai Medical Center announced plans to merge.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From High Court's Ruling Against the Male-Only Policy of V.M.I.

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today in United States v. Virginia, holding that the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment requires admission of women to the all-male Virginia Military Institute. 
 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist filed a separate concurring opinion. Justice Antonin Scalia dissented. Justice Clarence Thomas did not participate in the case.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Justice Ginsburg
Virginia's public institutions of higher learning include an incomparable military college, Virginia Military Institute (V.M.I.). The United States maintains that the Constitution's equal protection guarantee precludes Virginia from reserving exclusively to men the unique educational opportunities V.M.I. affords. We agree.
Founded in 1839, V.M.I. is today the sole single-sex school among Virginia's 15 public institutions of higher learning. V.M.I.'s distinctive mission is to produce "citizen-soldiers," men prepared for leadership in civilian life and in military service. V.M.I. pursues this mission through pervasive training of a kind not available anywhere else in Virginia.
Assigning prime place to character development, V.M.I. uses an "adversative method" modeled on English public schools and once characteristic of military instruction. V.M.I. constantly endeavors to instill physical and mental discipline in its cadets and impart to them a strong moral code. The school's graduates leave V.M.I. with heightened comprehension of their capacity to deal with duress and stress and a large sense of accomplishment for completing the hazardous course.
V.M.I. has notably succeeded in its mission to produce leaders; among its alumni are military generals, members of Congress and business executives. The school's alumni overwhelmingly perceive that their V.M.I. training helped them to realize their personal goals. V.M.I.'s endowment reflects the loyalty of its graduates; V.M.I. has the largest per-student endowment of all undergraduate institutions in the nation.
Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers nor V.M.I.'s implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women. And the school's impressive record in producing leaders has made admission desirable to some women. Nevertheless, Virginia has elected to preserve exclusively for men the advantages and opportunities a V.M.I. education affords. . . .
We note, once again, the core instruction of this Court's path-marking decisions in J.E.B. v. Alabama: Parties who seek to defend gender-based government action must demonstrate an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for that action. . . .
The burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the state. The state must show "at least that the (challenged) classification serves 'important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed' are 'substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.' " The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation. And it must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females. . . .
"Inherent differences" between men and women, we have come to appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity. Sex classifications may be used to compensate women "for particular economic disabilities (they have) suffered," to "promot(e) equal employment opportunity," to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our nation's people. But such classifications may not be used, as they once were to create or perpetuate the legal, social and economic inferiority of women.
Measuring the record in this case against the review standard just described, we conclude that Virginia has shown no "exceedingly persuasive justification" for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by V.M.I. We therefore affirm the Fourth Circuit's initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia, the Mary Baldwin V.W.I.L. [Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership] program, does not cure the constitutional violation, i.e., it does not provide equal opportunity, we reverse the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in this case.
The Fourth Circuit initially held that Virginia had advanced no state policy by which it could justify, under equal protection principles, its determination "to afford V.M.I.'s unique type of program to men and not to women." Virginia challenges that "liability" ruling and asserts two justifications in defense of V.M.I.'s exclusion of women.
First, the commonwealth contends, "single-sex education provides important educational benefits," and the option of single-sex education contributes to "diversity in educational approaches." Second, the commonwealth argues, "the unique V.M.I. method of character development and leadership training," the school's adversative approach, would have to be modified were V.M.I. to admit women. We consider these two justifications in turn.
Single-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to at least some students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality is uncontested in this litigation. Similarly, it is not disputed that diversity among public educational institutions can serve the public good. But Virginia has not shown that V.M.I. was established, or has been maintained, with a view to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, educational opportunities within the state. In cases of this genre, our precedent instructs that "benign" justifications proffered in defense of categorical exclusions will not be accepted automatically; a tenable justification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact differently grounded. . . .
A purpose genuinely to advance an array of educational options, as the court of appeals recognized, is not served by V.M.I.'s historic and constant plan, a plan to "affor(d) a unique educational benefit only to males." However "liberally" this plan serves the state's sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters. That is not equal protection.
Virginia next argues that V.M.I.'s adversative method of training provides educational benefits that cannot be made available, unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommodate women would necessarily be "radical," so "drastic," Virginia asserts, as to transform, indeed "destroy," V.M.I.'s program. . . .
Education, to be sure, is not a "one size fits all" business. The issue, however, is not whether "women or men should be forced to attend V.M.I."; rather, the question is whether the state can constitutionally deny to women who have the will and capacity, the training and attendant opportunities that V.M.I. uniquely affords. . . .
Women's successful entry into the Federal military academies, and their participation in the nation's military forces, indicate that Virginia's fears for the future of V.M.I. may not be solidly grounded. The state's justification for excluding all women from "citizen-soldier" training for which some are qualified, in any event, cannot rank as "exceedingly persuasive," as we have explained and applied that standard. . . .
In the second phase of the litigation, Virginia presented its remedial plan: maintain V.M.I. as a male-only college and create V.W.I.L. (Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership) as a separate program for women. The plan met district court approval. The Fourth Circuit, in turn, deferentially reviewed the state's proposal and decided that the two single-sex programs directly served Virginia's reasserted purposes: single-gender education, and "achieving the results of an adversative method in a military environment." Inspecting the V.M.I. and V.W.I.L. educational programs to determine whether they "afford(ed) to both genders benefits comparable in substance, (if) not in form and detail," the court of appeals concluded that Virginia had arranged for men and women opportunities "sufficiently comparable" to survive equal protection evaluation. The United States challenges this "remedial" ruling as pervasively misguided.
A remedial decree, this court has said, must closely fit the constitutional violation; it must be shaped to place persons unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in "the position they would have occupied in the absence of (discrimination)." The constitutional violation in this case is the categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men. A proper remedy for an unconstitutional exclusion, we have explained, aims to "eliminate (so far as possible) the discriminatory effects of the past" and to "bar like discrimination in the future."
Virginia chose not to eliminate, but to leave untouched, V.M.I.'s exclusionary policy. For women only, however, Virginia proposed a separate program, different in kind from V.M.I. and unequal in tangible and intangible facilities. . . .
V.W.I.L. affords women no opportunity to experience the rigorous military training for which V.M.I. is famed. Instead, the V.W.I.L. program "de-emphasize(s)" military education and uses a "cooperative method" of education "which reinforces self-esteem." . . .
As earlier stated, generalizations about "the way women are," estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description. Notably, Virginia never asserted that V.M.I.'s method of education suits most men. It is also revealing that Virginia accounted for its failure to make the V.W.I.L. experience "the entirely militaristic experience of V.M.I." on the ground that V.W.I.L. "is planned for women who do not necessarily expect to pursue military careers." By that reasoning, V.M.I.'s "entirely militaristic" program would be inappropriate for men in general or as a group, for "(o)nly about 15 percent of V.M.I. cadets enter career military service." . . .
Virginia, in sum, while maintaining V.M.I. for men only, has failed to provide any "comparable single-gender women's institution." Instead, the commonwealth has created a V.W.I.L. program fairly appraised as a "pale shadow" of V.M.I. in terms of the range of curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Scalia
Today the Court shuts down an institution that has served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and distinction for over a century and a half. To achieve that desired result, it rejects (contrary to our established practice) the factual findings of two courts below, sweeps aside the precedents of this Court and ignores the history of our people.
As to facts: it explicitly rejects the finding that there exist "gender-based developmental differences" supporting Virginia's restriction of the "adversative" method to only a men's institution and the finding that the all-male composition of the Virginia Military Institute (V.M.I.) is essential to that institution's character. As to precedent: it drastically revises our established standards for reviewing sex-based classifications. And as to history: it counts for nothing the long tradition, enduring down to the present, of men's military colleges supported by both states and the Federal Government.
Much of the Court's opinion is devoted to deprecating the closed-mindedness of our forebears with regard to women's education, and even with regard to the treatment of women in areas that have nothing to do with education. Closed-minded they were as every age is, including our own, with regard to matters it cannot guess, because it simply does not consider them debatable. The virtue of a democratic system with a First Amendment is that it readily enables the people, over time, to be persuaded that what they took for granted is not so, and to change their laws accordingly. That system is destroyed if the smug assurances of each age are removed from the democratic process and written into the Constitution.
So to counterbalance the Court's criticism of our ancestors, let me say a word in their praise: they left us free to change. The same cannot be said of this most illiberal Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after another of the current preferences of the society (and in some cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's law-trained elite) into our basic law. Today it enshrines the notion that no substantial educational value is to be served by an all-men's military academy so that the decision by the people of Virginia to maintain such an institution denies equal protection to women who cannot attend that institution but can attend others. Since it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States -- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I dissent. . . .
I have no problem with a system of abstract tests such as rational-basis, intermediate, and strict scrutiny (though I think we can do better than applying strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny whenever we feel like it). Such formulas are essential to evaluating whether the new restrictions that a changing society constantly imposes upon private conduct comport with that "equal protection" our society has always accorded in the past. But in my view the function of this Court is to preserve our society's values regarding (among other things) equal protection, not to revise them; to prevent backsliding from the degree of restriction the Constitution imposed upon democratic government, not to prescribe, on our own authority, progressively higher degrees.
For that reason it is my view that, whatever abstract tests we may choose to devise, they cannot supersede and indeed ought to be crafted so as to reflect those constant and unbroken national traditions that embody the people's understanding of ambiguous constitutional texts. More specifically, it is my view that "when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down." . . .
And the rationale of today's decision is sweeping: for sex-based classifications, a redefinition of intermediate scrutiny that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny. Indeed, the Court indicates that if any program restricted to one sex is "uniqu(e)," it must be opened to members of the opposite sex "who have the will and capacity" to participate in it. I suggest that the single-sex program that will not be capable of being characterized as "unique" is not only unique but nonexistent.
In any event, regardless of whether the Court's rationale leaves some small amount of room for lawyers to argue, it ensures that single-sex public education is functionally dead. The costs of litigating the constitutionality of a single-sex education program, and the risks of ultimately losing that litigation, are simply too high to be embraced by public officials. . . .
Should the courts happen to interpret that vacuous phrase as establishing a standard that is not utterly impossible of achievement, there is considerable risk that whether the standard has been met will not be determined on the basis of the record evidence indeed, that will necessarily be the approach of any court that seeks to walk the path the Court has trod today. No state official in his right mind will buy such a high-cost, high-risk lawsuit by commencing a single-sex program. The enemies of single-sex education have won; by persuading only seven Justices (five would have been enough) that their view of the world is enshrined in the Constitution, they have effectively imposed that view on all 50 states.

HEADLINE: 16 Foreign Law Firms Cleared To Open Offices in China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 26

 BODY:
China's Justice Ministry approved the opening of offices by 16 international law firms today, reflecting a brighter climate in Chinese-American business relations now that trade disputes have been put aside.
With foreign companies pouring into China in recent years, the need for business-related legal work has grown tremendously. Yet China has tightly limited the number of law firms allowed to fully operate. 
 Today's new licenses were the first granted since early last year, bringing the foreign law firms in China to 73. Many more are waiting for approval. Of those approved today, five are from the United States and the others are from Japan, Hong Kong, Britain, Italy and Jordan.
This round of license-granting was apparently delayed until a favorable moment in China's relations with the United States. American officials have been pushing hard for better market access for legal, insurance and banking firms.
The moment came, several foreign lawyers said, after Chinese and American trade negotiators reached agreement in Beijing last week on how to fight piracy of intellectual property. One of China's threatened retaliatory measures against prospective sanctions was to suspend the allotting of new business licenses for American trade and service companies.
Until today, only one American law firm, Davis Wright Tremaine of Seattle, had been approved to operate an office in Shanghai. Today, two were added: Altheimer & Grey of Chicago and O'Melveny & Myers of Los Angeles, where Secretary of State Warren Christopher was a partner before assuming his current post.
While several lawyers applauded the Chinese move as a step in the right direction, some complained about the confusion and difficulties of working in a semi-open market.
"Technically, we're not supposed to be here until we're legal," said an American lawyer who insisted on anonymity. The firm he works for was not approved today, though it operates an unofficial office in Beijing anyway. "But we can't become legal unless we're here, wining and dining Ministry of Justice folks, and showing how serious we are about the China market," the lawyer said.
In practice, dozens of similar firms operate preparatory offices in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities, where they act as consultants, keep low visibility, and generally answer telephones by saying "Hello?" rather than announcing the names of their firms.
Xiao Hongmin, an official at the Lawyers Affairs Division of the Justice Ministry, said there was no set schedule for approving new foreign legal firms, many of which applied as long as three years ago. More than 130 law firms have applications pending, Mr. Xiao said.
"The whole process of approval has become ultra-selective," said Louis B. Goldman, a partner at Altheimer & Grey, which will open an office in Shanghai. "Over 50 major American firms were competing for these slots, and 5 got in."
On the long list of things that Altheimer & Grey did to win favor with Chinese officials, Mr. Goldman said, was running a preparatory office in Beijing for two and a half years, inviting Justice Ministry staff members for visits to the United States, where meetings were arranged with business and political leaders, and advising Chinese officials on developing their legal profession.
The Justice Ministry is expected to soon issue a set of regulations on how the Chinese offices of foreign law firms will be supervised, the New China News Agency said yesterday.

Kantor Calms Indonesians
 JAKARTA, Indonesia, June 26 (Dow Jones) -- The United States Secretary of Commerce, Mickey Kantor, minimized differences with Indonesia today over its national-car program, stressing trade links instead.
After meeting here with the Minister of Industry and Trade, Tungki Ariwibowo, Mr. Kantor said:
"We want to see a growing and healthy economy in Indonesia. Part of this includes a healthy auto industry." But he added that Indonesia must abide by international trade rules.
The national-car program grants import-duty and luxury-sales-tax exemptions on cars that use Indonesian brand names, are produced by Indonesian companies and are developed with domestic technology, engineering and designs. The United States, Japan and the European Union have called the program discriminatory.
Mr. Kantor, who is on an Asian tour that also includes South Korea and Thailand, is scheduled to meet with President Suharto on Thursday morning.

HEADLINE: BOMBING IN SAUDI ARABIA: THE SAUDIS;
West's Uneasy Presence: Infidels or Protectors?

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 27

 BODY:
Switch on Saudi state television on any Friday and you are sure to see a panoply of preachers -- officially approved and even paid by the Saudi Government -- routinely referring to Christians and Jews as "infidels," "atheists" and "usurpers of Muslims."
Speaking to millions of Saudis, the preachers inveigh against traveling to the West and call upon believers to shun satellite dishes and all contact with foreigners. 
 Much the same message is heard almost daily on radio and in thousands of mosques around the country, even as the Saudi Government maintains close strategic, military and political ties to those same "infidels" in the United States and Europe.
For decades, the Saudi royal family has operated on the assumption it can maintain a two-track approach to the West: declaring its diplomatic and economic friendship with the outside powers whose support is vital to its survival, while allowing a totally different view of the West to be promoted by the country's vast religious establishment, which provides a vital connection between the ruling family and a large part of the country's estimated 15 million to 18 million people.
For decades that two-track approach served the ruling family well.
Western countries, anxious to secure access to oil, have provided the Saudis with enormous income and protection from neighbors like Iraq and Iran. While tens of thousands of foreigners work in Saudi Arabia, they have been largely confined to plush compounds and isolated along the Red Sea coast and the oil-producing area around Dhahran.
Meanwhile, legions of poorly educated Saudis have been insulated from the modern trends sweeping much of the Middle East, instead hearing the increasingly intense messages of alienation and fear emanating from the deeply conservative interior of the country.
It is an unnerving experience to walk from the compounds of any American, British or French company, where women congregate in bikinis around pools, and then drive a few miles away to a shopping market where Saudi religious police -- men in scraggly beards and sandals -- wield canes to beat any women foolish enough to venture out with any part of their bodies uncovered, even a bit of ankle. But now the two-track approach is breaking down. Especially since the Persian Gulf war of 1991, it has become harder and harder for the ruling family to keep its contradictory approaches to the West on separate planes.
Despite edicts extracted from religious authorities by the regime to sanction the presence of foreign troops as an "exceptional" measure, most of the religious establishment disapproved. A growing number have disapproved violently, leading to scores of arrests among eminent Saudi theologians since 1990 and the growth of an underground opposition that now hopes to bring down the Saudi regime.
"They hate the regime," said a senior Saudi official familiar with investigation of previous violent incidents. "To them the Americans are a symbol of everything they loath: corruption, joblessness, exclusion from decision-making, and this nurtured hatred of everything alien.
"But their real target, and the subject of their wrath, is the regime," he added.
The official, a liberal Saudi who asked for anonymity, explained at length what he and several other officials consider to be a "cancer that is growing".
Unrest has found fertile ground among tens of thousands of graduates of the multitude of recently established Saudi universities. Despite their degrees, most of them are semi-illiterate, their studies having been confined to Koranic subjects with a smattering of other knowledge.
Since the late 1980's, they have been disgorged from their schools unable to find jobs in the sophisticated Saudi private sector, which often uses foreign managers or Saudi graduates of American and European universities. Most cannot be absorbed, either, by Saudi Government ministries. In the days of $40-a-barrel oil, the Government used to give such graduates desks and salaries to do nothing.
Since then, oil prices have collapsed, Saudi coffers have been drained by the estimated $120 billion cost of the gulf war, and the population has grown at a dizzying rate, encouraged by edicts from religious authorities to procreate. (The average Saudi family is composed of 6 to 10 children from each wife.) As a result, the regime's promise of ever-growing wealth for all has broken down.
During much of the 1980's, Saudi religious radicals were given an immense boost by the Government's participation in efforts to resist the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Indeed, hundreds of Saudis joined large numbers of militants from other Arab countries in the fighting there.
After the end of the Soviet occupation, hundreds have returned to Saudi Arabia and other countries to continue the struggle at home. Indeed, the four men executed for November's Riyadh bombing had all served in Afghanistan. Not much else is known about them except for two significant facts: They were Sunni Muslims from the Wahabi Islamic school that is the foundation of Saudi Arabia's religious scholarship. Wahabis, who deliver the most rigid interpretation of Islam, have been allied with the Saudi family since the inception of the modern Kingdom a little more than 60 years ago. And, they were young, mostly unemployed and deeply fanatical about their religious belief.
All of which suggests they were not outsiders but a product of the very base of Saudi society. None, for example, were Shiite Muslims who could be thought sympathetic to Iran. And they were followers of other militant Wahabi religious Saudi figures, some of whom are in jail after breaking with the traditional religious establishment whom they accuse of having abandoned the rigid code of Wahabism.
While it is not known who mounted the Tuesday bombing, all those arrested in previous acts of violent or verbal opposition to the regime fit the same general background, suggesting a pool of native Saudi religious militants from the desert regions of Nejd, -- the heartland that begat the regime itself.
This homegrown opposition emerged in distinctive profile in 1990, when a group of 400 religious scholars, clerics and some liberal technocrats put their name to a petition demanding reforms and an end to corruption. The Government rejected their demand, accusing them of breaching the Koran's teachings by challenging the rulers.
Undeterred, the group tried again two years later in 1992, They sent a four-page letter to King Fahd. Again they were rebuffed, and this time the Government made some arrests.
The next year, the Islamist opposition hardened further. Six senior religious scholars left their jobs and challenged others in the religious establishment to follow suit. They founded the Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights, demanding more rigorous enforcement of Islamic law and an end to government corruption. Then cassettes began to surface all over Saudi Arabia carrying the same message coupled with fiery speeches by a leader of the group, Safar al-Hawali.
There were more arrests. Mr. Hawali and several of his followers are still in jail and threats began to surface hinting at violence unless they were released.
Many Muslim militants made their final break with the regime during 1993 and 1994: No longer satisfied with demanding reforms, they shifted to calling for the removal of the Saudi royal family from power.
One of them, Muhammad al-Masaari, who was part of the Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights, fled to London and continues his opposition to the regime from here. Mr. Masaari, who is a religious militant himself denies any connection with the bombings, says he understands the bombers' motives and their opposition to the American presence in the Kingdom.
"The Americans have become a very convenient target, being a shield for the al-Saud regime," he said in an interview. "They are standing between the people and the royal family. So, I can see that from a religious and moral point of view they are an easy target."
Caught in its own contradictions, the regime has a hard time, politically, cracking down on militant opponents.
"They are heroes," the Saudi official said. "We made them heroes. They fought against atheism and the Soviets. They died for Islam. The whole religious establishment, even those working for the Government, admire them. If you start rounding them up, you lose even more senior clerics, which will widen the ideological base of the militants."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Advance in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday, helped by end-of-the-quarter buying by portfolio managers.
That buying activity, bolstered by technical factors and thin trading volume, helped push the yield on the long bond below 7 percent for the first time in nearly three weeks. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond settled up 17/32 of a percentage point, to 87 23/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.99 percent, from 7.03 percent on Wednesday, and the lowest since June 6, when the yield was at 6.89 percent.
The Treasury market opened weaker from selling in Europe after the Bundesbank left German interest rates unchanged. Currency traders who had expected the central bank to cut rates, which would have weakened the mark, pushed the dollar lower, putting pressure on dollar-denominated securities.
But a rally soon began quietly as portfolio managers bought securities to make portfolios more attractive before the end of the quarter today, traders said.
The rally picked up steam after prices in the Treasury futures market breached a important technical level of 108 in the afternoon. That movement generated more buying and forced short-sellers, who had bet that prices would fall, to try to limit their losses by buying back securities. In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit.
The September bond future contract settled at 108 14/32 yesterday, just off its high of 108 15/32 .
With trading light, the momentum gained quickly enough to become a full-fledged rally in late afternoon trading, said Jack Regan, chief investment strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
Prices were also bolstered after a private consulting firm, Johnson Smick International, indicated that the Federal Reserve was not likely to raise interest rates until after the November election. Only a small minority of market participants expect the Fed to raise rates when its policy-making committee meets next week.
Still, the report eased some concerns about when the Fed would act on interest rates, in no small part because Manuel H. Johnson, who heads the firm, was vice chairman of the Fed in the 1980's.
In the corporate market, Teleport Communications Group, priced $925 million of junk bonds yesterday in a two-part transaction through underwriters led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The first part included $300 million of senior notes due in 2006 at a price of par to yield 9.875 percent. The notes are noncallable for five years and are rated B1 by Moody's Investors Service and B by Standard & Poor's. In addition, there is an early redemption provision, in which the company can redeem 33.3 percent of the issue if it sells stock at a public offering within three years.
The other part includes $625 million in proceeds from senior discount notes due in 2007 with a 10.875 percent interest rate that are priced to yield 11.125 percent. Like the senior notes, these notes cannot be called for five years and have an equity redemption provision.
Teleport, based in Staten Island, is a provider of telecommunication services. The company was also busy raising cash in the stock market yesterday. Shares of Teleport rose to $17.625 in Nasdaq trading, up $1.625 from its offering price of $16. The offering of 23.5 million shares was underwritten by a group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Raise 1997 Vehicle Prices 1.7%

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 27

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that prices for its 1997 model vehicles would rise by only 1.7 percent, on average, putting pressure on its rivals to hold down the prices of their cars and trucks.
Auto makers have been struggling in recent months to maintain price increases on mini-vans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and particularly cars as customers have grown increasingly cost-conscious. 
 Michael L. Bowyer, an auto analyst at McDonald & Company, a Cleveland brokerage firm, said that the modest size of G.M.'s price increases -- they are below inflation, which has been running at just under 3 percent a year -- were a sign that auto makers were trying to lure less well-heeled customers back from the used-car lots.
But while car buyers might appreciate G.M.'s restraint in pricing, the small size of the increases puts extra pressure on auto makers to reduce their costs in order to stay profitable, he said. Auto workers and shareholders might benefit more from stiffer increases, he said.
George C. Peterson, president of Autopacific Inc., an automotive marketing and consulting firm in Santa Ana, Calif., said, "It looks like their price increases are pretty reasonable." In part, that reflects the fear that would-be buyers will walk away from cars that seem too expensive.
"The manufacturers are really conscious of affordability these days," Mr. Peterson said.
Indeed, the Ford Motor Company has had special difficulties meeting the demand for affordable vehicles. When it redesigned its popular Ford Taurus sedan for the 1996 model year, it gave the car a more sophisticated body and suspension and raised the price, only to lose sales.
As sticker prices for new cars have risen -- they hit $19,459 in the first quarter of this year, according to the Commerce Department -- many customers have headed for the used-car lots.
The Chrysler Corporation, Ford and other auto makers are expected to announce prices for 1997 models later this summer.
The relatively small increases by G.M. also signal that it is continuing its drive to win back market share, which has eroded over the last few years, industry experts said. "What G.M. is doing is trying to hold and gain share back by being the value leader in North America," said Martin L. Anderson, the associate director of the International Motor Vehicle Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Auto makers are also looking over their shoulders at Japan and at currency fluctuations as they set prices.
Since April 1995, the dollar has strengthened from 79.85 yen to its current level of nearly 110 yen. That has reduced the cost of building cars for Japanese auto makers and will allow them to earn higher profits or reduce prices on the vehicles they sell in the United States. Japanese auto makers were constrained from greatly reducing prices, and were often forced to raise them, when the yen was stronger because they would have lost money on the cars they sold here.
The G.M. announcement covered price increases on the 1997 models of existing vehicles, and the 1.7 percent increase compares comparably equipped models. G.M. said that the price for Chevrolet's popular midsize sedan, the Lumina, would rise 2 percent, to $17,495, for example. Prices for the Geo Tracker will be unchanged. And the base sticker price for Chevrolet's C/K pickup will rise 1.2 percent, to $15,157, a G.M. spokesman, Dean Rotondo, said.

HEADLINE: Keeping Saudi Arabia in Perspective

BYLINE: By Michael Field; Michael Field, a consultant on Middle East affairs, is the author of "Inside the Arab World."

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The simplest explanation for Tuesday night's bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 Americans, may turn out to be the correct one. We should not be surprised if the attack was carried out by people from the same indigenous group of militants responsible for the bombing of a National Guard building in Riyadh last November.
Three of the four bombers in that attack stated in their televised confessions that they had fought for Islamic militant groups in Afghanistan, where they had been trained in the use of explosives. Many men like them have returned home violent, unemployable and imbued with anti-Western ideas that make them want to purge their nation of what they see as America's corrupting influence. 
 These militants may have connections with other "Afghanis" in neighboring countries, particularly Lebanon. Recently, a car from Lebanon holding explosives was stopped at the Saudi-Jordanian border. They may also have links with Yemeni tribesmen who worked in Saudi Arabia and left disliking their hosts. Last November's bomb was made from explosives smuggled from Yemen, according to the confessions of the defendants, which were likely coerced. In effect, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, supported by the United States, are now reaping the whirlwind after encouraging their nationals to go to Afghanistan to fight the Russians in the 1980's.
Saudi Arabia is vulnerable to violence by militants in that the very raison d'etre of the state, since it was established in the 18th century, has been the propagation of an orthodox form of Islam. The royal family, many of whose members have fairly secular attitudes, finds itself bound to encourage anything that might strengthen the Islamic nature of society, in particular the expansion of religious education.
What the bombings do not mean is that Saudi Arabia has become unstable or is approaching the point of revolution. This basic truth is obscured by three misconceptions.
First, the Saudi Government, which is ridiculously sensitive to criticism, tries to link acts of terrorism to any peaceful opposition. Thus, it inadvertently makes the opposition seem more dangerous than it is. It routinely blames all religious opponents for inspiring terrorism, and uses the alleged link as an excuse for not addressing complaints, mainly about corruption among a few royal family members and their hangers-on.
Second, given any opportunity, the United States and Israel try to link any terrorist act to Hezbollah in Lebanon to suggest that Iran is trying to destabilize the region. In fact, Iran is trying, clumsily, to improve relations with most of its neighbors and has no motive to anger Saudi Arabia. There is more than a streak of paranoia in America's and Israel's attitude to Iran.
Third, the liberal Western intelligentsia, particularly journalists, makes it clear that Saudi Arabia is not a model society. It is highly conservative, religious, conformist, rich and somewhat corrupt. In most commentaries on the kingdom, one senses that journalists are looking for parallels with Iran in the late 1970's or Algeria in the early 1990's.
The reality is that there is increasingly open grumbling. The Saudis, including many princes, are concerned about corruption, particularly in arms purchasing. They also complain about the poor quality of the state-controlled media and the inability of the Government, under the incapacitated King Fahd, to address the kingdom's chronic overspending.
Saudi Arabia needs a younger monarch who will be brave and energetic enough to tackle these problems and slowly allow its people greater participation. Unfortunately, the designated heir is Crown Prince Abdullah, King Fahd's half brother, and he is unlikely to take these steps.
If the Government fails to address its problems, the kingdom could gradually become more unstable. But serious civil unrest is likely still a long way away.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines on Comments By Group of Seven Officials

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday as officials of the seven leading industrial nations voiced satisfaction with the currency's current levels, prompting worries that yearlong gains might be coming to an end.
A decision by the Bundesbank yesterday to leave German interest rates unchanged also undermined the dollar. The president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, speaking after the central bank met, said the German economy had been burdened by the strong mark but that the currency's strength had been fully corrected. 
 The dollar dipped toward 1.5200 marks on the statement, and an effort by a Bundesbank spokesman to put Mr. Tietmeyer's remarks in context did little to calm market jitters.
The spokesman said the Bundesbank president's comment referred to the dollar's rise against the mark after it slumped to a post-World War II low of 1.3438 marks in March 1995.
With the comments from the Bundesbank, "a lot of people are getting out of dollars," said Mark Gargano, chief trader at First Union National Bank.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5180 marks, down from 1.5257 marks on Wednesday, and at 109.10 yen, down from 109.42 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5480 from $1.5407.
Mr. Tietmeyer's comments came as leaders from the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Britain, Italy and France gathered in Lyons, France, to discuss the world economy and foreign policy.
France's Finance Minister, Jean Arthuis, said France favored a stronger dollar.
But analysts said France, which is seeking a weaker franc to increase the competitiveness of its exports, might be alone among the Group of Seven richest nations in pushing for a stronger dollar.
Indeed, a Japanese Government spokesman in Lyons said Japan was "more or less" satisfied with the current level of the dollar against the yen.
"What the Group of Seven nations are saying is they're comfortable with the dollar," said Jim Phoenix, director of foreign exchange sales at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

Federal Reserve Seen Holding Rates Steady
The Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates when its policy-making body meets next week, economists said, but that call will be an unusually difficult and close one on both economic and political grounds.
With the economy apparently growing robustly and with unemployment low, the likelihood of inflation taking root might ordinarily be considered high. But there are only scattered and inconsistent signs of inflation, which higher rates would be intended to head off. [Page D2.]
 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell below 7 percent for the first time in nearly three weeks. [D16.]
 
China's Trade Status Is Upheld
The House defeated an effort to block China's preferred trade privileges with the United States. The resolution lost by a vote of 286 to 141, assuring most-favored-nation status to the Chinese for another year. [A2.]
 
G.M. Plans Small Price Increases
General Motors said it would raise prices for 1997 models of its vehicles, like the Chevrolet Lumina, by only 1.7 percent, on average, putting pressure on its rivals to hold down the prices of their cars and trucks. Auto makers have been struggling in recent months to maintain higher sticker prices as customers have grown increasingly cost-conscious. [D2.]

Westinghouse Buys a Channel
Westinghouse and its CBS subsidiary have acquired Telenoticias, a Spanish-language news channel. The move signals an expansion into cable television by CBS, which expects to expand distribution of the channel throughout Latin America and Spain. [D5.]
 
Approval Is Seen for MGM Bid
The board of Philips, which owns 75 percent of Polygram, reportedly voted to allow Polygram to submit a bid for MGM. [D6.]

Court Victory for Genentech
Genentech said a Federal judge had granted a preliminary injunction preventing Novo Nordisk of Denmark from selling a human growth hormone similar to a product developed by Genentech. [D4.]

Drug for AIDS-Related Blindness
Gilead Sciences, a biotechnology company, said it had won final approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin marketing a drug for the treatment of an infection that causes blindness in AIDS patients. [D4.]

Dow Down, but Other Stocks Rise
The bond rally and some bargain hunting among depressed technology shares lifted most of the stock market yesterday. Still, the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 5.17 points, at 5,677.53. [D7.]

Path Cleared for Cigarette Suit
The Florida Supreme Court upheld a state liability law, clearing the way for Gov. Lawton Chiles to proceed with his lawsuit against cigarette makers that seeks to reclaim the cost of treating Medicaid patients who have smoking-related diseases. [A24.]
 
Roll Cameras, Roll Dice
ITT plans to develop casinos with Planet Hollywood, hoping that the images of the restaurant chain's founders, stars like Demi Moore and Arnold Schwarzenegger, can draw a younger generation of gamblers to places that are perhaps more often associated with Telly Savalas or Robert Goulet. [D6.]
 
The Stratosphere, a 1,149-foot hotel, gambling and retail tower, was the toast of Las Vegas -- and Wall Street -- when it opened. Then gravity asserted itself. Market Place. [D6.]
 
Shifts in Addressing Gay Market

HEADLINE: Debt Crisis in the Third World

 BODY:
President Clinton and the leaders of six other industrialized countries will devote much of their meeting this week in Lyons, France, to the terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia. But Jacques Chirac, the President of France, is rightly insisting that the summit meeting also grapple with the troubling problem of third-world debt. As many as 20 countries have reached debt levels so high that they are shut out of international capital markets and cannot climb out from under repayment burdens. The seven leaders agree debt relief is needed soon, but they disagree over how to provide it.
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have proposed a plan, backed by the United States, that would knock down the debt burdens of the poorest countries to sustainable levels. That would allow the countries to repay lenders without imposing punishing taxes on their citizens. Under the proposal, the bank would reduce debt repayments on its loans. The I.M.F. would sell a small portion of its gold stock, invest the proceeds and use the income from the investments to reduce the debt payments of some third-world borrowers. 
 The bank and the fund would also pressure donor countries to write off between 67 and 90 percent of their loans to these heavily indebted countries. For their part, the borrowing countries would be required to adopt a strict program of market reforms that would be monitored by the bank and the fund. The stringent reform package is designed to lock the borrowers into sensible economic habits and dissuade existing or future borrowers from accumulating excessive debt under the cynical presumption that lenders will someday write down the loans.
The proposal makes sense. But divisions exist over its details. Some lenders, like Japan and Italy, are cool to the idea of selling the gold deposits of the fund for debt relief. Germany, which wants the fund's gold used only for true financial emergencies, is adamantly opposed to gold sales. To its credit, Germany is willing to provide direct debt relief, an offer the United States will not match.
The problem with the proposal is not that it risks too much debt relief, but offers too little. Oxfam International, a private organization that lobbies on behalf of third-world debtors, estimates that Uganda spends more than five times more each year on debt repayment to industrialized countries than it does on health care for its citizens. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have been crushed by the excessive loans. The proposal would have them wait six years for substantial relief.
The emergency is here. There is no better use for the gold stocks held by the I.M.F. Debt relief tied to stringent economic reform is an idea the industrialized powers should enthusiastically embrace before they depart Lyons.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Not Expected to Lift Rates at Meeting Next Week

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates when its policy-making body meets next week, economists said today, but that call will be an unusually difficult and close one on both economic and political grounds.
The economy appears to be growing at an unexpectedly robust clip of around 4 percent for the second quarter, and with unemployment at a low 5.6 percent, the likelihood of inflation starting to take root would normally be considered high. Under its chairman, Alan Greenspan, the Fed over recent years has taken to heading off inflation in advance by attacking it with higher interest rates long before it has a chance to spread through the economy. 
 But there are only scattered and inconsistent early warning signs of inflation, mostly reports that tight labor markets in some areas are starting to push up wages. Indeed, many economists believe the economy is about to slow substantially, and some even think the Fed will move to reduce rates by the end of the year. A number of analysts, however, contend that the Fed is likely to raise rates slightly sometime later this year.
To a large extent, economists said, the financial markets have already done much of the Fed's inflation-fighting work for it by sending long-term interest rates sharply upward earlier this year. The higher rates are expected to slow key sectors of the economy like housing, and should help cut the growth rate in the the second half of the year, easing whatever inflationary pressures might be building.
"While the economy has been somewhat stronger than expected so far this year, the backup in interest rates that's taken place is going to end up slowing the economy no matter what the Fed does," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "So in that sense, I don't think the Fed needs to do anything."
Sentiment in the credit markets has also shifted in recent days toward the belief that the Fed will keep short-term rates steady. As a result, the value of existing bonds has strengthened as rates have dipped, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond even dipping below 7 percent today.
But nothing is certain. At the Fed meeting, which stretches over two days starting on Tuesday, the central bankers could still choose to raise rates by the minimum increment available to it, a quarter of a point, just to maintain their status as stalwart inflation fighters. "While they may think the economy is going to slow," Mr. Steinberg said, "they may not want to risk their inflation credibility on that prediction."
The Fed cut rates three times between last July and January, and has since held steady at 5.25 percent the primary short-term rate it controls, the Federal funds target, even as the bond market has sent long-term yields up by more than a full percentage point.
Some Fed watchers believe the central bank may push rates up next week rather than risk having to do so later this year, in the heat of the Presidential election campaign.
Whether the Fed chooses to raise rates at its subsequent meeting, in August, will largely depend on the pace at which the economy creates new jobs, analysts said. Job-creation statistics for June will be issued next Friday, after the Fed's two-day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the figures for July will be available in early August, ahead of the Aug. 20 Fed meeting.
"By the time we get to August, my guess is that there will be evidence that employment growth is slowing and they won't tighten," said David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., a New York investment firm.
But the American Bankers Association Economic Advisory Committee said in a report this week that it expected the Fed to raise its Federal funds target rate, currently 5.25 percent, by a quarter- or half- point by the end of the summer.
The most visible guide to inflationary pressures in the economy is the interplay between unemployment and growth. Most economists believe that if the economy is growing at a rate above its long-term trend at a time of low unemployment, the inevitable result will be a bidding war for workers, with the ensuing higher wages leading to rising prices. At 4 percent, the economy is growing much faster than the 2 to 2.5 percent that is generally considered the trend growth rate, and the 5.6 unemployment rate is below what many analysts long considered the rate at which wage pressures start to build.
Some economists are particularly wary of inflation now because companies have been slashing inventories, meaning that if demand remains strong, it would be met by increased production. Increased production would translate into higher demand for labor and materials, and upward pressure on wages and prices.
A report last week by the Federal Reserve Banks on economic conditions in their regions found anecdotal evidence of upward pressure on wages, with fast-food restaurants in St. Louis paying $250 bonuses to attract new workers and companies in Minnesota having grown so discouraged about finding skilled employees that they stopped advertising their job openings.
But there are few other signs of inflation. Commodity prices have fallen in recent weeks, in part because of a drop in copper prices after a huge trading loss at Sumitomo. Grain and gasoline prices have also been falling.

HEADLINE: Spy Agencies Faulted for War Focus

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
American intelligence agencies devote too much time and money to supporting the military, and far too little to understanding the problems of peace, a new and authoritative critique concludes.
The report, by 19 people from the worlds of espionage, diplomacy, the military, academia and business, says American intelligence "still has not yet come in from the cold" and is "ill-prepared for the 21st century," in the words of the group's executive director, Allan E. Goodman, a dean at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and a former top administrator at the Central Intelligence Agency. 
 The militarization of intelligence has sapped the United States' ability to devote brainpower to diplomacy, the global economy and other peacetime problems, the report said. It was made public today by the Twentieth Century Fund, a nonpartisan organization based in New York that organized and paid for the study.
The report, one of four major studies published in recent months critiquing American intelligence, said the intelligence community had been increasingly dominated by the military in the years since the cold war. This "alarming imbalance," said the report's chairman, former Ambassador Stephen W. Bosworth, has corroded the corps of American intelligence analysts in favor of spy satellites and other billion-dollar tools for stealing information abroad.
The result is an intelligence system that spends more than $26 billion a year on machines and less than $3 billion on people to analyze the information the machines collect -- a system that is "90 percent hardware and 10 percent software," said one of the study's principal authors, Philip Zelikow, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
While machines can steal secrets, only humans can unravel mysteries like the future course of China, the chances for Russian democracy, or the internal machinations of the Japanese economy. For the cost of one of the least expensive spy satellites -- several hundred million dollars -- the cadres of American intelligence analysts could be dramatically strengthened, the report argued.
The C.I.A.'s spies and their paramilitary culture have dominated the agency at the expense of analysts, said another principal author, Gregory F. Treverton, a former top United States intelligence analyst and a director at the Rand Corporation. The culture of secrecy makes it harder for the agency's analysts to travel abroad, talk to outsiders, learn new lessons and grapple with mysteries, Mr. Treverton said.
The report said the C.I.A.'s spies were responsible for "a long string of embarrassments" and called for a smaller, more specialized clandestine service. It said those spies should focus on far fewer targets -- a small number of nuclear nations, rogue states, terrorist groups and foes to American forces overseas -- and close up shop in less threatening countries. Diplomats, not spies, should be the ones analyzing events in more peaceful places, it said, arguing that the Foreign Service had been crippled by budget cuts and should be given the money and power to reclaim its once-central role in reporting from abroad.
In a dissent, Richard J. Kerr, a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, said the C.I.A.'s spies should keep their global presence and their capacity for covert action.
The report is the latest in a series of Government and independent studies calling for major changes at the C.I.A. and the dozen other arms of American intelligence. Those calls began in 1994, after the arrest of Aldrich H. Ames, a C.I.A. officer who spied for Moscow for nine years.
The Ames case and other scandals led to a cry from Congress and outside critics for an overhaul of American intelligence, and led to the series of studies. But they created no significant changes. Their often-contradictory recommendations are bogged down in Congress, where the Senate and House Intelligence Committees have competing visions of the future. The White House has taken few steps to resolve them, leaving the acknowledged problems in the hands of the Director of Central Intelligence, John M. Deutch.
Mr. Deutch has vowed to seek evolutionary, not revolutionary changes, and evolution is slow, often invisible.
Mr. Deutch and other top intelligence officials have said that supporting the military is one of their priorities. They also have said they are trying to refocus the C.I.A.'s espionage efforts on the world's most dangerous places, and striving to improve the quality and utility of their analytical work.

HEADLINE: Not All Aboard: A Big Rail Merger and Its Critics;
Sidetracked Since '13, Plan Still Raises Antitrust Fears

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Talk about your rocky romances. Born as rivals seeking to build the biggest stretch of the first transcontinental railroad in the late 1860's, the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads came close to marriage by the turn of the century only to have their union scotched in 1913 by a disapproving Supreme Court.
Now, the two railroads are once again hoping to get hitched in a $5.4 billion deal that would create a 37,000-mile rail network linking 25 states, Mexico and Canada. And, once again, the road to the altar is proving rocky. 
 In all, according to Union Pacific, customers, port operators, political leaders, unions and other interested parties have filed more than 2,000 letters of support for the merger with the Government, a record. Trouble is, the opposition is just as intense, including such heavyweights as the Departments of Justice and Agriculture, the State of Texas, and trade groups like the National Industrial Transportation League and the Society of Plastics Industries.
There are also qualms at the Department of Transportation, which oversees the independent three-member agency called the Surface Transportation Board that will rule on the merger proposal July 3.
The heart of the problem: If the Surface Transportation Board, the successor to the Interstate Commerce Commission, allows the merger without demanding major divestitures where the railroads have overlapping service, the new rail giant and its main rival, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, would control 90 percent of all rail traffic west of the Mississippi River. Such a duopoly, opponents say, could stifle competition.
"This is taking the level of competition back to when there were more buffalo than people in the West," said William H. Brodsky, president of Montana Rail Link Inc., a privately held regional carrier based in Missoula, Mont. Montana Rail Link wants the Government to order Union Pacific to sell it more than 1,000 miles of track through the heart of the country from Kansas to California as a condition for approving the merger.
The Union Pacific-Southern Pacific rail network would carry more than 75 percent of rail traffic to and from Mexico and two-thirds of the traffic in chemicals, plastics and other industrial goods from Texas and Louisiana to the rest of the country. And, it would have no direct competition in the central corridor from the Midwest through Utah to California.
The Justice Department, while lacking jurisdiction over railroads, is lobbying against the merger. If the deal goes through, it calculates prices will rise 19 percent for shippers that previously had a choice between the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific and 10 percent for those that would have two railroads to choose from instead of three.
Union Pacific -- based in Omaha and a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Corporation of Bethlehem, Pa. -- hotly disputes that claim, predicting instead that most shippers will see better service, lower prices or both. It projects annual savings at about $750 million and argues that service on the Southern Pacific will decline steadily without the huge capital investments the Union Pacific has promised to upgrade track and equipment.
The debate over the merger plan has refocused attention on an industry that once dominated the American economy and still holds a huge share of the market for shipping goods long distances.
Railroads are unlikely ever to recapture the near-monopoly over transportation that they enjoyed in the late 19th century -- a lock that prompted a series of Congressional investigations and attempts by the states to curb price gouging and other abuses. In 1886, the Supreme Court held that the states could not regulate the industry, and in response Congress adopted the Interstate Commerce Act the following year, the first Federal law to regulate private business.
Nearly a century later, in 1980, Congress deregulated the railroads, and since then, rates have fallen steadily and worker productivity has risen sharply. But with deregulation came consolidation -- and with consolidation came a resurgence of antitrust concerns.
"This debate is larger than the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger," said Warren Erdmann, a spokesman for Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Missouri Republican who is opposed to the merger. "It has to do with how strongly we enforce antitrust."
Many shippers -- from coal-mine operators in Utah and farmers in Kansas to manufacturers in Texas and Louisiana -- oppose the proposed combination, fearing both higher prices and a decline in service. Farm groups are especially skeptical because of the problems Union Pacific has had in digesting the Chicago & Northwestern Railway, which it acquired last year for $1.2 billion.
"It's been a disaster," said Frederic E. Schrodt, director of transportation for Farmland Industries, a huge cooperative based in Kansas City, Mo. Union Pacific's failure to provide prompt service has cost Farmland members $100 million in higher costs for grain storage and other expenses, they say.
Another merger opponent is Lew Meibergen, president of Johnston Enterprises Inc., a grain shipper for about 10,000 farmers that is based in Enid, Okla. "I supported the Union Pacific when they bought out the old Katy in the 1980's," Mr. Meibergen said, referring to the former Missouri Kansas & Texas Railroad Company. "They promised to maintain service and I'm still waiting for them to keep it."
Making matters worse, Mr. Meibergen said, service by his only reliable provider, the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, has deteriorated since it was taken over last year by the Burlington Northern Corporation in a $4 billion transaction.
Huntsman Chemical, a Houston-based producer of chemicals, said it feared it would lose bargaining power on shipments of products like polypropylene pellets to Mexico and other chemicals to customers in Louisiana. "We have 3,000 shipments a year where we will be down to just one carrier," said Chris VanderHeuvel, a Huntsman spokesman.
Union Pacific has been working hard to mute the criticism. It agreed with the Chemical Manufacturers Association, for example, to make sure that Burlington Northern trains could run against the one-way flow of Union Pacific traffic on tracks in the Texas-to-Memphis corridor, to share storage facilities with Burlington Northern and to pay for a Burlington Northern dispatcher to sit beside its own to make sure Union Pacific trains were not being given favorable treatment. These and other concessions persuaded the trade group and key members like the Monsanto Company to withdraw their opposition. Other shippers have likewise dropped their objections, either after receiving special deals or simply from fear of offending the powerful railroad.
Still others have thrown their full support behind the deal, including Exxon, General Motors and its biggest Government customer, the Department of Defense. And the lobbying to change the minds of opponents is not over. Richard Davidson, chief executive of Union Pacific, said both he and Drew Lewis, the chairman, "have meetings scheduled with customers right up until the hearing" the first week in July that will decide the merger's fate.
Mindful of the problem of reduced competition even before the deal was announced last fall, Mr. Lewis, a former Secretary of Transportation, led a concerted lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill last year as Congress was phasing out the Interstate Commerce Commission to make sure that oversight of rail mergers was given to the new Surface Transportation Board rather than the Department of Justice, which has historically been more hostile to the industry. Most analysts expect the board to approve the merger -- but to attach conditions. The big question mark is what the scope of the conditions will be.
Whether supporting or opposing the merger, many railroad experts agree that Government approval without ordering major divestitures will invite further consolidation in the industry. They foresee a cascade of deals in the next few years, leaving only two or three major coast-to-coast railroads to dominate the industry. "CSX will join one of the Western railroads and Norfolk Southern the other," said Steve Lewins, who follows the industry for Gruntal & Company in New York. "Conrail might stay independent or it could get divided up."
That would be terrific, according to Mr. Lewins, who argues that a few strong rail companies could be efficient enough to save shippers billions of dollars annually and reinforce the nation's role as a crossroads of world trade. But such benefits would be invisible for all but the biggest shippers with the power to negotiate the best rates, according to Michael Havarty, president and chief executive of the Kansas City Southern Railway. "Service will decline and ultimately the Government will be forced to reregulate the industry," said Mr. Havarty, whose railroad would lose substantial traffic if the merger went through.
To allay antitrust concerns, Union Pacific is doing its best to paint itself as a regional player that poses no monopolistic threat. While its fusion with Southern Pacific would create the nation's No. 1 railroad, it says it is not interested in building a transcontinental railroad (though it would like to expand in Mexico).
Union Pacific also argues that it had no choice but to pursue the Southern Pacific in order to remain competitive as the industry consolidates. The Southern Pacific's gem is the carrier's Texas-to-Los Angeles lines, which Union Pacific has coveted for more than a century. And Southern Pacific's tracks north from Los Angeles to Oregon and Washington could fill a gaping hole in the Union Pacific network.
But Southern Pacific, based in San Francisco and considered by many to be the greatest railroad in the country as recently as the 1950's, comes with many liabilities. It diverted too much cash into other businesses and then was hamstrung by a leveraged buyout and a failed merger attempt in the early 1980's with the Santa Fe. It has had operating losses in 14 of the last 17 years. The invaluable tracks heading west from El Paso to California and northeast toward Kansas City are overcrowded and other parts of its network are deteriorating.
But the Union Pacific had to overlook those drawbacks after its first choice as a partner, the Santa Fe, instead embraced the Burlington Northern last year. That merger made the freight hauler, based in Fort Worth, a 31,000-mile colossus spanning 27 states and two Canadian provinces, and it knocked Union Pacific from its cherished position as the nation's largest railroad. The deal also delighted Wall Street by bringing one of the nation's most highly regarded rail executives, Robert D. Krebs of Santa Fe, to Burlington as successor to the retiring Gerald Grinstein.
"The Burlington Northern Santa Fe merger changed the landscape of the Western railroad industry forever," said Mr. Davidson, the Union Pacific chief executive. "It made our merger inevitable."

HEADLINE: Bond Rally Helps Stocks, But Dow Retreats by 5.17

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A late bond rally and some bargain hunting among depressed technology shares lifted most of the stock market yesterday.
But the tone of trading remained cautious as money mangers sold shares to try to make the performance of their portfolios look good for the end of the quarter. Investors braced for potential surprises in next week's economic data and the Federal Reserve's meeting on monetary policy, at which it will decide whether to adjust interest rates. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.17 points, to 5,677.53, recovering from a midafternoon slide of 36 points as bond prices jumped, sending long-term interest rates below 7 percent for the first time in three weeks.
But the Nasdaq market, which is heavily weighted with technology issues, was stronger from the start of the session as bargain hunters took advantage of Wednesday's 19-point tumble.
A series of cautious profit outlooks in the computer industry has led to several rounds of profit taking after the powerful rally in that sector this spring. Since setting a record high at 1,249.15 on June 5, the Nasdaq composite index has lost 6.8 percent of its value.
The Nasdaq rose 12.72, to 1,166.01, helped by big rebounds in computer-related issues like Dell Computer, up 2 3/4, at 48 1/2; Iomega, up 6 1/2, at 27 1/2, and U.S. Robotics, up 7, at 84 3/4.
The Dow industrials were weighed down by Procter & Gamble, which fell 2 1/4, to 91 1/4, after announcing a $150 million after-tax charge to earnings to increase its reserve for changes in pulp prices, and Union Carbide, which fell 2 1/4, to 40 3/8, after the chemical maker reportedly issued a cautious second-quarter assessment to analysts.
The market value index of the American Stock Market fell 5.50, to 570.13, its lowest level since April 11. The Amex has now plunged 7.3 percent since setting a record high at 614.99 on May 22.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-10 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 405.6 million shares as of 4 P.M., up from 386.5 million in the previous session.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.71, to 357.58, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.16, to 668.55. Both indexes were lower until midafternoon.
"There's been a lid on the broad market indices with these interest rates," said Robert Streed, senior investment adviser at Northern Trust in Chicago, about the pessimistic tone that's dominated the bond market for weeks. "As soon as you get a little lift in the bond market, stocks can pop up."
"There's been so much of a negative consensus building in the bond market. People have been talking about the Fed raising interest rates, wage inflation around corner, the economy remaining too strong; all of these bad things probably aren't going to happen."
The Labor Department reported yesterday morning that the number of American workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but remained at a level economists said represented slower job growth.
The weekly report generally draws less reaction than the monthly tally, which is due next Friday. In recent months, that report has disclosed strong employment growth, spurring worries that a rapid increase in consumer spending power would generate too much demand and inflation.
Analysts are divided over whether the Federal Reserve's policy makers, who meet next Tuesday and Wednesday, will decide to raise interest rates as a pre-emptive strike against inflation. Higher interest rates can hurt corporate profits by raising borrowing costs and slowing revenues.

HEADLINE: CBS Adding a Spanish-Language Channel

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Signaling a long-delayed expansion into cable television, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and its CBS subsidiary announced yesterday the acquisition of Telenoticias, a Spanish-language, 24-hour news channel now distributed in more than 20 million homes in 22 countries.
Westinghouse expects to expand the channel's distribution throughout Latin America and Spain. Beginning in the fourth quarter, Westinghouse also plans to market the channel on cable television in American cities with significant Spanish-speaking populations, including New York, Los Angeles and Miami. 
 Donald H. Mitzner, the president of Group W Satellite Communications, was put in charge of marketing and distribution for the channel, which is based in Miami. The news operation will report to Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News.
The channel, which was renamed CBS/Telenoticias, would give CBS News its first foothold in cable television, a point that Mr. Heyward emphasized yesterday.
"Obviously it is terrifically significant for the new CBS to be expanding in news rather than contracting or standing still," Mr. Heyward said.
CBS News, under its previous owner, Laurence A. Tisch, underwent several rounds of cutbacks and never invested widely in expansion either internationally or in cable television. Two other networks, NBC and Fox, are already deep into planning 24-hour cable news channels to compete with the Cable News Network.
The Telenoticias channel does not plan to compete with those channels, not only because it will have minimal distribution in the United States, but also because it will be reported completely in Spanish, not English. But Mr. Heyward said that the competition among news organizations in the United States had led to "a saturation in the overall market," while a Spanish-language channel would be able to "speak to one the largest growth areas in the world."
CBS News also plans to make use of bilingual correspondents from Telenoticias and to revise some of its English-language programs for use on the channel, Mr. Heyward said.
Other CBS executives said that the cost of the service was another factor in making the investment attractive. "We will not have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to make this a viable service as the networks starting up news channels will," a CBS executive said.
Westinghouse bought Telenoticias from a consortium of owners that included Reuters Holdings P.L.C., Artear of Argentina, Antenna 3 International of Spain and Telemundo News Network. The purchase price was not disclosed, although one CBS executive described it as "highly economical" and two executives familiar with the deal put the cost in the $20 million range.
CBS remains the network with the smallest presence in the cable television business, but this deal could signal a change in strategy, CBS executives said. "This is the first step in a multichannel presence," Mr. Mitzner said. "There will be other steps."
He did not specify what those steps would be. CBS, alone among the four broadcast networks, never negotiated deals with cable operators three years ago for the right to retransmit the signals of its broadcast stations on cable systems. The three other networks created new cable channels as a means of gaining compensation from cable operators.
Mr. Mitzner said the Telenoticias channel would not be part of a CBS retransmission strategy, though other CBS executives suggested the network might make limited retransmission deals for the channel in those cities where there is a large Spanish-speaking audience.
Two executives suggested CBS had plans for further expansion into cable. The next channel the company invests in is also likely to involve some participation by CBS News, one executive said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Upbeat On Chip Deal With Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: LYONS, France, June 27

 BODY:
In a private half-hour session here today from which their key aides were excluded, President Clinton and the Japanese Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, appeared to lay the groundwork for a settlement of a highly contentious trade issue: extending one of the largest accords between the two countries, governing trade in computer chips.
The current agreement expires on July 31, a decade after the Reagan Administration first got the Japanese Government to agree to a target for American penetration of the Japanese chip market. Now United States companies have more than a 30 percent share of the market -- up from less than 10 percent a decade ago -- and the Japanese have refused to renew the accord, saying the problem is solved. 
 American officials were careful today in describing Mr. Clinton's talk with Mr. Hashimoto, in part because only a translator was with the two men when they went into an unscheduled half-hour of direct discussions. But officials familiar with the conversation, which was reconstructed later from the interpreter's notes and Mr. Clinton's own recounting, said they felt far more optimistic that Japanese officials now saw the political need for a deal.
"They're moving a long way," one American official said. Another added, "They both have political instincts telling them this has got to get solved."
A senior Japanese official familiar with Mr. Hashimoto's account of the same discussion interpreted the meeting the same way, though he cautioned that an agreement was not certain.
The public statements were far more neutral. "The President expressed concern that there has been very little progress" on the chip discussions, or on the enforcement of a previous accord providing foreign access to the Japanese insurance market, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the National Economic Council, told a news conference here, just before the opening of the annual meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
American officials contend that Japan has backed off on its commitments on the insurance market to protect its insurance industry, which has been battered during Japan's banking crisis. It was unclear whether any progress was likely in that dispute.
The two leaders, Ms. Tyson said, are "committed to work together to reach a solution to both problems by the end of July." She said the meeting was "a very positive session."
It was also a very political one. The chip accord in particular is a potent subject for Mr. Clinton in California, the key state he must win in November. His support in California's Silicon Valley has been much weaker than it was during the 1992 Presidential campaign, and donations from entrepreneurs there have fallen off sharply. His political advisers say he clearly wants to demonstrate that he is pressing for broader access to Japan, the world's largest consumer of semiconductors outside the United States.
Mr. Hashimoto, more than most Japanese politicians, has a gut sense of the connection between trade accords and vote-getting. A skilled negotiator, he struck the automobile agreement with the United States a year ago this week, when he was still the Minister of International Trade and Industry. That deal, which resulted in vague Japanese assurances that more American-made cars and auto parts would be sold in Japan, averted a major trade war. It also helped raise Mr. Hashimoto's stature in Japan, paving the way for him to gain the prime ministership.
The outlines of a semiconductor deal the United States will accept are already fairly clear. The United States has said that unlike the previous two versions of the chip accords it would not seek a specific numerical share of the market, or even a commitment from the Japanese Government to guarantee access. Instead, it would likely settle for a Government blessing of an industry-to-industry agreement. That is the deal that still needs to be negotiated.
"We just need something that will keep the heat on," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers said recently. "Otherwise, we know there will be backsliding."
There is still opposition in Japan to renewing the accord, chiefly from bureaucrats who are asking: Why cannot a trade agreement die a dignified death once it has succeeded?
It is a question American officials are loath to answer. But there is little question that the chip accords have helped create an atmosphere that greatly increased purchases of American chips. Much of that increase might have occurred anyway, however, because of Japan's total reliance on Intel microprocessors for most of its personal computer lines.
Nonetheless, the United States has insisted that a "transition accord" is needed before Washington will be satisfied to leave a multibillion-dollar business to what Ms. Tyson referred to today as "a full-fledged, dynamic, competitive marketplace."

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
I grew up in the southwest Virginia coal fields in a big family of storytellers who, my mother liked to say, would rather "climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground and tell the truth." I spent my childhood hanging around the Buchanan County Courthouse (where my granddaddy was the treasurer) and at my daddy's Ben Franklin dime store right across the street. I heard a lot of stories.
I also read every book I could get my hands on. What I especially liked were the books that made me feel all wild and trembly inside: "The Secret Garden," which I read maybe 20 times; and "Little Women," especially the part where Beth dies; and "Gone With the Wind," especially the part where Melanie dies. I loved anything at all about horses and saints. Reading, I felt exactly the way I felt during summer thunderstorms: I just had to run out of the house and up the mountain into the very storm to whirl in the thunder and rain while lightning cracked all around me. 
 At the time I was growing up, everybody I knew in Appalachia felt that culture was somewhere else: in Europe, in New York City or in Richmond. Culture was a long, long way from where we were. And when the time came, I was "sent off" to get some.
Well, I did. I ended up becoming a writer and a professor. By then I'd realized that some of the best stories I had to tell were those I'd heard so long ago, in Buchanan County, spoken in the most picturesque and precise language I would ever hear, Appalachian English. (A creek "turkey-tails out in the bottom," in the dialect of my birthplace, and a baby small enough to stay put on a blanket is a "a set-along child.")
 I also realized that I was hearing entirely too much about agents and advances, about "revising the canon" and "privileging the text." I was depressed about writing, which no longer seemed relevant to anything. I had "gotten above my raising," as my family might have said; I was too far removed from the springs of my own language.
So two years ago, when I was offered a Lila Wallace-Readers' Digest Writers' Award to do community work with a nonprofit group of my choice, I went back to the coal fields.
Now, for several weeks each year, I work with the Hindman Settlement School right over the Virginia state line in Hindman, Ky. The school's adult learning center, a no-nonsense brick building overhanging a muddy creek, offers a literacy program, adult education classes and tutoring services for the high school equivalency exam. The need for these programs is great. Half the county's population hasn't made it through high school; most dropouts leave before the ninth grade. Unemployment is high, and incomes are low.
My work in this brick building has helped me remember the enormous sense of empowerment that comes with mastering written language. It was, for example, a revelation for me to meet Connel Polly from Vicco, Ky., a successful, red-haired, talkative contractor who for almost 50 years had kept his illiteracy a secret from everybody but his wife. In "It's Like Coming Out of a Deep Hole," his book of memories published by the Hindman school, he writes:
"One time, the mining company sent me to Canton, Ohio, going after mine parts in a pickup truck. They had told me which roads to take and what the exit was, and I was supposed to find this company that was on Fifth Street. So I drove all around looking for a 5, and I couldn't find it. That's when I realized 'Fifth' was a word, and I couldn't read it. I couldn't find it. That's the only time I ever cried in my life. I just pulled off the road and sat there and cried. I was 8 hours away from home and it was getting dark. That was pitiful. Finally I had to ask somebody, and it turned out I was sitting right at it. I could see it. I felt so bad I didn't even stay the night. After I did my business I drove on back, and I was down all the way home. I was so blue. I felt the worst I've ever felt. There I was -- a grown man -- trying to make a living in that shape!"
Now, he writes:
"I didn't know learning to read would change my life so much. It has made me have more confidence in myself. Before, I even had a fear of going into a public restroom. I had fear of being embarrassed by someone handing me something to read. I stayed away from places such as banks, post offices and doctors' offices. The first visit to a new doctor was hardest because you had to fill out forms. I always had my wife with me. Now, I'll go anywhere. Also, me and my wife leave notes for each other. Now that's something!"
And here's Florida Slone, a lively ballad singer who enrolled just after she was widowed:
"I always thought of myself as a bean planted in a garden, and then someone put a big rock on top of me so that I could not get out of the ground. Now . . . I have gotten my driver's license, and I can write my checks. I can read my Bible and my songbooks. I have always liked to make up songs and stories, but I never could write them down before. Now I can. I am beginning to grow. Maybe one of these days I'll be like Jack's beanstalk!"
Mrs. Slone has written down a book of songs by now. "A Garden of Songs," published by the school, includes hymns, love ballads and party tunes like "Chew Tobacco" and "Big Fat Dog." There are also songs like "Red Hot Election" and "School Bus Wreck in Floyd County," which chronicle local events. Some of her songs read like poetry:
Last night I sat and watched the clouds go by
I heard whippoorwills call from the mountains so high
I heard the water as it dropped soft and low
Seems like death is a secret nobody knows.
Most of my writing students are women; many have enrolled upon discovering, after divorce or widowhood, what they could do for themselves.
Glenda Johnson, who eventually had to drop out of the program to tend ailing family members, first found the time to write about her son:
This is a poem about Roy Glen Johnson.
He has blue eyes
and blond looking hair . . .
He is afraid of my father.
He would like to have
His family whole again.
Then there's Ollie Wallen, who was shy and extremely quiet when I first met her two years ago in the high school equivalency program and who now joins every discussion. She recently wrote to her Congressman with a complaint and was pleased when he called her at home to advise her how to take action on getting benefits she was due. One of her poems is about marriage and divorce, about doing things for herself. Her self-image, she writes, has changed from from "bad" to "great" --
"Like a rope was wrapped around me
But now it is loose."
It's a long, winding road from where I am living now to the mountains of eastern Kentucky. But it has brought me home -- back to what reading and writing were all about in the first place, before book tours and disputes about deconstruction. Helping people express themselves in writing for the first time is like watching them fall in love. For me, it has brought back the old thrill, the lightning storm.

HEADLINE: House Defeats a Move to End China's Favored Trade Status

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The House defeated an effort today to revoke China's broad trade privileges with the United States.
Lawmakers blocked the resolution by a vote of 286 to 141, assuring China's preferred trade status for another year. Reflecting divisions in both parties, 167 Republicans and 119 Democrats voted against the measure, while 65 Republicans, 75 Democrats and one independent voted for it. 
 On May 21, the White House renewed China's "most favored nation" status for another year. The decision could have been overruled only by a vote of both houses of Congress.
President Clinton and Bob Dole, the likely Republican presidential candidate, support the renewal. "Most favored nation" trade status permits a country's goods to be imported to the United States with the same low tariffs enjoyed by nearly all other nations.
"The strong bipartisan action today is clear evidence that the American people agree that engagement, not isolation, is the best way to advance America's vital interests with China and the world," President Clinton said at the Group of Seven economic summit meeting in Lyons, France.
But opponents argued that the United States should not reward a Government that abridges human rights, violates treaties restricting sales of missile technology and wages unfair trade practices.
Renewing China's trade privileges reinforces a centerpiece of the Administration's Asia policy and opens the way for billions of dollars of uninterrupted trade with American companies like Boeing, Ford and General Motors. Total trade between the two countries has increased to $57.3 billion in 1995 from $4.8 billion in 1980, making China the United States' sixth-largest trading partner.
But opponents of renewing the trade benefits won a small concession, a promise that four House committees -- Banking and Financial Services, International Relations, National Security, and Ways and Means -- will hold hearings on China's checkered record on human rights, spreading of weapons and trade policies. The House approved this resolution by a vote of 411 to 7.
The three-hour debate on the House floor today centered on whether the United States should engage China rather than threaten it with trade sanctions as the best way to promote human rights and protect America's security and trade interests in Asia.
Both sides criticized China's human rights record, citing reports of persecuted Tibetans, Government-imposed abortions and army-operated prison labor camps that manufacture industrial goods.
Both sides condemned China's sale of M-11 missiles to Pakistan and nuclear-reactor technology to Iran, and an apparent attempt by state-owned Chinese companies to smuggle illegal automatic weapons into the United States for sale to street gangs.
Both sides denounced the piracy of American music, movies and computer software in China, and other unfair trade practices.
But supporters and opponents of renewing China's trade status differed sharply on how to influence China.
Supporters said that only by engaging China in free trade would Washington have leverage to influence Beijing.
"Yes, things are bad in China," said Representative Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida. "By cutting off normal trade relations, we'd only succeed in isolating China again. We should be building bridges instead of burning bridges."
Representative Thomas W. Ewing, Republican of Illinois, said, "When we're involved in China, we can improve the conditions in China."
But opponents of favorable trade status for Beijing accused the Administration of coddling a tyrannical regime and argued that China would change its behavior only if threatened with the loss of American trade.
"These people don't think like us," said Representative Joe Scarborough, a Florida Republican. "They don't share our values. They only understand that the U.S. continues to kow-tow to them."
Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of New York, said: "Whatever happened to U.S. foreign policy that looked out for human decency around the world? Appeasement of tyrants does not work."
China's trade status comes up for renewal every year, offering a forum to link human rights with trade policy. But this year's debate was even more spirited because many previous supporters said they were fed up with China's record.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, and Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House's second-ranking Democrat, both bucked the White House and voted to revoke the trade benefits.

HEADLINE: Michigan Asks U.S. to Approve Work-for-Welfare Plan

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 27

 BODY:
The State of Michigan asked the Clinton Administration today for permission to undertake a vast welfare overhaul whose central provision would require work in exchange for benefits.
This afternoon the state delivered to the Federal Department of Health and Human Services an inch-high stack of documents requesting the necessary waivers -- 75 exemptions in all -- that would allow it to deviate from the Government's welfare rules. 
 In addition, two Michigan Republicans -- Senator Spencer Abraham and Representative Dave Camp -- introduced in Congress a pair of bills that would grant the waivers through legislation.
Michigan's Governor, John Engler, along with Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, has been in the forefront of a Republican effort for a sweeping change in national policy that would end welfare's status as a Federal entitlement and grant the states, with virtually no strings, authority to design and administer their own welfare programs.
President Clinton signaled his support last September for one welfare-overhaul bill approved by the Senate but vetoed two subsequent versions, calling them too harsh on children. In the meantime, states like Michigan, granted a variety of waivers by Washington, have proceeded with their own experiments, imposing restrictions on welfare beneficiaries and creating work incentives.
In submitting the new waiver requests today, Mr. Engler, frequently mentioned as a possible running mate of Bob Dole, the apparent Republican Presidential nominee, blamed the Administration for the delay in changing Federal welfare law.
"President Clinton, who has said he wants to end welfare as we know it, has done his utmost to protect a failed system and preserve welfare as we know it," the Governor said.
In response, Melissa T. Skolfield, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, defended Mr. Clinton's record.
"The President has said repeatedly that he would like Congress to pass national welfare reform legislation," Ms. Skolfield said, "but in the meantime we have used our waiver authority under current law to aggressively reform the welfare system state by state."
In all, the Administration has now granted 40 states a total of 67 such waivers. An additional waiver seemed at hand last month, when Mr. Clinton, in a radio address, appeared to endorse a Wisconsin plan intended to abolish welfare. But Administration officials have since said they have concerns about some of that plan's central provisions.
Michigan and Wisconsin would move in the same direction: They would require nearly all welfare recipients to work, and they would quickly cut off benefits to those who did not. But the Michigan plan stops short of Wisconsin's proposal, which would not guarantee a job and could leave even those who qualify for benefits without government aid.
This difference in the two approaches may make it easier for Michigan to win Federal approval.
In fact, on Wednesday the Administration approved part of an earlier waiver request from Michigan: the Department of Health and Human Services agreed to allow the state to cut off cash benefits to teen-age parents who do not live with their own parents or other adults, and to teen-age parents who skip school.
On the other hand, the Department of Agriculture, which handles waiver requests for the food-stamp program, today denied Michigan permission to cut off stamps to the very same beneficiaries who were the subject of the Health and Human Services waiver. The department said it lacked authority to grant a waiver.
Mr. Engler today called for Mr. Clinton to approve Michigan's new waiver requests within 30 days. But Ms. Skolfield said a decision was unlikely to come so quickly because Michigan's complex application did not meet requirements for so-called fast-track approval. She said the Administration's goal would be to reach a decision within four months.
The Michigan plan takes a carrot-and-stick approach to welfare.
The state would cut off cash benefits and food stamps within 60 days to recipients who refused to take a job offered or, if no job was available, to those who refused to perform community-service work or enroll in job-training programs.
But the state would guarantee access to transportation and child care for those who participated in the program. Michigan would also pay to continue Medicaid benefits for one year for welfare recipients who find jobs in the private sector but lack health insurance.
Michigan's welfare caseload has dropped significantly over the last two years, but it is unclear whether it is the changes in the political climate or in the economic climate that deserve the greater credit.
Mr. Engler has repeatedly pointed to the decline in the state's caseload as evidence that his earlier welfare changes are working. There are now 176,634 people receiving welfare benefits in the state, down 20 percent from the level of two years ago.
But the numbers have been helped by Michigan's strong economy. Buoyed by an automobile industry that is earning record profits, the state has boomed in recent years.

HEADLINE: Look to the Peace Scaffolding, Mr. Netanyahu

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your June 26 news article on the meeting between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in Jerusalem: 
 The agreements signed at Oslo and ratified in 1993 on the White House lawn were the most far-reaching initiative taken by an Israeli Government in recent decades.
If Israel's relationships with Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Morocco, Tunisia, Oman, Qatar, Mauritania and Turkey are weakened, its security and prestige in the world community will be seriously undermined.
The United States invested a great deal of its influence in helping Israel build new relationships in the Arab and Muslim worlds. When Arab reactions to new statements of Israeli policies seemed to threaten Israel's hard-won positions in the Middle East, it was natural for Secretary of State Christopher to feel and show concern. The danger of a halt in the expansion of Israel's international relations has not yet been overcome.
The previous Israeli government bequeathed a rich bounty to its successors: a booming economy, a growth of gross national product that most of the seven industrialized countries would envy, a series of recent anti-terrorist successes and the widest breach ever made in the wall of Arab and Muslim hostility.
Israel now has relations with 168 countries and is almost the least, not the most, isolated nation in the international system. The Middle East peace process is responsible for most of this.
Every government stands tall on the shoulders of its predecessors and then boasts of its own farsightedness. The existing 1993 peace process is a strong foundation on which Prime Minister Netanyahu can build. It is not a scaffolding that he can lightly discard.

HEADLINE: Make Rent Increases Province of City Council

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The New York City Rent Guidelines Board decision to grant landlords the largest rent increase in seven years (news article,June 25) points to a fundamental flaw in the structure of our city government: economic decisions affecting millions of people should not be in the hands of unelected officials. 
 Voters and tenant groups are wasting their time and energy screaming and demonstrating at public hearings of the board, which is appointed by the mayor. Such hearings are little more than political window dressing, and news accounts invariably depict them as political circus.
Instead, voters should be directing efforts at making these decisions the responsibility of their elected representatives on the City Council, who will then be answerable in the most effective way possible.
Politicians will think twice before betraying their constituents when their jobs are on the line, and voters will regain a measure of control over vital economic decisions.
But this won't happen unless New Yorkers start to take city government more seriously. Only then can New Yorkers make city government more responsive to their needs, rather than the needs of banks and landlords.

HEADLINE: A Drive to Defeat Giuliani in 1997

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
The meetings have been held throughout the city for months now, in churches, in offices and in restaurants, and virtually every black elected official in New York City has attended one or more of them. The agenda is always the same: figuring out how to register more than 250,000 new voters in the next 17 months, create a robust "get out the vote" effort and, finally, defeat Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The city's black elected officials have held strategy meetings before with the intention of affecting mayoral elections, with mixed results. In 1985, they tried to support Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr. In 1977, they tried to rally behind the Manhattan Borough President, Percy E. Sutton. 
 Internal bickering derailed those efforts; with them went the possibility of establishing a powerful organization within the Democratic Party. Power gains after the successful 1989 campaign for David N. Dinkins were offset by Mr. Dinkins's defeat in 1993.
Now, perceiving that they are virtually shut out of the Mayor's circle, black politicians are reaching out in a show of unusual strength to other politicians, labor leaders and a cross-section of black clergy members. Notably, they are doing so in the absence of a black candidate.
One indicator of the strength of this effort is the leadership role played by H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller and the first black official elected to statewide office.
"The idea is to make some collective decisions, to have some impact on the upcoming elections," said Mr. McCall, who, as the state's highest-ranking Democrat, has become a leader for black Democrats.
The meetings are called by the Council of Black Elected Democrats, a statewide organization of politicians. So far, a large number of politicians -- more than three dozen -- have been involved, including Representatives Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan and Major R. Owens and Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn. State assemblymen, state senators and City Council members from every borough have also been involved, including Councilwoman Helen M. Marshall of Queens and Senator David A. Paterson of Manhattan and Assembly members Gloria Davis of the Bronx and Albert Vann of Brooklyn.
In recent months, along with black politicians, the meetings have included black clergymen: the Rev. Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker of Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry of the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn and the Rev. Al Sharpton, the former candidate for United States Senate. And they have held meetings with labor leaders, like Brian M. McLaughlin, the Queens Assemblyman who is also president of the New York City Central Labor Council, and Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the National Health and Human Services Employees Union.
At times, the meetings are structured, with officials from the State Legislature, the City Council and Congress assigned to make presentations on issues considered of particular concern to black voters. At other times, the discussions are freewheeling, focusing on a wide variety of topics, from how to raise money for voter registration to estimating the degree to which white Democratic leaders will support their efforts.
"We learned some lessons from David Dinkins's loss," said Gregory W. Meeks, an Assemblyman from Queens who is the chairman of the Council of Black Elected Democrats. "We learned that we can't rely on anyone to do this kind of work but ourselves. We have to be the ones to make sure people are registered and that we pull them out to vote."
The first priority is a voter registration drive, then a "get out the vote" effort for this year's Presidential election. That is meant as a dress rehearsal for the mayoral race.
The officials hope to capitalize on what they see as a strong anti-Giuliani feeling among black voters. That feeling was in evidence at a free concert in Harlem yesterday sponsored by the Fugees, the rap group.
The rally, the idea of the group's lead singer, Lauryn Hill, was dedicated to voter registration; dozens of volunteers circulated among the thousands of people at the concert, trying to get them to fill out voter registration forms. While Ms. Hill said the event was nonpolitical, there was a pronounced undercurrent of animosity toward Mayor Giuliani.
"Giuliani must go," said a 22-year-old senior at City College who gave his name only as Tre. "I never thought that voting accomplishes much. But with what he has done to raise tuition and everything else, I'm registering this time."
Andre Blackman, a recent Lehman College graduate, said: "There is a strong feeling among people that there is a need for change."
Mr. Meeks recently said: "Since we all agree that Giuliani must go, we're trying to use our collective strength to come together in a unified bloc to determine who the next mayor will be. We want to use the Presidential election to establish an infrastructure to be a major force in the 1997 election."
After interviews and discussions with various mayoral candidates, the council expects to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.
The clergymen and the labor leaders say they are interested in collaborating with the black officials on election strategies for the Clinton campaign and the voter registration drive. But the labor leaders say it is too early to decide political strategy for the next mayoral election.
"We're having dialogue with the black elected officials," Mr. McLaughlin said. "And when the time comes for us to make an endorsement, we will certainly consult with them. We think it's a powerful coalition that will strengthen with constructive dialogue. But for the 1997 election, it's still premature to discuss what we might do."
Whether this broad coalition lasts and bears fruit is a matter very much under debate. For one thing, many of these officials have already made their private alliances with Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn, who has announced his candidacy, or with one of the all-but-announced Democratic contenders: the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, and Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President. Still others are waiting to see if other candidates emerge.
Also, there is the clash of egos and interests encountered in any group of politicians. Those are heightened in part by historic political rifts between black Democratic officials in Manhattan and those in other boroughs, particularly Brooklyn.
In the last two mayoral elections, black elected officials were united in support of Mr. Dinkins. But seldom has there been much unanimity among black elected officials in the absence of a black candidate. In fact, there are already differing views among these very officials on whether the group should promote the candidacy of a black official for Mayor.
Then, there is the issue of how to finance such a large-scale voter-registration drive. Some officials in the group are looking for money from President Clinton's re-election campaign organization. But, many officials say, that will not be likely to come because the President is already doing well in the polls in New York.
And some black elected officials complain that the group of black Democrats are placing too much emphasis on political, rather then economic, solutions to problems.
"Frankly, I find it frustrating sometimes that our African-American leadership does not seem to accept the notion that economics and business development will determine the survival of our people," Representative Floyd H. Flake, a Democrat from Queens, said. "The political role is important, but it should not play the predominant role it has played over the last 30 years."
Also, it is unclear how fast an alliance with labor might hold, particularly where opposing Mr. Giuliani is concerned. Stanley Hill, executive director of the city's largest municipal employees' union, has participated in some of the meetings. But he recently stunned a group of Democrats at a labor breakfast by lauding two of New York's most prominent Republicans -- Mayor Giuliani and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- for helping his members, while criticizing the state's leading Democrat, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
Missing among the clergy is the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Mr. Butts was so frustrated a few years ago by his lack of impact on the Democratic Party that he began courting Republicans.
Mr. Meeks and Mr. McCall concede that unanimity is an impossible goal and that what they are seeking is some degree of consensus. And while they say it will be impossible for everyone in the group to agree with the endorsement of a mayoral candidate, they add that their emphasis is largely on developing what they call "political infrastructure," voter registration and bringing voters to the polls.

HEADLINE: BOMBING IN SAUDI ARABIA: THE POLICY;
Clinton Asks Summit Partners to Join in Battle on Terrorism

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: LYONS, France, June 27

 BODY:
President Clinton appealed today to the leaders of the world's biggest economic powers to join the United States in a stepped-up international campaign against crime and terrorism in the wake of Tuesday's bombing in Saudi Arabia.
A few hours before the start of the annual meeting of the Group of Seven nations, Mr. Clinton traveled from Lyons, France's second city, to the restored medieval village of Perouges, northeast of here. In a speechthere to villagers, war veterans and schoolchildren gathered in a cobblestone square, he said: "We must rally the forces of tolerance and freedom everywhere to work against terrorism." 
 He said he would put to his colleagues "40 very specific recommendations to combat crime and terror, to increase our efforts to prevent terrorists from committing their crimes and our ability to track, catch and punish them when they do." Apparently the proposals were recast this week following the bombing in Dhahran, in which 19 Americans were killed; last week, officials in Washington described them as a 40-point program to fight crime and money-laundering.
Mr. Clinton plans to cut short a visit to Paris on Saturday, the White House said, in order to fly to Florida, where he will attend memorial services on Sunday at Eglin Air Force Base and at Patrick Air Force Base.
The President was pressed by reporters to say whether greater precautions should have been taken at the Saudi compound where the Americans died, particularly in view of the devastating 1983 bombings in Beirut. He said that a fence gave the Dhahran installation "a 35-yard cushion, and the bomb was just bigger than anyone calculated could be gotten in that close to the building."
After his trip to Perouges, a fortified hilltop village so picturesque that is often used as a set for movies, the President met individually with President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime Minister John Major of Britain and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan. He said they had agreed to support a lot of his recommendations and added, "I believe they will be willing to do more."
Asked whether some of the other nations represented here would cease economic contacts with countries the United States considers sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran, Syria and Libya, Mr. Clinton replied: "Let's just wait and see. You know what my position is on that, so we'll just keep working on it."
But several senior American officials said they expected no broad agreement to emerge from the three-day meeting here, which involves Canada, Italy and Germany in addition to Japan, Britain, France and the United States. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia is scheduled to join the talks on Saturday morning.
At Perouges, Mr. Clinton spoke at length on links between the United States and France, whose relations have greatly improved recently after several rocky decades. He noted that the village's mayor, Guy Passart de la Chapelle, had an ancestor, Pierre, who fought in the American Revolution, and that American troops of the 45th Davision helped to liberate this area late in August 1944.
Standing in the shadow of an ancient plane tree believed to have been planted in 1792, the final year of the French Revolution, the President said that rapid change poses fresh challenges.
"While new technologies and rapid movements of information and money and people across national borders bring all of us closer together," he declared in a 16-minute speech, "they also make all of us more open to common dangers -- crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, as we saw in Saudi Arabia."
Although the crowd was relatively sparse, perhaps because of security considerations, the schoolchildren were animated, waving French and American flags, and the village's ramparts, lane and tile roofs provided a vivid backdrop for the omnipresent television cameras.
The first big event of the summit meeting, as has become traditional, was the "class photo" of the leaders, taken at the Lyons City Hall. They then ate a dinner cooked by four chefs from towns and cities around Lyons whose restaurants have won three stars in the Michelin guide, including Paul Bocuse, long the high priest of French gastronomy.
Of the President's bilateral discussions, the talk with Mr. Hashimoto appeared the most substantive. Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said Mr. Clinton had expressed concern that little progress had been made since 1993 on trade issues involving insurance and semiconductors.
In a 30-minute meeting that "went beyond platitudes and got into real issues," she reported, the two leaders agreed to try to resolve the outstanding questions by the end of July.
Mr. Chirac, the host for this meeting, the 21st of its kind, complained to Mr. Clinton that the decline of American aid to poorer nations was undercutting the United States' leadership. Mr. Clinton blamed Republicans in Congress for the decline. Like other European leaders, Mr. Chirac also protested American moves to penalize countries who continue to trade with Cuba.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 29, 1996, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about an appeal by President Clinton for an international campaign against terrorism misidentified Laura Tyson. She is chairman of the National Economic Council; she left the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers last year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs Near 110 Yen As Japan Rate-Rise Fears Ebb

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to within a whisker of 110 yen yesterday, reaching its highest level in almost 29 months, as concerns about an increase in Japanese interest rates faded.
The yen fell against the dollar and other leading currencies after Japan said that its unemployment rate rose to a record 3.5 percent in May. The labor report reinforced the view that Japan's economic recovery was still too fragile to withstand an increase in interest rates. Higher rates in Japan would make some investments there more attractive, helping the yen. 
 The unemployment figure "takes away the view of an imminent Japanese rate increase," said Seth Cohen, director of currency sales at Merrill Lynch & Company. "That's firing up the dollar."
The dollar's gains also came as leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations met for a second day in Lyons, France.
The dollar climbed as high as 109.98 yen, its highest since Jan. 31, 1994, when it reached 110.26 yen. When the dollar failed to breach 110 yen, a psychologically important level, profit takers stepped in.
"We tried and couldn't get over it," said Lizbeth Goldberg, a currency saleswoman at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank. "It will take quite a push to go through it."
John Trammell, who manages currency investments for the A. Gary Shilling Company of Springfield, N.J., said, "As the dollar approached 110, there was a massive amount of selling."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 109.72 yen, up from 109.10 yen on Thursday. The dollar stood at 1.5241 German marks, up from 1.5180 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5505 from $1.5480.
The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- issued a statement yesterday welcoming the dollar's recovery from last year's post-World War-II lows against the mark and yen as "positive and promising."
Yet because the group stopped short of calling for a stronger dollar, traders said the impact on currency rates was slight.
"They're in favor of allowing the market to continue seeking an equilibrium level for the dollar," Mr. Cohen of Merrill Lynch said. "That implies tacit approval for a stronger dollar."

Used to Talk, Now Shrieks

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
It's all about money now. I saw a man standing on the street corner talking into his cellular phone. He was talking about money. What other subject is there nowadays? If I had a cellular phone I, too, would take it out to a street corner and talk about money. I can hear me now:
"How did gold open in Tokyo?" Or, "Sell 100,000 shares of Allied Apricot before noon." Or, "Buy me the most expensive haircut on the Atlantic Coast, scissors on the side." 
 I saw a man at the beach with a computer. He was asking it to check London to see if he could make a big killing in bonds before teatime; and if not in bonds, in stocks; and if not in stocks, how about pork bellies? How was the price of Joe DiMaggio baseball cards on the Bourse this afternoon?
If I had a computer suitable for the beach, I'd be doing the same thing if I knew what the Bourse was. Oh yes, of course I know it is in Paris and has something to do with money, money, money, money. Doesn't everything nowadays?
I saw the Senate kill a campaign finance reform bill. It was a bill filled with a hostility for money so alien to our age that it seemed to have risen from the antique mire. If I had a Senate seat bought for me at great expense by a lot of gigantic corporations, I too would vote to kill such a bill. I can hear me now:
"What is wrong, senators, with letting the corporations who run not only America but also the world -- what is wrong, I ask you with customary senatorial prolixity -- what is wrong with letting these great corporations choose the Senate which not only makes the laws they must obey, but also provides, protects and preserves the Federal subsidies on which they thrive?"
Money, money, money, money. Who can imagine anything else in the present age? I foresee schoolbook censors any day now banning all writings that suggest, no matter how subtly, that money cannot buy happiness.
The new formulation is thus: Happiness can't buy money.
Here are some other new formulations appropriate for today's America:
". . . o'er the land of the money and home of the big windfall."
"I pledge allegiance to the money and to my brand new Range Rover for which it stands . . ."
". . . among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of money." Or possibly, ". . . among these are life, money, and the pursuit of money."
Though, preferably, ". . . among these are money, money and the pursuit of money."
"Greed is bad, but there are things even worse than greed, like not owning a senator or a Range Rover."
Why all this interest in money? Is it sour grapes? Is it an expression of unseemly bitterness provoked by my failure to accumulate some capital gains?
To quote the philosopher Fats Waller, "One never knows, do one?" What I think I'm trying for, though, is a description of the environment in which the Clinton-Dole campaign is being conducted. The campaign already feels as if it has been in progress since the fall of the Bastille and seems likely to go on until Doomsday. Given so much idle time to think about a campaign that is clearly brain dead, we naturally start asking, "What's going on here -- if anything?"
Politics is mostly about which part of the electorate gets the money. Saying so is usually said to be cynical, but this is one of those periodic times in American history when the question of who gets the money is too blatantly in the open to be ignored.
Our eyes tell us the country is incredibly rich, while our politicians insist we are too poor to afford for millions the amenities of civilization, and economists tell us the middle class is shrinking.
The great beneficiary of the "No new taxes!" movement has been the rolling-in-money class, which, judging from the evidence of our eyes, can well afford to come across with more money. Not a chance. It uses its wealth to club any politician insolent enough to note that the well heeled don't pay their fair share.
Throughout his Presidency, Bill Clinton has respected that threat at least as faithfully as Senator Dole. Or, to put it impolitely, what difference does it make which man wins? Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Dole -- the more names change, the more things stay the same. Money, money, money, money and money rule.

HEADLINE: First-Quarter Growth Put Lower, at 2.2%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
The economy grew at a slower pace than previously estimated in the first quarter, reflecting a lull in export demand, Government figures showed today.
The nation's gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the Commerce Department said. Before the report, analysts had expected a gain of 2.3 percent, the same as the department's previous estimate. In the fourth quarter, the G.D.P. edged up just five-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The Commerce Department regularly revises its G.D.P. statistics as more information becomes available. Today's report marks the second and final revision of the first-quarter figures.
"It still shows the economy is healthy and it won't greatly change what we're likely to see for the third and fourth quarters," said Gary Thayer, an economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
The report comes as Federal Reserve policy makers prepare to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. Economists said the revised G.D.P. data confirmed their expectations that the Fed would not raise short-term interest rates next week.
The revision also confirmed the bond market's expectations, and Treasury prices rose sharply. The rally in bonds was also fed by a report from the Chicago Purchasing Management Association.
The association said its monthly index of regional manufacturing conditions rose to 53.3 from 53, suggesting regional manufacturing was improving at a sluggish pace. The prices-paid index rose to 53 from 52.2, a signal that more manufacturers were paying higher prices. Although both indexes rose, the gains were less than some economists expected.
The latest G.D.P. report "does not substantially change the general picture of the economy presented by the preliminary estimate," said J. Steven Landefeld, director of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. "First-quarter growth was markedly higher than in the fourth quarter of 1995," he said, paced by stronger consumer demand for big-ticket products.
For example, real final sales, which exclude the effects of inventory changes, rose 3.3 percent in the first quarter, after increasing 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
By category, consumer spending increased 3.6 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 1.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter of last year. Net exports of goods and services rose in the first quarter at a slower pace than first thought. Exports grew 2 percent in the first quarter, compared with a previous estimate of a 4.9 percent increase and an 11 percent gain in the fourth quarter.
First-quarter business inventories declined by $2.1 billion, a slower pace of liquidation than previously estimated, but still the first drop since the first quarter of 1992. Shrinking supplies of cars and trucks accounted for much of the decline.
The G.D.P. chain-weighted index, which tracks changes in the price of all goods and services made in the United States, increased at a 2.4 percent rate in the first quarter. In this category, too, there was no revision.
On the inflation front, the G.D.P. price deflator, a measure of price increases followed by Wall Street, grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the first quarter, unchanged from the last estimate. The price deflator measures the magnitude of price increases, and detects whether higher costs drive consumers away from a product.
The Commerce Department also reported today that after-tax corporate profits increased 5.9 percent during the first quarter after rising 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

Hungry for Respect, France's 2d City Puts On Its Best for Visitors

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: LYONS, France, June 28

 BODY:
Lyons doesn't get much respect, either from the snooty Parisians or from foreigners otherwise entranced with France.
But it hopes to make a better impression this week on the visitors -- politicians, aides and journalists -- who are here for the annual conference that brings together the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies. 
 Raymond Barre, a former French Prime Minister who was elected Mayor last year at the age of 71, sees the summit meeting as a kind of "debutantes' ball" that will give Lyons a chance to demonstrate its charms. At the moment, he conceded recently, "Lyons is not very well known or recognized," although it is France's second largest city, with a metropolitan population of 1,200,000.
It is, in fact, a lovely place, full of handsome, well-kept old buildings and elegant squares. For the visitors' benefit, the city has been brilliantly floodlighted and some of the bouchons, the working-class bistros unique to Lyons, have been told to scrub themselves down. This is necessary, French television reported this week, so that Americans will not be frightened away by "their fear of germs."
Giant masts have been built on the east bank of the Rhone, opposite President Clinton's hotel, to fly the flags of the nations represented here. Posters showing childrens' impressions of the participating countries have been put up on street corners; the American one shows the McDonald's logo, the World Trade Center, Mickey Mouse and a forest of Coca-Cola bottles.
Officials estimate the cost of all the preparations at about $4 million, but they expect the visitors to spend more than $5 million.
 
Bringing Tricolors to France
There are certain set-pieces at each of these annual fiestas.
Inevitably, a political issue pops up at the last minute to deflect the leaders' attention from their economic agenda. This time, terrorism, in the form of Tuesday's bomb attack in Saudi Arabia, is the uninvited guest, horning in on a conference that President Jacques Chirac of France wanted to focus on aid to the third world.
Inevitably, too, the police close major streets. The locals grumble. The locals stay home. The cab drivers and restaurateurs (and, on the two occasions when the meeting was held in Venice, the gondoliers) lose money.
This time, by way of compensation for the Lyonnais, a big concert is planned for Saturday night, after the conference has ended, with prominent musicians from each G-7 country. The American representative was to have been Bob Dylan, but "it proved impossible," a local official noted sourly, "for him to be here and in Hyde Park in London on the same night." Mr. Dylan will be performing at a big concert in London on Saturday.
One American who did show up, President Clinton, has been applauded, although the sheer scope of the White House entourage has, as always, raised eyebrows. At the medieval village of Perouges on Thursday, the chief of police, Francois L'Esprit, complained about French flags distributed to schoolchildren by presidential advance men hoping to pep up television pictures.
"Why does he bring everything with him?" the chief asked. "Does he think we have no flags of our own? This is not Africa or China, you know."
 
A Flap Over Chickens
For Mr. Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, the champion trenchermen among this week's visitors, Lyons has put its best plates forward.
Tonight the leaders had dinner at Leon de Lyon, a much-beloved establishment in the center of the city that features such dishes as pike dumplings, frog's legs, suckling pig and "six desserts on a praline theme."
The city proper has no three-star restaurants, as defined by the Michelin guide, but there are four within a drive of an hour or so. Their chefs cooked the leaders' dinner on Thursday night -- Paul Bocuse of Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or in the Lyons suburbs, Pierre Troisgros of Roanne, George Blanc of Vonnas and the new boy in the group, Marc Veyrat of the Auberge de l'Eridan on the Lake of Annecy.
No nouvelle cuisine, Mr. Chirac cautioned them, no fancy stuff. So Mr. Blanc, a third-generation chef, made his grandmother's famous creamed chicken, with a few special touches such as a garnish of chicken livers. Of course, he used the local Bresse chickens, France's finest, which have coloration appropriate for a patriotic occasion like this -- red crests, white plumage and blue feet.
Mr. Blanc is president of the resoundingly titled Interprofessional Committee for the Promotion of Bresse Chicken, and he knows Mr. Clinton comes from a big chicken-producing state. In a chat the other day, he even mentioned Don Tyson, the Arkansas poultry magnate and amply certified Friend of Bill.
So it has come as something of a disappointment to the chef that he has been unable to gain permission to introduce Bresse chickens to the United States. Someone told him he would do better if he put some American wines on the list at his restaurant, so now there are a few puddles of Ridge and Mondavi from California amidst the lakes of Burgundy and Rhone and Bordeaux on offer chez Blanc.
"It didn't work," Mr. Blanc said. "It's very sad, because they are wonderful birds. There must be something here that I don't understand."

HEADLINE: Keep Trucks Out of Saratoga Park

 BODY:
The mineral springs at Saratoga were first used by the people of the Iroquois Confederacy. Since early colonial days the waters have drawn visitors who came to relax in mineral baths. Today Saratoga Spa State Park includes a grand Georgian hotel, two race tracks, bridle paths, golf courses, a trout stream and a heron rookery. Saratoga is something of a cultural and social icon to New Yorkers. Its environment does not need more stress.
Even so, some local people, citing increased traffic congestion in town, want to put a new truck route through the southern section of the park. Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro said this spring that she would not allow it, and Gov. George Pataki indicated that he backed her decision. But local business people keep pressuring the Governor, despite the fact that other alternatives -- including roads outside the park -- have not been adequately studied. The Commissioner and the Governor should resist this pressure. 
 Earlier this month the State Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whose district includes Saratoga, introduced a provision in the Senate version of the state budget to set aside $500,000 to study possible solutions to the congestion problem. Mr. Bruno says he does not favor any particular plan.
Some boosters of the park route have resorted to inflammatory language, painting environmentalists concerned about its impact as fanatics and describing the issue as "jobs vs. frogs." They point out that the route through the park would be the most convenient way to link the current truck route with a local industrial park.
But state parks are not created to be partitioned by roads whenever it is commercially convenient. The local task force that studied the problem was weighted with people who favored the park route and did not seriously consider alternatives. It seemed unimpressed by the damage a truck route would cause to fragile wetlands, with their breeding grounds for the great blue heron.
Ms. Castro and Mr. Pataki were on the right track. The money appropriated by Senator Bruno should be used to find a good alternate route. Saratoga Park, which attracts 1.4 million visitors a year and clearly benefits the local economy, should be left intact.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls on Mixed Signals In End-of-Quarter Action

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks gave back early gains to close lower yesterday, but technology stocks led the Nasdaq market to its second consecutive gain.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended 22.90 points lower at 5,654.63 after gaining 27 points early in the day. For the week, it was down 50.60 points. 
 But broader indexes were higher. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.08 points, to 670.63. And the Nasdaq composite index surged 19.01 points, to 1,185.02 -- its biggest daily percentage gain in four months.
Analysts said they did not think there was much to be gleaned from the day's action. They said the market's mixed signals were typical of end-of-the-quarter portfolio adjustments.
"At the end of the quarter a lot of strange things happen," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter. "It's difficult or dangerous to read things into this."
The stock market largely shrugged off a strong rally in bonds on growing expectations that the economy was not growing fast enough to accelerate inflation.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates -- fell to 6.89 percent, from 6.99 percent on Thursday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
Interest-sensitive stocks, particularly utilities, benefited from the rate outlook.
Among utility stocks, PECO Energy rose 1, to 26, and DTE Energy gained 1 1/8, to 30 7/8.
Investors will soon start focusing on second-quarter earnings reports, looking for clues as to which group of stocks will replace technology as market leaders, analysts said.
The market is currently lacking direction, said Ken Tower, an analyst at UST Securities. "Stocks are going through a very tough time," he said.
Several initial public offerings were strong yesterday, with closely watched Donna Karan International Inc. gaining 4, to 28, in its first session.
Among other initial stock offerings, Check Point Software Technologies jumped 10, to 24; Seibel Systems surged 13 3/4, to 30 3/4, and Factset Research Systems rose 3, to 20.
Union Carbide lost 5/8, to 39 3/4, after the company said its second-quarter earnings would be hurt by falling ethylene glycol prices.
Commercial Intertech leaped 6 3/4, to 25 7/8, after United Dominion Industries offered $27 a share in an unsolicited bid Thursday for the diversified manufacturer.
Planet Hollywood International gained 4 1/4, to 27. It agreed to form a joint venture with the ITT Corporation to develop themed casino hotels in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and other resort areas. ITT rose 1/4, to 66 1/4.
American depository receipts of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel added 3 1/2, to 37 7/8, after saying it expected sales and gross profits at its American generic drug unit to top its first-quarter results and those of last year's second quarter. Each A.D.R. represents 10 ordinary shares.
Stocks overseas ended the week just slightly higher. The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese issues closed up 29.14
points, or one-tenth of 1 percent, at 22,530.75, a rise of only 0.1 point from last Friday. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed 32.2 points higher at 3,711.2, its biggest point gain since mid-April. But for the week, the index was down 11.1 points.

HEADLINE: Summit Meeting Endorses Plan Giving Police Freer Rein to Pursue Criminals Abroad

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: LYONS, France, June 28

 BODY:
The leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies and Russia endorsed a 40-point plan today to combat crime and terrorism that would, if fully carried out, give the police far freer rein to pursue criminals abroad.
The plan, disclosed at the 22d annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven countries, would allow the United States and other countries to post investigators on foreign soil and would require the seven allies to crack down on the import and export of firearms. 
 The plan was under development before the terrorist bombing on Tuesday that killed 19 American servicemen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. But President Clinton, seizing the moment to drag along allies who have often been reluctant to agree on concrete steps that impinge on their national sovereignty, pressed to tighten some of the provisions.
Some of the steps, originally packaged as a broader anti-crime initiative, appeared aimed more at drug dealers and corrupt business executives than at terrorists. But Administration officials pointed to requirements that nations coordinate prosecutions when crimes occur across borders and that they "insure that criminals and terrorists are brought to justice and tried" even if extradition proves impossible.
The other members of the Group of Seven -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- are also bound to develop witness protection programs, much like the one used in the United States, to give new identities to people who testify against organized crime groups.
While they were eager to portray the agreement as major progress, Administration officials conceded today that turning those general agreements into national laws and regulations would be a long struggle.
"These are countries that often can't agree on the rules for selling planes to China or moving lumber across borders," a senior Administration official said tonight.
"We'd be fooling ourselves to think any of this will happen instantly. But it's a start."
An example of the complications over extradition was unfolding in Rome as the leaders gathered: this week, Italy's constitutional court blocked the extradition to Florida of a man wanted on charges of first-degree murder because he could face the death penalty. Italian law does not permit the death penalty.
The anti-crime and anti-terrorism principles would require major changes in Italian and Russian laws, and major changes in common practices elsewhere. For example, the new rules call for all the G-7 nations to strengthen "laws to prevent bribery and extortion." While that sounds non-controversial, until a few months ago German companies paying bribes abroad were permitted to deduct them from their taxes.
The most visible divisions among the leaders were over American efforts to isolate Iran, Libya and Cuba and over strategies to relieve the world's poorest nations from their huge debt loads.
Several leaders chastised Mr. Clinton for signing legislation that would punish foreign companies that do business with Cuba and for announcing that he would go along with a bill approved by Congress a week ago that would similarly penalize companies that invest in Iran and Libya.
At a briefing for reporters today, Daniel Tarullo, a top official of the National Economic Council, said that "the President pushed back fairly hard," telling the allies that they needed to "confront terrorist states to take action against countries that are threats to democracy and to the safety of our citizens."
Separately, a dispute flared over a plan pressed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to arrange for the International Monetary Fund to sell part of its $40 billion in gold reserves. The proceeds of a sale of $2 billion to $3 billion in gold would be invested in interest-generating financial instruments, and the resulting income would be used to pay off debt for third-world countries without requiring donor countries to allocate more resources to pay off the loans. The World Bank would pay off roughly $2 billion, and individual nations would forgive other debt as part of a larger initiative.
After a lengthy struggle with countries opposed to the plan, led by Germany, the United States won wording in the economic communique that Mr. Rubin said would allow the gold sales to move forward after the I.M.F.'s annual meeting in the fall.
"We've all agreed that the I.M.F. should fund this primarily through its own resources, and we've all agreed to optimizing the assets of the I.M.F. to do so," Mr. Rubin said.
But just before he spoke, the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, insisted that the wording of the communique would allow the sale of gold to be blocked. Germany has steadfastly insisted that the gold reserves should be held for true emergencies.
Further sparring broke out over Mr. Clinton's presentation about the halving of the Federal budget deficit and the creation of 9.7 million jobs by the American economy.
President Jacques Chirac of France, where unemployment rates are running upward of twice the level of those in the United States, acknowledged that "the U.S. has created a lot of jobs," but added, "A lot are underpaid ones that we wouldn't find acceptable in Europe."
The leaders will meet again on Saturday, the last day of the conference. Mr. Clinton will then travel to Paris for dinner with Mr. Chirac, and later fly to Florida for a Sunday memorial service for those killed in the attack in Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: Inflation Fear Falls, Sending Long Bond Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday as investors increased their bets that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates next week.
Data indicating that the economy was not growing fast enough to spur inflation confirmed to many in the market that the Fed would have no reason to act when its policy-making committee begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday. Such expectations combined with end-of-the-quarter buying by portfolio managers fed the rally. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32 points, to 8826/32 . The bond's yield fell to 6.89 percent, from 6.99 percent on Thursday, and to the lowest since 6.89 percent on June 6.
Investors gained about $13 on the day for every $1,000 invested in bonds.
Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch, described yesterday's trading as a feeding frenzy. Yesterday's data provided more evidence that the economy was growing at a moderate pace, she said.
Bonds first received a boost after the Commerce Department revised the first quarter's gross domestic product growth to 2.2 percent, down from 2.3 percent. The report indicated the economy was growing at a slower pace than estimated before.
The rally picked up after the a report from the Chicago Purchasing Management Association came in weaker than expected. The purchasing managers' index for June, which had been expected to rise to 54.6, came in at 53.3, compared with 53.0 in May. The prices-paid index rose to 53 from 52.2, but was also weaker than expected.
Ms. Adolfson, however, said, "I think the market got a little too revved up" over the purchasing managers' figures because some of the components should have been down due to seasonal factors, suggesting "some price pressures."
Another source of buying in the market was portfolio managers seeking high-rate securities to dress up their portfolios as the quarter ended yesterday. Managers who had previously stayed on the sidelines, uncertain of the Fed's next move, increased their positions.
Market participants have been increasingly confident that the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, will leave interest rates unchanged after its meeting next week. The market does expect the Fed will increase rates in the coming months.
Still, Ms. Adolfson noted, "There is no guarantee next week when the F.O.M.C. meets."
She said other data still awaited the market, including the National Association of Purchasing Management's report for June on Monday and the Government's June employment report on Friday. "Any of these are factors that could shift the landscape in a hurry," she said.
In the futures market, Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said buyers bought their way through 108 31/32 and 109 12/32 , "and then it was buy, buy, and more buy." The September bond futures contract closed several ticks below the day's session high at 109 17/32 .
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch's Global Securities Research and Economics Group, said the bond market's rally from 7.20 percent to 6.89 percent over the last two weeks was striking given the lack of new data.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Draws Record Fees in Stock Issues

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
As the stock market set records, Wall Street firms enjoyed their strongest stock-offering business in many years during the second quarter, reaping record underwriting fees of almost $3 billion.
As of yesterday, the last business day of the quarter, the securities industry underwrote $236.6 billion of domestic debt and equity issues, down slightly from a restated $240.2 billion in the first quarter because of the slower market for debt issues. 
 In the last three months, Wall Street firms underwrote $40.97 billion of common stock and $128.2 billion of straight and convertible debt issues, the Securities Data Company, a New Jersey statistical concern, estimated.
That represents an 81 percent increase in domestic equity underwriting from $22.6 billion in the first quarter, but a decline of 16 percent from $153 billion of debt issues in the first quarter.
The rise in long-term interest rates slowed debt issues in the United States, traders said. Securities firms generally earn significantly bigger fees for underwriting stocks than debt.
In the underwriting rankings, Merrill Lynch & Company led the combined totals for debt and equity offerings. Goldman, Sachs & Company, meanwhile, replaced Morgan Stanley & Company as the leader in domestic equity offerings during the second quarter, Securities Data said.
Investors helped to create this boom in underwriting by continuing to pour money into mutual funds in the last three months. Interest rates also remained relatively low, despite the uptick in long-term interest rates.
A strong stock market that has climbed about 10 percent so far this year, coupled with a climate of business confidence, fueled the underwriting business throughout the quarter, traders and investment bankers said.
"Never underestimate cash," said Brian Hehir, a managing director at Merrill Lynch who helps to run that firm's equity business, highlighting the critical role played by the huge amounts of cash investors are putting in mutual funds.
Fund managers have to place that money, creating a benign environment for the underwriting of debt and equity securities.
This has all led to a bonanza of fee income on Wall Street. "It's been a record quarter for equities, and a record quarter for debt and equity fees, which exceeded $2.91 billion for the quarter," said Richard J. Peterson, an analyst at Securities Data. "The previous fee record was $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 1993."
He said equity fees had been particularly strong in the first half, representing more than $3 billion of the more than $4.6 billion of fees for the first six months.
The debt markets have also been busy despite the drop in business for domestic debt issues. "It's been a real strong quarter," said John C. Qua, a managing director in Merrill Lynch's debt capital markets division, "even though rates have been creeping up here." He noted that long-term interest rates had risen more than one percentage point since the beginning of the year.
The continuing boom in mergers and acquisitions has helped to bolster the underwriting business. The second quarter, Mr. Qua said, "saw a re-emergence of corporate bond issues." Many American companies had been borrowing debt overseas, taking advantage of the scarcity in foreign markets of their established names.
Even though the debt and equity underwriting markets seem so healthy, some bankers sounded a note of caution. "The quarter continued strong from the first quarter, but in the last three weeks the market began to exhibit some signs of overcongestion, particularly among small-cap stocks," said J. Richard T. Blackett, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. who is co-manager of that firm's equity underwriting business.
Several mutual fund managers, who are judged on their quarterly performance numbers, backed away from smaller-capitalization technology stocks, which have generally not performed as well as the overall stock market in recent weeks.
But, Mr. Blackett said, "We expect that after July 4 the market will continue strongly, and that the shakeout in small technology issues will be the primary focus of interest. The question is, is it temporary?"
Still, his overall conclusion is "the market looks robust," and he said that this had indeed probably been his department's busiest quarter in years.
The hectic pace of underwriting seems to have taken its toll. "I think all of us are exhausted, everyone in the industry is exhausted at the pace of transactions," Mr. Hehir at Merrill Lynch said. "The question is, can you do it again?"
Several big international new-equity issues are set to come to market in the next week or two, including a stock offering of about $1 billion for Telefonica de Peru, an issue of $1.9 billion for Royal Ahold, the company that is buying Stop and Shop, and an issue of about $1.9 billion for Pharmacia & Upjohn, the pharmaceutical concern.
Reviewing these prospects, Mr. Hehir said the underwriting outlook at the beginning of the third quarter might even be as good as that at the start of the second quarter.

Austerity Plan For Workers Is Approved In Germany

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, June 28

 BODY:
Parliament approved major parts of an austerity plan today that would reduce workers' sick pay and job security in an effort to increase the competitiveness of the nation's industry.
Since the measure was introduced, workers have staged protest strikes and have accused the Government of destroying Germany's generous welfare state. 
 The measures reflected the wider concerns among European governments that budget deficits and unemployment are both far too high at a time when the European Union is demanding tighter fiscal management as the price for a single currency to compete in an increasingly global market.
Coming soon after Parliament's decision last week to loosen Germany's highly restrictive shopping hours, today's decisions provided further evidence of the pressures exerted by a changing world economy and the dictates of European integration on the country's rigid economic habits and ingrained social assumptions.
While the measures are in no way comparable to the sweeping changes of Margaret Thatcher's Britain or the United States in the Reagan era, they nonetheless represent an intimation for many Germans that the days of ever-expanding comfort are over.
By a narrow margin reflecting the governing coalition's 10-seat majority, the lower house approved the measures as Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other European leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized nations, meeting in Lyons, France, forecast economic improvements later this year.
But outside Parliament, in the streets, hundreds of thousands of Germans have taken part in organized protests since the plan was presented, asserting that Bonn's austerity measures punish workers while making no demands on their employers.
"Today, in every part of Germany, workers are protesting against the Government's savings plans," Oskar Lafontaine, the leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said in Parliament. "People have understood what is going on. This is about domestic peace and the stability of our democracy.
"End this policy of social injustice."
Earlier this month, more than 300,000 labor union members converged on Bonn to protest the austerity package. Across Germany on Thursday, before today's vote, some 200,000 workers staged demonstrations that ranged from brief work stoppages to human chains and processions of cars.
The measures approved today would reduce sick pay by one-fifth, to 80 percent of workers' salaries, and would make it easier for companies with 10 employees to dismiss workers. The existing law on dismissals is limited to companies with five or fewer employees.
In addition, charges for prescription medications were increased while state support for Germans to spend time at health spas was reduced.
A separate vote on increasing the retirement age for women to 65 from 60 by the year 2005 and freezing unemployment benefits was postponed until July 9 because of a parliamentary maneuver by the Government to legislate the proposals without the approval of Parliament's upper house, which is controlled by the Social Democrats.
"We are not making these savings for millionaires, but for millions of people who pay their contributions," the Labor Minister, Norbert Blum, said in Parliament, reflecting the Government's argument that the savings would create jobs by making it cheaper for employers to hire people.
"Our aim is to promote hiring, not firing," he said, arguing that the Government's actions would cut Germany's labor costs -- the world's highest -- by almost $50 billion by the end of the century.
Reflecting the same philosophy, Peter Hintze, the secretary general of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats, said on Thursday that Germany "will only achieve more employment if we attain greater flexibility, a cautious reduction of welfare costs and improved opportunities for people to become self-reliant."
Bonn is seeking savings of some $33 billion in public spending next year coupled with cuts of about $13 billion in social security budgets to reduce its overall budget deficit to the margins set by the European Union as criteria for the creation of a single currency, one of Mr. Kohl's main policy goals.
The measures approved today, coupled with the legislation on pensions, should save about one-third of the total, with the rest coming from limited pay increases for public service workers and from fiscal measures that still have to be approved by both houses of Parliament.

HEADLINE: Fund Plans to Lend $50 Million For Jobs, Not Profit, in New York

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
A group of 50 major New York City corporations and business executives, led by Henry R. Kravis, the financier, said yesterday that they had raised $50 million for a new fund intended to make hard-eyed venture capital investments -- not for private gain, but to create jobs and promote economic development.
The fund, which its organizers say is probably unique in the nation in its investment style and operation, will have the power under its charter to take high-risk positions and offer loans to everything from new, promising companies to retailers in poor neighborhoods where ordinary commercial lenders fear to tread. It plans to start this fall. 
 The organizers say they hope to attract another 50 contributors who will provide $1 million each, for a total of $100 million. None of them intends to take any profits from the venture, to be called the New York City Investment Fund. Instead, the organizers say they are creating a large, privately run economic development authority for the city.
Although plans are not final, the organizers say they plan to use their first investments to stimulate commercial and retail development in neighborhoods of upper Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens that have been the earlier focus of the New York City Housing Partnership. That group's parent, the New York City Partnership, a business and civic organization, is also the parent of the new investment fund.
Mr. Kravis, the man behind many of the biggest corporate takeovers and buyouts of the last decade -- the second K of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company -- thought up the idea, raised much of the money over the last two years and will be chairman. Participants in the New York City Investment Fund said that Mr. Kravis would also, to a great degree, be the chief asset.
"It's not that Henry has unique knowledge, although he is considered the master of his field," said Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner and a member of the fund's still-forming 12- to 15-member board. "He also symbolizes something: he is the ultimate symbol of both raising and bringing capital to bear on new ventures. The fact that he was involved gave it credibility."
That symbolism and credibility, fund organizers theorize, will be the key to the fund's ultimate impact: leveraging small investments into large, potentially huge ones.
The idea is that Mr. Kravis's reputation as a shrewd businessman and spotter of deals and trends will be a kind of "bell cow," as the fund's new president, Kathryn Wylde, put it. As a result, the theory goes, just as many investors mimic financial gurus like Warren E. Buffett or Peter Lynch, private money people will follow where Mr. Kravis leads.
As chairman of the new fund, Mr. Kravis is likely to become a figure with public and private clout, as he points his fund's spotlight toward what he and his directors conclude are the areas of potential growth.
The investment fund will differ in its structure and aims from the private economic-development partnerships that exist in other cities, many of which either devote themselves to single issues like building convention centers or attracting sports teams, or lock up their resources in long-term construction projects or housing development.
The New York City Investment Fund, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of the New York City Partnership, intends to make loans and get the money back in three years or less. It will focus exclusively on job growth.
Its goal is to be self-sustaining -- a revolving fund where each investment is supposed to be paid back for use on another project. It might buy stock in one company, and give another a loan, but it will give no charity grants that would permanently reduce assets. Each contributor has agreed to keep his $1 million in the fund for 15 years. At the end of that period, according to the plan, each will get $1 million back.
Another characteristic of the fund, Mr. Kravis said in an interview, will be that unlike most recent economic development efforts in New York, this one will not try to protect the existing economic base or try to keep companies from leaving the city -- though investments like that might be made on occasion. Instead, he explained, the idea is to look at what could be, or what might be, and then encourage it. "We're going to be playing offense for a change, instead of just defense," he said.
Although that attitude may bring every dreamer who believes he has just founded the next Microsoft to the fund's door, it also creates what the president of the New York City Partnership, Robert R. Kiley, said is a fundamentally new way of looking at New York City's assets.
"We don't really know everything that's going on in the city," Mr. Kiley said. "That's the other thing that's quite amazing here, because there hasn't been all that much focus on growth and job creation."
The new fund also seems likely to create a new political mix in the city's economy. While City Hall will have no official role in the fund's activities, the organizers say city officials will be invited to offer suggestions. The fund also hopes that local, state or Federal money will be invested in some of the projects that the fund takes on. At the same time, many of the fund's participants have local investments of their own that could be in some cases affected by the fund's activities.
 Ms. Wylde said contributors had to agree unconditionally that the decision making on investments would be wholly at the discretion of the fund's management in order to preclude potential conflicts of interest.
Although the full list of contributors has not yet been released, Ms. Wylde said it included most major New York banks, including Chase, Citicorp and Bankers Trust, and most of the major Wall Street firms, including J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.
Mr. Kiley said the birth of the fund, at a time when city, state and Federal Government resources are shrinking, also marks a resurgence of confidence by city business leaders that New York's economic problems can be addressed, and that new ideas are possible.
Mr. Parsons, the Time Warner officer, said the other major difference between the new fund and past development efforts was that the impact of the new efforts would be measurable. The fund's investments might work, or might not, but it won't take years to find out.
"We've always raised funds around activities -- summer jobs, housing," Mr. Parsons said. "This is going to be the first time, in a significant way, that the business community can put its money where its mouth is in terms of start-up ventures. This allows us to bring significant clout to the table -- catalytic clout."

HEADLINE: New York Dominicans Strongly Back Candidates on Island

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, June 28

 BODY:
Arturo Ortiz left an assistant in charge of his car parts business on Audubon Avenue in Manhattan. Ramon Infante has taken time off from his job as a furniture salesman in the Bronx. The gypsy cab Demetrio Ortega normally drives is parked in a lot, awaiting his return to Manhattan.
All week long, passengers arriving here on the nine daily flights from New York City have been telling the same story. With this Caribbean island nation of 7.5 million people scheduled to elect a new president on Sunday, several thousand Dominicans living in New York have put their normal routines on hold and are returning home to vote, help run campaigns and serve as poll watchers. 
 "We are working people, not rich folks, so yes, we have sacrificed to come back here," said Rafael Sanchez, a New York City Housing Authority employee who is on a brief leave of absence, as he got off a plane after a crowded, three-and-a-half-hour American Airlines flight Wednesday. "But it is a sacrifice we are happy to make because the future of our country is at stake."
In a campaign dominated by personal attacks, both Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a candidate of the Dominican Revolutionary Party and winner of the first round of balloting in May, and Leonel Fernandez Reyna of the Dominican Liberation Party, who the polls say has now surged into a narrow lead, are predicting victory. The contenders agree about one thing: the critical, even indispensable role of the huge Dominican community in New York City.
"The part they play is absolutely decisive, especially in terms of campaign finances," Mr. Pena Gomez said in an interview this week. Bienvenido Perez, a New York City resident who is Mr. Fernandez's campaign chief in the United States, agreed. "The Dominican community abroad has tremendous economic weight and political prestige, so of course its influence is being felt," he said.
The importance of the "absent Dominicans," as they are officially known here, has been growing since massive emigration to the United States began in the 1960's. Even though Dominicans can only vote at home, candidates routinely campaign in the New York City metropolitan area, home to the bulk of the estimated one million Dominicans living in the United States, and a large part of their contributions is typically raised at $150-a-head dinners in places like the Bronx and Paterson, N.J.
But interest among Dominican emigrants has been running especially high this year, perhaps because New York City's Dominican community views Mr. Fernandez as one of its own. Born here in 1953, Mr. Fernandez was taken to New York as a child by his mother, who worked simultaneously as a nurse's aide and seamstress, and grew up on the Upper West Side, where he attended Public School 75, Joan of Arc Middle School and Louis D. Brandeis High School.
"He understands our situation and our aspirations because he has felt in his own flesh the same vicissitudes of life that we have," said Jaime Vargas, the owner of a Manhattan insurance agency and leader of a group called Friends of Leonel. "He has experienced the snow up to his knees, the discrimination, the longing to return home. So we look upon him as a brother."
For his part, Mr. Fernandez has not only acknowledged those links but eagerly embraced and capitalized on them. "I am a product of New York City," he said in a recent interview, and as "the first Dominican candidate to have been molded by New York, I want to be a role model for a community that has often been unjustly portrayed in a negative way."
Dressed in the purple-and-yellow colors of their party, Mr. Fernandez's New York supporters have been arriving with tens of thousands of campaign posters, bumper stickers, buttons, baseball caps and photographs produced in New York City by businesses that Dominicans own.
Many of the advertisements appearing in newspapers and magazines for both Mr. Fernandez and Mr. Pena Gomez are also paid for by the Dominican community in New York, as are the airplanes and hot air balloons that fly over their campaign rallies with messages of support.
But returning Dominicans also bring with them the organizational expertise they have learned in New York City, said Guillermo Linares, a New York City Councilman who is the first Dominican to hold elective office in the United States. As part of an observer delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter and as an elected official whose own constituents are deeply divided between the two candidates here, Mr. Linares has been careful to steer a neutral course.
For those Dominicans living in the United States, the election here offers "a way to maintain their links with the Dominican Republic," said Guido Gomez, a young political scientist who recently earned his doctorate at Columbia University and is now working on Mr. Pena Gomez's campaign. Most left their homeland reluctantly, in hopes of bettering themselves, and are appalled to see that, while their own fortunes have dramatically improved, those of the country have not.
"It makes us feel bad when we visit on vacation and see what's going on," said Jose Hugo Rodriguez, an ardent Fernandez supporter who first went to the United States in 1967 and now lives in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. "This is a country rich in natural resources, but all you see is misery. So if you have patriotic fiber, that is something painful to endure, and you want to do all you can to change it."
Political reforms enacted in 1994, which established the principle of dual citizenship, have made it easier for Dominicans living abroad to act on that impulse and have whetted their appetite to play a larger role here. In recognition of that growing clout, Mr. Fernandez and Mr. Pena Gomez have tailored their message with an eye to increasing their popularity in New York.
Both candidates, for instance, favor legislation that would permit Dominican nationals residing abroad to vote wherever they live, perhaps at the closest consulate, instead of having to come here. If implemented, that proposal would immediately transform the New York City metropolitan area into the second-largest concentration of votes in future Dominican presidential elections, exceeded only by the capital.
In addition, Mr. Fernandez favors a plan to establish a Ministry of the Diaspora. Mr. Pena Gomez says that, if he wins, he will sponsor a provision to amend the Constitution to allow the election of congressional deputies specifically to represent Dominicans living abroad so that Washington Heights and Inwood would, in effect, be treated no differently from Puerto Plata and San Pedro de Macoris. "These people send back more than a billion dollars a year to our country," or more than the combined total of all Dominican exports last year, he said, adding, "Their voices deserve to be heard."

HEADLINE: Mollie Beattie, 49; Headed Wildlife Service

BYLINE: By WILLIAM DICKE 

 BODY:
Mollie H. Beattie, who resigned as director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on June 6 because of failing health, died on Thursday at Grace Cottage Hospital in Townsend, Vt. She was 49 and lived in Grafton and Alexandria, Va.
The cause was brain cancer, said a friend, Alexandra M. Marks. 
 A forester by training, Ms. Beattie was the first woman to head the agency. In three years as director, she defended the Endangered Species Act against attacks from many Republicans in Congress and fought efforts to reduce the agency's budget, not always successfully.
"In the Clinton Administration, she was probably the strongest single voice for wildlife conservation," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, a nonprofit group that works to protect and preserve species.
Ms. Beattie was a strong proponent of the effort to have gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park for the first time since the 1920's. Mr. Schlickeisen said one of his most vivid memories of her was seeing her rub cold water on the belly of a wild wolf at Yellowstone in April to cool it so the animal could be moved to another site for release. Despite the rain in her face, he recalled, she smiled broadly and said, "Any day I can touch a wild wolf is a good day."
As director, she was responsible for the wildlife service's 7,000 employees and an annual budget for resource management of $501 million in the current fiscal year, down from $511 million the previous year. The agency, part of the Interior Department, enforces wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species Act and carries out wetland protection and management. John Rogers has been serving as acting director.
Ms. Beattie sought to conserve species by managing entire ecosystems rather than waiting until individual species became endangered, and presided over the addition of 15 national wildlife refuges to a system that now has 508.
The agency said that under her direction 140 habitat conservation plans were established and 300 more were being developed. These plans are formal agreements between landowners and the Fish and Wildlife Service that allow the owners to harm individual members of a species listed as endangered or threatened if they take steps to help the species as a whole to recover.
She argued that such plans demonstrated that the Endangered Species Act, under which they are carried out, has the flexibility to conserve species while allowing economic development. In fact, she said, the act "has been one of the biggest success stories of the conservation movement in America," contending that many myths had been spread about the act's supposedly onerous effects.
Just before she resigned, she led efforts to resume the listing of endangered species after a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress, which sharply cut the agency's money for such listings in the current fiscal year.
Earlier this month, Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, introduced legislation in the House and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, in the Senate to name an eight-million-acre wilderness in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after her.
Mollie Beattie was born on April 27, 1947, in Glen Cove, L.I. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1968 and a master's degree in forestry at the University of Vermont in 1979. She also received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1991.
She was program director and lands manager for the Windham Foundation, a nonprofit organization that conducts seminars on critical issues facing Vermont, from 1983 to 1985; commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation from 1985 to 1989, and deputy secretary of the state's Agency of Natural Resources from 1989 to 1990. She left to become executive director of a public policy institute, the Richard A. Snelling Center for Government in Vermont, before taking her post at the Fish and Wildlife Service.
She is survived by her husband, Rick Schwolsky of Grafton; her mother, Patricia Beattie of Ketchum, Idaho, and a sister, Jane Beattie, also of Ketchum.

Supreme Court Is Split On Banning Smut on Cable
The Supreme Court ruled that operators of cable television systems may ban indecent programming from certain commercial channels but not from the community-access channels used by local governments and community groups. Shifting majorities on the Court upheld part and struck down other parts of a 1992 Federal law intended to protect children from indecency on cable television. 
 The splintered decision indicated deep divisions and great uncertainty over how to approach free speech in such new media as the Internet. [Page 1.]
The Supreme Court extended significant new free speech protection to independent government contractors. [8.]
 
Fund to Create New York City Jobs
A group of 50 corporations and executives, led by Henry R. Kravis, raised $50 million to start a nonprofit venture to create jobs and promote development in New York City. The organizers of the new fund hope to attract another 50 contributors who will provide $1 million each, for a total of $100 million. [1.]
 
Donna Karan a Hit on Wall St.
Donna Karan's shares jumped as much as 25 percent above their initial public offering price in their first day of trading as investors sought to cash in on the fashion designer's prospects. The company's stock closed up $4, at $28, after rising as high as $30.125. The demand for Donna Karan and other new issues provided a sign that the I.P.O. market was regaining its robust form. [35.]

Unexpectedly Slow G.D.P. Growth
The economy grew at a slower pace than previously estimated in the first quarter, reflecting a lull in export demand. The nation's gross domestic product rose at a revised annual rate of 2.2 percent, the Commerce Department said. Economists said the revised G.D.P. data confirmed their expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers would not raise short-term interest rates next week. [34.]

Bond Market Bullish on Rates
Treasury prices surged as investors increased their bets that the Fed would not raise interest rates. The price of the 30-year bond rose 12/32 , to 8826/32 . The bond's yield fell to 6.89 percent from 6.99 percent on Thursday and the lowest since 6.89 percent on June 6. [44.]

Senate Approves Securities Bill
The Senate passed a bill reducing overlapping state and Federal regulation of the mutual fund and securities industries. The bill would eliminate much of the ability of states to regulate the mutual fund industry and large securities offerings, leaving that responsibility with the S.E.C. [34.]
 
Dow Drops, but Nasdaq Surges
Blue-chips stocks gave back early gains to close lower, but technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq market. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 22.90 points lower at 5,654.63. For the week, it was down 50.60 points. But broader indexes were higher. The Nasdaq composite index surged 19.01 points, to 1185.02 -- its biggest percentage gain in four months. Analysts said the market's mixed signals were typical of end-of-the-quarter portfolio adjustments. [36.]
 
Dollar Nears 110 Japanese Yen
The dollar rose to within a whisker of 110 yen, reaching its highest level in almost 29 months, as concerns about an increase in Japanese interest rates faded. The yen fell against the dollar and other leading currencies after Japan said that its unemployment rate rose to a record 3.5 percent in May. [32.]
 
A Roadway Splits the Casinos
With two powerful casino owners pulling in opposite directions, New Jersey's Governor is moving toward a decision on whether the state will pay for a $329 million tunnel and roadway project in Atlantic City. [21.]
 
Corn Futures Prices Rise
Corn futures jumped after an Agriculture Department report indicated that high prices had not deterred demand. [32.]
 
Group of Seven Divided on Gold Sale
Leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies disagreed over a U.S. plan for the I.M.F. to sell part of its $40 billion in gold reserves. The Group of Seven did agree on a plan to fight crime and terrorism. [4.]

HEADLINE: John Hanson, 88, Executive Who Built Up Winnebago

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
John K. Hanson, an indefatigable entrepreneur who built Winnebago Industries into a leading mobile home manufacturer, died on Thursday at St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, Minn. He was 88 and lived in Forest City, Iowa.
An avid camper, Mr. Hanson began what would become a lucrative association with recreational vehicles in 1957, when he became a travel-trailer dealer. A year later he and other local investors lured Modernistic Industries, a California-based travel-trailer manufacturer, to open a branch in Forest City. 
 Modernistic faltered a year later, and the local owners took over. Mr. Hanson offered to manage the business and assumed its liabilities. At the time, the company had 39 trailers, $100 in the bank and nearly $42,000 in debts.
Over the next decade, Mr. Hanson relentlessly introduced new products, cut costs and eventually brought mass production to motor home assembly, transforming the company and building his own fortunes.
In 1960 he renamed the company Winnebago, the name given to the river that flows through Forest City by the Winnebago Indians.
Winnebago grew rapidly throughout the 1960's, and Mr. Hanson took the company public in 1970. Over the course of the next year, the company's stock price rose to more than four times its value. 0.
Suffering from cataracts, in 1972, Mr. Hanson decided to retire, sold off a large piece of his stock and turned management of the company over to his son, and then to his son-in-law.
But within seven years, the business was foundering, damaged in no small part by skyrocketing gasoline prices. In 1979, after watching from the sidelines and undergoing eye surgery to restore his sight, Mr. Hanson felt compelled to return.
"I watched for seven years as the business went down, down, down," he told an interviewer in 1984. "I came back to build it up, up, up."
He eventually returned the company to profitability, but was forced to cut staff and sell assets to achieve that end.
"I came in like Wyatt Earp," he said later. "I just lined 'em up and shot 'em down."
Winnebago went through another financial crisis in the late 1980's, and Mr. Hanson, who by that time had relinquished day-to-day control of the company to others, responded by dismissing four chief executives in two years.
"He was very much a hands-on chairman, and an integral part of the operations of the company throughout its history," said Robert J. Evans, a securities analyst who follows Winnebago for John G. Kinnard & Company in Minneapolis. "He was very heavily involved in its strategic direction right up until he died."
Mr. Hanson, who kept a 47 percent stake in Winnebago, also owned 20 percent of Cycle-Sat Inc., a Winnebago subsidiary that distributes radio and television advertising via satellite.
In the late 1980's, Mr. Hanson's critics called Cycle-Sat a distraction that Winnebago could ill afford. Later this year, Cycle-Sat's shares are expected to be offered to the public for the first time.
Even as he made millions of dollars from Winnebago, Mr. Hanson gave much back to the local community through contributions from the Hanson Foundation and the Winnebago Industries Foundation.
A native of Thor, Iowa, Mr. Hanson graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1934 with a bachelor's degree in mortuary science. He ran his father's funeral home for several years and also assumed responsibility for the family furniture and appliance store for a time.
Before venturing into the mobile home business, He also founded a bank and in 1948 became a partner in an International Harvester and Oldsmobile dealership.
Mr. Hanson is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Louise Voss; two sons, John V. Hanson of Jensen Beach, Fla., and Paul Hanson of Clear Lake, Fla.; a daughter, Mary Jo Bowman of Palm City, Fla.; three sisters, Mildred Sager of Story City, Iowa, Dorothy J. Nelson of Minneapolis and Barbara Bulman of Forest City, Iowa; three grandchildren, and three great-granchildren.

HEADLINE: As Atlantic City Thrives, Whitman May Call a Casino Bluff

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 28

 BODY:
With two powerful casino heads pulling in opposite directions, the Whitman administration has taken tentative steps this week toward calling the bluff of one of them, Steven A. Wynn, who has threatened to cancel plans for a $2 billion casino and resort unless the state builds a road to his property.
Perhaps because the decisions are not final, Donald J. Trump, the other mogul, tried to appear not to gloat. His spokesman even called an alternative plan, outlined in the past few days by the State Transportation Commissioner, Frank Wilson, "a very fair plan." 
 Mr. Wilson had been expected to make a recommendation to the Governor today, but he requested a delay until early next week, the Governor's chief spokesman, Carl Golden, said. Mrs. Whitman will make a final decision a day or two after she receives the Commissioner's recommendation. "This is such an important issue," Mr. Golden said. "We don't want to move too fast."
Mr. Wynn, the chairman of Mirage Resorts in Las Vegas, wanted the state to pay for a $329 million road and tunnel that would run from the Atlantic City Expressway alongside a canal to his property. The proposals outlined by Mr. Wilson, people familiar with them said, called for a privately financed road without a tunnel that would offer access to other casino properties along the Boardwalk as well as to Mr. Wynn's proposed casino.
The Wynn development would be the largest ever in Atlantic City, with 7,000 hotel rooms, four new casinos and as many as 20,000 jobs. Mr. Wynn's ultimatum left Mrs. Whitman with one of the biggest economic development decisions of her tenure. The Governor, however, has historically shied away from subsidizing private development projects, and knows as well as anyone else in the state that in the months since Mr. Wynn first made his proposal, Atlantic City has become a magnet for casino development. The arguments for a subsidized tunnel carry a lot less weight now.
"Within the past few weeks some of the biggest companies in the industry have come in here with no strings attached," said Marvin Roffman, a Philadelphia-based gambling industry analyst. Asking taxpayers to provide large incentives to Mr. Wynn while other developers are rapidly moving into Atlantic City's thriving casino market without public subsidies would be ill-advised, he said.
I.T.T. Corporation, owners of Caesars Palace casinos, said this week that it would spend about $490 million expanding its Atlantic City operations, and Hilton Hotels recently agreed to spend $3 billion for Bally Entertainment, which includes significant casino holdings in the city.
Mr. Roffman noted that the city has already given Mr. Wynn a 168-acre piece of land known as the "H Tract," on which to build the casino resort. "If Steve Wynn turns this down and decides not to come to Atlantic City," he said, "within 45 minutes, someone else will come there and take that H Tract."
Lobbyists representing Mr. Wynn in Trenton refused to discuss the Governor's impending decision, but Mirage officials did confirm that they had been involved in talks with the Transportation Commissioner.
Last week, Mirage executives were still insisting that they would cancel their project without the state-financed tunnel and roadway, but by this afternoon they seemed to be tempering their position. When asked if Mr. Wynn would walk away if his demands are not met, a Mirage spokesman, Alan Feldman, said: "There has to be a transportation solution to traffic problems that have plagued that area. It's up to the Governor to make a decision."
Mr. Wilson, the Transportation Commissioner, would not comment on his impending recommendation to the Governor.
Opponents of Mr. Wynn's proposal have asserted that it would divert traffic from other casinos along the Boardwalk, funneling customers directly into the Mirage development. Mr. Trump has lobbied heavily against the road and tunnel, contending that it would give Mr. Wynn an unfair advantage and provide subsidies in a market where none are needed. "They're going to come anyway, with or without a roadway," Mr. Trump said today. "The numbers are so good in Atlantic City that they have to come." A veto of Mr. Wynn's plan would be a huge victory for Mr. Trump, a nemesis of the Mirage chairman.
In a series of meetings this week with executives from the Mirage, the Trump organization and representatives from other casinos, Mr. Wilson discussed an alternative highway that would take traffic closer to the existing casinos along the Boardwalk before diverting it back inland toward the Mirage complex. In between his meetings, Mr. Wilson was in close contact with Mrs. Whitman, according to people involved in the talks, but the Governor seemed to be fully entrusting Mr. Wilson to reach a recommendation. "There are intense pressures on her with this," said Alan Marcus, a lobbyist for Mr. Trump. "What Wilson previewed is a very fair plan. You've got to hand it to him, the guy knows what he's doing."
However, as of late last week, Mr. Wilson's highway plan still had not resolved one sensitive issue. Under the latest proposal -- as well as Mr. Wynn's original proposal -- a historic African-American community of nine houses would be razed to make way for the highway, and residents of the community have already filed a lawsuit against the city to fight the destruction of their neighborhood.
Mr. Wynn, who is considered one of the most powerful casino developers in the world, could walk away but industry observers say they doubt it. "If he walks away, it doesn't matter to the Governor because somebody else is going to develop it," Mr. Marcus said. "My bet is the person who is going to develop it is Steve Wynn."

HEADLINE: Unhappy Goodbye for Health Workers

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
Frank Lashley came to work at Metropolitan Hospital Center fresh out of high school and stayed 24 years. When he left, he figured, it would be because he wanted to, and his send-off would be filled with happiness and laughter.
But like hundreds of others working at public hospitals throughout the city, Mr. Lashley, 43, was laid off yesterday, too young to retire and fearful that he would be considered too old for another job. 
 "It's very emotional to just let you go out on the streets when there's no jobs around, when you're in a no man's land because you're not young or old," said Mr. Lashley, a cardiopulmonary technician. "It's unbelievable that now my whole life has changed."
Yesterday was the last day of work for 1,600 nurses, doctors, lab technicians and other employees at New York's public hospitals. The job cuts, announced last month by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, were the first time in more than a decade that the hospitals have systematically laid off professional patient-care workers.
The Health and Hospitals Corporation is seeking to eliminate 2,000 more positions by August, agency officials said. But an early retirement program they plan to offer may take care of some of those slots, and officials say they are continuing to seek other ways to avoid layoffs.
"We're going to continue to talk to the unions," said Thomas Doherty, senior vice president for administration and support services for the corporation. "Layoffs are our last resort, and we're continuing to work with them on other ways of reducing staff with the hopes that we will not have to lay off."
But agency officials say the current job cuts became necessary in the wake of increased competition from the managed care system, which is drawing away patients and thus shrinking the need for staff.
"We don't anticipate any negative impact on the quality of patient care that our facilities deliver," said Jane Zimmerman, vice president for communications for the Health and Hospitals Corporation. "We simply do not have the business to support the size of the current work force."
But Mavis Dummitt, a registered nurse who tended to children with AIDS and counseled and comforted their parents, wondered what her patients would do without her.
"There's no replacement for dedicated people, the dedication of the worker who's been here for years and years and years," said Mrs. Dummitt, who has spent more than three decades at Metropolitan Hospital, at First Avenue and 97th Street. "I never thought I'd be thrown out like dirty water in a dishpan and not given a second thought."
Mrs. Dummitt was one of the few people to show up for work this last day. Many others cleared their desks and said their goodbyes days or weeks ago, using vacation time or unused sick days. But Mrs. Dummitt went to work, to have lunch with her co-workers and to gather the ceramic figurines and colorful drawings that her patients had given her over the years. She willed herself to sit at her desk until quitting time and not shed a tear.
"I figured someone would say, 'This person put in 36 years, which is a lifetime, let's see if we can save her job,' " said Mrs. Dummitt, who has a grown son and an adopted 11-year-old daughter. "I expected at least a thank you, at least a thank you for the years that I've been here. The only good thing that happened was my co-workers took me out to lunch today. If it wasn't for them, there would be nothing."
Elaine Thilo, a pediatric occupational therapist at the hospital, said that her co-workers threw her a going-away party last week. When she went to work yesterday, her arms filled with strawberry-almond bread and bagels she had baked for her colleagues, she was no longer angry, just resigned and disillusioned.
"I've gone through the 'why me, what did I do wrong, will I ever get a job again' phase," said Mrs. Thilo, who has worked at the hospital since April 1995. "I guess I've just come to terms with it. I can't change it. And I'm not so sure if by some miracle they said we'll give your your job back, I'm not sure I'd even take it. Not the way I've been treated."
For Mr. Lashley, his last day was filled with tearful goodbyes. But as difficult as yesterday might have been, he knew the days to come would be harder. He would have to find a way to support his family and tell his 15-year-old daughter that she would not be going back to her Roman Catholic high school in the Bronx because he could no longer afford it.
"Monday is really going to hit me," he said. "Monday, when you're home alone, and you think wait a minute, I don't have to go to work anymore, I have to go down to unemployment."

The state Insurance Commissioner, Elizabeth Randall, approved a 3 percent increase yesterday in automobile insurance rates for the 4.37 million drivers in New Jersey. The increase was the minimum allowed under the state's insurance law. The state's 80 auto insurance companies are allowed a rate increase each year based on the rate of inflation. Companies are also permitted to apply for additional increases, and since 1993, the department has granted an average increase of 7.5 percent to nine insurers covering about 21 percent of the state's drivers, said Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the Department of Insurance.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Offer Campaign Finance Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
Insisting that campaign finance legislation was not dead for the year, House Republicans today proposed a measure that would require candidates to raise the majority of their money in their own districts but would not diminish the role of big contributions by corporations, unions and the rich.
The bill would set the same limit, about $2,500, on donations by individuals and political action committees, said Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who heads the Committee on House Oversight. Now, political action committees can give $5,000, while individuals can give only $1,000. 
 Individuals can give no more than $25,000 a year to everyone they help, but that ceiling would be removed under the House Republican plan. Political action committees have no overall limit.
Mr. Thomas said he thought the Senate killed campaign finance legislation on Tuesday only because the bill before it was flawed. But Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said just before Tuesday's vote that the issue was too important to deal with "in the heat of a national election."
Mr. Thomas said that even if the Senate was not ready to act, the House Republican proposal would "stake out our territory for desired changes in the law." It would also enable House Republicans to go to voters this fall and say they had voted for a bill dealing with campaign financing.
The bill is expected to be taken up and passed during the week of July 15, which House leaders have labeled "reform week." Other measures on the schedule would enforce a ban on distributing campaign checks on the floor of the House and deny Congressional pensions to felons.
Mr. Thomas told a news conference that the new bill would be co-sponsored by Speaker Newt Gingrich and all Republican leaders.
He said the bill was "the most serious anti-incumbent legislation that anyone has introduced" because the requirement that a majority of money be raised within a district would cut into the advantage some incumbents have in raising money in Washington and elsewhere.
The Senate bill that died would have required candidates to raise 60 percent of their money in their own states. It also sought to overcome incumbents' money advantage with voluntary spending limits. Candidates who abided by them would have been rewarded with half an hour of free television time and vouchers for reduced-rate broadcast time and mailings.
The House plan seeks to strengthen the power of political parties. It would allow them, for example, to help candidates who were running against incumbents who carried over big war chests by giving the challenger enough money to match the war chest. It would allow similar matching for candidates running against people spending more than $150,000 of their own money.
Mr. Thomas's written summary said the bill would "ban non-Federal money from Federal elections." Asked what new restrictions that would impose on the use of corporate, union and vast individual contributions to political parties -- "soft money" -- he said the bill would add no curbs but simply write into law the rules the Federal Election Commission has established.
The bill provides that limits on contributions would rise with inflation.

NEW YORK
 
A Fund for Creating Jobs
A group of 50 major New York City corporations and businessmen, led by the financier Henry R. Kravis, said that they have raised $50 million for a new fund intended to make hard-eyed venture capital investments, not for private gain, but to create jobs and promote economic development. The fund will be empowered by its charter to take high-risk positions and offer loans to everything from new and promising companies to retailers in poor neighborhoods. [Page 1.]
 
Dominicans' Crucial Role
With the Dominican Republic electing a new president, several thousand Dominicans living in New York have put their usual routines on hold and are returning home to vote, help run campaigns and serve as poll watchers. Even the presidential contenders agree on one thing: the huge Dominican community in New York City plays a critical role in the elections. [21.]
 
Serving Up Last Meals
For 79 years it has been the Rick's Cafe Americain of the kosher set, a crossroads for garment center business deals, politics, matchmaking and schmoozing in an old-fashioned Jewish restaurant with the refinement of white tablecloths. Among the observant, everybody came to Lou G.'s. But the restaurant, on 38th Street off Seventh Avenue, served its last helpings of matzoh ball soup and gefilte fish and closed its doors for the last time. [21.]
 
Romance Takes Center Stage
Romance is alive and well at a cafe in the Hotel Pierre on Fifth Avenue. There, couples embrace and glide over the dance floor to the tunes of Gershwin and Porter as the woman behind the piano recreates a bygone era. About New York by David Gonzalez. [21.]
 
Challenging Crew's Decision
A lawyer for Agnes Green, who was re-elected to the District 17 school board, said he was preparing documents to be filed in Federal Court to challenge Chancellor Rudy Crew's decision to bar Ms. Green from taking office. Fourteen other board members were also barred, and lawyers for some of them said they were also taking legal steps to stop Dr. Crew. [22.]
 
SUNY Search Is Stalled
A search for an interim chancellor for the State University of New York has bogged down over internal political divisions among the trustees, the late withdrawal of a favorite candidate and other questions. But board members said someone might be chosen by Monday. [22.]
 
Hospital Workers' Last Day
It was the last day of work for 1,600 nurses, doctors, lab technicians and other employees at New York's public hospitals. The job cuts, announced last month by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, were the first time in more than a decade that the hospitals systematically laid off professional patient-care workers. [23.]
 
A Year Later, Bridge Complete
A year ago, Dave Allan feared that his nonunion construction company had met its Waterloo at the Island Creek Bridge in Wantagh, L.I., at the southern end of a highway leading to Jones Beach. Now, more than a year past the construction deadline, he is claiming a hard-won and costly victory with the completion of the bridge project. [24.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Calling a Casino Bluff
The Whitman Administration has taken tentative steps toward calling the bluff of the casino mogul Steven A. Wynn, who has threatened to cancel plans for a $2 billion casino and resort unless the state builds a road to his property. [21.]
 
Whitman Signs State Budget
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a $15.9 billion state budget into law that lowers taxes for the third straight year and reduces government programs in almost every state agency, with the Department of Environmental Protection facing the steepest cuts. [24.]
 
Execution Request Denied
The New Jersey Supreme Court has rejected a 65-year-old death row inmate's request to be executed and instead required him to undergo a new appeals procedure. The inmate, John M. Martini, a convicted murderer, had exercised an option under New Jersey court rules last fall, choosing not to continue to challenge his death sentence. National report. [9.]
 
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing "victim impact" statements in death-penalty cases. [9.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
State Said to Violate Order
A Federal judge has ruled that Connecticut is in violation of a 1992 court order to improve services for abused and neglected children, and has ordered the state to take 20 corrective actions. The ruling was based on a report that the state was delinquent in more than 20 areas, including specialized foster care placement, drug-abuse treatment for adolescents and families, and parent training.

HEADLINE: Recycling Is Garbage

BYLINE: By John Tierney; John Tierney is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
AS THEY PUT ON PLASTIC GLOVES FOR THEIR first litter hunt, the third graders knew what to expect. They knew their garbage. It was part of their science curriculum at Bridges Elementary, a public school on West 17th Street in Manhattan. They had learned the Three R's -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle -- and discussed how to stop their parents from using paper plates. For Earth Day they had read a Scholastic science publication, "Inside the World of Trash." For homework, they had kept garbage diaries and drawn color-coded charts of their families' trash. So they were primed for the field experiment on this May afternoon.
"We have to help the earth," Natasha Newman explained as she and her classmates dashed around the school collecting specimens. Their science teacher, Linnette Aponte, mediated disputes -- "I saw that gum wrapper first!" -- and supervised the subsequent analysis of data back in the classroom. The students gathered around to watch her dump out their bags on the floor. 
 "Do you see any pattern as I'm emptying it?" Miss Aponte asked.
"Yeah, it stinks."
"Everybody's chewing Winterfresh."
"A lot of paper napkins."
"It's disgusting."
"They're throwing away a folder. That's a perfectly good folder!"
"It's only half a folder."
"Well, they could find the other half and attach them together."
Miss Aponte finished emptying the last bag. "We've been learning about the need to reduce, reuse and recycle," she said, and pointed at the pile. "How does all this make you feel?"
"Baaaad," the students moaned.
Miss Aponte separated out two bottles, the only items in the pile that could be recycled. She asked what lesson the students had learned. The class sentiment was summarized by Lily Finn, the student who had been so determined to save the half folder: "People shouldn't throw away paper or anything. They should recycle it. And they shouldn't eat candy in school."
Lily's judgment about candy sounded reasonable, but the conclusion about recycling seemed to be contradicted by the data on the floor. The pile of garbage included the equipment used by the children in the litter hunt: a dozen plastic bags and two dozen pairs of plastic gloves. The cost of this recycling equipment obviously exceeded the value of the recyclable items recovered. The equipment also seemed to be a greater burden on the environment, because the bags and gloves would occupy more space in a landfill than the two bottles.
Without realizing it, the third graders had beautifully reproduced the results of a grand national experiment begun in 1987 -- the year they were born, back when the Three R's had nothing to do with garbage. That year a barge named the Mobro 4000 wandered thousands of miles trying to unload its cargo of Long Islanders' trash, and its journey had a strange effect on America. The citizens of the richest society in the history of the planet suddenly became obsessed with personally handling their own waste.
Believing that there was no more room in landfills, Americans concluded that recycling was their only option. Their intentions were good and their conclusions seemed plausible. Recycling does sometimes makes sense -- for some materials in some places at some times. But the simplest and cheapest option is usually to bury garbage in an environmentally safe landfill. And since there's no shortage of landfill space (the crisis of 1987 was a false alarm), there's no reason to make recycling a legal or moral imperative. Mandatory recycling programs aren't good for posterity. They offer mainly short-term benefits to a few groups -- politicians, public relations consultants, environmental organizations, waste-handling corporations -- while diverting money from genuine social and environmental problems. Recycling may be the most wasteful activity in modern America: a waste of time and money, a waste of human and natural resources.
The obvious temptation is to blame journalists, who did a remarkable job of creating the garbage crisis, often at considerable expense to their own employers. Newspaper and magazine publishers, whose products are a major component of municipal landfills, nobly led the crusade against trash, and they're paying for it now through regulations that force them to buy recycled paper -- a costly handicap in their struggle against electronic rivals. It's the first time that an industry has conducted a mass-media campaign informing customers that its own product is a menace to society.
But the press isn't solely responsible for recycling fervor; the public's obsession wouldn't have lasted this long unless recycling met some emotional need. Just as the third graders believed that their litter run was helping the planet, Americans have embraced recycling as a transcendental experience, an act of moral redemption. We're not just reusing our garbage; we're performing a rite of atonement for the sin of excess. Recycling teaches the themes that previous generations of schoolchildren learned from that Puritan classic, "The Pilgrim's Progress."
John Bunyan's 17th-century allegory features a character not unlike the garbage barge that left Long Island: a man dressed in rags who flees the City of Destruction, desperate to find a place he can unload the "great burden upon his back." Guided by the Evangelist, the pilgrim wanders the world trying to reach the Celestial City. His worst trial occurs in Vanity Fair, a village market founded by Beelzebub and inhabited by noblemen named Lord Luxurious and Sir Having Greedy. The market offers tempting wares, but the pilgrim bravely practices the first R -- reduce -- by shunning the products of the "merchandizers" and continuing on to the Celestial City.
Today's schoolchildren, though, might be confused by one character encountered on Bunyan's road to salvation: a man, the source of our word "muckraker," who is busy raking together a compost pile. This recycler of household waste isn't presented as a role model for the pilgrim. He's a symbol of moral blindness because, instead of looking up to see the heavenly rewards awaiting him, he "could look no way but downwards, with a muck-rake in his hand." In Bunyan's time, it would have been hard to imagine that pilgrims would one day be taught to search for salvation right down there in the muck.
 
The Day of Reckoning Foretold

"All I've been thinking about all week is garbage. I mean, I just can't stop thinking about it. . . . I've just gotten real concerned over what's gonna happen. . . . I started feeling this way . . . when that barge was stranded."
-- Opening lines of the 1989 film "Sex, Lies and Videotape," spoken to a psychiatrist by a woman whose real problems -- sexual and marital unhappiness -- have nothing to do with municipal solid waste.
AT THE TIME AMERICANS BECAME RACKED WITH GARBAGE GUILT, businesses were already recycling millions of tons of trash a year. They were voluntarily -- and profitably -- recycling newsprint, office paper, cardboard, aluminum and steel. But the barge's plight convinced everyone that voluntary enterprise was not enough. As Newsweek noted, the Mobro's saga was "to the trash crisis what the sinking of the Lusitania was to World War I." The magazine's cover story, titled "Buried Alive," warned: "With rare exceptions during wartime, Americans have not been adept at making individual sacrifices for the common good. That mentality will have to change. Otherwise, the dumps will cover the country coast to coast and the trucks will stop in everybody's backyard."
Suddenly, just as central planning was going out of fashion in eastern Europe, America devised a national five-year plan for trash. The Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a "Waste Hierarchy" that ranked trash-disposal options: recycling at the top, composting and waste-to-energy incinerators in the middle, landfills at the bottom.
The E.P.A.'s five-year goal, to recycle 25 percent of municipal trash, was announced in a speech in early 1988 by J. Winston Porter, an assistant administrator of the agency. Even as Porter was setting the goal, he realized that it was presumptuous for a bureaucrat in Washington to tell everyone in America what to do with their trash. "After all the publicity about the barge," Porter recalls, "I sat down with some engineers in my office to estimate how much municipal waste could be recycled. At that time, about 10 percent was being recycled. We looked at the components of waste, made a few quick calculations and figured that it was reasonable to reach a level of 25 percent within five years. It wasn't a highly quantified thing. Some of the staff didn't even want me to mention a figure. But I thought it would be good to set a target, as long as it was strictly voluntary and didn't involve a lot of regulations."
Politicians across the country had bigger ideas. State and city officials enacted laws mandating recycling and setting arbitrary goals even higher than the E.P.A.'s. Most states set rigid quotas, typically requiring that at least 40 percent of trash be recycled, often even more -- 50 percent in New York and California, 60 percent in New Jersey, 70 percent in Rhode Island. Industries were pressured to set their own goals. Municipalities followed the Waste Hierarchy by building waste-to-energy incinerators and starting thousands of curbside recycling programs -- all in the belief that it would be cheaper than landfilling. But the incinerators turned out to be disastrously expensive, and the recycling programs produced a glut of paper, glass and plastic that no one wanted to buy.
So recycling devotees hit on a new solution: if people aren't willing to buy our precious garbage, we'll force them. The Federal Government and dozens of states passed laws that required public agencies, newspapers and other companies to purchase recycled materials. These regulations, along with a wide variety of tax breaks and subsidies, have pushed the national rate of recycling up to Porter's goal of 25 percent -- an expensive achievement, since the programs lose money. But that's still not enough. Environmental groups are pressuring local governments to expand their recycling programs to meet the goals set in law -- goals that, according to the official who helped start the whole movement, are impossible to reach.
"People in New York and other places are tilting at recycling windmills," says Porter, who left the E.P.A. in 1989 and is now president of a consulting firm, the Waste Policy Center in Leesburg, Va. "There aren't many more materials in garbage that are worth recycling." Porter has been advising cities and states to abandon their unrealistic goals, but politicians are terrified of coming out against recycling. How could they explain it to the voters? How could they explain it to their children?

The Evangelist's Alarms

AFTER THE LITTER HUNT IN MISS APONTE'S SCIENCE classroom, it was time for a guest lecturer on garbage. A fifth-grade class was brought in to hear Joanne Dittersdorf, the director of environmental education for the Environmental Action Coalition, a nonprofit group based in New York. Her slide show began with a 19th-century photograph of a street in New York strewn with garbage.
"Why can't we keep throwing out garbage that way?" Dittersdorf asked.
"It'll keep piling up and we won't have any place to put it."
"The earth would be called the Trash Can."
"The garbage will soon, like, take over the whole world and, like, kill everybody."
Dittersdorf asked the children to examine their lives. "Does anyone here ever have takeout food?" A few students confessed, and Dittersdorf gently scolded them. "A lot of garbage there."
She showed a slide illustrating New Yorkers' total annual production of garbage: a pile big enough to fill 15 city blocks to a height of 20 stories. "There are a lot of landfills in New York City," Dittersdorf said, "but we've run out of space." Showing a slide of Flushing Meadows, a former landfill that's now a park, she asked, "Would you want to live on top of one of these landfills?" The place didn't look too bad, actually, but Dittersdorf explained that toxic threats could be hidden in a landfill. "Have you ever heard of a place called Love Canal? It was an old landfill that belonged to a chemical company, and they sold it to build a school on, and everyone who went to that school got very sick. There was poison in the dirt underneath."
A supermarket package of red apples appeared on the screen. "Look at the plastic, the Styrofoam or cardboard underneath," Dittersdorf said. "Do you need this much wrapping when you buy things?"
"Noooo."
"Every week," Dittersdorf said, "75,000 trees are cut to make the Sunday New York Times." The children were appalled. A few glanced reproachfully at me sitting in the back of the room. I didn't try to justify my -- or your -- role in this weekly tree-slaying, garbage-generating, earth-defiling ritual. The children were in no mood for heresy. Dittersdorf had masterfully reinforced the mythical tenets of the garbage crisis:
We're a wicked throwaway society. Plastic packaging and fast-food containers may seem wasteful, but they actually save resources and reduce trash. The typical household in Mexico City buys fewer packaged goods than an American household, but it produces one-third more garbage, chiefly because Mexicans buy fresh foods in bulk and throw away large portions that are unused, spoiled or stale. Those apples in Dittersdorf's slide, protected by plastic wrap and foam, are less likely to spoil. The lightweight plastic packaging requires much less energy to manufacture and transport than traditional alternatives like cardboard or paper. Food companies have switched to plastic packaging because they make money by using resources efficiently. A typical McDonald's discards less than two ounces of garbage for each customer served -- less than what's generated by a typical meal at home.
Plastic packaging is routinely criticized because it doesn't decay in landfills, but neither does most other packaging, as William Rathje, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona, has discovered from his excavations of landfills. Rathje found that paper, cardboard and other organic materials -- while technically biodegradable -- tend to remain intact in the airless confines of a landfill. These mummified materials actually use much more landfill space than plastic packaging, which has steadily been getting smaller as manufacturers develop stronger, thinner materials. Juice cartons take up half the landfill space occupied by the glass bottles they replaced; 12 plastic grocery bags fit in the space occupied by one paper bag.
Our garbage will bury us. The Mobro's saga was presented as a grim harbinger of future landfill scarcity, but it actually represented a short-lived scare caused by new environmental regulations. As old municipal dumps were forced to close in the 1980's, towns had to send their garbage elsewhere and pay higher prices for scarce landfill space. But the higher prices, predictably, encouraged companies to open huge new landfills, in some regions creating a glut that set off price-cutting wars. Over the past few years, landfills in the South and Middle West have been vying for garbage from the New York area, and it has become cheaper to ship garbage there than to bury it locally.
America today has a good deal more landfill space available than it did 10 years ago. Landfills are scarce in just a few places, notably the Northeast, partly because of local economic realities (open land is expensive near cities) but mainly because of local politics. Environmentalists have prevented new landfills from opening by propounding another myth. . . .
Our garbage will poison us. By mentioning Love Canal, Dittersdorf made landfills sound like the Slough of Despond, Bunyan's dread swamp. But it's not fair to compare modern municipal-trash landfills with Love Canal, an old industrial dump filled with large concentrations of toxic chemicals that seeped into the ground when a school was, stupidly, built on the site. (Even so, it's not clear that any of the schoolchildren were poisoned. Exhaustive scientific studies around Love Canal haven't detected any increase in cancer rates.)
Today's landfills for municipal trash are filled mostly with innocuous materials like paper, yard waste and construction debris. They contain small amounts of hazardous wastes, like lead and mercury, but studies have found that these poisons stay trapped inside the mass of garbage even in the old, unlined dumps that were built before today's stringent regulations. So there's little reason to worry about modern landfills, which by Federal law must be lined with clay and plastic, equipped with drainage and gas-collection systems, covered daily with soil and monitored regularly for underground leaks.
The small-time operators who ran the old municipal dumps can't afford to provide these safeguards, which is why corporations have moved in, opening huge facilities that might serve half a state, typically in a rural area with few neighbors. It's a prudent environmental strategy and it provides jobs for rural communities, which is why some of them have been competing to attract new landfills. But the availability of landfill space in the countryside has created an awkward situation for cities committed to more expensive alternatives like recycling programs and incinerators. Environmentalists have responded with a mythical imperative. . . .
We must achieve garbage independence. When Dittersdorf told the children that New York City was running out of landfill space, she was technically right. Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki have promised Staten Island that its municipal landfill will close in five years, and there's no logical place in town to put a new one. But why should the city have to use a local landfill? Why assume that New Yorkers have a moral obligation to dispose of their garbage near home? Most of the stuff was shipped to the city from factories and farms elsewhere. What's wrong with shipping it back out to be buried in places with open land?
"I don't understand why anyone thinks New York City has a garbage crisis because it can't handle all its own waste," says James DeLong, an adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington. "With that kind of logic, you'd have to conclude that New York City has a food crisis because it can't grow all the vegetables its people need within the city limits, so it should turn Central Park into a farm and ration New Yorkers' consumption of vegetables to what they can grow there." Some politicians in other states have threatened to stop the importing of New York's garbage -- it's an easy way to appeal to some voters' chauvinism -- but in the unlikely event that they succeeded, they would only be depriving their own constituents of jobs and tax revenue.
We're cursing future generations with our waste. Dittersdorf's slide showing New Yorkers' annual garbage output -- 15 square blocks, 20 stories high -- looked frightening because the trash was sitting, uncompressed, in the middle of the city. But consider a different perspective -- a national, long-term perspective. A. Clark Wiseman, an economist at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., has calculated that if Americans keep generating garbage at current rates for 1,000 years, and if all their garbage is put in a landfill 100 yards deep, by the year 3000 this national garbage heap will fill a square piece of land 35 miles on each side.
This doesn't seem a huge imposition in a country the size of America. The garbage would occupy only 5 percent of the area needed for the national array of solar panels proposed by environmentalists. The millennial landfill would fit on one-tenth of 1 percent of the range land now available for grazing in the continental United States. And if it still pains you to think of depriving posterity of that 35-mile square, remember that the loss will be only temporary. Eventually, like previous landfills, the mounds of trash will be covered with grass and become a minuscule addition to the nation's 150,000 square miles of parkland.
We're squandering irreplaceable natural resources. Yes, a lot of trees have been cut down to make today's newspaper. But even more trees will probably be planted in their place. America's supply of timber has been increasing for decades, and the nation's forests have three times more wood today than in 1920. "We're not running out of wood, so why do we worry so much about recycling paper?" asks Jerry Taylor, the director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute. "Paper is an agricultural product, made from trees grown specifically for paper production. Acting to conserve trees by recycling paper is like acting to conserve cornstalks by cutting back on corn consumption."
Some resources, of course, don't grow back, and it may seem prudent to worry about depleting the earth's finite stores of metals and fossil fuels. It certainly seemed so during the oil shortages of the 1970's, when the modern recycling philosophy developed. But the oil scare was temporary, just like all previous scares about resource shortages. The costs of natural resources, both renewable and nonrenewable, have been declining for thousands of years. They've become less scarce over time because humans have continually found new supplies or devised new technologies. Fifty years ago, for instance, tin and copper were said to be in danger of depletion, and conservationists urged mandatory recycling and rationing of these vital metals so that future generations wouldn't be deprived of food containers and telephone wires. But today tin and copper are cheaper than ever. Most food containers don't use any tin. Phone calls travel through fiber-optic cables of glass, which is made from sand -- and should the world ever run out of sand, we could dispense with wires altogether by using cellular phones.
The only resource that has been getting consistently more expensive is human time: the cost of labor has been rising for centuries. An hour of labor today buys a larger quantity of energy or raw materials than ever before. To economists, it's wasteful to expend human labor to save raw materials that are cheap today and will probably be cheaper tomorrow. Even the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group that strongly favors recycling and has often issued warnings about the earth's dwindling resources, has been persuaded that there are no foreseeable shortages of most minerals. "In retrospect," a Worldwatch report notes, "the question of scarcity may never have been the most important one."
It is better to recycle than to throw away. This is the most enduring myth, the one that remains popular even among those who don't believe in the garbage crisis anymore. By now, many experts and public officials acknowledge that America could simply bury its garbage, but they object to this option because it diverts trash from recycling programs. Recycling, which was originally justified as the only solution to a desperate national problem, has become a goal in itself -- a goal so important that we must preserve the original problem. It's as if the protagonist of "Pilgrim's Progress," upon being informed that he could drop his sinful burden right there on the road, insisted on clinging to it just so he could continue the pilgrimage to get rid of it.
Why is it better to recycle? The usual justifications are that it saves money and protects the environment. These sound reasonable until you actually start handling garbage.

The Muckrakers' Discoveries
 
The 1992 Plan projected that the City would realize net savings from recycling. The Department's experience to date in implementing the recycling program diverges from the assumptions of the Plan.
-- 1996 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan of the New York City Department of Sanitation.

EVERY TIME A SANITATION DEPARTMENT CREW PICKS UP A load of bottles and cans from the curb, New York City loses money. The recycling program consumes resources. It requires extra administrators and a continual public relations campaign explaining what to do with dozens of different products -- recycle milk jugs but not milk cartons, index cards but not construction paper. (Most New Yorkers still don't know the rules.) It requires enforcement agents to inspect garbage and issue tickets. Most of all, it requires extra collection crews and trucks. Collecting a ton of recyclable items is three times more expensive than collecting a ton of garbage because the crews pick up less material at each stop. For every ton of glass, plastic and metal that the truck delivers to a private recycler, the city currently spends $200 more than it would spend to bury the material in a landfill.
Officials hoped to recover this extra cost by selling the material, but the market price of a ton has never been anywhere near $200. In fact, it has rarely risen as high as zero. Private recyclers usually demand a fee because their processing costs exceed the eventual sales price of the recycled materials. So the city, having already lost $200 collecting the ton of material, typically has to pay another $40 to get rid of it.
The recycling program has been costing $50 million to $100 million annually, and that's just the money coming directly out of the municipal budget. There's also the labor involved: the garbage-sorting that millions of New Yorkers do at home every week. How much would the city have to spend if it couldn't rely on forced labor? True, some people would probably be glad to do the work for free because they regard garbage-sorting as a morally uplifting activity for the whole family. But many others have refused to follow the law. They seem to have a more traditional view of garbage-sorting: an activity done only for money, and then only by the most destitute members of society.
I tried to estimate the value of New Yorkers' garbage-sorting by financing an experiment by a neutral observer (a Columbia University student with no strong feelings about recycling). He kept a record of the work he did during one week complying with New York's recycling laws. It took him eight minutes during the week to sort, rinse and deliver four pounds of cans and bottles to the basement of his building. If the city paid for that work at a typical janitorial wage ($12 per hour), it would pay $792 in home labor costs for each ton of cans and bottles collected. And what about the extra space occupied by that recycling receptacle in the kitchen? It must take up at least a square foot, which in New York costs at least $4 a week to rent. If the city had to pay for this space, the cost per ton of recyclables would be about $2,000. That figure plus the home labor costs, added to what the city already spends on its collection program, totals more than $3,000 for a ton of scrap metal, glass and plastic. For that price, you could find a one-ton collection of those materials at a used-car lot -- a Toyota Tercel, for instance -- and drive home in it.
LAST YEAR, A SURGE in the market price for recycled materials prompted a spate of recycling-has-finally-arrived articles. At one point, New York was selling its old newspapers for $150 per ton, which was almost enough to offset the extra costs of the paper recycling program. But newsprint prices have since plummeted back to familiar levels; New York is once again paying recyclers to take its newspapers, and city officials are resigned to losing money on recycling. As a result of a lawsuit by City Council members and the Natural Resources Defense Council, the city has been under court order to collect increasing amounts of recyclable material to meet goals set in law. City officials have promised to comply by expanding the recycling program and promoting a separate program in the public schools, but they've been stalling because they don't want to increase the budget deficit.
Officials in some cities claim that curbside recycling programs are cheaper than burying the garbage in a landfill, which can be true in places where the landfill fees are high and the collection costs aren't as exorbitant as in New York. But officials who claim that recycling programs save money often don't fully account for the costs. "A lot of programs, especially in the early years, have used funny-money economics to justify recycling," says Chaz Miller, a contributing editor for Recycling Times, a trade newspaper. "There's been a messianic zeal that's hurt the cause. The American public loves recycling, but we have to do it efficiently. It should be a business, not a religion."
Recycling programs didn't fare well in a Federally financed study conducted by the the Solid Waste Association of North America, a trade association for municipal waste-management officials. The study painstakingly analyzed costs in six communities (Minneapolis; Palm Beach, Fla.; Seattle; Scottsdale, Ariz; Sevierville, Tenn., and Springfield, Mass.). It found that all but one of the curbside recycling programs, and all the composting operations and waste-to-energy incinerators, increased the cost of waste disposal. (The exception was Seattle's curbside program, which was slightly cheaper -- by one-tenth of 1 percent -- than putting the garbage in a landfill.) Studies in European cities have reached similar conclusions. Recycling has been notoriously unprofitable in Germany, whose national program is even less efficient than New York's.
"We have to recognize that recycling costs money," says William Franklin, an engineer who has conducted a national study of recycling costs for the not-for-profit group Keep America Beautiful. He estimates that, at today's prices, a curbside recycling program typically adds 15 percent to the costs of waste disposal -- and more if communities get too ambitious.
Franklin and other researchers have concluded that recycling does at least save energy -- the extra fuel burned while picking up recyclables is more than offset by the energy savings from manufacturing less virgin paper, glass and metal. "The net result of recycling is lower energy consumption and lower releases of air and water pollutants," says Richard Denison, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, which has calculated the ecological benefits of recycling. But there are much more direct -- and cheaper -- ways to reduce pollution. Recycling is a messy way to try to help the environment. Consider a few questions whose answers would seem obvious to the environmentally aware:
Does a 5-cent deposit on a soft-drink can help the environment? Mandatory deposits encourage recycling and reduce litter, but these programs typically spend $500 for every ton of cans and bottles collected, which makes curbside recycling look like a bargain. States without mandatory deposits -- like Texas and Washington -- have proven that the most efficient way to reduce litter is to hire clean-up crews, which pick up a lot more than just bottles and cans. Recycling takes money that could be used for other clean-up efforts: when New York's Sanitation Department started its recycling program, it cut back on street cleaning.
Are reusable cups and plates better than disposables? A ceramic mug may seem a more virtuous choice than a cup made of polystyrene, the foam banned by ecologically conscious local governments. But it takes much more energy to manufacture the mug, and then each washing consumes more energy (not to mention water). According to calculations by Martin Hocking, a chemist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, you would have to use the mug 1,000 times before its energy-consumption-per-use is equal to the cup. (If the mug breaks after your 900th coffee, you would have been better off using 900 polystyrene cups.) A more immediate environmental impact has been demonstrated by studies in restaurants: the average number of bacterial organisms on reusable cups, plates and flatware is 200 times greater than on disposable ones.
Should you recycle today's newspaper? Saving a tree is a mixed blessing. When there's less demand for virgin wood pulp, timber companies are likely to sell some of their tree farms -- maybe to condominium developers. Less virgin pulp means less pollution at paper mills in timber country, but recycling operations create pollution in areas where more people are affected: fumes and noise from collection trucks, solid waste and sludge from the mills that remove ink and turn the paper into pulp. Recycling newsprint actually creates more water pollution than making new paper: for each ton of recycled newsprint that's produced, an extra 5,000 gallons of waste water are discharged.
Cost-benefit analyses for individual products become so confusing that even ardent environmentalists give up. After years of studies and debates about the environmental merits of cloth versus disposable diapers, some environmental organizations finally decided they couldn't decide; parents were advised to choose whichever they wanted. This sensible advice ought to be extended to other products. It would not only make life simpler for everyone, but would probably benefit the environment. When consumers follow their preferences, they are guided by the simplest, and often the best, measure of a product's environmental impact: its price.
Polystyrene cups are cheap because they require so little energy and material to manufacture -- without reading a chemist's analysis, you could deduce from the cup's low price that it's an efficient use of natural resources. Similarly, the prices paid for scrap materials are a measure of their environmental value as recyclables. Scrap aluminum fetches a high price because recycling it consumes so much less energy than manufacturing new aluminum. The low price paid for scrap tinted glass tells you that you won't be conserving valuable resources by recycling it. While price is hardly a perfect measure of environmental impact, especially in countries where manufacturers are free to pollute, an American product's price usually reflects the cost of complying with strict environmental regulations. It's generally a more reliable guide than intuitive moral judgments or abstract theories about what's good for the planet.
A theorist could logically argue that you have an obligation to recycle not just the paper in this magazine but also the staples. As a nonrenewable resource, isn't the steel theoretically even more precious than the paper? Shouldn't you take each staple to a scrap-metal dealer or, better yet, reuse it in your own stapler? But if you look at the low price of new staples -- and the fact that scrap dealers aren't scurrying to buy used staples -- you can see that it's a waste of time to worry about posterity running out of staples. Recycling devotees have too often ignored such signals, preferring programs based on rules instead of prices, and they've hurt their own cause. They've missed the obvious solution to America's garbage problems -- a solution they should have recognized from one of their seminal ecological texts.

The Tragedy Of the Dump

THE PHILOSOPHICAL underpinning of the modern environmental movement can be found in "The Tragedy of the Commons," a 1968 essay by the ecologist Garrett Hardin. It is a parable about a village's public pasture, the commons, that is open free of charge to everyone's cattle. Because no villager has a personal incentive to restrict the size of his herd, the herds keep growing, and eventually their overgrazing destroys the commons. The parable is a useful model for the many environmental problems in which the common good is damaged by individuals acting out of rational self-interest (like overfishing of the oceans or pollution of the atmosphere). It applies nicely to the garbage situation in the many communities where a free town dump has historically been treated as a commons.
There are two ways to avert the Tragedy of the Commons, as Hardin's essay explains. The first is to convert the commons to private property, dividing up the land so that every herdsman owns a piece of pasture and has a personal incentive not to destroy it. The second is to make rules limiting the number of cattle on the commons. This approach, government regulation, is the most obvious solution to some complex environmental problems, especially ones involving global commons like the oceans or the atmosphere. But garbage is not one of these complex problems.
The Tragedy of the Dump is a simple problem better resolved with the first approach: private responsibility. Your trash is already your private property. You should be responsible for getting rid of it. You should have to pay to get rid of it -- and you should pay whatever price it takes to insure that your garbage doesn't cause environmental problems for anyone else. Paying for residential garbage collection sounds like a radical idea in New York and other cities where these costs are hidden in property taxes, but it's already being done in thousands of communities, including cities like Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. It's also standard practice for commercial establishments in New York and elsewhere. Some cities charge according to volume -- the number of bags or cans that you fill -- and some have begun experimenting with charging by the pound.
Once people switch to this pay-as-you-throw system, they throw away less -- typically at least 10 to 15 percent less. Some shop differently; some take their names off junk-mail lists; some recycle. Instead of following (or ignoring) arcane rules and targets set by politicians, they're personally motivated to figure out what's worth paying to discard and what's worth diverting to a recycling bin. Those who want to recycle for spiritual reasons can do so; others can recycle whatever makes economic sense to them. If the pay-as-you-throw system became common everywhere, there would be no need for recycling laws and goals and moral exhortations. "In a purely market-driven situation, people would still recycle according to what makes sense in their area," says Lynn Scarlett, the vice president of research at the Reason Foundation, which has studied pay-as-you-throw systems. "In most places it would pay to recycle aluminum cans, corrugated cardboard and office paper. A lot of newspapers and some clear glass would be recycled. But people wouldn't meet the high targets set by laws. They wouldn't bother with some of the things being mandated today, like mixed paper and certain plastics."
Environmentalists don't necessarily oppose free-market reforms for garbage -- they've supported some pay-as-you-throw systems -- but they spend much of their energy crusading for government recycling programs and regulations. They have instinctively chosen Hardin's second solution. This is partly because of their ideology -- many environmentalists trust government regulations more than market forces -- but there's also another reason. The leaders of the recycling movement derive psychic and financial rewards from recycling. Environmental groups raise money and attract new members through their campaigns to outlaw "waste" and prevent landfills from opening. They get financing from public and private sources (including the recycling industry) to research and promote recycling. By turning garbage into a political issue, environmentalists have created jobs for themselves as lawyers, lobbyists, researchers, educators and moral guardians. Environmentalists may genuinely believe they're helping the earth, but they have been hurting the common good while profiting personally, just like the village's herdsmen. This is the real Tragedy of the Dump: the waste of public funds on recycling programs, the needless public alarm about landfills.
Fortunately, though, not every community has been afflicted. For those seeking the truth about garbage, there's a mountain 300 miles south of New York that's worth a pilgrimage.

The Celestial City Glimpsed at Long Last

T HE MOST SENSIBLE comment I've heard on the subject of garbage was uttered by Linny Miles as we were looking at a mountain of it near his farm. Miles grows wheat and raises Thoroughbreds in Charles City County, Va., which has 6,000 residents and one stoplight. Next to his farm, 20 miles southeast of Richmond, is a landfill that accepts 4,000 tons of trash a day, much of it from the New York area. Private carters deliver trash from Manhattan restaurants; sealed rail cars bring municipal waste from suburban New Jersey.
The trash is surprisingly hard to spot. I got lost on the way to the landfill and drove around the perimeter of the wooded property without realizing there was garbage hidden back there. I finally got a view of it from Miles's house, which sits on a rise 200 yards from the edge of the landfill's property. He pointed to a brown ridge rising above the pine trees. The ridge was maybe 75 yards high, and the lower slopes were already covered with grass. Miles said he was occasionally bothered by odors and noise from the unloading operations, but overall he thought the landfill was good for the county. When I asked if he objected to New Yorkers using Charles City as a dumping ground, Miles shook his head and explained his reasoning in one sentence: "They brought something to the party."
Ten years ago, Charles City County had much in common with New York today. It had no money to fix its decrepit schools. Its economy was stagnant, its tax rate was among the state's highest and it was being ordered to shut down its old dump. Now, thanks to its new landfill, the county has lower taxes, better-paid teachers and splendid schools. The landfill's private operator, the Chambers Development Company, pays Charles City County fees totaling $3 million a year -- as much as the county takes in from all its property taxes. The landfill has created jobs, as have the new businesses that were attracted by the lower taxes and new schools. The 80-acre public-school campus has three buildings with central air conditioning and fiber-optic cabling. The library has 10,000 books, laser disks and CD-ROM's; every classroom in the elementary school has a telephone and a computer. The new auditorium has been used by visiting orchestras and dance companies, which previously had no place to perform in the county.
If you are are heavy with garbage and guilt, Charles City is the place to lay down your burden. There you can see garbage the way Linny Miles regards it: not as a moral issue but as an economic commodity. New Yorkers get rid of their garbage cheaply; Charles City's children get new schools. Why should New Yorkers spend extra money to recycle so they can avoid this mutually beneficial transaction? Why make harried parents feel guilty about takeout food? Why train children to be garbage-sorters? Why force the Bridges school to spend money on a recycling program when it still doesn't have a computer in the science classroom?
Several weeks after Dittersdorf's lecture there, I told her about Charles City's schools and asked if recycling needed to be so important to New Yorkers' education.
"I wish we spent more money on other things in the schools here," Dittersdorf said, "and I don't think recycling has a higher priority than things like computers or art classes. But I'd put it equal. Sure, kids should have time for other things, for reading and writing and dreaming. But recycling can be a wonderful project for kids and parents to do together. It inspires creative work and teaches valuable lessons."
Maybe she's right. Maybe parents and children correctly see the intangible value of recycling lessons. But as children pursue their moral education, as they learn to ponder the fate of the earth, it wouldn't hurt for them to also study, once again, that recycling scene in "Pilgrim's Progress." If Bunyan were an administrator in today's schools, he might call it a lesson in prioritizing. The thrifty muckraker, intent on his compost pile, doesn't notice a figure hovering overhead, offering to trade him a golden celestial crown for his rake. This scene is observed by the pilgrim, who consults a helpful guide named the Interpreter.
"This is a figure of a man of this world, is it not, good sir?" the pilgrim asks.
"Thou hast said the right," the Interpreter replies, "and his muck-rake doth show his carnal mind." The Interpreter points out the waste on the ground and sadly explains that, for the muckraker, "Things here are counted the only things substantial." The muckraker has forgotten that there is more to life than hoarding natural resources. His recycling has become the most primitive form of materialism: the worship of materials.
"Earthly things, when they are with power upon men's minds, quite carry their hearts away from God," the Interpreter says. The pilgrim cries out in horror.
"O! deliver me from this muck-rake."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Environmental Sensitivity;
For Office Towers, Being Green Can Be Beneficial

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
IT would not be surprising for the first new office building to go up in mid-Manhattan in many years to incorporate a few new wrinkles. But the Durst Organization, which is scheduled to break ground this summer for a 48-story tower on Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets, is emphasizing an attribute not commonly associated with the Times Square area: environmentalism.
The building, whose address will be 4 Times Square, will include energy efficient heating and cooling, increased use of natural light, internal chutes to collect materials for recycling, tightly fitted windows and extra insulation, water conservation fixtures and measures to avoid the use of materials that release toxic gases to interior air. 
 Durst officials say the emphasis on green virtues produces a double benefit: A pleasant interior space is attractive to prospective tenants, and careful attention to conservation actually saves money, despite somewhat higher initial costs.
"Being environmentally responsible is a part of our lifestyle," said Douglas Durst, president of the Durst Organization. "We were pleased to learn that the economics made sense as well." He said the energy costs of the building will be 25 to 30 percent below those of the office buildings built in the 1980's, and 15 to 20 percent better than the government standards currently in effect.
The lower costs will be passed on to tenants to make the building more attractive, said Jonathan (Jody) Durst, the organization's chief of operations.
The publishing company Conde Nast will be the anchor tenant, occupying one third of the building's 1.5 million square feet of office space. (There will be an additional 100,000 square feet of retail space on the first three floors.) Charles H. Townsend, Conde Nast's executive in charge of the relocation, said he was drawn to the building's green benefits and planned to build its space following environmental principles.
"The tenant benefits from a green building," Mr. Townsend said. "The Dursts supply us with high quality air and low noise levels. It is our intention to carry on the environmental theme in the build-out and furnishing of our space."
He said the effort would focus on adhesives, paints, carpeting and wall coverings because these are the things often responsible for releasing volatile gases that are associated with "sick building syndrome,"in which workers complain of headaches and other illnesses caused by polluted air. Even the basic layout of the space may be unconventional to promote maximum use of natural light.
"We are at the expression of interest stage, but we would be highly receptive to an approach that made maximum use of outdoor light," Mr. Townsend said. In a typical layout, executive offices ring the exterior of a floor, blocking the light for clerical workers in the interior.
WITH a different layout, more workers would benefit from natural light, which is easier on the eyes than artificial lighting. Special glass will be used on the building to admit natural light but reject ultraviolet rays, which tend to drive up temperatures.
Until recently, the chief proponents of green building were, not surprisingly, environmental groups. When the Natural Resources Defense Council remodeled the top four floors of 40 West 20th Street in 1988, it did so with an eye toward energy conservation.
Instruments that detect motion turn off lights in unoccupied rooms and natural light is conveyed to the interior of the structure by using glass on the top of interior partition walls. An etched glass wall on one side of the conference room there minimizes the use of artificial light, even though it is at the middle of the space, because outside light passes through the wall.
"The total energy bill here is $35,000 a year," said Robert Watson, a senior resource specialist with the group. "If it was a conventional office, it would be over $100,000."
He said the conversion was more expensive than a standard approach, but attributed the extra expense mostly to the learning curve. "There was a bit of tuition, a certain cost of learning how to do it," he said. "But if we did it again, it would be no more costly." The group spent about $200,000, or about 7 percent of the $3.1 million project on energy conservation features such as motion sensors that turn light out in unoccupied rooms and low watt fluorescent specially coated to resemble daylight.
William Browning of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a research group in Colorado, said at a recent conference in New York that energy efficient building, using parts and equipment now available, should cost no more than 5 percent more to build than the standard approach.
The Audubon Society achieved similar energy savings when it remodeled a 100-year-old, eight-story building at Broadway and East Fourth Street several years later. "Our energy costs are about $86,000 to $87,000 a year," said Ken Hamilton, the building's manager. Standard industry guidelines for such a building in this climate zone predict costs of $120,000 to $140,000 a year, he said.
Interest in environmentally correct buildings is growing nationally, said David Gottfried, the founder and vice chairman of the U.S. Green Buildings Council in San Francisco. "I've been into green building since 1990, but now interest seems to be heating up," he said.
He said the council, which has 110 members including equipment suppliers, universities, utilities and environmental groups, is developing a rating system for buildings. "Buildings get rated in the United Kingdom and Canada, but we've had nothing here, Mr. Gottfried said. "When we publish our rating system, it could start to affect leasability and rental rates if the tenant community picks up on it."
Mr. Townsend of Conde Nast said one of the attractions of 4 Times Square was the air handling system, which will measure air quality as well as temperature. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the air will be continually monitored, and when it rises above a pre-set point, more fresh air will be circulated inside.
The carbon dioxide level is a proxy for all the contaminants that can foul indoor air, including emissions from office machines and solutions used in cleaning, said Barry Dimson, president of Health Properties L.L.C., a consulting company in New York.
"Ninety-nine percent of the systems run on temperature alone, so there is no way to measure as the volatile organic compounds build up," Mr. Dimson said. "By 2 P.M. the air in some of these buildings is not very good."
And, he said, most buildings turn their air-conditioning systems off at night, when cleaning crews are using various chemicals as part of their work. The ones that evaporate thus stay in the air until the system is turned on again in the morning. "The eager guy who comes in at 8 A.M. gets quite a jolt," Mr. Dimson said.
Mr. Dimson said he expects the Durst building to stimulate interest in an environmentally better workplace. "Brokers do not like to talk about air quality but soon they will have to because their clients will ask," he said. "Already some law firms are starting to ask questions because of what they see in their own practices."
The Durst building will include two chutes to promote recycling, one for wet trash, such as the remains of a lunch, and one for the waste paper that offices generate in vast amounts. Both chutes will lead directly to compactors, which will prepare the garbage for disposal and the paper for recycling.
Collection of cans and bottles will be handled on a floor by floor basis, Jody Durst said, because the volume is much less than paper and more shafts would reduce rentable space.
SAVING in energy costs and carbon dioxide levels in interior air are easy to measure, but green building advocates say the big advantages are less easy to quantify: more productive employees.
Several studies have suggested that a healthy work environment boosts productivity by about 10 percent, by reducing the number of sick days taken off and improving people's attitudes. If the average office worker in New York costs $40,000 a year and occupies about 200 square feet of space, that means the employer's cost is about $200 per square foot per person.
A 10 percent increase in productivity would produce a $20 a square foot increase in rental value.
"Eighty percent of most employers' costs are for personnel," Douglas Durst said. "If you reduce absenteeism in an environmentally friendly building, it can have a big payoff."

HEADLINE: Habitats/420 West 23d Street;
Auction, Anxiety, Success

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
FIFTY or 60 business cards from real estate agents, the memorabilia of his unsuccessful apartment search, are filed neatly in his office. Other cards, other contacts, are also filed, the evidence of a more successful search for a foreclosed apartment, which he succeeded in buying at public auction.
For Stefan Bange, a 34-year-old executive with a French textile company, the two-and-a-half-year search for a New York City apartment was a learning experience, an experience that, he said, may well turn into another career: advising people how to buy apartments at auction, without the help of a broker. 
 "It was so frustrating," Mr. Bange said of New York apartment hunting. "A person with a relatively good income can find only one-bedrooms for $180,000 to $250,000. I didn't like it at all."
Aside from one near-purchase -- an apartment on Park Avenue at 39th Street, which he said "in the end, had the same views I have out of my office windows" -- he found nothing he thought was worth jumping at.
"I took all the newspapers," he said. "I called all the agents; after a while I think they were thinking I was not really going to buy anything." He subscribed to various services that, for a fee, sent lists of properties, "but I think the brokers had skimmed off all the good stuff so it was really the dregs," he said.
Faced with unenthusiastic agents and paltry lists, Mr. Bange changed his strategy.
"I started calling the banks, Chemical you name it," he said. "They sent out lists, but those lists, too, had been skimmed by the agents. After 1992, the banks had wised up -- they weren't selling these apartments for way below market value anymore."
He then went to an agency that handles foreclosures. These agencies buy groups of options on apartments wholesale and sell them before the auction. But he found such a situation can lead to one big problem: "if the person whose apartment it is files for bankruptcy, it can hold up the whole thing." Mr. Bange said.
"It can end up a complete disaster," he continued. "Not that it's not resolvable, but you want to have a happy experience, not a nightmare."
So Mr. Bange took to the streets, chatting up doormen and maintenance men. "If I saw a construction van double-parked in front," he said, "I'd go up to them and -- to break the ice -- say something like: 'Hey, you must get a lot of tickets.' " He met someone -- he is a little vague here to protect his sources of information -- who told him about a one-bedroom apartment at 420 West 23d Street that had been taken over by the bank holding the mortgage.
Faced with little information, he started pestering the managing agent of the building, trying to learn more.
"At first, I only knew it was 700 square feet, and it was a condominium," he said. Next, he learned the time and date of the sale. But he wanted more. "I've got to make sure it's not a rundown place," he said. "I kept calling, schmoozing, I had to develop a relationship, be tactful. I developed a relationship with the doorman. After about two weeks, he finally gave in."
Snapping his fingers, Mr. Bange mimicked the doorman's attitude: "Alllright, I have the keys and I'll let you in."
"It was basically to get me out of their hair," Mr. Bange said. "I saw it and it was great so I called my lawyer and put my life savings on the line."
Then came the foreclosure sale. Although Mr. Bange dug up the referee's name and address -- and tracked the man down -- the court-appointed official could tell him little about the terms of the sale.
ACCOMPANIED by his lawyer, Mr. Bange arrived, shaking with nervousness, he recalled.
"Three or four investors strolled in," he said. "Whatever stereotyped description they give about loan sharks in the movies, that description would fit these men perfectly. They saw me, and walked over and said something like: 'We're all here, we shouldn't get crazy . . . .' "
"I couldn't figure out what they were saying," Mr. Bange continued, "but my lawyer explained to me that what they wanted to do was to pay me for walking away. But I said 'No, we'll stay cool, we'll do our thing.' So we played it cool, but I really wanted this apartment so bad."
Mr. Bange had drawn up a spread sheet and estimated what these investors -- would pay for the apartment, a sunny spot with parquet floors and a 10-by-6-foot balcony in a 10-year-old building with a garden in back for residents.
He estimated the investors would go to $130,000 for the apartment. Mr. Bange's research showed that it might bring $165,000 on the open market "as is" -- in excellent condition but neither renovated nor decorated -- with $832 a month in combined charges.
The auctioneer started with $500.
"I thought this was great," Mr. Bange said. "The investors piled in with $100,000. Then the representative from the bank bid $114,090 -- which was the money the bank needed to get out of the sale. The investors bid $116,000. I came in with $118,000." The price rose in increments of $2,000.
"The investors' last bid was $132,000," Mr. Bange said. "I was going to bid $140,000 just to hammer it home, but then the economist in me came through and said: 'Be cool,' so I said $135,000." The man who was bidding for the investors gave a disgusted wave -- indicating it was Mr. Bange's -- and walked away.
Buoyed by his success, Mr. Bange has become a man with a mission. Even though he has not yet moved into his apartment -- he plans to move in soon with his girlfriend, who, during the process, became a real estate agent -- he is trying to find another apartment for a friend in Germany who is coming to New York City.
"It just might become a business for me in the future," he said.
As for the orthodox way of finding an apartment, Mr. Bange said: "I've done everything differently and contrary from what a real estate agent would tell me to do. Not that all real estate agents are sharks; there are some excellent brokers and I plan to keep in touch with the good ones -- I told them it wouldn't be a one-way street."

HEADLINE: Developer's Plan Roils a College Town in Vermont

BYLINE: By SALLY JOHNSON 

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURY, Vt.

 BODY:
A PLAN by Middlebury College to sell a parcel of college-owned land to a shopping-center developer has sent shock waves through this town, which, many believe, depends on its image to maintain its economic health.
The proposal calls for Middlebury College, which owns a vacant motel and a 30-acre tract just south of town, to sell off eight acres. The prospective buyer is Myron M. Hunt, a developer and Middlebury alumnus who has applied to the town for permission to build a 44,400-square-foot Price Chopper supermarket and a 5,000-square-foot restaurant on the land. 
The idea of building a supermarket in a town with three grocery stores and a definite traffic problem has rankled critics, who argue that more congestion at the town's southern entrance can only hurt the economy of Middlebury, where the scenery,not the shopping, has been the major draw.
"It's a matter of this developer and this tenant in this site, which has been identified in the Town Plan as a gateway to the village," said John Barstow, a member of the steering committee of Citizens for Middlebury, a group formed in response to Mr. Hunt's proposal.
In many ways, the clash of wills is similar to thousands of development disputes that play out each year in cities and towns all over the country -- a push and pull between those who staunchly defend laissez-faire capitalism and those who don't.
Mr. Hunt, a developer from Buffalo, argues that his project will work to the town's long-term benefit. To the many residents who worry about increased traffic on an already congested road, he has promised that new traffic signals and wider roadways, installed at his expense, will improve the situation, even with the 20 percent traffic increase his engineers predict the shopping center will generate.
To those who argue that Middlebury already has three groceries, he cites a market study by his consultants. "Market conditions dictate an additional supermarket," it says. "It would be a fine asset to this community."
"Besides, Mr. Hunt added, "competition is always good for the consumer."
SUCH assurances were not sufficient to calm the fears of the 350 people who turned out for a public hearing by the Middlebury Planning Commission earlier this month. Residents took the microphone to tell Mr. Hunt civilly but passionately that they did not need or want what he was selling.
"We don't need your groceries," said one young woman to enthusiastic applause from the audience. "Why don't you take your store somewhere else and give us something we do need?"
Another public hearing is scheduled July 10. Mr. Hunt hopes to get the town's approval to begin construction in the fall and open the store next spring.
There is a broader issue at play here than groceries and traffic. The dispute turns on a powerful and pervasive fear that the town (population 8,034, plus 1,900 college students) is losing what makes it distinctive.
Settled in the latter half of the 18th century, Middlebury still has a thriving downtown, filled with locally owned businesses housed in three blocks of 19th-century brick buildings. The village is bisected by the Otter Creek, which takes a dramatic and noisy fall off a ledge in the middle of town under the century-old stone bridge. The bridge was constructed of stone, not iron, at the behest of Joseph Battell, a town father and eccentric millionaire of the last century, whose principal passion was buying enormous tracts of land, much of which he left to Middlebury College.
The town's green, with gazebo, occupies a prominent place visually and socially. Churches hold their fund-raisers on the green and children congregate there after school on their bicycles. Families turn out for Festival on the Green, which takes place each year in early July -- seven evenings of free concerts, juggling acts and community-theater productions.
But there is a sense now that the visual and social tranquility could evaporate under the strain of overdevelopment. In addition to the Hunt application, Rite-Aid, the national chain drugstore, has applied to move in across the road from Price Chopper. To Robin Scheu, a member of Citizens for Middlebury, the future of her adopted hometown is in danger. "To me, this Price Chopper represents the end of Middlebury as we know it," Ms. Scheu said. "Once this starts, you have a domino effect."
To see the domino effect in action elsewhere, Middlebury residents have only to look to strip development 30 miles north or south, to Burlington and Rutland respectively. The two main thoroughfares to the south and west of Burlington, Vermont's largest city, are filled with fast-food chains, gas stations, discount department stores and motels. To many, the Burlington experience is a cautionary tale.
"Middlebury is a different place than the rest of the country, and it has a population that appreciates that difference," said Fred Dunnington, Middlebury's town planner and zoning administrator for 15 years. "Part of the issue here is image -- and that's a very difficult thing to do through zoning."
EQUALLY troubling to opponents of Mr. Hunt's proposal is the role of Middlebury College. The college did not list the property; in fact, Mr. Hunt approached college officials about buying it, according to all those involved. Because the small liberal-arts college, founded in 1800, has long been the dominant economic and cultural force in town, and because the college uses its scenic location as a selling point, many critics are wondering just what the administration is about.
"What is the college doing in the role of developer-broker in a town, and state, trying desperately to preserve its rural, Main Street heritage?" wrote Ron Powers, a recently resigned faculty member, in a scathing commentary that appeared in the local weekly. "And what kind of signals is the college sending into the regional and national debate over sprawl vs. controlled growth?"
For their part, college officials said they were acting as responsible citizens by following existing procedures to determine the appropriateness of the development and that this proposal should be treated no different from any other.
"Middlebury College isn't seeking to build a supermarket; Middlebury College isn't seeking to increase the town's traffic problem," said John McCardell, president of the College, in a telephone interview. "We're selling that land because we were offered what we consider a fair price for it."
Steven Rockefeller, a professor of religion at Middlebury who has given millions of dollars toward the preservation of open land in Vermont, is not buying the college's claim of neutrality.
"I do not think this is a good idea for the town, and I certainly hope the college will reconsider its position," Mr. Rockefeller said. "And, yes, this is certainly a matter over which the college exercises a great deal of control."

BOOMERANG
Clinton's Health Security Effort and the Turn Against Government in U.S. Politics.
By Theda Skocpol.
230 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $27.50.
 Back in 1976, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan was seeking a United States Senate seat from New York, he took delight in ridiculing his opponent, the Conservative-Republican incumbent James Buckley, as a man who simply couldn't accept the political realities of his time. "Look," Mr. Moynihan would tell his political audiences in tones of mock exasperation, "there's this particular fringe, and their one fundamental problem is they simply never accepted the New Deal. They're still running against 'that man in the White House.' " Twenty years later, a similar syndrome is evident in American political discourse. Only now "that man in the White House" isn't Franklin Roosevelt but Ronald Reagan. And those struggling with the day's political realities aren't conservative Republicans but liberal Democrats. 
 This turnabout is reflected in "Boomerang," Theda Skocpol's well-researched and highly ideological analysis of what really happened back in 1993 and 1994 when President Clinton attempted to give the country a comprehensive and universal health care system. This bold initiative turned out to be a political disaster, as Ms. Skocpol concedes. Its defeat, she suggests, led directly to the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress and to the Democrats' lack of any meaningful political vision in this Presidential campaign season. "The Democratic Party is by now a relatively hollow political shell," she writes.
 So what went wrong? Ms. Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, dismisses most of the conventional thinking that emerged in the wake of Mr. Clinton's defeat. She evinces contempt for the "punditocracy" that attributed the defeat to the "know-it-all" arrogance and elitist zeal of Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Clinton friend Ira C. Magaziner, who led the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform. "Stories about flawed personalities are fun to read," Ms. Skocpol writes. "Retrospectives blaming the failure of health care reform on scapegoats have easily slid into this well-worn line of condemnation."
 She is equally dismissive of the view that the public was simply too confused to accept the Clinton prescriptions. Ms. Skocpol pronounces this argument "glib and unsatisfying." If the voters were confused, she says, it was largely because of the barrage of opposition propaganda that greeted the President's plan. No, the most compelling explanation for the debacle, in Ms. Skocpol's view, is what she calls, borrowing a phrase from the historian Alan Brinkley, "Reagan's revenge" -- a political legacy that doomed the Clinton initiative from the beginning.
 The argument goes like this: For decades following the New Deal, the Republican right attacked the expanding Federal Government, but these attacks failed to topple the liberal order because the programs put forth by big Government -- particularly the huge entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare -- were widely popular. But then conservatives discovered a better approach; they attacked high taxes "and the politicans and 'bureaucrats' who spent them in supposedly 'wasteful' ways." These contentions fueled both the property tax revolts of the late 1970's and the 1980 election victory of Ronald Reagan. Mr. Reagan's large cuts in income tax rates, enacted in 1981, served to starve Federal programs of funds, rendering them ineffective and feckless. This in turn fueled voter cynicism about the capacities of government and the value of governmental programs. Mr. Reagan's political legacy was therefore a lingering sump of antigovernment sentiment, while his economic legacy was a Federal Government hobbled by an inadequate tax base. "By the time Bill Clinton got ready to run for the Presidency," Ms. Skocpol writes, "Americans' distrust of the Federal Government was at an all-time high."
 The result was that when Mr. Clinton designed his health plan he embraced the "managed competition" concept, which was designed to use market forces to promote efficiency and lower prices in health care delivery. An important element of the plan was a network of Government-regulated "health purchasing alliances" aimed at making it possible for small and medium-sized companies to purchase insurance at lower cost. Mr. Clinton relied heavily on regulation, on the theory that there was no political support for a less regulated system requiring higher taxes. Yet in promoting his plan, Ms. Skocpol notes, Mr. Clinton studiously avoided any serious discussion of the health purchasing alliances, because he feared an antigovernment backlash. Thus, he never successfully explained his plan to the American people and allowed his opponents to define it in negative terms. The President was caught in a double bind -- Reagan's revenge.
 Ms. Skocpol unabashedly suggests that Mr. Clinton should have ignored the Reagan legacy and proceeded as if the Reagan Presidency had never happened. "I conclude," she writes, "that President Clinton should have been less worried about pleasing deficit and budget hawks. He should have done what his conservative critics falsely charged him with doing -- acted more like a Democrat in the New Deal tradition, by combining new Federal regulations with generous subsidies to those affected." But perhaps Mr. Clinton, in fashioning his plan, understood a political reality that Ms. Skocpol doesn't want to acknowledge -- namely, that the New Deal is dead and gone, and that any health plan with any chance of success must incorporate that reality.
 Beyond that, Ms. Skocpol's analysis raises a fundamental question that goes to the heart of how history unfolds in our democracy: Did the New Deal die because Ronald Reagan was elected President? Or was Mr. Reagan elected because the New Deal had died? Was it really "Reagan's revenge" or merely the voters' wishes? Ms. Skocpol's view that the old days would have remained in place if only Mr. Reagan hadn't been elected is akin to the anti-Roosevelt view of the conservatives so zestfully twitted by Pat Moynihan back in 1976. Both are based on highly debatable premises about how American politics works. Nonetheless, it is Ms. Skocpol's perspective that gives her book its value. She adds a spirited outlook to the post-mortem debate over President Clinton's health care fiasco and its impact on American politics.

GRAND EXPECTATIONS
The United States, 1945-1974.
By James T. Patterson.
Illustrated. 829 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $35.
 A few months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Henry Luce called upon the American people to accept their responsibility as citizens of "the most powerful and vital nation in the world." The time had come, he wrote in Life, one of the flagships of his publishing empire, to exert "the full measure of our influence, for such purposes as we see fit" in the dawning "American Century." 
 This sentiment was hardly new. The belief that Americans had a mission to lead -- a special destiny -- was as old as the nation itself. Yet the challenges of World War II had turned this rhetoric into reality by placing the United States at the very center of the international stage. As Walter Lippmann, the nation's leading columnist, noted in 1945, "What Rome was to the ancient world, what Great Britain has been to the modern world, America is to be to the world of tomorrow."
 "Grand Expectations," by James T. Patterson, a professor of history at Brown University, is a spirited, sprawling narrative of American life in that "world of tomorrow," from the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945 to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Mr. Patterson enters a field so crowded with other books about modern America that the authors appear to be running out of titles. The "G" section on my alphabetized bookshelf already includes "Grand Illusions" and "Great Expectations." Is there need for another account, more than 800 pages in length? The answer, decidedly, is yes.
 Mr. Patterson's book is part of the multivolume Oxford History of the United States, which in 1989 produced "Battle Cry of Freedom," James McPherson's Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the Civil War era. A sweeping synthesis based entirely on secondary sources, "Grand Expectations" covers its subject in meticulous detail, beginning with a vibrant portrait of the nation in 1945.
 Only 50 years ago, Mr. Patterson reminds us, the United States was a very different place. The population contained a small and declining number of foreign-born, the result of strict immigration quotas installed in the 1920's. (Ellis Island would close for good in 1955.) Most blacks still lived in the South, where racial segregation was the law. Blue-collar workers outnumbered white-collar workers, and labor unions, led by charismatic figures like John L. Lewis and Walter Reuther, were at the height of their power. The first Levittown had yet to be built. Few couples got divorced. There were no supermarkets or shopping malls, almost no four-lane highways or air conditioning, no television or ball-point pens. More than half of the nation's farm dwellings had no electricity. Tobacco companies placed cigarette advertisements in medical journals.
 Traditional values were strong. Most Americans believed deeply in the virtues of organized religion, hard work and self-help. Yet their experiences in the Great Depression and World War II had made them more accepting of other ideas -- like a government safety net for the truly disadvantaged and a foreign policy that stressed serious (and sometimes expensive) involvement in places far from home. What worried most Americans in 1945 was the return of hard times as defense spending dropped and factory jobs disappeared. Could the United States handle the difficult reconversion from a wartime to a peacetime economy?
 These worries did not last long. As Mr. Patterson demonstrates, a combination of factors, including generous mortgage and college benefits lavished upon returning veterans, a surge of consumer demand after years of war rationing and the pathetic state of international competitors like England, Germany and Japan made a postwar depression almost impossible, a relic of the past. "The prosperity of the period broadened gradually in the late 1940's, accelerated in the 1950's and soared to unimaginable heights in the 1960's," Mr. Patterson writes. "By then it was a boom that astonished observers."
 Prosperity brought "grand expectations." For the growing middle class it meant advances in science and medicine, a home in the suburbs, a college education for the children, the abundant consumption of new products and America's unchallenged leadership in the world. For the millions below them it meant economic opportunity and expanded political rights.
 Covering enormous ground, Mr. Patterson weaves a narrative that includes everything from the battle against polio and the meaning of Alfred Kinsey's sexual studies to the rise of McCarthyism and the struggle for civil rights. Yet absent from "Grand Expectations" is the role of popular culture in American life. There is little of importance about movies or music, and almost nothing about sports. The book also ignores regional change, leaving Sun Belt and Far Western growth largely unexplored.
 Mr. Patterson is particularly adept at explaining the long-term consequences of events that have faded from public memory. In discussing the Korean War, for example, he reminds us that President Harry Truman set a modern precedent by sending American troops into battle without consulting Congress; that defense spending more than tripled between 1950 and 1953, rarely to fall again; that General Douglas MacArthur's insubordination served to reaffirm civilian control of the armed forces; that Chinese Communist involvement in the war forced the United States to guarantee Taiwan's future security; and that total victory -- an American tradition -- is not always possible in the modern, atomic world.
 Mr. Patterson's judgments are in line with the most recent scholarship of this era. Harry Truman is portrayed as a determined New Dealer and a tough anti-Communist who adequately filled Franklin Roosevelt's shoes. Dwight Eisenhower comes across as a strong, confident leader, committed to fiscal conservatism and limited government, yet determined to keep New Deal reforms mostly in place. John Kennedy is viewed as a fierce cold warrior, intensely competitive, with little interest and few accomplishments in domestic affairs. Lyndon Johnson is described as a "bread-and-butter" liberal who unwisely measured success in quantitative terms, from the number of people receiving new benefits to the number of North Vietnamese lying dead on the battlefield. An overbearing man, often a bully, he once surprised the Pope dur-ing a ceremonial gift-giving in Rome. The Pontiff handed the President a 14th-century painting; Johnson gave the Pope a bust of himself.
 Mr. Patterson's account of the 1960's, the pivotal decade of his book, is both grumpy and shrewd. He sees the intense divisions over national goals and traditional values as the natural outgrowth of postwar events. For one thing, the huge baby boom generation came of age in this decade, fueling permissive feelings about sex, drugs and divorce. For another, the well-publicized successes of the Southern civil rights movement encouraged other groups, like feminists, homosexuals and Native Americans, to make their own voices heard. Finally, the escalating conflict in Vietnam, part of the larger cold war struggle, undermined the Government's credibility and sapped its programs for the poor.
 A backlash was inevitable. Most Americans had supported a civil rights movement devoted to political equality and economic opportunity for individuals. They were "much less sympathetic," Mr. Patterson notes, "when people demanded the 'right' to social equality or special entitlements for groups." Furthermore, the public theater of the 1960's -- the posturing of Black Panthers, the violent demonstrations of privileged college students, the bold complaints of previously marginalized groups -- played into the hands of politicians like George Wallace and Richard Nixon, who claimed to speak for America's patriotic, hard-working "silent majority."
 Mr. Patterson ends his learned book with the self-inflicted downfall of Nixon, aptly described as the only postwar President who "never seemed to enjoy the job." In these final pages the White House is under a cloud and the economy is in trouble. Americans are less optimistic, their grand expectations dimmed by the painfully visible limits of progress. Yet for all of these troubles, Mr. Patterson concludes, the United States in 1974 "remained one of the most stable societies in the world," still com- mitted to hard work, equal opportunity and respect for the law. "These were among the many attitudes and values that flourished from 1945 to 1974 and that remained alive and well thereafter."

AMERICANS
A Collision of Histories.
By Edward Countryman.
294 pp. New York:
Hill & Wang. $25.
 What is an American? When J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur posed this question in his 1782 volume, "Letters From an American Farmer," he supplied an answer that has proved resonant over the generations. The American, Crevecoeur argued, represented a new composite race made up of different nationalities. According to this view, ethnic or cultural differences inevitably dissolved in the melting pot of the New World, producing a hybrid breed. 
 In recent years, the melting pot thesis has been challenged by those who say that America is not one culture but many cultures, each with a distinct identity and heritage. Multiculturalism has had a ripple effect through American society, affecting school curriculums, affirmative action programs and the academic culture wars. To its defenders, multiculturalism is just in its recognition of diversity; to its critics, it can become divisive and fractious.
 All too often, the debate over multiculturalism displays more spleen than reason. This is not true of Edward Countryman's new book, "Americans: A Collision of Histories." Mr. Countryman, a professor at Southern Methodist University and the author of several previous books on American history, offers a solid historical rationale for those who see the United States as a multistranded tapestry rather than a synthetic carpet. "I have not sought a spurious 'inclusivity' or 'multiculturalism' that merely mentions names," he announces in his introductory note. Rather, he provides a dispassionate history of different ethnic groups -- principally European whites, African-Americans and Native Americans -- during America's formative period, roughly from 1600 to 1900.
 His aptly worded title stresses that there is no single type that can be identified as American. There are instead Americans. Likewise, there is no single American history; there is "a collision of histories."
 His story of this collision is often unsettling. Especially moving is his rendition of the suffering of Native Americans. When whites arrived in the Americas in 1492, he reminds us, the aborigines in the hemisphere numbered perhaps as many as 100 million. Before long, this figure dropped about 90 percent, because of the disease, alcohol and uncontrolled slaughter that accompanied the arrival of Europeans. This "demographic disaster," Mr. Countryman writes, "has no equal in history, not even the Black Death." The plight of the Indians never improved during the period he covers. He tells the pathetic story of many once-proud nations and tribes forced steadily westward by the encroaching white settlers.
 He is equally strong on the bleak experience of African-Americans. Although in the early years blacks enjoyed a certain measure of independence, with the growth of slavery they were subject to widespread degradation in the South and increasing social ostracism in the North.
 More dramatically than previous historians, Mr. Countryman underscores the ironies associated with the unfair treatment of these and other oppressed groups. He points out that it was precisely in the half-century following the signing of the Declaration of Independence -- with its proclamation of human equality -- that actual inequality and injustice became particularly severe in America. Andrew Jackson's unremitting campaigns against Native Americans led to the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which sent the Cherokees and other tribes west into the Oklahoma Territory along the infamous Trail of Tears. The entrenchment of slavery and the passage of several pro-Southern laws impelled Northerners like William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips to bring attention to the terrible gap between America's egalitarian ideals and its heinous practices. A similar gap began to be perceived by many women, like those who gathered in 1848 in Seneca Falls, N.Y., at the landmark women's rights convention, where the most famous passage of the Declaration of Independence was pointedly rewritten: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal."
 While sensitive to social wrongs, Mr. Countryman avoids making a blanket indictment of the American mainstream. His book is not another expose of historical victims and their victimizers. He avoids painting any ethnic group in uniform colors. "There was no single way to be a slave," he writes, "any more than to be an Indian or a white." True, among the whites were oppressors and ravagers, but also among them, he points out, were canny inventors, dedicated workers and contributors to world thought. He demonstrates that Native American culture was remarkably varied too. Some Indians, like the Creeks in Alabama, took pride in their tribal heritage and tried to preserve it; others, like some Cherokees in Georgia, readily adopted Christianity and white laws. Some American blacks, likewise, clung to African folkways, while others, like Frederick Douglass, did their utmost to identify themselves as Americans.
 The picture of Americans that emerges in this book, then, is diverse in the best sense. In delineating the contours of the nation's ethnic makeup, Mr. Countryman avoids pat generalizations and political partisanship. Although he adds few new facts to the record, he innovatively synthesizes relevant, often unfamiliar information and presents it with disarming directness.
 To be sure, his bare-bones approach results in omissions and foreshortenings. One of the major "collisions" in American history took place when hundreds of thousands of European emigrants flooded to America's shores during the 19th century, creating enormous political shake-ups. Mr. Countryman offers statistics about the immigration issue but gives little sense of how the new foreign-born citizens lived or were treated. Similarly, even though he is generally perceptive about economic developments, he gives short shrift to the widening class divisions that spurred vigorous labor protests and utopian socialism during the antebellum period.
 What the book occasionally lacks in depth, however, it more than makes up for in breadth. Mr. Countryman rightly says that it would be "incredibly arrogant" of him to try "to write the whole history of my subjects." As it stands, "Americans" admirably provides what we have long needed: a compact, illuminating overview of the intricate strands of early American history.

DIVIDE AND RULE
The Partition of Africa, 1880-1914.
By H. L. Wesseling.
Translated by Arnold J. Pomerans.
Illustrated. 446 pp. Westport, Conn.:
Praeger. $75.
 It is a fact almost as remarkable as the event itself that for nearly a century after the imperial powers of Europe carved the continent of Africa into 47 territorial slices and served them out to one another like so many helpings at a banquet table, no comprehensive study of this historical phenomenon was published -- and then, in 1991, two appeared in quick succession. The first was by H. L. Wesseling of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Six months later there arrived Thomas Pakenham's monumental book "The Scramble for Africa." Although Mr. Wesseling won the race, so to speak, his book was in Dutch and so remained virtually unknown outside his own country. But now it is being published in English (in a capable translation by Arnold J. Pomerans) and will present a much wider audience with a useful counterpoint to Mr. Pakenham's better-known work. 
 The closeness of their original publication makes comparison all the more interesting, since it meant neither could influence the other. They cover the same events over a vast continental expanse in an amazingly compressed period of time, a mere 35 years from 1880 to 1914, but that is where the similarity ends. In both literary style and historical analysis, the two books differ sharply.
 Mr. Pakenham's is racier, more journalistic and, despite its greater length (738 pages compared with 446), more readable. Mr. Wesseling's is more scholarly, and somewhat drier for the nonspecialist reader.
 For Mr. Pakenham, the scramble was a feeding frenzy set off by the heroic death of the missionary-explorer David Livingstone, whose sun-dried body was returned to London for ceremonial burial in Westminster Abbey after he had issued a ringing call to the developed world to redeem Africa by the three C's -- commerce, Christianity and civilization. For Mr. Wesseling, who mentions Livingstone only in passing, there was no single trigger event and no general hypothesis to explain Europe's intervention in Africa. Instead, the partition was "the result of a series of independent and more or less 'accidental' decisions." For Mr. Pakenham, again, the race for territory was driven by a vision of Africa as an El Dorado, a huge new market and treasure house of raw materials, while for Mr. Wesseling, Africa was of little economic interest to the colonizers and "came low on the long list of preoccupations of contemporary politicians."
 The essence of Mr. Wesseling's analysis is that the partitioning of Africa was a sideshow that played itself out on the periphery of European geopolitics. The second half of the 19th century was a time of great transition in Europe. France suffered a crushing defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Germany emerged as the most powerful nation in Europe and the Ottoman Empire was in terminal decline, leaving its colonies in the Balkans and North Africa as vacuums waiting to be filled. To stabilize this situation, Otto von Bismarck called the European powers together for the Congress of Berlin in 1878.
 It has long been a popular assumption that this meeting was convened specifically to divide up Africa. Not so, says Mr. Wesseling. Its main purpose, he contends, was to sort out the affairs of the Balkans following Turkey's defeat at the hands of Russia in a war that had just ended. Bismarck also wanted to secure Germany against any future threats from Britain and France in the West and Russia in the East. The settling of colonial boundaries in Africa was a byproduct of these pressing European considerations.
 Thus Bismarck, anxious to placate the French after their painful loss of Alsace and Lorraine, prevailed upon Britain to allow France to take over the Ottoman colony of Tunisia. Meanwhile, an uprising in Egypt, where an Ottoman sultan had exercised suzerainty, caused Britain to step into that power vacuum. Once there, Britain felt impelled to secure the Nile, on which Egypt was totally dependent. This meant moving into the Sudan and ultimately on to East Africa. And so on.
 Mr. Wesseling's analysis is probably closer to the truth than the more popular theories of a systematic and planned process of occupation. Colonialism was certainly the spirit of the times and was obviously driven by capitalism's need for raw materials and new markets. But the reality of politics is that events tend to take place more haphazardly than the retrospective chroniclers would have us believe, with leaders compelled to weigh up competing options and interests at any given moment before making their decisions.
 Eschewing any broad explanation or hypothesis as he does, Mr. Wesseling paints for us a large canvas covered with intricate detail. It is a work of considerable scholarship if not easy reading. It will also not sit well with contemporary Africans, who view colonialism as the original sin that has precipitated nearly all their present-day woes. As Africans see it, colonization not only stripped them of their sovereignty and rent the fabric of their societies, but was also an exploitative system -- one that sucked out Africa's mineral and other wealth and left it without the broad-based development it now needs to sustain itself in the postcolonial world.
 They will not like Mr. Wesseling's assertion that in historical terms the colonization of Africa was a fleeting and not very damaging experience, that the colonizers were not able to reshape anything very much and that "in economic or social respects, colonization brought nothing essentially new." Nor will they like his observation that there was no significant African resistance to the conquest. "Local chiefs jostled one another to sell their 'sovereignty,' not for a mess of pottage but for more attractive things such as bottles of gin and uniforms," he writes stingingly. Mr. Wesseling also contends that for the most part Africans collaborated passively in their supposed oppression. "Without their collaboration colonial rule would not have been possible. . . . Even under colonialism Africans thus largely remained masters of their fate."
 That is a judgment that cuts across the heroic mythology that modern Africa has created for itself, and certainly goes too far in exonerating the imperial powers of all blame for Africa's current condition. That said, it is time Africans discarded the crutch of blaming the legacy of colonialism for all their ills and faced up to the fact of their own misrule and the extent to which they themselves are to blame for turning Africa into the most marginalized continent on earth.
 Nonetheless, this issue points up the one serious flaw in Mr. Wesseling's work. It is too Eurocentric in its approach. It may indeed be true that Africa was partitioned by Europeans acting exclusively in response to political events in Europe, but the book cries out for a perspective on how all this affected the Africans themselves. The nature of the colonial occupation meant that many African social and political institutions were broken down but little was put in their place. Arbitrarily drawn boundaries cut through tribal units and across demographic and geographic belts, rendering many of the territories incoherent and unviable as nation-states. To suggest, as Mr. Wesseling does, that the colonization of Africa was of little importance to Europe may be true. But it certainly had a profound and lasting impact on Africa.

FAT AND MEAN
The Corporate Squeeze of Working Americans and the Myth of Managerial "Downsizing."
By David M. Gordon.
320 pp. New York:
Martin Kessler Books/The Free Press. $25.
 Economics, as practiced in America, is laced with tradition and accepted wisdom. Standard theory is repeated and embellished in many convincing ways, and volumes of data are harnessed to demonstrate a fairly rigid set of mainstream views. Such a straitjacketed social science cries out for iconoclasts -- not naysayers, but skilled economists who take the same raw data and come up with different insights. When they do, they force open the debate over what is happening to the economy and to ourselves at work. 
David M. Gordon, a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York, was such an economist. He died in March at 51, just weeks before the publication of his last book, "Fat and Mean." He had not expected to die. Until a day or two before his death, he had been confident that a heart donor would be found in time and that after a successful transplant he would go on with his life as if he had been momentarily distracted by nothing more significant than an appendectomy. "Fat and Mean" rings with the tone of a man still warming to his case.
 The Gordon case is this: Standard economic theory has masked the most important reason for the stagnating incomes and the rising inequality of income levels that have plagued the nation for nearly 25 years. According to standard theory, the main culprits are low-wage foreign labor, global competition, not enough improvement in productivity and the abundance of unskilled Americans in an age of high technology that requires workers with ever greater aptitude and education. But the real malefactor, Gordon argues, is corporate America's approach to management.
 Rather than relying on a cooperative approach -- featuring raises and bonuses as "carrots" -- American corporations deploy a huge bureaucracy of bosses. This bureaucracy embraces what Gordon calls the "stick strategy," issuing commands, threatening dismissal for failure to obey and, in wielding its power, holding back wages for tens of millions of "nonsupervisory" workers. And the more wages are held down, the less the incentive for workers and the greater the need for supervisors to sustain performance.
 From this "fat" bureaucracy and its "mean" management style flow "the economic anxieties shared by scores of millions of Americans," Gordon writes. I don't know whether he is correct in drawing so broad a conclusion. He suggested this view before, most notably in "Beyond the Waste Land," written in 1983 with two other economists, Samuel Bowles and Thomas E. Weisskopf. These three, all highly trained in traditional economics -- Gordon, for example, a Ph.D. from Harvard, taught for a while at Yale -- came of age in the 1960's, and set themselves up as left-wing economists. But they engaged in the same data analysis and the same computer modeling as their mainstream counterparts, and out of their research came a different, less sanguine view of American capitalism -- what James Tobin, the Nobel laureate at Yale, once described approvingly as "left-wing political economy come alive."
 Since the late 1970's, Gordon gathered data for what is now his legacy. "Fat and Mean" offers more than enough evidence to force his view into the public debate as an antidote to the prevailing wisdom. In the hands of a Paul Krugman or a Herbert Stein or a John Kenneth Galbraith that almost certainly would happen. They are as skilled at writing for the general reader as they are at economics; Gordon didn't share those communications skills. One must have an affinity for statistical data, vivid as the data in "Fat and Mean" are, to get through this book. Fortunately, the first 100 pages tell most of the story.
 "Fat and Mean" is cast not as a polemic, though plenty of polemic slips through, but as a different twist on the same collection of statistics and research papers that other economists draw upon. Thus Gordon reports, accurately, that while layoffs have spread through white-collar and upper-level ranks, where managers reside, pink slips are still more numerous among blue-collar workers and their office equivalents. The ranks of the supervisors are thinning, but more slowly than those of their charges, and the ratio of the first to the second has risen, not fallen.
 Why this rise, just when downsizing and the participative workplace, featuring workers who manage themselves, have become so fashionable? Here Gordon's analysis is at its most original. The stick strategy, by its nature, requires ever more supervisors, starting with low-level supervisors who command only two or three workers. This is particularly the case when the incentive of rising wages is absent. And once in place, he argues, this bureaucracy tends to appropriate to itself a growing share of the national income earmarked for wages.
 While some economists offer various statistical measures that suggest that incomes have not really stagnated, Gordon has developed a different guidepost, called "real spendable hourly earnings," for production workers. This is the amount left in an average worker's pocket from his or her hourly wage, after stripping out income and Social Security taxes, adjusting for inflation -- and subtracting the wages that go to bosses. Since the early 1970's, that spendable hourly wage has fallen by nearly 1 percent a year. Gordon finds one central reason. An ever larger share of the national income has gone to the horde of supervisors, "almost entirely at the expense of production workers."
 Most economists argue over whether too much of the national income is going to profits rather than pay, or whether the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans are getting rich while the bottom 80 percent lose ground. They fail to note that supervisors are, in effect, taking money from the paychecks of their charges and, in the process, encouraging the sort of conflict and tension that undermines efficiency and productivity. This income shift, Gordon asserts, "is one of the best-kept secrets of the U.S. economy." His last act was to try to lift the secrecy.

HEADLINE: Developers Are Bullish On Wall Street

BYLINE: By ELLEN KIRSCHNER POPPER 

 BODY:
WHEN the union of two pivotal engineering achievements, the elevator and the steel frame, spawned the skyscraper at the close of the 19th century, the new form flourished in lower Manhattan. In 1911, intrigued by the potential to accommodate multiple uses in a single framework, Theodore Starrett of the Starrett real estate family proposed a 100-story tower to house industry, business, residences and a hotel in a self-contained vertical city. But the idea of living as well as working in lower Manhattan became the exception rather than the rule; the skyscrapers that were built downtown were monolithic "cathedrals of commerce."
Now Starrett's vision may be coming to pass. Less than a year after an incentive plan for residential conversions in lower Manhattan was approved by the State Legislature, at least 20 buildings are slated for alteration, and developers are mining the canyons of Wall Street for more. 
 Candidates for conversion range from Gothic skyscrapers considered obsolete by modern business standards to contemporary towers of glass and steel left vacant by economic downturns and corporate downsizing. Developers hope to make some buildings wholly residential, while others are planned for mixed use with stores, offices and parking on the lower, broader, floors and apartments in the slender towers. Plans are also underway for restaurants and retail shops.
Richard T. Kennedy, an associate director for Cushman & Wakefield's Wall Street office, estimated that construction would start on 1,200 to 1,800 residential units in lower Manhattan in the next year. But banks and other institutional investors are taking a conservative stance.
Not all buildings are suitable for conversion, according to architects and developers involved in the downtown plans. Certain architectural features are key in assessing a structure's residential potential. They are floorplate size, distance from window to core, natural light, ventilation and view. Drawbacks include facade problems like crumbling stonework or corroded curtain walls, inoperable windows and asbestos.
To determine economic viability, developers calculate the ratio of usable, meaning sellable or rentable, square feet to overall square feet. An abundance of windows allows for flexible apartment layouts, promoting efficient use of space.
In lower Manhattan, where there is a dense concentration of vintage skyscrapers, many buildings meet the requirements for successful residential conversion.
"Skyscrapers built between the 1890's and the 1940's are beautifully adaptable to residential use," said Carol Willis, author of "Form Follows Finance; Skyscrapers and Skylines in New York and Chicago" (Princeton Architectural Press, 1995). "They are naturals for conversion." Ms. Willis is seeking to establish a skyscraper museum in the district.
"Before the advent of fluorescent lighting and air-conditioning, buildings relied on natural light and air," she explained. "First-class office space had large, operable windows and a maximum distance of 28 feet from window to corridor wall."
A depth of 27 to 30 feet is considered optimum for new residential construction.
New York City's first skyscrapers rose skyward from Wall Street in unbroken planes. Standing cheek-by-jowl along the crooked, narrow lanes of old New Amsterdam, they produced the shadowy, windswept canyons that lend the district its distinct architectural flavor.
But while these turn-of-the-century towers may be closed in at street level, because they were built on angled streets they provide stunning views from above.
"Wall Street has a mixture of buildings," said Francis Greenburger of Time Equities, who is converting the Delmonico building at 56 Beaver Street to apartments that will be available in about two months and is also working on loft conversions at 47 West Street. "Some have spectacular views of the harbor and others are quite hemmed in. Some that seem closed in have architectural views, looking out on good buildings."
Many of Wall Street's commercial skyscrapers were built as architectural statements for corporations. They feature high ceilings, expansive lobbies, ornate materials and elegant architectural details.
"These buildings were built to service an affluent commercial tenant," said Paul Bentel, an architect who teaches preservation at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. "They were prime office space in today's terminology, corporate headquarters designed with incredibly beautiful lobbies and interior spaces and great views from the upper levels."
POSTWAR buildings have also been targeted for conversion. Their "wedding cake" setbacks are conducive to mixed-use conversions with residential units in the towers and commercial spaces in the base. Some of these buildings are empty, which makes asbestos removal easier.
At 25 Broad Street, a classical building whose facade is graced with fluted columns, an unusual Y-shaped footprint created an ideal layout for residential conversion, said Costas Kondylis of C.K. Architects, who is adapting the building for Bruce A. Menin of Crescent Heights Investments.
Known as the Broad-Exchange Building, the 525,000-square-foot edifice was first designed in late 1899 by the architect Robert Maynicke, to grandfather the site under a building code that was about to expire. The architectural firm of Clinton & Russell took over the project by 1901 and reorganized the plan. Both architects worked for a syndicate that included Henry O. Havemeyer, the sugar manufacturer and art collector; James Stillman, head of the National City Bank; and Henry Morgenthau, later the United States Ambassador to Turkey.
Mr. Kondylis is designing 345 rental units with luxury finishes that are to be available in about a year. Half will be one-bedroom units of about 800 square feet. The rest will be two- and three-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 1,032 to 1,500 square feet. The lowest ceilings are 10 feet, and five floors have 15-foot ceilings. All units have large, double-hung windows.
While the upper floors of the building were gutted, the marble-clad lobby, with its carved terra-cotta ceilings and palatial staircases, was kept intact. One elevator bank will be turned into a seating area and mail room. On the floors above, the elevator shafts will be made into laundry rooms and storage bins.
Mr. Kondylis called this "found space," explaining that office buildings require many more elevators and hallways than residential buildings because of the increased traffic that business generates.
Said Mr. Menin: "This will be one of the most luxurious residential lobbies in Manhattan. There was a different notion of space for commercial tenants, and now the residential tenant will benefit."
One-bedroom apartments are to start at $1,300 a month and two-bedroom units at $1,900.
Joseph Pell Lombardi, an architect who has adapted more than 75 commercial buildings to residential use throughout the city, lives in the walnut-paneled former board room of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Company on the 29th floor of 55 Liberty Street. From his spacious, airy apartment he can see the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River piers.
Mr. Lombardi converted the building to 89 co-op apartments in 1980 under the old tax abatement plan known as J-51. The tower was built in 1909 to the designs of Henry Ives Cobb, one of the first architects to adapt Gothic details to the new skyscraper form.
Mr. Lombardi is now converting the 15-story 33 Rector Street and the 27-story 11 Hanover Square into lofts for Tony Goldman of Goldman Properties, a developer who was instrumental in the renewal of SoHo and of South Beach in Miami.
Mr. Goldman plans to offer what he called "enhanced vanilla boxes," open lofts that "meet all code requirements in a well-secured, aesthetically pleasing, structurally solid, clean, elegant building." His market is "the new urbanites like me, who live and work in the same place and don't want walls put up for us," he said. The lofts will sell for between $150 and $250 a square foot.
"SoHo is now $350 per square foot and TriBeCa is $300," Mr. Goldman said. "The buying opportunity of this decade is in Wall Street."
"Now older office buildings are being converted but the trend will spread to newer ones; both are suitable," said Mr. Lombardi. "Office buildings in general are more adaptable than manufacturing buildings or warehouses because the infrastructure is newer and they are more geared to people."
For example, before World War II office buildings were built with a sink in almost every room. "The pipes are not right for bathrooms or kitchens but the shafts are there," he said. "You only need to add plumbing, and risers are not expensive."
As real estate speculation at the turn of the century accelerated, fear of increasingly sunless streets prompted passage in 1916 of the city's first zoning resolution, requiring buildings to have periodic setbacks so that light and air could reach the ground.
Office buildings constructed after 1916 lend themselves to mixed use, with retail and offices in the bottom floors and apartments in the towers.
The Hong Kong developer Li Ka-Shing has purchased 60 Broad Street, built in 1961, for mixed-use conversion. The 39-story curtain-wall building comprises one million square feet.
"The strategy," said Jonathan Coven of Concord Properties, a spokesman for the owner, "is to use the residential tax breaks to convert the tower floors to apartments and to use the lower floors for a big commercial tenant who needs lots of contiguous space."
Similar plans are being drafted for 127 John Street on behalf of Rockrose Development by the architect Avinash K. Malhotra.
"Asbestos removal takes a huge amount of money," said Thomas Elghanayan, a partner in Rockrose. "To do it properly you need to empty the building, redo it, and put it back together." This accounts in part for the wholesale abandonment of office buildings constructed in the mid-1970's, he noted.
ONCE the building is empty, as 127 John Street and others like it are, asbestos can be removed more economically. And renovating these buildings for residential use is far less costly than bringing them up to current commercial standards.
"There are at least half a dozen office buildings in lower Manhattan which are substantially vacant," said Merrill L. Roth, senior managing director of the Edward S. Gordon Company. Mr. Roth is also chairman of the Lower Manhattan Rental Conditions Committee of the Real Estate Board of New York.
Mr. Elghanayan said that the location of 127 John Street, on an open plaza across from the South Street Seaport where residential amenities like a supermarket, retail stores and restaurants are already in place, more than compensates for the building's drawbacks. "This building is the answer to skeptics who say that Wall Street has no shopping amenities and no light and air," he said. "You won't feel like you're in nowhere land."
When artists and other loft pioneers turned faltering manufacturing areas like SoHo and TriBeCa into chic residential enclaves, they did so in spite of existing zoning laws and municipal policies. But in lower Manhattan, where the commercial vacancy rate approaches 25 percent, the Giuliani administration is actively promoting conversions with tax abatements and zoning reforms.
The plan, which was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki on Oct. 29, 1995, provides a 14-year phased tax abatement program for conversion of office properties to residential use, 12-year phased tax abatement programs for commercial renovations and mixed-use conversions, a 12-year phased program of reductions in electric rates for commercial owners who make improvements costing at least 20 percent of their building's current assessed value, and an 8-year phased tax abatement program for construction of new buildings that are computer-ready.
The law also provides five-year phased abatement programs for real estate taxes and commercial rent taxes, applicable to newly leased space or renewals in commercial office properties built before 1975. To qualify for benefits, which must be passed on to tenants, owners must make a threshold investment to improve tenant space or common areas. These incentives come at a time when the residential real estate market is tight. Citywide, the vacancy rate is about one percent, the lowest in 15 years.
A pressing demand for new apartments combined with extraordinarily low prices for empty downtown office buildings and monetary inducements for conversions make Wall Street a favorable investment, real estate professionals say.
"People looked at residential conversions before," Mr. Kennedy noted, "but without the Giuliani plan they couldn't make the numbers work." Under the new tax benefit package, developers say they can produce stylish lofts and apartments at prices at least 20 percent lower than in more established neighborhoods uptown. But banks are reluctant to lend money in what they consider an untested market.
"The downtown incentives are the good news," said Rosina K. Abramson, a real estate lawyer in private practice in the downtown area. "The bad news is there is no financing." As a result, a segment of the real estate community that typically wants to invest up to one third equity and leverage the rest is cut out of the market, she added.
"I'm financing myself to some degree," said Mr. Goldman. "Banks have extended me letters of credit, I have mortgages on some smaller pieces and for the big stuff I'm using venture capital. It's early for the conventional lender."
A similar pattern emerged in SoHo, Ms. Abramson noted. "The first residential conversions in SoHo could not get financing," she said. "My sense is that there comes a tipping point when the banks will come in."
"From the point of view of lenders," said Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, which finances low and moderate income housing, "it is difficult to understand what 'comparable living' is and to make a judgment about financing.
"Banks want to know 'What will people pay?' " Mr. Lappin said. "To find out they see what people are paying down the street. But here there is no 'down the street' yet."
Mr. Lappin said the Community Preservation Corporation is working on a deal downtown because "if we can help to seed the market, that is a good role for us to take."
"It is consistent with our purpose," he added. "Once one project gets off the ground it will provide the basis for future financing."
Mr. Goldman said that "the conventional lender will be in the marketplace in a couple of years when there are comparables to give comfort." He added: "We are in the business of making the comparables."
Still, some real estate professionals are reserving judgment.
"I would love to see downtown succeed," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W & M Properties. "But in an old building every time you knock a hole in a wall you find a surprise. Unless a building is conservatively capitalized and has a significant equity investment, revenues may not meet expenses. This is the challenge investors face."
DEVELOPERS recognize that attractive apartments alone will not turn the Financial District into the urbane quarter that they envision. "A neighborhood doesn't just pop up," said Mr. Goldman. "It must be nourished, incubated, marketed and presented." Mr. Goldman is building a restaurant, the Wall Street Kitchen & Bar, at 70 Broad Street. The four-story stone building embellished with classical columns was built in 1908 as the headquarters of the American Bank Note Company, one of the nation's original printers of paper currency and stock certificates. The upper floors will house the new offices of Goldman Properties.
In addition, Mr. Goldman has purchased several small buildings in and around the newly designated Stone Street Historic District, including 15 and 17 South William Street, 85 Pearl Street "and a couple of others I can't mention," he said.
His intention is to generate "a firebox to ignite the neighborhood" by converting a row of low-scale warehouses into shops, restaurants and cafes to create what he called a "SoHo scene."
"Small buildings in a big area make the pedestrian more comfortable," he added. "They are embracing."
Mr. Goldman sits on the board of directors of the Alliance for Downtown New York, which manages a Business Improvement District formed by property owners to promote the neighborhood's turnaround. The area served extends roughly from City Hall to the Battery and from the East River to West Street.
Led by Carl Weisbrod, who formerly headed the New York State Economic Development Corporation, the Alliance lobbied forcefully for zoning revisions and tax abatements to spur redevelopment below Chambers Street. It is developing alternative sources of financing such as pension, investment and venture funds.
The executive director of the American Institute of Architects' New York Chapter, Carol Clark, said that for Wall Street to succeed "the city should be an aggressive advocate of mixed use, loosening up the rules to promote greater flexibility."
Amendments to the zoning code have been proposed to make allowances for mixed uses that the current "gray-flannel" zoning does not permit, said Joseph A. Rose, the chairman of the New York City Planning Department. Other zoning changes include reduction of the minimum unit size in older buildings from 1,800 square feet to 900 square feet on average.
"Wall Street is a vertical place," said Ms. Clark. "There is nothing analogous to it in form, except maybe Hong Kong, but the culture there is completely different. We have to encourage mixed use to insure that a vital residential community takes hold in this canyon atmosphere.
"The big problem downtown is about economics, not architecture."

AMERICAN ORIGINAL
A Life of Will Rogers.
By Ray Robinson.
Oxford University, $30.
In this pleasant, reverential biography, two scenes linger in the mind: Will Rogers in a small plane over Alaska, hours before he died at the age of 55; and the rugged cowboy philosopher lassoing a mouse with string. Maybe they stand out because they stray from the usual image. In "American Original," Ray Robinson presents the legendary Rogers: born in 1879 in the Indian Territory and one-quarter Cherokee, he grew up to become the nation's "poet lariat." Stage philosopher who poked fun at politicians while roping celebrities in the audience, movie star, newspaper columnist, he was even urged to run for President. Puritanical and oafishly unromantic ("My dear old pal," he wrote to his future wife during their courtship), he was also extraordinarily generous: he offered handouts to unemployed actors, paid Flo Ziegfeld's medical bills and gave vast sums to relief organizations during the Great Depression. The book does raise some questions -- for example, why did this political commentator apparently never vote? One wishes that Mr. Robinson, whose many previous biographical subjects include Lou Gehrig and Christy Mathewson, had dug deeper. Still, Will Rogers has plenty of surface worth writing, and reading, about. Carol Peace Robins

From Army Base to a Step Toward Home Ownership

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: SHOREHAM

 BODY:
AN experiment in helping people get off public assistance and into home ownership is under way on a quiet dead-end street of 16 two- and three-bedroom ranches built here in the 50's to house Army personnel.
The houses, on Defense Hill Road, were recently purchased by the nonprofit Community Development Corporation of Long Island (C.D.C.). They are being rented to families earning no more than $30,000 a year, who get rent subsidies under the Federal Section 8 program. 
 The nonprofit group's goal is to enable all the families to own their house within five years by providing support services that include job training and money management. The first five tenants moved in this weekend.
Defense Hill Road, which is about a quarter mile east of the William Floyd Parkway, leads from Route 25A to a 27-acre park on its north end that is owned by the Town of Brookhaven.
The park, where model airplanes are now flown, at one time had been a Nike missile site. The Army dedicated the property to the town in the 70's. But the 6.3 acres on which the 16 houses stand remained in Government hands until May 30 when, following a sealed-bid process, the property was purchased for $560,000 by the C.D.C., which was the high bidder.
The group, which has offices in Centereach and Babylon, was created in 1969 as the Suffolk Community Development Corporation to develop housing solutions for low- and moderate-income families. The name was changed last year.
Among other functions, it is the Suffolk County administrator of the Section 8 program for New York State. It has also developed houses for first-time buyers under various affordable-housing programs, and plans to build a 36-unit housing-for-the-elderly project in the Village of Amityville.
As part of its Section 8 responsibilities, the group also runs the Federal Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which teaches participants to attain economic independence.
The voluntary program provides families with career counseling, job training and placement, child care, budget counseling, and personal counseling among other benefits. Families are counseled on how to pay off their debts and how to establish a good credit history. The 16 families who will move to the Defense Hill Road project were selected from the roughly 250 families enrolled in the program.
Wilbur Klatsky, president of C.D.C., said the Defense Hill Road endeavor would be a practical demonstration that, given support and motivation, people could turn around their lives.
"You are doing a real disservice to people if you force them to stay in subsidized housing forever," he said. "What we are trying to do is allow people to extricate themselves from poverty and become productive members of our society, both financially and socially."
The 16 houses, which had been vacant but always maintained by the Army, are receiving a basic overhaul. Broken pipes are being repaired and new roofs, new cesspools and new sheds are being installed, along with new front doors. When the families are ready to purchase their houses, each will receive a new kitchen and a new bathroom.
The site is surrounded by dense woods, owned in part by the town and in part by the Long Island Lighting Company. The bright and airy houses occupy quarter-acre lots, and except for a sign at the entrance to the enclave that still reads "U.S. Government Property," they look like dwellings in any typical suburban subdivision.
The EAB bank of Uniondale gave the C.D.C. a $632,000 loan at 8.57 percent interest and payable in five years for the $560,000 acquisition and for legal and other costs. The nonprofit group is investing $168,000 of its own funds for repairs and road improvements that it promised the town it would make.
THE $10,000 cost of a new kitchen and bathroom is expected to be covered by a Federal loan that will be forgiven after the house has been owned for 10 years.
Although families initially will pay the C.D.C. only 30 percent of their income in rent under the Section 8 program, the Government will pick up the difference between that figure and $1,285 monthly for the three-bedroom house, and $885 monthly for the two-bedroom house. The rents will cover operating costs.
The houses are priced at $55,000 for the two-bedroom dwelling and $60,000 for the three-bedroom residence. In addition, there will be a $25,000 second mortgage placed on each house, which will only have to be paid if the house is resold within 10 years of ownership.
After 10 years, the $25,000 loan is forgiven. EAB will also provide mortgage loans to families, with down payments as low as 3 percent.
"Defense Hill Road will be an important example of how government, community groups and financial institutions can work together to save taxpayers money by assisting people in becoming self-sufficient," said Robert J. Klein, an EAB vice president.
Down payments will not be a major problem, said Marianne Garvin, the executive vice president of C.D.C., because families enrolled in the Family Self-Sufficiency Program build up savings in an interest-bearing escrow account.
The savings are attained, she explained, by the fact that rent increases the family would have to pay if its income rises are put into the escrow account. Once a family completes the five-year commitment to stay in the program, the escrow money is turned over to it. If the family drops out before the five years are up, it forfeits those savings.
Among the first five families moving into the Defense Hill Road houses are Diane Wood, 36, and her two daughters, Christine, 14, and Danielle, 12.
Separated from her husband in 1983 after three years of marriage, and later divorced, she was forced to seek Section 8 assistance so that she could afford a decent place to live, Ms. Wood said. She has been enrolled in the Family Self-Sufficiency Program since 1993.
SHE said she had earned an associate degree in accounting in 1989 at Suffolk Community College in Brentwood, and four years later received a bachelor's degree in business administration at St. Joseph's College in Patchogue, going to night school while working days. She recently began working as an accounting clerk for the Town of Huntington and now earns $24,000 a year.
"This deal is a wonderful opportunity because without it I don't think I could ever have afforded a house on Long Island with what I'm making," said Ms. Wood of the Defense Hill Road project.
Now she hopes to close on the two-bedroom house she selected within a year, using the $2,800 she has accumulated in her escrow account for a down payment.
"I look at this as a jump start in my life," said Jolene Novak who, with her husband, Frank, and their three children ranging in age from 6 to 8 will occupy one of the three-bedroom houses on Defense Hill Road.
Mrs. Novak works as a medical assistant, but her husband, a construction worker, is unemployed. Nevertheless, Mrs. Novak said, she hopes that they will be able to purchase their house within two years.
The Novaks signed up for the Family Self-Sufficiency Program three years ago because, Mrs. Novak said, "we wanted something better for our children than being on Section 8."
The story "still to be told," said Mr. Klatsky of the C.D.C., will have to wait another seven years or so.
"We have the sense that when we come back then to revisit Defense Hill Road we will be amazed at what these people will have achieved in contributing to the community," he said, "giving back in taxes, and making better lives for their children."

A Full-Service Hotel for Mount Olive's Trade Center

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WORK has begun on a 141-room full-service hotel at the International Trade Center in Mount Olive in Morris County -- a first for the 670-acre multi-use business park off Exit 25 of Interstate 80.
The five-story Wyndham Garden Hotel, three years in the planning and estimated to cost $14 million, is expected to be completed within a year. The developers are the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Rockefeller Group, and Leslie E. Smith Jr., a builder and the center's executive director, who are also developing the Trade Center. 
 It will be managed by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, the Dallas-based national hotel company that owns and operates 66 lodgings, including the 41-hotel Wyndham Garden chain.
The project reflects New Jersey's improving hotel industry, which has shaken off its recessionary doldrums to see occupancy and room rates rise. But since financing for new construction remains somewhat tight, especially for full-service hotels, it is being built with state, Federal and private funds.
"Three years ago we made a commitment to get this project done and at the time the public assistance was essential," said Jonathan D. Green, president and chief executive of the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation. "It is an easier financial picture today, but it's purely speculative whether we could have put it together today without government assistance."
The developers received a $6.5 million loan from Skylands Community Bank of Hackettstown and the Operating Engineers Local 825 Annuity Fund and Pension Fund; the New Jersey Economic Development Authority is guaranteeing $1.5 million of the loan. The developers also secured $1.5 million in Federal funds under a program that offers incentives to create jobs for low- and moderate-income people. The rest will come from the developers' own equity.
At the ground-breaking on June 18 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman stressed public and private partnerships in spurring economic development. "I am eager to see the International Trade Center realize its enormous potential for creating good jobs, permanent jobs, New Jersey jobs," she said.
Estimates are that the new hotel will create about 200 construction jobs as well as 60 permanent ones. Because Hackettstown, a neighboring Warren County community, was instrumental in securing the Federal grant, the permanent jobs will be offered first to residents of that town.
While there have been, and continue to be, a smattering of lodgings built in the last two years, few have been full-service hotels like the one begun at the Trade Center. Lenders generally have an investment ceiling of $5 million on the loans they make available, said Patrick Ford Sr., president of National Hotel Realty, a research firm in Portsmouth, N.H. Loans for more, he said, are more difficult to secure.
Lenders also require at least 20 to 30 percent equity participation from builders, and it still costs less to buy an existing hotel than to build a new one, said Mark V. Lommano, executive director at Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville Tenn., which reports on the market for hotel companies nationwide.
As a result the trend in new development in New Jersey and the nation has been toward economy, limited-service and all-suite hotels because lower construction costs are easier to finance, Mr. Ford and other analysts said. Typically, they do not have the large restaurants, ballrooms shops and abundance of meeting rooms found in traditional, full-service lodgings.
Among hotels not offering full-service facilities that are now under way or planned in New Jersey is the 134-suite hotel that Summerfield Hotel Corporation of Wichita, Kan., is building on Route 10 in Hanover. It is on that town's side of the 600-acre, 1.5-million-square-foot Prudential Business Campus that straddles the Parsippany/Hanover border.
In another project, Prime Hospitality Corporation of Fairfield signed a ground lease on June 19 with Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus to build a 159-room AmeriSuites hotel. It is to rise over the next year in the mixed-use Harmon Meadow development, which has more than 2 million square feet of office and retail space as well as five hotels. Harmon Meadow is in the Secaucus Meadowlands, which Hartz has almost completely built out.
IN Jersey City, Garden State Development of Jersey City continues to package its proposal for a full-service hotel a block from its hometown's waterfront. The developer had been negotiating for $9.3 million in public funds for the project, but "we just could not come to an agreement on the terms," said Peter G. Mangin, president of Garden State.
Nevertheless, he said, Garden State will proceed with the project, though it has been scaled back to 147 rooms from 245 and its cost reduced to $18.5 million from $40 million.
Mr. Mangin said financing would come from the partners and several lending institutions. Construction is to start by year's end.
The development activity, industry analysts said, is being nudged along by an improving economy. A rise in tourist and corporate travel, the latter in spite of cutbacks and restructurings, over the last two years has resulted in an increased demand for rooms at a time when there has been little new construction. Statistics kept by the New Jersey Hotel and Motel Association in Trenton show that the state's supply of 90,000 hotel and motel rooms relatively unchanged since 1994.
Over the last 12 months ending in April the state's lodging occupancy rate was 68.09 percent, up from 67 percent for the same period a year earlier, according to Smith Travel Research. The national rate was 65.8 percent. At the same time, daily room rates in New Jersey hotels averaged $75.42, up from $72.70 a year earlier; in the nation it was $68.71, up from $65.22.
Indications are that both the state and national markets will continue to build momentum into 1997, said John A. Fox, senior vice president at PKF, a Manhattan-based hotel and real estate consulting firm.
Meanwhile, developers of the International Trade Center feel the time is right for the Mount Olive project. When built it will be the only full-service hotel in the area.
"We needed a critical mass to support the hotel," said Mr. Green, of the Rockefeller Development Corporation. With the center's population nearly tripling to 4,300 workers in 35 concerns over the last year and a half it "has come of age," he said. Of the 7 million square feet of space planned at the center, about half is built and occupied.
THE Wyndham Garden Hotel, which will surround an open garden, has been designed to cater to individual business travelers and small business groups. It will have 3,723 square feet of meeting space, a 60-seat restaurant, lounge, a pool, a health club and parking for 248 cars. The daily corporate room rate will be $80 to $100.
Leslie V. Bently, president of the Wyndham Garden Hotel Division, said the Mount Olive site was an "opportunity" to do new construction because "the corporate infrastructure is in place and the market has an undersupply of rooms." This is the second hotel for the company in New Jersey, but its first new construction. Its other hotel, with 210 rooms in Piscataway, was a renovation.
Mr. Smith, executive director of the trade center, said signed commitments were in place with two major corporations for about 25 percent of the Wyndham Garden rooms for five years. He said he expected the hotel to be busy on weekends with demand for social functions from about 400,000 people living within a 15-mile radius of the site and from visitors to the nearby Waterloo Village historic and cultural center.

Hartford and New London Recycle Space for Artists

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
TWO derelict buildings, one in Hartford and the other in New London, are in different stages of restoration to provide housing at a moderate cost solely for artists, writers and musicians.
In so doing, the developers say they are salvaging worthwhile architecture and offering better homes than most of the targeted tenants could otherwise afford. 
 Hartford officials hope that the project will also help regenerate the city core. "It's a critical part of downtown," said Mayor Michael Peters. "We've designated a 20-block arts and cultural center near the Union Place railroad station, and this will create activity in the western end that pulls the whole thing together."
Artspace, as the project is called, is scheduled to open early in 1998. Design work has begun on a $5.9 million renovation of the four-story, 84,000-square-foot abandoned industrial building at 555 Asylum Avenue. The open floor spaces of the 1910 structure will be divided into 45 apartments where tenants may work as well as live -- a dual use that zoning laws often prohibit. Kai Soo Kim, principal of Kai Soo Kim Partners, a Hartford architecture firm, is the designer.
A state grant of $150,000 and a Federal loan of $600,000, plus city tax abatements of one-third over a 15 year period are in place. In addition, the state's Housing Finance Authority is considering low-income-housing tax credits amounting to $3.85 million and Fleet Bank has submitted a nonbinding letter of intent to supply a $1.4 million first mortgage to the developers, Artspace Hartford Limited Partnership.
In New London, the renovation of Sapphire House, a Granite Street mansion built in 1929 by Benjamin L. Armstrong, co-owner of a silk mill, has almost been completed. Five of the 10 apartments in the project, which has been entirely paid for by private donations, are already occupied.
The building was purchased for $150,000 in 1994 by the nonprofit Griffis Art Center on Pequot Avenue. An additional $250,000 was spent on restoration and renovation. According to Sharon Griffis, director of the center, "the building is now appraised at $960,000."
Its one- and two-bedroom apartments -- one with a 30-foot living-dining room, another with two bay windows, and still others with the original marble sinks in the bathrooms -- rent for $450 to $600 a month, including utilities, plus $25 to $60 a month for optional basement storage.
"I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I moved here from New York," said Robin Hornbuckle, a freelance magazine writer who was the first tenant to move in while renovations were under way more than a year ago. "This is the smalltown life I always wanted."
Anne Seelbach, a painter who exhibits at the Kouros Gallery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, had been paying $900 a month in Brooklyn for a one-room apartment where "I went to bed breathing paint and turpentine all night," she said. She moved into Sapphire House in May and said she didn't know yet "whether or not I feel isolated."
"New York drives me nuts but I need to be there," she said.
A third resident is Lou Bonamarte, another painter who moved in when his lease in Old Lyme expired. "I have a lot of light and the apartment is bigger than I'm used to," he said. "It reminds me of a time when artists lived in boarding houses like the Florence Griswold in Old Lyme," a reference to what is now the Old Lyme Historical Society Museum, which is filled with American Impressionist paintings.
IN Hartford's Artspace, the one- to three-bedroom apartments, with 1,095 to 1,587 square feet of space, will be rented only for the first 15 years and income limits will be imposed.
Of those who will occupy Hartford's Artspace, 36 households must have incomes of no more than 60 percent of the Hartford area's median of $44,800 for a couple or $55,600 for a family of four; four must be at or under 50 percent of the median and the remaining five households must be at or under 25 percent of the median.
According to Marc S. Levine, a partner in Artspace and a West Hartford developer, the units will rent initially for about $550, $650 and $750 a month, respectively, including utilities, for the three different income levels.
After 15 years the tenants will be invited to buy the apartments and form a co-op. Prices will be commensurate with their incomes, said Mr. Levine. "The investors' fund or group will receive tax credits of about $600,000 a year for 10 years," he said.
"This is an incentive for artists to stay and eventually have an equity position," said Peter DeWilde Shapiro, a Hartford lawyer and a second partner in Artspace. Elie Pallandre, the third partner, is president of the real estate consulting firm in West Hartford that bears his name.
Mr. Shapiro's daughter, a performing artist in St. Paul, Minn., brought to his attention Artspace Projects of Minneapolis, which is now affiliated with Artspace Hartford. Over the last 15 years 300 apartments have been created in Minneapolis, and now St. Louis and Atlanta have projects of their own.
Plans envisioned by Mr. Kim and the partnership include restoring the building's brick exterior, installing 90 parking spaces and a small garden on the property, creating practice rooms for musicians as well as extra studio space for welders and potters, and providing a black-box theater and an art gallery in the building.
The Hartford Stage Company, Hartford Ballet, Hartford Symphony, Wadsworth Atheneum, Bushnell Hall and other members of the city's arts community view the project favorably. But Will K. Wilkins, director of Real Art Ways, an avant garde visual and performing arts center in Hartford for almost 30 years, is skeptical about what he calls "the use of the arts to revitalize downtown."
"That worked in the 70's," he said, "but during the 80's real-estate boom arts organizations were moved out to make way for office buildings, and the city had a great exodus of artistic talent. If the arts are used as marketing again, what happens when the city gets vital again?"
Larry A. Smith, dean of the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford, thinks that "it's possible that symphony and ballet professionals in the area might want to put down some roots, but artists tend to be a fairly mobile group."
FOR the last 15 years a number of artists have inhabited spaces in the former Colt firearms building -- first as studios, then as work/living spaces. Today these quarters make up about a fourth of the 155 occupied spaces in the half-vacant, 755,000-square-foot, 20- building complex, with the remainder of the occupied areas used primarily for light industry. The work/living spaces rent for $625 to $1,200. "We are trying to secure funding to demolish some nonlandmarked buildings and make this into an artists' community," said David Richard, manager of the property for its owner, Water+Way Properties of Hartford.
"Arts and entertainment is becoming a serious idea," said Robert Hankins, executive director of the Hartford Arts Council, and former director of five arts councils across the country.
"It's a lot cheaper for an artist or arts company to live and work in Hartford and still do business in New York and Boston. There is art and history here to build on for tourism -- a niche midway between those two cities that Hartford hasn't developed a strategy for yet."

HEADLINE: Renewing The Loft Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thank you for your balanced story on the renewal of the loft law [May 19]. It highlighted the contribution of sweat equity, money and creativity by loft tenant/artists and explained how renewing the loft law and preserving this productive sector of our economy will help downtown Manhattan continue to be a vibrant, mixed-used community. But please let us clarify: 
 Loft dwellers' average base rent is far higher than cited because loft tenants bear so many costs other tenants don't. These often include heat, hot water, electricity, repairs (internal and external), water taxes and maintenance duties.
You didn't mention that the law allows landlords a 20 percent rent hike en route to code compliance. This is in addition to the owner's right to pass along the cost of compliance work to the tenant in a restructured rent.
About Jesse Bryant's letter [June 2]: Has the writer considered what the value of these then-derelict buildings in downtown New York would be today if loft tenants hadn't come along and fixed them up at their own expense? The self-sufficient efforts of these artists/tenants created neighborhoods like SoHo and TriBeCa, which are now world-class tourist destinations. Rather than be a drain on New York these pioneers have helped create a booming art and cultural market that brings in billions of dollars in revenues annually to the city and state.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Accounts That Give Piggy Banks a Run for the Money

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
WHEN Alana Miller was 11, she decided that if she wanted to go to college, she had to start saving her baby-sitting money and weekly allowance.
A neighbor in Massillon, Ohio, told her that a Key Bank branch in nearby Canton had a program geared for children. Youngsters who opened and maintained an account could earn model dinosaurs and recognition in a national newsletter mailed to other "Dinosavers." 
 In 18 months, thanks to interest and additional deposits, Alana's initial deposit of $20 has grown to almost $300, she has received two dinosaurs and has become a member of the Key Bank Youth Advisory Council, whose young members advise the bank on how it can appeal to children.
"When I save at home, I end up spending the money," Alana said. "It's safer there, at the bank."
Many banks have long made it easy for children to open savings accounts, by waiving minimum balances and service fees. For the most part, industry experts say, the banks are still doing so today, even as pressure to cut costs is leading many of them to establish or raise fees and minimums on adults' accounts.
The banks are not simply being benevolent toward children. Rather, the savings programs and special treatment are marketing strategies intended to pay off in both the short and the long term.
Children who learn to save at the bank, the reasoning goes, will continue to do so as adults. In the meantime, the children's parents will see the bank as family-friendly, with something for everyone. Scrapping the children's accounts, or burdening them with fees, could give the bank a Scrooge image.
"It's good business sense, and it's good customer relations," said Patricia Boerger, spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association in Washington. "This helps build a loyal, long-lasting relationship. Many people reach adulthood, but they don't know about savings. They charge, charge, charge."
The most recent Commerce Department figures, for the first quarter of this year, show that Americans save less than 4 cents of every dollar; in 1970, it was 8 cents. By comparison, the savings rate in Japan is 15.3 percent and in Canada, 8.3 percent.
In an effort to increase saving, bankers are working with the A.B.A. Education Foundation to present consumer education programs for adults and children, teaching them to become "more financially literate," said the foundation's chairman, Lloyd Lyons.
Of the 32,000 presentations last year, the foundation said that more than half were focused on children. The programs, often developed with local school officials, should be considered a community service, Mr. Lyons said, though he acknowledged they were "not without some marketplace orientation."
"Part of financial management habits are developed early in life, so kids are a target," said Mr. Lyons, who is also a first vice president of First Chicago NBD Bank in Indianapolis. "I don't think it can be done too early."
Key Bank's Dinosavers program, geared toward children 5 to 13 years old, lets them open accounts with as little as $10 at 1,300 branches in 11 states. An adult would need $50, with varying minimum balances to avoid fees.
Each deposit in a child's account is rewarded with a dinosaur sticker "to encourage savings behavior," said Eric Chester, vice president of retail investment product management for Cleveland-based Keycorp, Key Bank's parent.
After nine deposits of $10 or more, the child's name is published as a Super Dinosaver in a newsletter that reaches more than 100,000 households. Children who make regular deposits are rewarded with the model dinosaurs produced by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. Though the balances are generally smaller than in an adult's account, and thus more costly to the bank, the children's accounts nonetheless receive the same interest rate.
"It's part of our strategic plan for the future," Mr. Chester said. "If a young family is driving by, they see that we have products and services for the whole family."
At the Republic National Bank of New York, the Bank for Kids program has more than 40,000 participants. Children aged 17 and younger can open an account with only $2. Each receives a membership card, a quarterly newsletter, an annual birthday card and the same interest rate as for an adult savings account, which was 2.75 percent last week, said Irene Ferrall, the bank's associate managing director. An adult would need $100 to open a savings account and would need to maintain a minimum balance of $500 to avoid a monthly fee.
"We want children to learn the value of savings and to be familiar with the banking environment and not intimidated by it," she said.
These young savers may also start thinking about banks in terms of loans and business propositions.
In Leavenworth, Kan., second-grade classes have been receiving "cookie loans" from the Army National Bank the last 10 years, to help finance their bake sales.
This year, students from MacArthur Elementary School in Leavenworth toured the bank, heard a lecture on fiscal responsibility and signed the papers for a collective $30 loan. The students used the money to buy ingredients and hold their sale. With the proceeds, they repaid the loan, including interest, and decided how to spend the profits. After the loan was repaid, each student received a certificate signed by the bank president.
The bank also offers a savings presentation to teach students about concepts like interest and Federal deposit insurance.
Credit unions are also getting into the youth market with programs that encourage savings. Some have set up shop in high schools with student managers, said Jerry Karbon, a spokesman for the Credit Union National Association in Madison, Wis.
"We want to encourage young people to save and not to put everything on a credit card," Mr. Karbon said. "We look at some of these programs as training grounds. Maybe these students will stay with it and we'll find them as tellers or managers in a credit union someday."
THE youth program of the D. Edward Wells Federal Credit Union in Springfield, Mass., began in 1988 and now has 2,000 members. Students act as clerks and tellers for their transactions, have board meetings and make loans to each other. They are taught to balance a checkbook, understand stock investments and to budget money for charity.
Shaheed Harris, a 16-year-old high school junior, opened an account 18 months ago with $10 and has now saved $170. He serves on the youth program's board and makes presentations to other students about financial issues. "I've been taught about stocks and bonds," he said. "It's basically training you about the business world."
Alana Miller has jumped into the world of high finance, too. The American Banker newspaper recently published a picture of a key that she drew for Key Bank, bearing the slogan, "This is your key to the future." Her idea to enhance the Dinosaver newsletter with a dinosaur-drawing contest is under consideration. But she probably won't use her savings to get a business degree.
"It's interesting," she said of the banking business. "But I'd rather be a teacher."

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Bank Funds Still Popular

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
The recent spate of bank mergers has reduced the number of bank-sponsored money market mutual funds. The funds, however, are increasingly popular with bank customers, according to a study by IBC's Money Fund Report in Ashland, Mass.
This year, 14 funds have closed. That leaves 468 bank money funds holding $175.1 billion in assets, more than a fifth of all money fund assets. Assets of all money funds had grown 6.7 percent as of mid-May, but those of bank money funds had grown 8.3 percent. 
 Tracy Burk, editor of the Money Fund Report, said, "As demand for money funds continues to strengthen and more banks focus on business lost in traditional bank products, it is likely that bank-sponsored funds will become even more of a force."
 
Lowering the Fees: The Next Generation
The apple never falls far from the tree, the saying goes, and that's the case now with John C. Bogle Jr., son of the chairman of the Vanguard Group, the fund company long known for its insistence on minimal fees and expenses.
The younger Mr. Bogle has left the Quantitative Group of funds, where he had managed Quantitative Numeric and Numeric II, to start his own fund group in Cambridge, Mass. The reason: He was unhappy with the expenses charged by the Quantitative Group. The Numeric funds carried back-end loads of 1 percent plus a continuing 12b-1 marketing fee of one-half of 1 percent. Because 12b-1 fees cover marketing expenses and are meant to let funds increase in size -- to create savings based on economies of scale -- he contended that it was particularly inappropriate to assess such a fee on a fund that no longer accepted new investors.
His new group, called the ni group, consists of no-load funds, and expenses for each fund are capped at 1 percent. The ni Micro Cap fund invests in domestic equities with capitalizations of $100 million to $1 billion; ni Growth is a domestic small-cap fund that invests in companies with capitalizations up to $1 billion, and larger companies with above-average earnings growth rates, and ni Growth and Value invests in the largest 1,000 American companies.
 
A New Fund
Meyers, Sheppard & Company of Beverly Hills, Calif., has introduced the Meyers Sheppard Pride fund, an open-end, no-load, diversified fund that will seek long-term capital appreciation by investing in what it sees as undervalued, fundamentally sound companies with progressive policies toward the gay and lesbian community.
 
New Managers
Edmond D. Villani, president and chief investment officer of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, will assume the newly created office of chief executive tomorrow. Mark S. Casady, deputy chairman of Scudder's United States mutual fund group, becomes director of United States mutual funds.
 Derek Webb, who runs GT Global Natural Resources and GT Consumer Products, has picked up the lead manager position at Global America Growth from Kevin Wenck, who has left the firm.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Volkswagen Passat TDI;
Knock, Knock. Who's There?

BYLINE: By JEFFREY J. TARAS 

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich.

 BODY:
THEY are called "oil burners," and you can hear them coming before they arrive. The frugal diesel engine, an 1892 invention of the German engineer Rudolf Diesel, has been embraced by thrifty Europeans since the first diesel passenger car, the Mercedes-Benz 260D, was introduced in 1936.
But the efficient, cacophonous, long-running diesel engine never really caught on in the United States, where gasoline has been cheap and plentiful. Now, after nearly disappearing from American roads, the engine is making another run at this country under the hood of the Volkswagen Passat TDI, which stands for "turbocharged direct injection." Available in Passat sedans and wagons, the 1.9-liter four-cylinder TDI engine differs in many respects from conventional diesels. 
 The engines operate by compressing intake air to high pressures before injecting fuel into the combustion chamber. This generates high internal temperatures, which cause the fuel to burn spontaneously without the spark plugs and ignition systems of gasoline engines. Though efficient, the diesel combustion process is also noisy, a chief reason most people won't accept diesel engines in their cars.
The TDI is a gentler engine that goes a long way toward quieting a diesel's clatter while sharply raising the efficiency of an already efficient design. Volkswagen disdains the separate combustion "pre-chamber" used for years on indirect-injection diesels. The pre-chamber was used to first combine fuel and air before passing it into the cylinders for combustion. This two-stage process helped to quiet the engine but reduced its efficiency. Doing away with the pre-chamber might have led to an unacceptably loud engine, yet the TDI is fairly quiet and well-mannered, thanks to a two-stage injection process in which two precisely metered amounts of fuel are infused as mists directly into the cylinder. Injecting fuel twice mimics the quieting effects of the pre-chamber without sacrificing efficiency.
Precise fuel delivery is handled by electronic controls that help to enhance performance and reduce exhaust emissions. The Passat TDI produces 20 percent less carbon dioxide than a comparable gas engine would, and it meets the emissions requirements of all 50 states.
Diesel engines use a fuel similar to home heating oil. Diesel is typically priced slightly higher than regular unleaded gasoline (it is selling in Manhattan for about $1.45 a gallon, midway between regular and premium grades). Though widely available at truck stops across America, diesel can be difficult to find at urban and suburban filling stations. But with the Passat's driving range of nearly 850 miles on a tank -- greater than the distance from New York City to Chicago -- fill-ups aren't needed often.
All in all, Volkswagen's TDI variation on the diesel theme results in an engine that is surprisingly powerful as well as remarkably efficient. Although it has just 90 horsepower, the 149 foot-pounds of torque allowed the five-speed test car to move smartly from a stop and to dart in and out of traffic. What's more, the four-door, family-sized car returns impressive fuel economy. The Environmental Protection Agency figures that the Passat TDI is capable of 37 m.p.g. around town and 45 m.p.g. on the open road.
To put this frugality in perspective, consider the 39/43 rating of the Geo Metro sedan, which weighs two-thirds as much and has a tiny a 1.3-liter gas engine.
But stellar fuel economy is only half of the Passat TDI story. The engine is quick to start; it idles smoothly, and it pulls the 3,000-pound Passat with authority. Driving with a heavy foot and a willingness to rev the engine reveals a sporty side to the car, largely because of the well-tuned suspension. The ride is firm but comfortable, even over the potholes and broken pavement of southeastern Michigan's roads. Accurate, well-weighted steering also contributes to the car's sporty demeanor.
Inside, the Passat features the accessories one expects in a $20,000 family car, including air-conditioning and power windows, locks and mirrors. And aside from the bleak expanses of black plastic in the test car, the interior has comfortable seats, easy-to-read controls and copious space.
Volkswagen charges $940 for the TDI engine, above the price of a gas-powered Passat. Despite the diesel's efficiency, it will take an average owner about four years to make up the extra cost of the purchase.
Volkswagen will add two more diesel-powered models this year when the Golf and Jetta go on sale with the same engine.
The Passat TDI illustrates how far the diesel-powered car has come. The mix of practical packaging, fuel-sipping efficiency and surprising performance make it a feasible alternative to mainstream family sedans like the Ford Taurus or Toyota Camry. Though still not for everyone, the TDI may win more Americans over to the diesel.
MERCEDES-BENZ E300 DIESEL: The Passat TDI may be a niche vehicle, but it is not all alone. Just one other diesel automobile is sold in the United States today, a version of the Mercedes E-Class sedan that has won raves in its gas-engine iterations.
The Mercedes diesel shares its distinctive retro styling and its chassis with two stable mates, the E320 and E420. The platform is so competent and well mannered it could probably make a Briggs & Stratton lawn-mower motor seem smooth and responsive. The body is solid. The steering is precise. The supple suspension imparts a lithe athleticism to the whole package.
But while the E300 is a good car, it is probably not the Mercedes that Janis Joplin was pining for. Its 3-liter, 6-cylinder engine uses 24 valves, dual overhead camshafts and a three-stage variable intake manifold to produce 134 horsepower. From inside the car, diesel clatter is held to a bare minimum at all engine speeds, with the only roughness coming just after the engine is started. Otherwise, the E300 is pleasant enough around town, but even better at covering highway miles at a fast, efficient clip.
INSIDE TRACK: The Passat TDI and E300 may be diesels, but they're nice nonetheless.

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
Why Our Pensions Aren't Really Portable

BYLINE: By JAMES H. SMALHOUT; James H. Smalhout is a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute and author of "The Uncertain Retirement" (Irwin, 1996).

 BODY:
MILLIONS of Americans will never get their money's worth from their pensions because, in a very crucial way, the nation's pension system is hopelessly backward.
Workers covered by traditional defined-benefit pension plans can lose as much as 90 percent of their pension wealth as a result of routine job changes or termination of their plans because there is no accounting for the corrosive effects of inflation. When pension coverage ends, the earnings benchmark used to determine benefits is frozen, and inflation can then whittle down those benefits to almost nothing at retirement. 
The stakes here are large. Defined-benefit plans cover 25 million workers in the private sector as well as most government employees, Federal, state and local. The plans appear safe because they promise a monthly payment -- based on length of service to a single employer and a measure of earnings while on the job -- but they do not recognize what is being lost to inflation.
Protection against such erosion, however, is the point of pension "portability" -- a buzzword resonating through Washington that refers to maintaining the value of a pension beyond a worker's years at each specific job.
The Clinton Administration proposed legislation in early April that focused on new ways to help workers take their money from one employer-sponsored savings plan, known as a 401(k), to another when changing jobs. That misses the point and, even worse, the proposal was strangely silent on the core problem of portability for defined-benefit pensions.
The logistics of moving retirement funds with workers who change jobs should not really matter. What should matter is whether pensions promised by traditional defined-benefit plans can withstand the pressure of inflation and retain their real value until the workers retire.
Furthermore, portability is not a problem for 401(k) money. Most workers already withdraw it when they change jobs.And mobile workers can then "roll over" their 401(k) savings into individual retirement accounts without losing any tax advantages.
Congressional hearings began this month on ways to simplify and improve pension coverage. For their part, Republicans have emphasized a need to set up more savings plans -- not pension reform. The House of Representatives passed a bill in late May abolishing rules that make those plans costly and complicated for small companies to provide.
But people ought to focus on the real portability problem. Portability losses defeat the purpose of tax breaks that subsidize employer-sponsored pensions. Congress intended to encourage employers to protect families who would not otherwise save enough for retirement. The lack of portability means that many families are not well protected and that employers do not need to spend as much on workers who stay long enough to collect pensions.
Each year, the Treasury could collect more than $60 billion from employers if their pension contributions were not tax deductible and if returns on pension investments were taxed when the pension plan received them. These provisions represent the second-most-costly tax expenditure for the nation, after the deduction for mortgage interest. But they never show up explicitly in the Federal budget. Instead, they are reflected by higher tax rates and increased Government debt.
Portability losses are not just a threat to a financially secure retirement. The flip side is a powerful incentive -- subsidized by Washington -- for companies to send their workers packing. Employers reap a windfall when workers leave. This is no doubt contributing in a big way to voters' fears about job security.
A first step in providing portable pensions involves indexing benefits to inflation after workers move on to new jobs. Unfortunately, a gaggle of lobbyists has been whining that this would be too expensive and would result in the termination of many plans. Unions are not keen on portable pensions because it is easier to organize workers when they stay put. And companies can offer benefits that look good on paper while allowing only a privileged few to ever qualify for a decent pension.
But inflation protection for deferred pensions has not reduced the appeal of defined-benefit plans in countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Britain. Pre-retirement indexing also need not result in higher annual pension costs for employers. With indexing, mobile workers could still have much better pensions, without raising total pension costs, if these plans offered initially to replace a smaller share of earnings in return for each year of service.
PROVIDING portable pensions would not be difficult. The Treasury recently announced plans to issue inflation-indexed bonds. This will suddenly make it simple for employers to calculate the cost of deferred pensions, similarly indexed.
Safe and secure pensions must be portable. President Clinton responded to concerns about unsafe pensions during the second Presidential debate in 1992 by saying he would regulate pension financing more effectively, but the goal of providing workers with a financially safer, more secure retirement has largely eluded his Administration so far.
Many important issues will be debated before the election. But it is still not too late for real progress in protecting mobile workers against horrendous pension losses. What better way to stand before the voters than to take the important step of making America's pensions safer and more secure?

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Casual, Worker-Friendly, And a Moneymaker, Too

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: VENTURA, Calif.

 BODY:
SURFBOARDS are stacked by the mail room, except when the surf's up two blocks away. There is a volleyball court out back, and showers in the restrooms. The cafeteria does not serve beef. Job interviews may touch on mysticism. Business cards have no titles. The corporate uniform is shorts and sandals. Work spaces are communal. Even the chairman does without an office.
A parody of the Southern California life style? Not at all. This place exists, and despite its unconventional conventions, business is thriving. Patagonia Inc., an outdoor-clothing retailer, did $154 million in sales in the last year, its best ever. 
 "We started working to create an atmosphere to maintain our life style," said Kris McDivitt Tompkins, who spent 20 years with Patagonia, until she resigned as chief executive in 1993. "We worked hard so we could take time off to go skiing and climbing."
More importantly, Patagonia has made a commitment to avoid the barriers that women can face in business. Though the number of women among the nation's highest-paid managers has nearly doubled in the last decade, only about 5 percent of senior managers at the largest corporations are women. And 96 of the top 500 companies have no women on their boards.
At Patagonia, a privately held retailer with 700 employees, women hold more than half of Patagonia's top-paying jobs (the top 20 percent of the pay range) and nearly 60 percent of managerial jobs. And five of the eight directors are women. Women account for 52.7 percent of the work force.
While its policies and practices appeal to and benefit women, Patagonia is not a company founded by women to make products for women. Ms. McDivitt Tompkins' successor is a man, David B. Olsen, as is Patagonia's chairman, Yvon Chouinard. Mr. Chouinard, 57, founded the company with his wife, Malinda, in 1973 to design and sell high-quality outdoor clothing for both sexes, and in the process, the company's mission statement says, "do no harm."
Last month, President Clinton hailed Patagonia as an "impressive" example of corporate responsibility, and he praised its family benefits and corporate tithing -- 10 percent of pretax earnings or 1 percent of sales -- to various environmental causes. Last year, Patagonia's donations amounted to $1.5 million, the company said, and the Department of Labor lists Patagonia among garment makers and retailers that monitor contractors for labor law compliance.
Barbara Reskin, a sociology professor at Ohio State University who studies corporate benefits, said, "Patagonia is defining the upper ideal of what people would like to see in family-friendly policies."
DECISIONS are made mostly by consensus. After the company had a round of layoffs in 1991, the books were opened to employees to show them why expenses needed to be reined in. They responded, current and former officials say, by helping managers cut costs significantly.
Benefits and work rules are generous and applied evenly. For example, new fathers, as well as mothers, get paid leaves. Employees can often be seen lunching with their children in the child care center, which the company subsidizes to hold down costs.
An aggressive recycling program led the single trash Dumpster to be filled up just twice in the last year. Indeed, Patagonia's high-priced products, sold by catalogue, in company stores and at other retailers, include items made from recycled soda bottles, like the Synchilla fleece shirt ($50), or from organically grown cotton, like the Topical T-shirt with surf logo ($24).
Patagonia is consistently profitable, said Ronald Jones, director of the apparel practice in Los Angeles for the accounting firm Moss Adams. But earnings fall short of the exceptional 25 percent pretax profits of apparel companies like Guess, he said.
"It takes that premium profit and puts it in programs, environmental investment and family benefits." he said. "They never set significant financial success as a priority. They've stuck to their noneconomic goals. Yvon wants the company to be a role model for a different objective."
Patagonia's culture evolved from the passions of Mr. Chouinard, an outdoors enthusiast who has developed a deep interest in environmental causes. Mr. Chouinard (pronounced shuh-NARD) started in retailing nearly 40 years ago, when he began selling the climbing pitons that he first fashioned for his own use. These days, he spends half the year away from the office, surfing and fly fishing, often using these activities to field-test new clothing.
Requests to interview him were politely rebuffed by a company spokeswoman who explained that Mr. Chouinard was on such a sojourn, or "off the map."
At the single-story corporate headquarters here, where patterns are designed for farming out to sewing contractors, evidence of Mr. Chouinard's philosophy and personality abounds. The ban on beef, for example, reflects his own diet.
While Mr. Chouinard may exercise his influence over company cuisine, he does not do so from a private office. Nor do other executives. Indeed, Patagonia's managers do without customary perks and work at desks out in the open with everyone else.
Patagonia's defining moment was probably the naming of Ms. McDivitt Tompkins, a longtime Chouinard family friend, as general manager in 1979, entrusting her with the day-to-day management -- and shaping -- of the company. She was then 28, an accomplished ski racer with no real business experience beyond working with the Chouinards since Patagonia began as a shoestring operation.
"We were a renegade group, not shunning society the way the hippies did, but rejecting cultural assumptions of the times," said Ms. McDivitt Tompkins, who is 45. "Between the three of us, the glass ceiling never existed."
Ms. McDivitt Tompkins now lives in Chile, but remains on the board; she and the Chouinards are the only stockholders.
People familiar with the company say many interwoven factors have created and fostered Patagonia's unusual corporate culture and a work environment that women find especially supportive.
As is often the case elsewhere in business, people are hired at Patagonia because they seem likely to fit into the corporate culture. Kate Larramendy, the company's design director for 15 years, said the "lack of sexism is an outgrowth of this being a nonhierarchical company."
"A lot is not clearly defined," she said. "You can work outside the box."
Karyn O. Barsa, 35, the company's chief financial officer, said a flat hierarchy meant decisions made by consensus, a "quality considered feminine and very welcomed here." Ms. Barsa said prospective employees' business skills were secondary to their being ardent outdoor types and product users, like the receptionist who is a world Frisbee champion or the manager of water sports products, who is a top kayaker.
"In self-propelled, single-participant sports there is little ego, little bias," she said. "Bias and prejudice are a result of insecurity. These are not insecure people."
Alison May, the company president from 1994 until last April, when she completed a financial overhaul of the company, recalled that her own job interview with a group of senior managers had touched on topics like herbalism and mystic practices of ancient Druids. She said that the company sought people who are gentle, self-sufficient and not domineering, and that an outdoors orientation and a commitment to preserving the environment seemed to fit that profile.
Patagonia's human resources director, Terri Wolfe, said employees were encouraged to use their benefits, a policy that she said helped retain workers, especially women. Just 4.5 percent of Patagonia's 700 workers leave in a typical year, compared with 25 percent at some rivals, she said.
PATAGONIA has not been an unqualified success. After experiencing sales growth averaging 26 percent a year in the 1980's, it overhauled itself in 1991 at the behest of nervous lenders. The company laid off 120 of its 620 employees at the time, cut its clothing line by 40 percent and catalogue distribution from four times a year to two.
It is now back on track, with an even larger work force, more retail outlets and, people familiar with the company say, a firmer hand on the throttle.
Francine Blau, who teaches labor economics at Cornell University, believes that Patagonia's renewed fiscal vigor should encourage other companies to follow suit in establishing progressive policies, especially toward women. But Sheila W. Wellington, president of Catalyst, a professional-women's advocacy group, contends that women achieve management parity only when top executives make it a goal, which she considers a hard task in a large corporation.
Ms. McDivitt Tompkins is skeptical that the Patagonia experiment will be widely repeated. "I don't think corporate America is reformable," she said. "If you want to create an environment like Patagonia, you have to create it yourself. It's not in the big sweeping decisions. It's in the minutia, in the thousands of tiny decisions made every day. You can't teach it. You can't sell it. It's only from people whose natural inclination is to live that way."

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: KI-JANA CARTER;
Risk? A Running Back Takes a Pass

BYLINE: By LARRY DIGNAN 

 BODY:
WHEN Ki-Jana Carter of the Cincinnati Bengals suffered a season-ending knee injury in his first preseason game last year, he learned a lesson that many professional football players don't learn until too late: a career in the National Football League, and the pay that comes with it, can be short-lived.
Mr. Carter, 22, the top draft pick in the N.F.L. in 1995, has a $19.2 million, seven-year deal that included a $7.125 million signing bonus, the richest to date for a rookie. The contract is lined with incentives -- an extra $100,000 for scoring 12 or more touchdowns in a season, for instance, and a clause that could make Mr. Carter, a running back, a free agent after four years. 
 "I came out of college and felt invincible," Mr. Carter said. "After the injury happened it was like, 'Wow, I may not be making any more money.' " Though Mr. Carter expects to come back and play well this season, he now views his career and his pay on a year-to-year basis. "I counted the first four years of the contract in the beginning," he said. "Now I just look at the money I have."
It is a prudent attitude not only for athletes, but also for models, entertainers and others who may have lucrative but relatively brief working lives.
In the case of Mr. Carter, the knee injury deepened an already cautious nature. Last season, he decided to put all his money into low-risk, fixed-income investments, mostly municipal bonds from Florida, where he is building a home. It was an unusual choice; most people of Mr. Carter's age who have money to invest are advised to put it primarily into stocks.
He will soon shift some of his portfolio to riskier, and potentially higher-yielding, equity investments. But the focus on tax-free bonds reveals his penchant for caution, as well as the educational role of planners who specialize in young, newly wealthy athletes.
"I knew what was safe," said Mr. Carter, who majored in business marketing at Penn State. "I got a $7 million bonus, so there was no need to gamble. I wanted to be safe and then branch out."
Mark Griege, Mr. Carter's financial planner, acknowledges that the unorthodox allocation was not ideal. But he says it was important that Mr. Carter's initial investments match his risk tolerance and his knowledge of investing.
"Rule No. 1 is, 'Don't invest in something you don't understand,' " said Mr. Griege, a principal at Robertson, Griege & Thoele, a financial planning firm in Dallas that also works with Troy Aikman, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback, and other prominent N.F.L. players.
Mr. Carter is as conservative in spending money as he is in investing it. He may be a millionaire several times over, but he still shops for the best prices on watches, clothes and other goods. That attitude stands out among professional athletes, many of whom spend their first contract as if it were going to last forever. (It won't. Some N.F.L. contracts can be ended by the team if a player is injured or performs poorly and, anyway, the length of the average N.F.L. career is just five years.)
Mr. Carter went to particularly great lengths to comparison-shop for his financial planner. He interviewed 14 of them before narrowing the pool to 7, all of whom then paid to fly themselves to interviews with Mr. Carter. Nearly all the planners were "fee only," charging a set amount regardless of the investments their clients made. But some of the planners receive commissions on such investments; many experts, believing that such advisers may give self-interested advice, discourage investors from using people with these pay arrangements.
How was Mr. Griege chosen? Compensation played a role, though neither he nor Mr. Carter would divulge the terms of his pay, except to say that Mr. Griege is a fee-only planner who is paid a percentage of the assets he manages. But the clinchers in Mr. Griege's selection were personal service -- Mr. Griege flies around the country to meet Mr. Carter -- and interaction with the client.
"Many tell you that you should do this or that," Mr. Carter said. "Mark tells you the reason why you should."
MR. CARTER not only interviewed the candidates but had some advisers do so, too. All told, he now has an agent, a planner, marketers, a family friend who is a lawyer and his mother all helping him make financial decisions.
"I didn't know all the questions to ask, so I had people around me who knew them," he said. "I knew the basics, but questions like, 'What if my career lasts only four years?' had to be asked. My mom was there and asked, 'Would you talk to my son a lot?' "
Awareness of his limitations is valuable for Mr. Carter, who said he learned little about investing as he grew up because his family did not have much money. They lived in a two-bedroom apartment outside Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Carter's father left when Ki-Jana was a baby, and he spent much of his childhood watching his mother, Kathy, work 12- to 15-hour days in her beauty salon to provide for him and his little brother, Nathan.
Mr. Carter is similarly family-oriented. "My mom worked so hard when I was little and she sacrificed everything for her kids," he said. "The least I can do is pay her back." His financial goals are straightforward: support his mother and brother, build his home in Florida and achieve financial security for life.
He also would like to help the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program with money and time. Indeed, Mr. Carter, who as a child had a Big Brother from age 10, is becoming a spokesman of sorts for the group. He also plans to contribute to other charities and is thinking about starting his own foundation someday.
He has made a good start toward these goals. Mr. Carter has bought his mother a Mercedes-Benz, a Chevrolet Blazer for the winter and a spacious house in Columbus. He also provides her with a monthly stipend that is "a little better than she made at the hair salon," said Michael Schiff, the family lawyer. He has already started work on building his home in Florida.
BUT, relatively speaking, Mr. Carter does not spend a lot, even though he gets his annual salary in 17 tempting weekly installments over the football season. Consider last year's earnings of $7.875 million -- the $7.125 million signing bonus and the $750,000 first-year salary. (His salary climbs each year. The 1996 figure is $946,000.) Of the 1995 income, 42 percent was saved, 42 percent went to taxes and 16 percent was spent. But excluding big expenses -- the fee for Leigh Steinberg, the well-known agent, for instance, and the average annual premium of $50,000 he pays Lloyd's of London for a $3 million disability policy -- Mr. Carter's 1995 expenditures equaled only 10 percent.
Much of that was used to satisfy Mr. Carter's self-imposed family obligations. But while he is generous with his family and is a good saver, too, he is not completely self-denying. He has the young athlete's obligatory sports car, a Mercedes, as well as a Lexus. He has a nice watch, and he says his biggest weakness is clothing. But, like many young people, he's talking Polo and Tommy Hilfiger, not Armani.
"It's like I'm still in college," he said. "I go out and spend money and go, 'Damn, I shouldn't have spent that much.' I know I can spend without worrying about it, but I still can't really picture a million dollars."
There is one danger, however, that the prudent Mr. Carter may be courting: inflation. Mr. Griege says Mr. Carter, with his heavy investments in tax-free bonds, needs some equities in his portfolio to insure that his money outruns inflation. "The time he has can work for him or against him," Mr. Griege said, and if it works against him, it can really hurt.
"Inflation is a significant threat for athletes," he added. "Ki-Jana is looking at 50-plus years of inflation."
So at the end of May, Mr. Griege offered Mr. Carter two portfolio allocations that would move him more into equities while still recognizing his conservative bent.
The first would have put 55 percent of Mr. Carter's assets into municipal bonds and spread 30 percent among no-load equity mutual funds. The 30 percent would have been divided equally among three categories: small-capitalization domestic funds, large-cap domestic funds and international funds. The portfolio would also have had 5 percent in real estate, primarily real estate investment trusts, and 5 percent in oil and gas investments, through mutual funds.
The remaining 5 percent would have been used to introduce Mr. Carter to individual stocks in fields he knows, like sports. Mr. Carter's early favorite is Nike, which happens to handle Mr. Carter's marketing through its Nike Sports Management division. As Mr. Griege's clients mature as investors, they typically put about 10 percent to 15 percent into individual stocks.
The second allocation would have assigned 30 percent of assets to municipals, 20 percent to small-cap domestic funds, 12 percent to large-cap domestic funds, 18 percent to international funds and the remaining 20 percent to real estate (7 percent) oil and gas (7 percent) and cash for buying individual stocks (6 percent).
But when the planner and the player met on June 17 for a periodic portfolio review, Mr. Carter chose neither option. He did not feel bold enough for the second nor conservative enough for the first. He decided to allot 45 percent to municipals and 40 percent to equity mutual funds (15 percent in small-cap funds, 15 percent in large-cap funds and 10 percent in international funds). As in the first option, there will be 5 percent each in real estate, in oil and gas and in a pot of cash for buying stocks based on Mr. Griege's evaluation and Mr. Carter's input.
"I was impressed with his focus," Mr. Griege said after the meeting. "He felt he was up to speed and felt comfortable with the new portfolio." But Mr. Griege said he still wanted the portfolio to evolve. Mr. Carter "was still nervous with investing overseas, so we're underweight there," said Mr. Griege, who also wants to increase the portfolio's overall equity portion.
While putting 45 percent of a 22-year-old's portfolio into tax-free funds may seem overly conservative to Mr. Griege and others, the wealth of many young athletes today may make such a strategy plausible, some advisers say.
"Players are making so much that there's no need for a lot of risk" to achieve their goals, said Bernard Wolfe, who runs a financial planning firm in Rockville, Md. He tends to use municipals for 45 to 55 percent of the assets of his clients, many of whom are professional hockey players.
IN any event, Mr. Griege and Mr. Carter are forging ahead with their new allocation. Mr. Griege will split each of the three equity fund categories among five or six funds, chosen for their performance, the records of their managers and their expense ratios, along with an eye toward a mix of growth and value investing styles.
Mr. Griege's picks among small-cap funds, some of which have substantial mid-cap holdings, include Columbia Special, Strong Opportunity, T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value, Mutual Shares, Heartland Value and the Brandywine fund. Among his favorite large-capitalization funds are Dodge & Cox Stock, the Janus fund, Twentieth Century Ultra, the Clipper fund, the Yacktman fund and Fidelity Value.
His favorite international funds are Sogen International, T. Rowe Price International, Scudder International, Warburg Pincus International and Twentieth Century International.
As for individual stocks, Mr. Griege is willing to go with Nike, Mr. Carter's favorite, but not yet. "If there's a correction in the future of Nike, we'll probably buy it," Mr. Griege said. The stock closed last week at $102.75, up from less than $65 four months ago.
He said Mr. Carter would invest in a few initial public offerings. Mr. Griege has a stack of candidates, underwritten by the likes of Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney and Goldman, Sachs. Usually, he said, his clients sell some shares of a new issue in two to four days, a process called flipping, for the quick price run-up, but they hold onto other shares of that issue. This double approach, he said, means that he and his clients look for stocks that will not only soar early on, but also appreciate in the long term.
Mr. Carter has already invested a small amount in one recent public offering: Planet Hollywood, the restaurant chain with a celebrity theme, whose stock has bounced between $22 and $28 since its mid-April debut, closing on Friday at $27.
Because young, wealthy people can sometimes be gulled on financial matters, Mr. Griege's plan also involves teaching Mr. Carter about investing. For example, he boils down information about each fund to a one-page summary that addresses tax issues, risk and asset allocations, with graphics showing how the funds perform in relation to one another.
Mr. Carter, who is learning to use the reports of Morningstar, the fund research company, will soon also learn to analyze a prospectus and to use Quicken, the financial planning software. Cash flow and budgeting, a full-time job when dealing with lots of zeros, is handled by Mr. Griege.
"I don't expect him to understand all of the fund terminology, but he knows why he has to diversify," Mr. Griege said. "He's a second-year guy and the goal is to have him grow in his education."
MR. CARTER said he wanted to learn as much as possible, but he knows that playing football is his best investment at the moment. If he plays well this season, he notches another year's earnings and possibly income from endorsements. Professional athletes who focus too much on business in their first contract often don't get a second.
Mr. Carter said his goal was to understand investing from a common-sense perspective. He and Mr. Griege sometimes discuss the risky things that other football players are doing with their money. Some young players are starting restaurants, which saps money from the core of a portfolio and should only be done toward the end of a career, Mr. Griege said. Other players simply spend a lot. Marshall Faulk, a running back for the Indianapolis Colts who is the same age as Mr. Carter, bought 11 cars within 2 years. And until he got some financial discipline, Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls was earning $2.5 million a year playing basketball, but still managed to fall $1 million into debt.
Mr. Carter is determined to be different. "I see a lot of guys come into the league and want to go out and spend to show they have a lot of money," he said. "That's good now, but I'm trying to live like this when I'm 50, 60, 70."

HEADLINE: An Invitation to Terror

BYLINE: By Chas. W. Freeman Jr.; Chas. W. Freeman Jr. was United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On Feb. 25, 1991, just three days before President George Bush proclaimed the end of allied combat operations, the last Iraqi Scud of the Persian Gulf war hit a barracks in Dhahran, killing 28 newly arrived United States Army reservists and wounding scores more.
Last week's carnage in Dhahran recalled that earlier horror. It also brought home to Americans that five long years after the spectacular victory of Desert Storm, American troops are still on combat duty in the Persian Gulf. Thousands remain in Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries, flying missions with full combat loads, manning anti-missile defenses and enforcing a naval blockade against Iraq. And they will stay there, far from home and vulnerable to more terrorist attacks, as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power in Baghdad. 
This is far cry from the return to normalcy that Americans and our Arab coalition partners looked toward in 1991. We had given President Hussein a terrible licking. We were sure his days were numbered. We had been careful not to weaken his country to the point where his successor would be unable to play Iraq's traditional role as a counterweight to Iran.
We expected Baghdad to see that it was in its interest to comply with United Nations demands that it dismantle its weapons of mass destruction -- its missiles and its nuclear, chemical and biological arsenal -- and to seek a renewal of peace with the Gulf Arabs, including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
We thought the Gulf Arabs would form an effective collective defense organization, backed by Egypt. United States land and air forces would then be no more necessary than they had been before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Americans and Gulf Arabs alike celebrated as our troops headed home.
But Saddam Hussein is still there, cheating all he can on United Nations efforts to halt his drive for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons with which to gain revenge on Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. And with the Gulf Arabs as militarily disunited as ever, the only thing stopping him is the United States military presence in the region.
Operation Desert Storm burdened the Saudi economy with huge debts. Saudi living standards have fallen substantially as the kingdom's generous subsidies to its citizens are squeezed to pay off wartime loans and subsidize the coalition forces (Americans and a few Britons) still in the kingdom. The presence of these foreign forces chafes at the country's social and political stability, and resentment swells the ranks of extremist groups hostile to the Saudi royal family and the West. The royal family's sensitivity to this resentment accounts for the initial Saudi press reports' identifying the victims of last Tuesday's bombing only as "foreigners," not as United States airmen.
Americans and Saudis would be a great deal more comfortable if the situation allowed what both expected after the gulf war: the withdrawal of United States forces from the kingdom. But because Mr. Hussein managed to escape the political consequences of his military debacle, the United Nations effort to curb his military ambitions must continue as long as he remains in power, and a United States military presence is essential to that effort.
Perhaps it's time to get serious about removing Mr. Hussein from power. But current American policy isn't really behind such an effort. It is based on the notion of "dual containment" -- isolating both Iraq and Iran in the region, cutting them off from the world economic and trading system, and balancing the two nations' military power with American forces while waiting for Mr. Hussein to fall.
The best that can be said of this strategy is that so far it has not brought Iraq and Iran together against the United States, as many of its critics feared it would. The worst may be that it has handed Baghdad and Teheran the initiative. Either can yank huge deployments of American forces to the gulf whenever it wishes to do so. Iraq has successfully pulled this particular string several times. Iran could do the same.
Iraq may be isolated, but Iran is not. The Gulf Arabs have joined our European and Asian allies in normalizing diplomatic relations and carrying on a thriving export trade with Teheran. The only coalition member with a policy of "dual containment" seems to be the United States. Efforts to force our allies to join us in isolating Iran anger them more than they hurt Teheran.
The Iraqi threat is military. United States forces in the region help contain it. But it is hard to see the relevance of these forces to the Iranian threat, which has consisted of terrorist actions in places far from the gulf, like Lebanon. The destabilizing effects of the American military presence in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Gulf Arab states may, in fact, be generating new targets for Iranian-backed terrorism.
Meanwhile, George Bush and Margaret Thatcher have been removed from office. King Fahd is visibly nearing the end of his reign. But Saddam Hussein is still in Baghdad, plotting revenge. Even if he didn't give the perpetrators of Tuesday's atrocity a helping hand, he must have been pleased by what they did.
"Dual containment" is a policy with no apparent benefits and many risks. It is hard to argue that it amounts to more than a catchy slogan for keeping United States forces in the gulf indefinitely until Mr. Hussein falls from power. Five years have gone by, and that has not happened. It might happen tomorrow, of course. Then again, it might not happen anytime in the next five years. Until it does, American forces will be stuck in the gulf, Saudi Arabia will remain troubled by their presence and extremists will see them as attractive targets for terrorism.
There are plenty of Iraqis eager to get rid of Saddam Hussein. The United States spends less to support them than its Air Force spends to fly a day's missions in the gulf. We need to get our priorities straight.
Our interests and those of our Gulf Arab allies call out for a strategy that does not depend on permanent stationing of United States forces in the gulf. Helping the Iraqi people rid themselves of Saddam Hussein, not hunkering down behind barricades in Dhahran or picking fights with our allies over Iran, is the key to security in the gulf.

POLITICS
 
Hit 'em Where They're Strong
 
Just a little recession -- Bob Dole could have really used one. Was that too much to ask? He would have floated to Election Day, thundering, "Clintonomics has failed!" (In four years, please, let's not have any "an" or "on" candidates. No more Reaganomics or Nixonomics or God-knows-who-nomics.) But apparently Mr. Dole's given up, for the word is now that he'll attack the President on the economy anyway. You can't ignore voters' wallets. This will be tough, considering that Mr. Clinton has all the right numbers -- growth, with unemployment and inflation low. So what Mr. Dole will say is that things could be even better, and zero in on the weak spots, like job-security worries and stagnant incomes. And, oh yes: being a politician, he'll surely not forget to suggest tax cuts.
 
MUTUAL FUNDS
 
Rainy Day? What Rainy Day?
 
More money has flooded into stock mutual funds so far this year than in all of 1995 (which, by the way, was a record year). Where does it all go? Straight into this red-hot market, of course. Can't have cash sitting around growing mold. (No, it's not really in bundles of $20's sitting in suitcases in fund offices.) In fact, even with all that money coming in, the cash held by funds is now at the lowest level in nearly two decades: just 6.7 percent. What the cash is for, of course, is to pay investors who want out. So you see what this could mean: a handful of investors want out, the cash vanishes, stocks are sold, the market falls, more investors get scared and want out. Panic. But that can't happen. Not in an election year.
 
NEW YORK TRANSIT
 
One Commute, One Fare
 
It has long been a complaint of New York City commuters. Even with an amazing network of buses and subways, many people simply can't get where they're going on one fare. Thus, the dreaded two-fare commute, a $6-a-day burden that, on a monthly basis, rivals the cost of travel to many a leafy suburb. But last week, the transit authority said that beginning next year, it would offer free transfers between subway and bus. This could cost the city $168 million in revenue, but officials hope some of this will be balanced by more riders. There's a catch: you'll have to start using those fare cards. Metrocards now account for just 6 percent of all fares paid.
 
MONEY
 
Those Voracious A.T.M.'s
 
You've got to be pretty old to remember this, but -- yes, this is scary -- there was a time when, on a Friday, you had to stockpile enough cash to get through the weekend. Ancient, ancient history. A.T.M.'s are everywhere now, open at all hours, their siren calls saying: "C'mon, big spender. Grab a few more $20's." What these modern-day sirens don't say, though, is what fees lurk inside, fees that have been sprouting like sidewalk pennies lately, with surcharges for noncustomers piling on top of banks' own fees. Pressure is mounting for legislation to tame this fee epidemic, with a proposal last week in the House to require banks to post fee warnings by A.T.M.'s and on screen. But that's not enough, some critics say -- people are so addicted to instant cash that being told the fee won't deter them. Those surcharges, they say, should be banned.
 
ON-LINE HEALTH
 
Is Information Treatable?
 
Nonstop radio and TV news. Sports statistics. Up-to-the-second stock quotations. The Internet. Enough already! Information overload! No, wait. There are times when we can't get our fill of the stuff, when, say, we're sick and the doctor hasn't a clue. Then we ask total strangers if they've had the symptoms, scour horoscopes and check crystal balls for new wrinkles. Sounds tailor-made for the data-clogged Internet, doesn't it? Sure enough, on-line health is on a roll. Jim Clark, of Silicon Graphics and Netscape fame, recently started Healtheon, and last week Allina Health Village joined the hordes of sites loaded with anecdotal and clinical data. Yes, you may stumble on the perfect mix of herbs or pills, but a more likely result might be paralysis -- an information overdose that, if untreated, could be fatal.
 
TOBACCO WARS
 
Killer Crackers?
 
In "Thank You for Smoking," his over-the-top satire of the tobacco wars, Christopher Buckley has a tobacco spokesman suggest that Vermont cheddar, that ruthless artery-clogger, kills more people than cigarettes. Meanwhile, back in the real world, Philip Morris Europe has been running ads suggesting that second-hand smoke is less dangerous than eating a biscuit a day. Last week, though, a French court banned the ads, upholding a complaint from the biscuit industry, and ruled that Philip Morris would be fined nearly $200,000 each time the ads appeared. The public, Europe's public health commissioner said, should treat the company's claim "with the scorn it deserves."
 
CYBERSPACE
 
On Line Is Not Enough
 
America Online. The company's name speaks clearly of both its pitfalls and its vast promise. This nation has gone feverishly on line, and the company has cashed in on that, becoming one of the brightest cyberspace stars. But the problem is that as Americans go on line, many find they don't need this escort. They can do it themselves, thanks. So as this all sorts itself out, America Online has taken a wild ride, its stock leaping ahead, then skittering back. Just last week its new president, recruited just four months ago from Federal Express, left abruptly, perhaps because of confusion about where the company is going. A "relaunch of A.O.L." is promised, but it's still not clear how to keep making money from stuff that, for the most part, is out there waiting to be plucked, free.
 
SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
 
Questions? Don't Be Silly
 
A shareholder meeting. The words conjure a warm, fuzzy image of democracy in action, the just plain folks who own a company sittin' a spell to talk things over. A fantasy even in America, but look at Japan. First, nearly all meetings are held on the same day, so you can't exactly hop from company to company bearing democracy's pollen. And loyal employees, who've arrived at dawn to crowd the front rows, chant a well-rehearsed "Oh, yes!" or "No objection!" no matter what executives on the podium say. Take Sumitomo's meeting last week. The decorum was broken briefly by a shareholder with the temerity to suggest that that $1.8 billion copper loss needed to be dealt with a bit more, well, strenuously. Not to worry. The president and the loyal crowd drowned him out, the board was re-elected, and the gathering was wrapped up in a tidy 40 minutes. Any questions?

For Danger In the Mideast, Just Look Around

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
JUST when Americans might have thought the Middle East was safe -- at least for oil and Israel, the usual concerns -- there was a sharp, ugly reminder last week of just how unstable the region really is: a huge truck bomb that took 19 American lives. Ironically enough, the explosion was in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, which six years ago was the main base for the American-led gulf war that undid Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
At the time, the war seemed part of a chain of events that would change the Middle East forever. The vital oil fields of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, if not democracy, had been saved. And, in the way events in one part of the Middle East reverberate in another, the Palestine Liberation Organization, having thrown in with Iraq, wound up so weakened that it had to make peace with Israel, heralding a new era. 
 An Arab summit meeting was held in Cairo shortly after the Iraqi invasion and shattered the myth of Arab solidarity (memorably so in a food fight in which the Iraqi delegation hurled lunch at the spotless white robes of the Kuwaitis). It was a myth maintained by ritual gatherings and by fist waving at Israel, with the illusions and diversions only crippling chances for change.
As last week began, Arab leaders gathered again in Cairo to resurrect the myth of Arab solidarity. In doing so, they papered over their sometimes lethal differences, as well as the threats many of the governments face from their own people. But it is those differences that continue to make the region so dangerous and unpredictable.
For centuries, religion has inspired the most violent actions in the Middle East. A Cook's tour from Iran to Algeria, from Turkey to Sudan, would show that militant Islam is the common thread (there is an echo in Israel, with the growing power of its nationalist Orthodoxy).
To pure belief add more mundane factors: poverty, frustration and a demographic time bomb. Throughout much of the region there is a dangerous population bulge of the young, the restless and the volatile. In Saudi Arabia, 58 percent of the population is under 24; in Egypt 57 percent, in Jordan 65 percent.
 
 
 
Afghan Legacy
 Iran is frequently pointed to as the principal sponsor of terrorism, but a more important threat may be the presence of veterans of the Afghan war -- the ex-mujaheddin, or holy warriors, who were backed by the Central Intelligence Agency in one of the last struggles of the cold war. Saudi Arabia helped pay for that war and sent hundreds of fiery-eyed zealots from its puritanical Wahabi sect who, along with other Islamic volunteers, fought with the Afghans and now want to continue their struggle elsewhere. The men who bombed the World Trade Center in New York came from these ranks, as did four Saudis who set off a car bomb that killed five Americans in Riyadh last November. It is called "blowback" in the intelligence community. The four were beheaded last month, and the latest bombing is believed to have been in retribution, aimed not only at the "infidel" Americans but also at the Saudi royal family.
 
 
 
Appearances
 So the tour of the region can start in Saudi Arabia itself, outwardly oil rich and seemingly stable. Unlike America's previous best friend in the Persian Gulf, the Shah of Iran, who tried to secularize and modernize a deeply religious country, the Saudi royal family is deeply entwined with the ulema, the religious leadership. Islamic law is strictly enforced. Indeed, King Fahd's very legitimacy rests on his role as the Sherif of Mecca, protector of Islam's holiest place. The dynasty's founder, Ibn Saud, seized this role with his desert warriors -- the Ikhwan, or brotherhood, of fundamentalist Bedouin -- from the Hashemite family in 1924, charging that they had failed to protect pilgrims and enjoyed a corrupt monopoly on the sale of dried lizards, which are used as a tonic.
But, particularly since American troops arrived to defend the kingdom five years ago and were allowed to stay on, the Government's policy of juggling friendship with the West and fundamentalism at home has come under growing attack. Senior religious scholars have posed a series of open challenges, amid widespread accusations of corruption and, worse, decadence. The criticism has grown as the oil boom that supported a safety net of free education, easy jobs and cheap housing collapsed and the country had to absorb $120 billion in war costs. The Government itself is in disarray since King Fahd suffered a stroke in November, with power now apparently centered in Crown Prince Abdullah.
America's other main supporter in the Arab world is Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak. Under him, Egypt remains perpetually in ruins and a breeding ground for fundamentalism. Its attempts to industrialize are a shambles, its Government bureaucracy legendary for sloth and inefficiency. Its schools spew out the uneducated into a nonexistent job market and its tiny strip of farmland along the Nile is being gobbled up into jerry-built urban slums that sometimes collapse into the sewage on which they are built. Its Islamic fundamentalists periodically shoot up tourists, the police, Coptic Christians or Government officials and are shot up in return.
Next door to Saudi Arabia, Jordan has joined Egypt as a leading backer -- and hopeful beneficiary -- of the peace with Israel. Six years ago, Saddam Hussein was on posters all over Amman and King Hussein had taken to calling himself the Sherif, the title his family lost to the Saudis (in the Middle East alliances can shift like the proverbial sands). But the King's embrace of Israeli officials and his grief at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister, have cost him badly at home. "We are very unhappy with the King," a money changer volunteered to a foreign reporter recently, in an open display that would have been unthinkable in the tightly controlled kingdom of a few years ago. There has even been rioting among the Bedouin, traditionally the King's base of support in a population that is largely Palestinian. Government officials worry, too, about a growing social disparity, with a tiny rich elite living in enormous new mansions surrounded by increasing poverty. The King has accused Syria of smuggling in terrorists to cause trouble, and last week Palestinian guerrillas, apparently coming from Syria, sneaked over the Jordan River and killed three Israeli soldiers.
In Israel, the peace process with the Palestinians has been on hold since the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister. Settlers and the religious right are elated and plan new settlements. Palestinians are frustrated at being kept from jobs in Israel and resentful of the highhanded leaders who with the peace have returned from their headquarters in Tunis.
Keep traveling and it doesn't get much better. Syria and Iraq remain gangster states, each ruthlessly ruled by a small clique from a religious minority -- Alawites in Damascus, Sunnis from the village of Tikrit in Baghdad. In Algeria the military dictatorship that replaced failed socialism is battling Islamic revolutionaries who murder foreigners and liberals. Turkey, where Kemal Ataturk introduced secularism after World War I, is on the brink of getting an Islamic fundamentalist Prime Minister (though in coalition with secularists). By the way, Turkey is also suppressing a Kurdish insurgency in its southeast. The Kurds have been hiding and training in Syria, and the Turks got so fed up, intelligence officials say, that they recently set off a big bomb in Damascus -- one more reason to be wary of rosy forecasts for the Middle East.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE UNIONS;
Citing Abortion Bill Veto, Union Head Rejects Clinton

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The head of the 100,000-member bricklayers' union has broken ranks with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and rejected its endorsement of President Clinton by announcing that he will not vote for the President because he vetoed a bill that would have banned a type of late-term abortion.
The president of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, John T. Joyce, said the veto so outraged him that he could not support Mr. Clinton even though the President, in his view, would be much better for working people than would Bob Dole, the all-but-certain Republican Presidential nominee. 
 "I can only go so far as my mind and conscience are going to let me go," Mr. Joyce said in explaining why he would not back Mr. Clinton. "But if the Republicans should win, it is going to make life a hell of a lot more difficult for working people."
Although endorsements by unions are not believed to carry the weight they once did, Mr. Joyce, with this move, has sought to bring some influence to bear on the election by raising an issue that the labor movement has steered clear of for years because it is so divisive.
Several union leaders criticized Mr. Joyce, who has a reputation as a iconoclastic Catholic intellectual, saying he was wrong to use a single issue as a litmus test, when in their view labor's agenda would be severely set back if Republicans win the White House and the Congress. They feared that Mr. Joyce's stand would undermine the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s $35-million education and get-out-the-vote effort aimed principally at defeating Republicans.
At the same time, some labor leaders praised Mr. Joyce for having the courage to speak his conscience and stray from the official line.
In April, Mr. Clinton vetoed a bill barring a type of abortion in which a fetus is partly extracted feet first and its brain is then suctioned out to allow the head to pass through the birth canal. Abortion opponents condemned the procedure as particularly gruesome, but Mr. Clinton opposed the bill because it did not include an exception to allow such abortions to avoid serious health consequences for the woman.
In an article to appear in the July 12 issue of Commonweal, the liberal Catholic magazine, Mr. Joyce explained that as a result of the Clinton veto he, for the first time in his life, found his personal convictions clashing with "the immediate economic needs of workers."
After attacking Mr. Dole for taking anti-union positions, he said he still could not back Mr. Clinton. "If I support someone who does not take every step humanly possible to prevent abortions, I practically condone such actions, and, to some degree, become complicit in the act of killing unborn human beings," he wrote.
Mr. Joyce said he would not vote for Mr. Clinton or Mr. Dole. He said he was unsure whether his union would also refuse to back Mr. Clinton, although he said that if his union had a much larger number of women it might take a different position from his.
In the Commonweal article, Mr. Joyce also attacked Mr. Dole. "The election of Bob Dole as President and the return of a Republican Congress will be ruinous for working people," he wrote.
Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, said he was disappointed by Mr. Joyce's position during a campaign the A.F.L.-C.I.O. sees as pivotal for unions.
"What the labor movement is trying to do is get away from single-issue litmus tests," said Mr. McEntee, who is overseeing the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political efforts.
Karen Nussbaum, the head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new Women's Department, said, "The position of the A.F.L. on abortion and reproductive rights is that we don't take a position as an institution, but we refer the matter to our affiliate unions." Geoffrey Garin, a pollster, said his surveys showed that union members' views on abortion mirrored those of the nation at large.
"By and large union leaders have credibility with their members on economic issues and the well-being of families," he said. "But union members do not necessarily want or expect union leaders to take a position on issues, like abortion or gun control, where there's no obvious connection to their lives as a union member."

HEADLINE: Hanoi Struggles to Reconcile Past and Future

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, June 29

 BODY:
The biggest applause of the day today went to the most enthusiastic speaker at Vietnam's Communist Party Congress, Jarvis Tyner, vice chairman of the American Communist Party.
"Long live proletarian internationalism!" he cried out. "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Vietnamese Communist Party and the Communist Party of the United States!" 
 His optimism seemed to offer a release for the Vietnamese delegates, still struggling after months of debate to redefine their party's role in a rapidly liberalizing economy, still unable to accomplish a transition to a new generation of leaders.
As a succession of foreign visitors took the floor beneath giant portraits of Marx and Lenin on the second day of the four-day congress, one Vietnamese delegate, Do Phuong, told reporters that a new, considerably younger Central Committee would be elected this weekend.
But Mr. Phuong, who as director general of the official Vietnam News Agency has become a de facto spokesman for the gathering, acknowledged that the party had failed to agree on changes at the top.
Though their replacements are ready to step in, he said, the ruling triumvirate of septuagenarian leaders -- the party's General Secretary, Do Muoi; its Prime Minister, Vo Van Kiet, and its President, Le Duc Anh -- will remain in place, perhaps for another year or two.
"At first," he said, "they wanted to retire. But after some discussions it was decided that this was not the time to make the change."
Mr. Phuong said the situation could change in the coming months. But the men likely to move up in the hierarchy, he added, include the liberal Mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, Troung Tan Sang, 47, and another rising star, Nong Duc Manh, 56, the chairman of the National Assembly.
He also cited two deputy prime ministers in their 50's, Tran Duc Luong and Pham Van Khai.
Mr. Phuong said the recent party discussions included debate over the pace of liberalization, a process that began 10 years ago and has accelerated over the last five years. During this period, growth has begun to transform Vietnam in ways that make some party members uneasy.
The leadership has decided to continue its attempt at an economic balancing act, aiming for a growth rate of 10 percent a year while continuing to accord primacy to less productive state-run enterprises.
A senior Western diplomat said this insistence on maintaining central control could make it difficult to meet targets for growth.
"They fear that if they give the private sector more room, it will become a political force," he said. "But you cannot maintain a 10 percent growth rate without very, very skillful management of the economy."
Caught in this dilemma, he said, the congress seems to want to pause for economic and political consolidation after years of rapid change.
Since 1990, when outside investment in Vietnam was negligible, foreign companies have committed $20 billion in investments. Taking advantage of Vietnam's new policies, some 25,000 foreign enterprises have registered to do business here.
"They are now dependent on foreign investment and foreign trade," the diplomat said. "But they want to retain the party system. They all wonder, 'Can we move with speed and protect our system?' "
While the leadership wrestled with these problems, it was the outsiders like Mr. Jarvis, and some of the old guard from the war years, who voiced the most unfettered idealism.
Mai Chi To, a former interior minister and brother of Le Duc To, who negotiated for peace in Paris with Henry Kissinger, insisted to foreign reporters that Communism was the wave of the future.
"It is the best system in the world," he said.
For Nikolai Bindyukov, the lone visitor from the resurgent but impoverished Russian Communist Party, the congress -- with its red bunting, heroic slogans and interminable speeches -- brought nostalgia "for the kind and good days of the past."
"But nostalgia is nostalgia," he said, as philosophical as Mr. Jarvis was buoyant. "We have to live with the political realities of today."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Makes Appeal to Patriotism in Texas

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 29

 BODY:
With his veteran's cap tilted across his brow, Bob Dole glorified America today in a tribute to honor, duty and country that highlighted his own military service and, by omission, President Clinton's lack of it.
Addressing the Texas convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Mr. Dole said that America's emergence as a world power in World War II "left its mark on people like Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, Lieutenant Richard Nixon and Lieutenant George Bush. It created a tradition of American leadership, shared by Republicans and Democrats." 
 Mr. Dole, 72, who earned two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star as a second lieutenant in Italy in World War II, added: "I want to preserve that legacy as President of the United States."
These were familiar themes for Mr. Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, but Texas is an important place for him to underscore them as he seeks to bolster his candidacy. The state has 32 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the Presidency in November.
He did not overtly criticize the President today because Mr. Clinton has been overseas, Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's press secretary, said. The President has been at a summit of the Group of Seven industrial democracies and Russia in Lyon, France.
In his most overt partisan reference, Mr. Dole said: "There's nothing flashy about me. I'm so dull, I hear someone fell asleep at the White House reading my F.B.I. files."
Like Utah and Arizona, Texas should almost automatically be in the Republican column, and most analysts predict that Texas will eventually fall to Mr. Dole. One of the most conservative states, Texas has not voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate since 1976. And it has evinced a deep antipathy toward President Clinton.
But the Texas Poll shows Mr. Dole's lead has narrowed. In March, he was ahead of Mr. Clinton by 56 percent to 40 percent. A week ago, that margin had slipped to a statistical dead heat.
"He has to reverse this pervasive mood of defeatism," Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston, said. "He needs to convey that he thinks he can win and he will put together a campaign that can do it. A lot of Texans don't think it will be there, and that's why this intraparty fighting has broken out," he said, referring to last week's divisive state convention, in which many of Mr. Dole's delegates were knocked off the slate for the party's national convention because they did not take a sufficiently hard line against abortion.
"If Dole can't get his act together in Texas, he might as well go fishing," said George Christian, press secretary to Lyndon B. Johnson and a longtime Democratic political adviser. "If I were predicting, I'd say Dole is going to carry Texas, but it's not a lay-down as it was during the Bush years."
Mr. Dole's visit is his second to Texas since winning enough delegates to claim his party's nomination in March. But on Friday, his visit included few public appearances. Mr. Dole attended two private fund-raising events closed to reporters and spent a brief period with children in physical therapy at the Texas Children's Hospital, an event were he was joined by his just-appointed Texas chairman, Gov. George W. Bush Jr., who, known for being a natural campaigner, planted a kiss on a little girl while Mr. Dole looked on.
The Governor, a loyal Republican, told reporters that it did not matter that Mr. Dole had said little at the event. Rather, he said, the images of his presence at the hospital sent a powerful message. Asked what that message was, since Mr. Dole had made no comments, Mr. Bush said it was this: "I'm in Houston, and this is an important part of the economy."
There was a strong military flavor to Mr. Dole's speech here today. Referring to the killing of American soldiers in Saudi Arabia last week, Mr. Dole said, "I would say to those -- and we may know some of those -- who sort of look down on the military, who say we spend too much on defense, it takes maybe a tragedy like this for those people to understand what liberty and freedom and duty and honor and God and country are all about."

Away From the Football Field, 'Reggie Lives the Life He Preaches'

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
HARDLY a day passes without a name athlete on the sports blotter. Illegal drugs. Guns. Sexual assault. Spousal abuse. Alcohol abuse. Driving under the influence.
Most athletes, like most people, are solid citizens, but by the nature of what constitutes news, the rotten apples' names are in headlines, their faces on television. More often than not, it seems, the rotten apples are the familiar names. 
 And then there's Reggie White.
He's not just the Green Bay Packers' defensive end, he's an ordained minister. He's not just the National Football League's career sack leader, he's the voice behind a campaign that could contribute as much as $8 million from N.F.L. players to help rebuild America's burned black churches.
"It just shows," he has said of the burned churches, "we've got problems we don't want to believe we have."
One of the burned churches is his church, the Inner City Community Church in Knoxville, Tenn., where he is the associate pastor, where he preached occasionally before flames lighted up the snowy darkness there Jan. 8.
"I believe that out of every bad situation, something great will happen," he has said. "When my church burned, it showed me that God is calling me to have an impact, to rally people from different ethnic backgrounds."
Of the $1.2 million required to rebuild his church, about $230,000 has been raised, mostly from predominantly white Packer fans in Wisconsin.
"Reggie lives the life he preaches about," said the Rev. David Upton, the Inner City pastor. "He's always reached out to help other people."
Now 34, White preached in high school in Chattanooga and at the University of Tennessee, where he was an all-American. In his years with the Eagles, he preached on Philadelphia street corners to teen-agers: stay in school, stay off drugs.
With a four-year, $19 million contract, the 6-foot-5-inch, 300-pound All-Pro has put his money where his mouth is. Two years ago, he helped organize the Community Development Bank in Knoxville for those who couldn't qualify for loans.
"To get it going," Upton said, "Reggie put up $1 million of his own."
Over the last 18 months, the despicable burning of some three dozen black churches, primarily in the South, has created the largest Federal arson investigation in the nation's history: nearly 250 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents along with another 250 state troopers and local police, some $21.5 million in additional funding.
And now pro football's Minister of Defense has challenged N.F.L. players to join the cause.
"Reggie mentioned this idea to me before his church was burned," said Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association. "He remembered how we did the same thing for the United Negro College Fund a few years ago. The players would sign over their $5,000 rebate checks from the union."
Each union member's annual dues are $5,000, but if licensing revenue pays the union's costs, all or part of that $5,000 is returned.
"I'll talk about it to the players, we'll send out letters, the player rep on each team will discuss it," Upshaw said. "The potential is $8 million for a foundation that would administer the money. This problem of churches being burned is not going away."
Upshaw remembered his Baptist church in Robstown, Tex., a few hours from the Mexican border.
"It was the glue to the community," he said. "Every Sunday you went to church all day. You had Sunday school at 9 in the morning, a worship and a sermon at 11, a service at 2 in the afternoon, another service at 6, then a worship and sometimes another sermon at 7:30. And if you weren't there, everybody knew it."
And when churches burn, everybody knows it.
"People always ask me," Reggie White has said, " 'As a minister, how do you justify the violence in football?' But I tell them: 'Football's not a violent game, football is an aggressive game. Violence is people shooting other people in the street.' "
Or people burning other people's churches.

HEADLINE: Columbia Trying to Show What a Gem It Is

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Not long after Emily Lloyd decided to leave New York City government to become a vice president of Columbia University, she began noticing how rarely Columbia seemed to surface on the city's psychic radar screen.
It was not like Harvard, which she remembered reading and hearing about constantly in the years she had spent in Boston, or even like the University of Pennsylvania as she recalled it from her Philadelphia days. 
 And when Ms. Lloyd started work in July 1994 and began making the rounds of Columbia trustees, faculty and alumni, she kept hearing the same complaint: interesting things were happening at Columbia, but who knew?
Now Columbia, arguably the most respected educational institution in New York City and its only Ivy League school, has decided it needs to pump up its public profile and draw attention to itself, especially within the city.
So it has dismissed the two top administrators who had served for years as the guardians of the university's image and replaced them with a former White House speechwriter with Hollywood experience.
To assist him, Columbia has signed up Howard J. Rubenstein, whose public-relations company attends to the image of the likes of George M. Steinbrenner 3d and Kathie Lee Gifford from his office 30 stories above midtown Manhattan.
The well-connected Mr. Rubenstein can now be found squiring Columbia's President, George Rupp, around the city, lining up audiences with editors and speaking engagements with civic and business groups.
Mr. Rubenstein's company has also enlisted Richard Valeriani, a former correspondent for NBC News, to "media train" Columbia scientists in how to speak, sit and even dress when talking to reporters.
In addition, the newly overhauled public affairs office is upgrading the choreography of Columbia's media events, calculating clever ways to attract the attention of reporters, especially television reporters.
When a group at Columbia began planning a news conference about a meeting of foreign environmental leaders, Allen Stone, the new public-affairs chief, had three suggestions: Center the news conference around the release of a document, bring in children (to give the event life) and hold the briefing in the morning (when reporters and television cameras are most likely to show up).
So, one May morning, 45 fifth and sixth graders from the nearby Bank Street School who had been studying conservation trooped across Broadway, onto the Columbia campus and up the Low Memorial Library steps. They settled in opposite environmental officials from places like Brazil and China, who were arrayed stiffly behind a long table to unveil "the Morningside Declaration."
As expected, the video cameras locked instantly onto the children's faces and stayed there throughout much of the briefing, which was turned over largely to the students' questions.
The lengths to which Columbia is going to attract attention illustrate a fact of life for universities today: the intense competitive and financial pressures brought on, in part, by waning government support.
In response, universities are vying to draw attention to their research and other programs in hopes of catching the eye of donors, funding agencies, potential students, even professors in the market for jobs.
Columbia's efforts also show the degree to which it let slide the business of self-promotion at a time when many schools, including New York University, 110 blocks south, were turning it into a science.
And while N.Y.U. embraced New York City in a kind of bearhug, Columbia had long seemed ambivalent about its hometown. Only in recent years has it seemed willing to treat the city as an asset more than a liability.
Dr. Rupp, not exactly a familiar fixture in the city, recalled recently how a Taiwanese woman had recognized him in the airport in Taipei after seeing his photograph in a local newspaper.
"In many ways, I think Columbia's strengths are appreciated more, well, in Tokyo or Taipei or Seoul than they are in New York," he said. "And that's a failure of communication, I guess."
Columbia is, after all, a significant force in New York City -- one of its biggest employers, a major property owner, a powerful stimulator of the economy, a health-care provider, a center of research on many aspects of city life.
When the university set about three years ago to catalogue the ways in which it contributes to New York, it ended up publishing a book, "Columbia and the City," that was 170 pages long.
Yet many people, including some inside Columbia, feel that its presence in the city is insufficiently felt and that for that reason neither the city nor Columbia take full advantage of their connection.
Part of the problem is geographic; Columbia falls outside the orbit of many New Yorkers. And, as Kenneth T. Jackson, chairman of the history department, put it: "New York is so big. Nobody dominates New York."
But Columbia has also been reticent about making its virtues more widely known, in part out of a belief that its successes should speak for themselves.
For years, the public-information office has been a modest operation -- a half-dozen people answering media queries and cranking out news releases on matters like appointments, prizes and actions by the trustees.
"We have had a very traditional approach to what we tell the world about ourselves," said Ms. Lloyd, executive vice president for administration. "If people ask, we are forthcoming. But if they don't ask, we don't go out and beat our drum because there is something unseemly about it."
Dr. Rupp suspects there was another reason, too. He believes Columbia developed "a defensive orientation" after 1968, when students seized the president's office, went on strike and severely disrupted the campus for six weeks.
Dr. Rupp, who found a panic button under the president's desk when he arrived from Rice University in Houston in 1993, said the attitude had been, "The best news was no news at all, just so we didn't get creamed the way Columbia got creamed in 1968."
When he proposed in 1993 to "exorcise the ghost of '68" by initiating talks with community groups in Harlem, he says, the two administrators he has since dismissed quickly shot back, "What are the downsides?"
"Their immediate reaction was, 'We shouldn't get exposed, we shouldn't take a risk,' " Dr. Rupp said. "So I think the communications strategy was designed to be self-protective."
But the times were changing. Other schools have become more enterprising about what they call "getting out the message," raising their profile in the eyes of prospective students, faculty, alumni, businesses and possible donors.
Take Washington University in St. Louis, a major research institution. Ten times a year, it sends out to 150 television stations around the nation videotaped reports about ongoing research, put together by a producer hired from a local station.
It dispatches radio news stories to stations worldwide, op-ed articles to newspapers and four fully executed feature stories every month to 1,200 print reporters and editors.
The university offers up professors to comment on public events, publishes a directory of faculty experts and goes out of its way to sponsor high-profile events, such as a Presidential debate this fall.
N.Y.U., too, has been aggressive. Under John Brademas, who spent 22 years in Congress before becoming N.Y.U.'s president, and now under his successor, L. Jay Oliva, the press office has prided itself on being user-friendly.
When the Democratic National Convention was held in New York City in 1992, the N.Y.U. administration recognized an opportunity and rounded up the names of 35 faculty members whose expertise might be useful to journalists.
Then Dr. Oliva invited them to a reception and explained why their cooperation with the media could be important to the school. The press office took the phone numbers at which they could be reached during the convention.
The efforts, aided by Mr. Rubenstein, who worked for N.Y.U. for years, seem to have paid off. The press office estimates that references to N.Y.U. appear in publications, excluding New York papers, more than 10,000 times a year.
The publicity has not gone unnoticed uptown -- in particular, an article on the front page of The New York Times in March 1995 describing how N.Y.U. had used fund-raising to rebuild itself from a mediocre school to a much better one.
"I heard from a lot of Columbia people, 'Why the hell is this story about N.Y.U. . . .?' " recalled Dr. Rupp, who contends that Columbia had raised more money during the same period "and invested it more wisely."
"That did irritate me," he said. "And it also got the goat of a number of Columbia people who let me know that they thought that, since we are a better institution, we ought to get at least reasonably comparable press notices."
Within months, a committee headed by Ms. Lloyd recommended that the two top administrators in charge of government and public affairs be replaced by Mr. Stone, a speechwriter for President Clinton.
A lawyer, former community organizer, longtime Congressional committee staff member, Presidential campaign aide and aspiring scriptwriter, Mr. Stone, 51, went to work last fall reinventing Columbia's approach to communications.
As for Mr. Rubenstein, N.Y.U. declined to renew his contract after a 20-year relationship -- right around the time that he went to work for Columbia. Purely coincidental, according to N.Y.U.
"While there was a time that we needed consultants, we don't need them now," said Naomi Levine, the senior vice president for external relations at N.Y.U. "The real way to get press is the quality of the institution."

HEADLINE: Immutability vs. Adaptability;
An Environmentalist Continues Her Fight

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
It has been more than a decade since Marcy Benstock slew her dragon, Westway, the superhighway, park and luxury real estate development that was to be built on land dumped into the Hudson River. It is an achievement the historian Robert Caro calls "one of the great victories in the history of New York in the 20th century."
The dragon is dead and buried, but the fight goes on. The enemy is now a park -- an emerald sliver to replace five miles of industrial riverfront desolation -- that many of Ms. Benstock's allies in the Westway wars favor. Some of them wonder why she can't just declare victory and move on. 
 "She's now fighting her friends," said State Senator Franz L. Leichter of Manhattan, who has been allied with Ms. Benstock in many battles. "She's opposing the very things we always thought she was for. In a certain sense, it's a personal tragedy."
In Manhattan's leftish political circles, Ms. Benstock's soft, clear voice and take-no-prisoners intensity made her the personification of the Westway opposition and of a distinctively New York style of environmental activism. Now she has become a more ambiguous symbol, of the power of opposition as an end in itself.
"It would be nice to have her on your side," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who said that he thinks the demise of Westway cost the city billions of dollars in economic development.
For Ms. Benstock, being a living symbol has had a price.
She works 12-hour days, has never married and lives on the $25,000 a year she earns as sole employee of the Clean Air Campaign, the environmental group she founded. But friends insist she is not one-dimensional. They describe her as warm, funny and there when they need her. One friend, Bunny Gabel, recalls repeated visits Ms. Benstock made to her and her new baby in the hospital at the height of the Westway wars.
But it remains a fact that friends feel the need to say Ms. Benstock is more than her cause. "She has other things she cares about and they are the normal human concerns," said Dr. Harold Varmus, now the director of the National Institutes of Health and a friend of Ms. Benstock's since she was 19. "She is a complex human being with tremendous attractiveness from many points of view."
But her intensity is a round-the-clock proposition, indicated by her habit of sometimes grabbing the phone -- she has no secretary, and it might be the Governor -- and shouting, "Don't bother me! I'm too busy!" Her knowledge is such that public officials call her for information on Hudson River issues. Even late at night she takes the subway rather than cabs, reflecting her small income as much as her frequently expressed commitment to mass transit.
"Commitment keeps you going," said Ms. Benstock a Radcliffe graduate once known as the "soot lady" for organizing West Siders to fight air pollution in the early 1970's. This grew into the Clean Air Campaign, which now has 600 members.
Ms. Benstock, who has strands of gray in her jet-black hair and says she is over 50, comes across as an articulate businesswoman. She giggles before she gets to her own punch lines. But her view of the world is as dark as midnight: Powerful businessmen use campaign contributions to push needless, environmentally deadly projects, then trumpet them with sophisticated public relations. To Ms. Benstock, governments are rife with secret agendas, slush funds and blind arrogance.
Her contention is that the Hudson River park, the latest in a long chain of park proposals, is the subsidiary of a public authority, the Empire State Development Corporation, which can do anything it wants in the way of development despite the fact that the subsidiary has its own board. Sometimes she accuses her enemies of plotting to pave the river, other times of planning to build pyramids there. The point, she insists, is to preserve it as is. In that case, delay can equal victory.
"Every year that the critical Hudson River is left in its natural state is another year for this extraordinary East Coast ecosystem," she has said.
Issues Shift,
But Fight Continues
Her persistence provokes some people to use words like saintly to describe her, and others, words like crazy. Can Marcy Benstock compromise and work toward a solution? Critics, even friendly ones, suggest that the fight-to-the-death approach of 1960's environmentalism is no longer relevant, particularly since the issues along the waterfront may have basically shifted against big development. She counters that the fight is the same, the difference being that her big-bucks enemies have become stealthier.
The proposed Hudson River park is meant to be for the 21st century what Central Park was for the 19th: a place of refuge and a spark to development in adjacent neighborhoods. Planners envision the refashioning of 13 rotting piers into recreational and cultural meccas that would include ballfields, playgrounds, boating facilities, lawns, fountains and a broad bikeway, all in an area presently dominated by razor ribbon.
Moreover, planners say that private concessions at three points comprising less than 10 percent of the park's 160 surface acres will enable the park to pay for itself at a time when state and city parks agencies are strapped for cash. This vision is sufficiently appealing to have struck some longtime Benstock allies as reason to consider dropping their opposition to development along the Hudson.
"There are many people who will less automatically agree with what she says," said Richard N. Gottfried, an Assemblyman representing the West Side who regards Ms. Benstock as "a genuine civic hero."
One of those people is Albert Butzel, the lead attorney in the Westway battle, who has been meeting with environmentalists to persuade them to support the park. "There's not as much difference as she thinks between what she would want from a West Side park and what's presented in that plan," Mr. Butzel said. But in two hours recently spent with Ms. Benstock, he could not sway her.
The dilemma is common among advocates, said Gene Russianoff, the senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group and a Benstock ally. "What percentage of the loaf are you willing to take?" he asked.
Of course, many of Ms. Benstock's detractors are part of the power elite she has spent a lifetime fighting. "People who blame her are selfish pigs anyway," said Bill Bowser, president of the West Village Committee, a group he helped the urbanist Jane Jacobs establish more than 40 years ago to beat back a proposed expressway smack through Greenwich Village.
"Marcy is our modern-day Jane Jacobs," he declared.
Others make a similar point in less flattering terms. "There is a value in someone being a cutting-edge fanatic," allowed Ross Graham, a West Side community advocate who opposed Westway but supports the new park.
A So-So Park
Or No Park at All?
But this is a touchy time. Although Gov. George E. Pataki's top economic advisers have endorsed the park and released a long-embargoed preliminary plan, the Governor has yet to agree to spend $100 million over the next 12 years. That would match the amount the city has already budgeted for the park, which is estimated to cost between $275 million and $300 million.
Park advocates are thus hoping that Mr. Pataki will approve the expenditure in a forthcoming environmental bond issue or in about 18 months when the environmental impact statement is done. On the other side, Ms. Benstock hopes the Governor rejects the park and reallocates money from other highway projects to do some simple landscaping and build a bike path.
Opponents, who already have three lawsuits pending against the park, can fight in environmental hearings, city land use hearings and in court. But as they do this, city and state agencies are already nibbling away at what would be the park by agreeing to pave land intended for grass at Chelsea Piers and elsewhere, asking for development proposals for other piers and making long-term plans for parking garbage trucks on one of them.
"In another six or eight months, the park is not going to be able to be constructed the way it was intended to be," said Peter Rothschild, a landscape architect who worked on the plan.
Ms. Benstock responds that no park is better than a bad park, and insists her back-to-basics alternative could be done in less than half the time at a fraction of the cost. She says she is waging the same fight she has fought for nearly a quarter of a century.
"The principles we fought Westway over are the same principles we hold today," she said, as she sat beneath towering piles of documents in her modest office near City Hall. "You either work for principles you believe are right or you don't."
Ms. Benstock grew up in Buffalo, and as a girl, enjoyed hiking in the woods. She recalls feeling environmental outrage for the first time at age 12 when a copper mine polluted the lake at a camp she attended in Ontario. Her role model was her generous grandfather, whom she called Mr. B and with whom she spent almost every Sunday puttering about the laundry he owned. He paid for her college education. "Mr. B was the world's most responsible person," she said.
At Radcliffe, she remembers being "a dreamy English major." She came to New York and got a job as a copy editor for the Book of Knowledge encyclopedia. She found an apartment on West 100th Street where she still lives. She became fascinated with studying people's faces in subway cars. She began to read a newspaper for the first time.
Linda Davidoff, who was briefly her roommate and went on to become president of the Parks Council, remembers her as nonpolitical but socially concerned. She said Ms. Benstock regularly read literature to a blind person in a nearby welfare hotel. She became interested in her block association and "went to a march or two."
A Mission
Founded in Soot
That, Ms. Benstock said, was "a drifting, searching" period. There were bouts of unemployment and a series of small editing jobs. She earned a master's degree in economics from the New School for Social Research, specializing in economic development. For two years, she left New York to work for Ralph Nader in Washington. There, she helped write a book on water pollution.
She returned to New York to discover soot all over her apartment -- on books, windowsills, everywhere. She got a small grant from the Fund for the City of New York to study why this happened and find ways to stop it. A first step was to get the city to agree to conduct an anti-pollution class for building superintendents if she could recruit 25. She got 114.
With volunteers, she conducted a survey that found 700 oil burners and 300 incinerators on the West Side were out of compliance with the city's clean-air code. After two years, soot was reduced 35 percent over a 200-block area. "It was a great lesson on what could be accomplished if ordinary citizens worked together," she said.
She says her opposition to Westway was a logical next step in her clean-air battle, because it would have meant greatly increased auto emissions. Other issues came later, from the health of the Hudson's striped bass to the possibility of using Westway funds for mass transit. Ms. Benstock honed her specialty: distibuting mountains of well-organized information, often typed single-space on both sides of the page to save paper.
The result of the efforts of Ms. Benstock and hundreds of others was that in 1985 Mayor Koch and Governor Mario M. Cuomo threw in the towel and asked Washington to transfer more than $1 billion in Westway appropriations to mass transit. "She was virtually intractable," said Mr. Cuomo, who wrote her a congratulatory note.
Ms. Benstock has made enemies. Edward Kirkland, a member of Community Board 4 and a supporter of the original Westway, calls her "a disingenuous and dishonest opponent." Tom Fox, first president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, which was formed to manage the new park, calls her a "zealot" and "dictator."
Friends say such attacks come with the territory. "Marcy can take a lot of heat and a lot of abuse," said Deborah J. Glick, a Manhattan assemblywoman who is Ms. Benstock's closest political ally. "This is a tough fight, not because we're wrong, but because there's a lot of money at stake."
Many of today's comments about "the woman who killed the big road" tend to be softer, but somehow more troubling. People wonder why she has repeatedly refused to accept legislation that would protect the Hudson, on the grounds that the protection was not absolute. They point out that she won a slew of awards from environmental and civic groups a decade ago, and virtually none since then.
"The great crusaders sometimes become tired and frayed," said Ms. Davidoff, who is now working on Ruth Messinger's mayoral campaign. "What's the personal cost of being Joan of Arc all your life?"

HEADLINE: At Summit Talks, Serbs Are Pressed on Ouster of Leader

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: LYONS, France, June 29

 BODY:
President Clinton and seven other international leaders threatened Serbia today with eventual reimposition of United Nations economic sanctions if it did not use its influence to press Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader indicted on charges of war crimes, to step down from political office.
The leaders set no deadline for Dr. Karadzic to step down, but they made it clear that he had to do so well before the elections to choose new leaders in all parts of Bosnia on Sept. 14. 
 Although they have been pressuring Serbia for months to use its influence to get Dr. Karadzic and the indicted Bosnian Serb military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, to step aside, today's explicit threat carried a new sense of urgency.
Carl Bildt, the international civilian coordinator for Bosnia, came here asking the leaders to set a Monday deadline for Dr. Karadzic's resignation, which is called for under the Bosnia peace agreement that was negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, last November.
The leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, joined at their summit meeting by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia, said they were ready to consider reimposing sanctions on any party to insure compliance with the Dayton accords, but did not explicitly endorse Mr. Bildt's deadline.
"We will support appropriate action by Mr. Bildt, though I have to say we have no information that there is a Monday deadline," Mr. Clinton said today at an outdoor news conference.
But a German diplomat said the expectation was that Dr. Karadzic would step down over the weekend, and Prime Minister John Major of Britain said, "By Monday, we will hear something from Mr. Karadzic; otherwise swift action will follow afterwards."
United Nations sanctions banning all trade with Serbia were lifted after Belgrade agreed to the peace accord last November, but similar restrictions on trade with the Bosnian Serbs remained in place until February.
Mr. Clinton said that both Mr. Bildt and the commander of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia had authority under the Dayton accords to recommend a reimposition of sanctions.
Leaders of the seven countries -- France, Italy, Germany, Britain, the United States, Canada and Japan -- pledged to contribute "substantially" to preparations for the Sept. 14 elections in Bosnia by helping to bolster independent news media there and by sending 2,000 observers to insure that the vote is free and fair. They also urged the NATO-led peacekeepers to increase their activities to provide the atmosphere of safety and security the electoral process needs.
Earlier, they had condemned the bombing on Tuesday that killed 19 United States Air Force personnel in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and today Mr. Clinton announced that Wayne A. Downing, a retired Army general and former commander in chief of the United States Special Operations Command, would lead an investigation and make recommendations within 45 days on how to prevent further attacks like it.
The President and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then flew to Paris late this afternoon for dinner with President Jacques Chirac and his wife, Bernadette, before flying on to Florida for memorial ceremonies for the victims of the Dhahran bombing.
Before a meeting with the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose re-election Mr. Clinton opposes, and heads of three other international organizations here, the President joined in a pledge of financial and political support for the United Nations.
All eight leaders promised "scrupulous respect by member states for their financial obligations" to the United Nations, including American payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in back dues. But they also called for "a more equitable scale of contributions," something long called for by the United States, which now has to pay a quarter of the organization's budget, more than any other country.
Mr. Clinton's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, described the atmosphere in the leaders' meeting with the beleaguered Mr. Boutros-Ghali as "correct and dignified." Mr. Chirac and the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, both said today that all the European leaders present were strongly supportive of Mr. Boutros-Gahli's re-election.
All the leaders came here to do was talk, and mostly there was little beyond broad, droning declarations to show for the three days of meetings that took place in the Museum of Contemporary Art here, a building designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano set in a park on the banks of the Rhone River that thousands of police sealed off from the public for the duration.
On Thursday, the leaders condemned the Dhahran bombing, and called a conference in Paris for mid-July to work out specific measures governments can take to combat terrorism more effectively.
If Mr. Clinton expected to get his European allies to agree to break off trade and diplomatic relations with Iran, which the United States regards as a leading source of terrorism, he succeeded only in getting them to join in calling on Iran to stop supporting "extremist groups that are seeking to destroy the peace process in the Middle East and to destabilize the region."
The summit leaders asked Iran to reject terrorism and stop endorsing threats to the life of the British author Salman Rushdie, who is under an Islamic sentence of death for writing a novel that Iranian religious leaders considered blasphemous.
On the rest of the Middle East, the leaders had little to say beyond urging Syria and Israel to resume negotiations on a peace agreement and all parties to live up to accords reached before momentum stalled over security concerns.
"We note the preeminence of the theme of security in Israel's recent election campaign," their statement said. "We are convinced that the security of all people of the region can eventually be achieved only through comprehensive, equitable and lasting peace."
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia had been invited to come to the last two days of the summit gathering, but stayed home to campaign for the second round of his country's presidential election on Wednesday and then was reported to have fallen ill with laryngitis.
Mr. Clinton said today that Mr. Chernomyrdin had reported that Mr. Yeltsin was down with a sore throat. "Something that I can identify with in a campaign year," the President added.

HEADLINE: Saudi Kingdom Shows Cracks, U.S. Aides Fear

BYLINE: The following article is based on reporting by Elaine Sciolino, Jeff Gerth and Douglas Jehl and was written by Ms. Sciolino. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
When a bomb struck Saudi Arabia's National Guard headquarters last November, killing five Americans, King Fahd was thunderstruck. "Catastrophes are coming at us one after the other," he confided to a close associate.
Two weeks later, the King experienced a catastrophe of his own: he suffered a debilitating stroke, forcing the royal family to grapple with the issue of who will rule the country. 
 Until recently, the United States took for granted the stability of its most strategic Arab ally. But a decade of overspending, the rise of a militant domestic opposition and uncertainties about the royal succession have opened new cracks in the House of Saud.
This week's catastrophe -- the truck bombing that killed 19 American military personnel in Dhahran -- deepened the worries in Washington about the future of the world's largest oil producer and raised hard questions about how the United States can best protect its enormous stake in Saudi Arabia.
"There has been an unwillingness to confront the Saudis," one senior Administration official said. "We all know they're in transition, but no one wants to go to them and say that there is a danger in the kingdom and ask, 'Who's in charge?' An episode like the bombing forces you to think hard about doing these things."
There are limits to what the United States feels it can do to effect change in the country.
Greater tolerance of political and religious voices, an American goal elsewhere in the world, might open the door to broader unrest. The dispatch of additional American troops, either to improve security at American bases or to help strengthen the Government, could prove counterproductive in a country where much of the population views foreigners with suspicion.
For the moment, the Clinton Administration's official policy is to refrain from putting pressure on the royal family.
In an interview shortly before he left for Saudi Arabia, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said he did not plan to press the Saudis on the issues of succession or internal opposition.
"I certainly don't push them on either of those issues," he said. "This, as far as I'm concerned, is an internal Saudi problem."
The American-Saudi relationship is based on a series of delicate balances.
 
The Alliance
 
Oil and Arms Bind U.S. and Saudis
The defense of the country and its oilfields depends on the United States military presence in the region. But the Saudis barely tolerate the visible presence on their soil of roughly 5,000 American troops, which stems from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and two years ago they refused to house an armored brigade's worth of equipment needed for American security plans.
To preserve this crucial relationship, the United States does not press the kingdom on a whole range of issues, from human rights problems to the lack of political and religious freedom.
While American military contractors have benefited greatly from Saudi purchases of equipment, these arms imports have contributed to Saudi Arabia's financial woes and have become a source of friction within the royal family.
Even so, the consensus among outside experts and American officials is that the royal family maintains a firm grip on power and that Saudi Arabia's fundamental alignment with the United States is unlikely to change. Any questions about the kingdom's stability take on disproportionate weight because of its irreplaceable role as the world's largest oil producer by far -- pumping eight million barrels a day. If anything, uncertainty is likely to tighten the embrace of the United States and the Saudis.
"There are places in the world where our national interest is in doubt," said Ray Mabus, the former Mississippi Governor who recently left his post as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. "This isn't one of them. That's because of the impact oil has on the world economy and on our economy. We went to war over that principle."
 
The Economy
 
From Petrodollars To Debt Pileup
In the past, the Saudi Government has dealt with problems like internal royal family disputes, popular discontent and external threats in a straightforward way: it has thrown money at them.
The estimated 17 million residents of Saudi Arabia live in one of the world's most generous welfare states. They pay no taxes and enjoy an elaborate array of subsidies from education to housing to health care.
Now, the country suffers from diminished financial resources, the result of 12 consecutive years of budget deficits and the $55 billion cost of the Persian Gulf war against Iraq, an amount that exceeded the Government's total revenues in 1992.
The transformation of Saudi Arabia from a country of unlimited economic horizons to one suffering from financial problems is captured in the most recent confidential analysis by the International Monetary Fund.
The fund's annual review last September found that even though Saudi Arabia had made progress in reducing Government spending, the Government's debt continued to increase because of large trade and budget deficits.
Domestic debt -- what the Government owes to local lenders -- was almost $100 billion in 1994, 77 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The monetary fund's staff projected that the proportion would reach 110 percent by 2000. This means that Saudi banks will have great difficulty financing private enterprise.
Since the fund's report was written, oil prices have risen, improving the prospects that the kingdom might be able to achieve a balanced budget in 1996. But the country's per capita income has declined by 50 percent in the last 12 years, and structural financial problems remain, which contribute to a sense of uneasiness in the country.
Although the Clinton Administration applauds Saudi efforts to control spending, officials acknowledge that those efforts are insufficient.
"They are controlling the overall budget much more carefully than they did over the last few years," said Jeffrey R. Shafer, the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. But, he added, "there is more they need to do."
One of the most widely criticized aspects of the Saudi relationship with Washington is arms deals. In the 1980's the kingdom paid more than $28 billion to the Pentagon for military goods and services from American contractors. By 1993 the total of pending Saudi military orders was roughly equal to what the Pentagon spent for itself that year on major weapons systems.
Those days ended abruptly. The Saudis have placed no significant new arms orders in the last few years, following the advice of Pentagon officials to curb their appetite for weapons.
The Saudis' financial problems became so great that they have had to stretch out the repayment schedule for pending orders, avoiding the shutdown of American production lines.
Proportionally to the size of their economy, the Saudis still spend as much on defense as any other country in the world. Yet a forthcoming book on Saudi security by Anthony Cordesman, a military analyst, argues that the kingdom will always need the United States to defend it against an ever-present external enemy, whether Iraq or Iran, and that its primary security threats are internal.
One key to resolving them, the book says, is to create more private-sector jobs to meet the needs of a population that is growing at a staggering rate.
 
The Opposition
 
Splinter Groups And Afghan Vets
Who is the favorite target of the discontented? The United States military presence on Saudi soil.
"America -- we urgently call upon God Almighty to destroy its economy and society, to transform its states into countries and turn them against each other and to make it an example to all nations."
That anti-American diatribe was contained in a much-circulated sermon delivered in early 1993 by a man who is considered the most charismatic cleric in Saudi Arabia, Sheik Salman al-Awdah.
Militant preachers like him and Sheik Safar al-Hawali, the former dean of Islamic studies at Umm al-Qura University in Mecca, have exposed deep pockets of opposition to the current rulers, and worry the Saudi leadership.
Although there are divisions among the dissidents, much of their message is the same: the royal family is secular and corrupt and has betrayed the laws of Islam; the presence of infidel American troops is against Islam, and they must go.
Rather than open up the rigid political system after the gulf war, the response of the Saudi leadership has been to muzzle all dissent.
In the fall of 1994, the two sheiks were arrested with more than 400 others termed dissidents as part of a major crackdown against religious opposition. The two men are believed to be in prison -- although they have never been tried -- according to the State Department's 1995 global human rights report.
Despite the Government's efforts to snuff out their message, cassette tapes of the two sheiks' sermons circulate clandestinely in pockets throughout the country.
"The most charismatic of the preachers is al-Awdah," said Richard A. Smith, a former United States Government analyst on Saudi Arabia who has prepared CD-ROM's about the kingdom for his consulting company, Ardaman Industries.
It is impossible to judge how much of a following the dissidents have.
In confessions -- which may have been coerced -- the four Sunni Muslim Saudis convicted last month for the bomb blast against the National Guard in November said they had read the writings of Islamic extremists abroad.
The men, who were later executed, said they had smuggled the explosives used in the bomb attack from Yemen. Three said they had served with Islamic fighters in Afghanistan, and one of the three in Bosnia as well.
While it is still not known who carried out last Tuesday's attack that left 19 Americans dead, Mr. Perry says the investigation is centered on the possibility that it was the same group that carried out the November bombing. Whatever the case, the gap between the kingdom's rulers and its people seems to be growing, and a generation of Saudis radicalized by militant Islamic teachings may have the will and the capacity to carry out more violence in the future.
Indeed, given the extensive American arming and training of Islamic fighters challenging the Soviet military in Afghanistan, it is not inconceivable that the killers who attacked the Dhahran air base had earlier worked in concert with the Central Intelligence Agency.
"There are so many underground parties -- so many splinter groups, many of them made up of people who fought in Afghanistan," said Mohammed al-Masaari, an exiled Saudi religious militant, when asked in an interview in London about who might have been responsible for the recent bombing. "I expect more of the same. The political environment breeds it."
 
The Leadership
 
Family Tensions As Worries Grow
The Saudi Government is worried by the ease with which explosives are smuggled into the country.
In March, Saudi border guards intercepted a Chevrolet Caprice from Jordan that was packed with sophisticated high explosives.
The royal family has begun to face the same kind of violence that has wracked other countries in the region at a time when its leadership is in transition.
King Fahd, who is in his mid-70's, is not always lucid, Western associates close to the royal family say, and a transfer of power is already under way. Crown Prince Abdullah, the King's half-brother and designated heir, has essentially assumed the day-to-day operations of the Government.
But there are underlying tensions among the senior royals, particularly between the Crown Prince on one side and the King's full brothers Prince Sultan, the Defense Minister, and, to a lesser extent, Prince Nayef, the Interior Minister, on the other. Some of the royals have urged the King to retire to Spain, American officials say.
"The Crown Prince's support structure is simply not in place," said one Administration official who knows Prince Abdullah. "He will be King, but in terms of how things get done, there is a competition for influence and he is not as good a player."
The Crown Prince, who is head of the National Guard, is an austere, no-nonsense leader who is uncomfortable making small talk because of a noticeable stutter, say Administration officials who have dealt with him.
Prince Sultan, by contrast, is expansive, effusive and very comfortable with foreigners.
The tension between the two Princes is most dramatically illustrated in their different attitudes toward military spending.
Prince Abdullah has been struggling to rein in military spending even more. His efforts have alienated family members aligned with Sultan, who have much to lose financially if new projects do not go forward.
Prince Sultan, on the other hand, is much more willing to spend. In the wake of the 1991 gulf war, he came up with a number of ambitious military projects that were approved by the King but apparently not by other important ministers.
The Crown Prince seems determined to forge strategic relationships with other Arab countries without becoming anti-American.
American military contractors train his National Guard, and five Americans were among those killed in last November's bombing of its headquarters.
After the most recent bombing, Mr. Clinton and other senior Administration officials have expressed America's firm commitment to the stability of the kingdom and to a continued American presence there.
This ferment has not moved the Administration to press the Saudis harder, underscoring the mutually dependent if reluctant relationship.
"We're not doing them a favor by being there," Defense Secretary Perry said in the interview just before he left for Saudi Arabia. "They're not doing us a favor in letting us stay there. Each of us believes that this contributes to the stability of the region."

HEADLINE: Where, Oh Where, Have All the Corporate Raiders Gone?

BYLINE: By MARGARET ISA 

 BODY:
THEY were the much-feared and often reviled commanders of the takeover wars of the 1980's. Fueled by junk bonds, they raided corporate America seemingly at will, and made vast fortunes. In their heyday, they hobnobbed with the junk-bond king Michael R. Milken at his annual "Predators' Ball."
But this is the 1990's. Junk bonds and greenmail are out, Mr. Milken is a private citizen after spending two years in jail and paying $1.1 billion in fines and settlements for securities-laws violations, and a restructured corporate America has made itself resistant to the unwanted attentions of wheeler-dealers. 
 And the former corporate raiders? They are older, of course, and some are ailing. Some are prospering, but others have been forced to seek Chapter 11 protection for their debt-laden companies -- or give them up altogether. A few have scaled back their ambitions to such undertakings as running Burger Kings in Israel or doing consulting work for a little computer company in the West. A couple have run afoul of the law, receiving punishments ranging from 20 months in prison to serving meals to the homeless.
Here is a look at some of the men -- there are no women in their ranks -- who with Irwin L. Jacobs helped define the decade of greed, and where they are today.
 
THE BASSES
Sid, Lee, Robert (left) and Edward Bass, whose holdings include oil and real estate, scored one of their biggest and most publicized victories in 1984 with a huge but friendly investment in the Walt Disney Company, which was busily fighting off an assault by Saul P. Steinberg. The tale of that convoluted transaction was told in a 1987 book by John Taylor, "Storming the Magic Kingdom." All four brothers, as well as their father, Perry, and Sid's former wife, Anne, are on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. The brothers divided up their fortune in the 1980's to pursue separate business strategies and interests. Sid, who had been most active in managing the family's business affairs, has largely escaped the limelight. Earlier this year, however, he created a stir in the art community by increasing his investment group's stake in Sotheby's Holdings Inc. The youngest, Lee, was embroiled in a controversy over a $20 million donation he made to Yale University five years ago. The university returned the money last year because Lee had stipulated that it be used for a Western Civilization curriculum and wanted to approve the instructors himself. What one brother taketh away, another brother giveth: Last month, Robert made a $20 million donation to Yale to renovate its residence halls. The entire brood has joined in a venture called Sundance Square to renovate the historic downtown area of Fort Worth, with brother Edward in charge. Edward, an avid environmentalist, also financed the Biosphere II project near Tucson, Ariz., a $150 million attempt to create a self-sustaining ecosystem inside a glass bubble, where eight people lived for two years.
 
THE BELZBERGS
Canada's Belzberg brothers -- Samuel (left), Hyman and William -- failed spectacularly in their 1990 attempt to acquire Armstrong World Industries. Not only did their prey escape, but the Lancaster, Pa., home-products company also lobbied successfully for passage in Pennsylvania of some of the country's toughest anti-takeover legislation.
The Belzbergs ended up losing $13.6 million in their aborted bid, and their Vancouver flagship company, the First City Financial Corporation, showed a $228 million loss for 1990. Though the family then said it was shifting its focus to West Coast real estate, environmental services and friendly transactions, things went from bad to worse. In 1991, American regulators seized a California savings and loan owned by First City Financial, saying it was poorly managed. As losses of the Belzberg company widened to $324 million, Swiss bondholders gained majority control and renamed it the Harrowston Corporation. The Belzbergs, however, kept a 15 percent stake and installed a member of the next generation, Brent, as president.
 
PAUL A. BILZERIAN
Mr. Bilzerian is doing worse, in some ways, than most. In top form in 1988 when he acquired the Singer Companies, a military contractor, in a $1.06 billion hostile takeover, he was convicted a year later of nine felony counts; fined $1.5 million and sentenced to four years in prison (later reduced to 20 months) for securities-law violations, including filing false information with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In sentencing him, the judge said he was increasing the prison term because he believed Mr. Bilzerian had perjured himself. The charges stemmed from his acquisition of large blocks of stock in two companies: Cluett, Peabody & Company and the Hammermill Paper Company. After filing for personal bankruptcy in 1991, Mr. Bilzerian has stayed out of the public eye of late, leading a quiet life in the 22,901-square-foot Tampa compound that he fondly calls the "Taj Mahal." (Florida law protects homes -- no matter how big -- from creditors.) In 1994, he was hired as a management consultant by Cimetrix Inc., a small computer company in Utah.

ROBERT CAMPEAU
Mr. Campeau's department store empire tumbled two years after he completed it. The Canadian financier's hostile takeovers of Allied Stores Inc. for $3.4 billion in late 1986, and then Federated Department Stores for $6.6 billion in 1988, left his Campeau Corporation awash in debt just when junk bond prices collapsed in the late 1980's. In 1990, both retailing units were forced to seek bankruptcy protection and Mr. Campeau was ousted as chairman and chief executive. In a 1992 reorganization, Campeau Corporationwas renamed the Camdev Corporation and Mr. Campeau ended up with a 2 percent stake. Camdev now deals only in real estate.
 
ASHER B. EDELMAN
Back in 1985, Barron's magazine called Mr. Edelman "the newest kid on the takeover block" and described the "fierce struggle" by the Datapoint Corporation to fend off him off. Datapoint lost the battle, and Mr. Edelman continues to run the San Antonio-based maker of computer networks as chairman and chief executive. Datapoint, which had $174 million in revenue last year, has been losing money for several years. But it is mostly Mr. Edelman's lavish life-style, rather than his raiding skills, that has captured the public's attention in the 1990's. He has a large, and by some accounts risque, art collection. Last November, he sold Jasper Johns's "Winter" from the "Four Seasons" series for $3 million, and in May he put another Johns work, "Gray Painting With Ball," up for auction but failed to get the $1.5 million minimum he was asking.
Mr. Edelman also has a taste for spacious living quarters; in 1994, he sold his 23-room penthouse on East End Avenue in Manhattan, complete with a 63-foot-long entrance gallery, two libraries, a gym, a four-bedroom children's wing and planted terraces overlooking the East River -- for $5.85 million. His artworks haven't immunized him from the nitty-gritty of the business world, however. Mr. Edelman and his company recently settled a lawsuit over the sale of land in Texas for an undisclosed sum after a jury had awarded the plaintiff a total of $63 million. And five years ago, he agreed to pay $436,858 in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had accused him of waiting two days before disclosing his additional purchases in September 1989 of Datapoint stock.
 
SIR JAMES GOLDSMITH
Sir James has been devoting himself increasingly to politics. The English-French financier, who once owned the American supermarket chain Grand Union, sold most of his business interests before the stock market crash of 1987. A committed conservative who wrote editorials for the French magazine L'Express when he controlled it in the 1980's, he is turning his guns these days on European unification. He has written a book, "Le Piege" (The Trap), that criticizes plans for a single European currency. In 1994, he won a seat on the European Parliament. He also founded the Referendum Party in Britain, which has threatened to sponsor single-issue candidates in any election where the Labor and Conservative parties refuse to support a national plebiscite on "the sort of Europe of which Britain wants to be a part."
 
CHARLES E. HURWITZ
Mr. Hurwitz has made headlines recently with his fight to end Federal logging restrictions on his redwood forests. Maxxam Inc., a conglomerate that he controls, went heavily into debt in 1986 to buy the Pacific Lumber Company for $900 million, and now Mr. Hurwitz wants to chop down thousands of acres of giant evergreens on Pacific Lumber property to pay down his debt. Environmentalists want to protect the old-growth trees and the endangered coastal birds, marbled murrelets, that live in them. In May, Pacific Lumber sued the Federal Government, demanding an end to the logging restrictions on the grounds that they violate the Constitutional prohibition on taking private property without compensation. The Federal Government wants to buy some of of Pacific Lumber's land, but the two sides have not been able to agree on a price.
 
CARL C. ICAHN
Mr. Icahn is perhaps the busiest of the bunch. He is now trying to wrest control of RJR Nabisco Holdings to force a spinoff of the food business from the tobacco operations, a move that he contends would produce a bonanza for stockholders. Mr. Icahn failed to win control of the board of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation with his ally, Bennett S. LeBow, in April, but earlier this month he severed his agreement with Mr. LeBow, an increasingly unpopular figure with Wall Street.
Mr. Icahn has also changed with the times, seeking out stakes in distressed companies that he can turn into good investments. In 1995, he bought up debt of Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the trust that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center. Mr. Icahn has also gone into the consolidator business in a deal he made with Trans World Airlines Inc., a company he once owned. As part of its bankruptcy restructuring, T.W.A. gave Mr. Icahn the right to buy tickets with a face value of $610 million at a discount and then resell them. The airline plans to use the money it gets from selling him the tickets to pay him back the $190 million it owes him.
 
BENNETT S. LEBOW
Mr. LeBow has been making waves in the tobacco world. With his fellow financier, Carl C. Icahn, he fought a fierce battle this year for control of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, which the two men wanted to split up into separate food and tobacco companies in the hope of driving up the stock value. Their bid was soundly defeated in April. Separately, Mr. LeBow's Liggett Group Inc., the nation's fifth-largest tobacco company, broke ranks with the rest of the industry in March and settled with the lawyers for anti-tobacco plaintiffs.
Mr. LeBow also came close to forging an alliance in April with an entrepreneur, Jay MacDonald, to buy three troubled women's magazines: Working Woman, Working Mother, and Ms.Mr. LeBow agreed to pay off the magazines' $25 million in debt and put up $3.5 million in new working capital, but he pulled out after NatWest, the biggest creditor, demanded that he forfeit the $3.5 million if the deal fell through. Mr. MacDonald later linked up with Paxson Communications to make the purchase.
 
RONALD O. PERELMAN
Mr. Perelman, who acquired Revlon Inc. in a $1.8 billion hostile takeover in 1986, is doing better than most of his counterparts. He took the cosmetics company public in February to raise money to repay some of Revlon's $2.2 billion debt.Mr. Perelman also owns the comic-book and sports-card publisher Marvel Entertainment Group Inc.. and New World, an entertainment empire that includes television stations and a production company. The flayboyant financier has probably made as many appearances in the gossip columns as he has on the business pages. He recently married Patricia Duff, a Democratic Party activist and mother of his one-year old daughter.
Mr. Perelman, who is a Republican, has five other children from two earlier marriages. His previous wife, the gossip reporter Claudia Cohen, walked away with an $80 million divorce settlement and then had a short-lived romance with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York. Mr. Perelman can frequently be found at charity dinners, parties and nightclubs.
He was embroiled last year in a high-profile spat with the former chief financial officer of his MacAndrew & Forbes holding company, Fred Tepperman, who said he had been wrongfully dismissed by Mr. Perelman for taking time off from work to care for his wife, who had Alzheimer's disease. The company had its own side of the story, contending in a countersuit that it had dismissed Mr. Tepperman for neglecting his duties. The two sides reached a out-of-court settlement, the terms of which were not disclosed.
 
T. BOONE PICKENS
Mr. Pickens, the Texas oilman who railed against entrenched managers who were no friends of the common stockholder, came full circle this month by stepping down as chairman and chief executive officer of Mesa Inc., the energy company he founded 40 years ago. Mesa had been straining under more than $1 billion of debt, and a group of shareholders, led by David Batchelder, a board member and former Mesa president and Pickens protege, had been seeking to unseat Mr. Pickens on the grounds that he had mismanaged company finances. Richard Rainwater, whom Mr. Pickens had recruited to help defend Mesa against the dissidents, is expected to install his own team now. Analysts attribute Mr. Pickens's downfall in part on his losing gamble that natural-gas prices would jump. His quiet departure contrasts vividly with the high-profile runs he made in the 1980's on energy giants like Gulf Oil, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal.
 
VICTOR POSNER
Mr. Posner once reigned over a financial empire with substantial stakes in about 40 companies. But the Sharon Steel Corporation, the linchpin of his holdings, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1987, and Mr. Posner has spent the last decade in and out of court. In a 1987 conviction for tax evasion, the Miami financier was sentenced to serve meals to the homeless and to help pay for homeless shelters. In 1989, he was sued by shareholders of the DWG Corporation, who accused him of plundering the company. To resolve the lawsuit, Mr. Posner agreed in 1992 to resign as chairman of DWG and to give up his controlling stake in the conglomerate, which owned the Arby's Inc., fast-food chain; the Royal Crown Cola Company, and the National Propane Corporation. In 1993, he was convicted of securities fraud relating to his 1984 bid for the Fischbach Corp., a New York electrical contractor. Mr. Posner was permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company and was ordered to give up $3.5 million. Last year, he was sued by his son Steven, who accused his father of plundering the closely held Security Management Corporation, an owner of rental property controlled by the elder Mr. Posner. His lawyer at the time said Mr. Posner intended to vigorously defend himself.
 
JAY A. PRITZKER
Mr. Pritzker, the Chicago financier whose family owns several closely held businesses, including the Hyatt Corporation and Regency Cruises Inc., has spent the last few years feuding with another, albeit part-time, raider, Donald J. Trump. In 1993, Mr. Trump had sued the Pritzker family over its management of their jointly owned hotel, the Grand Hyatt in New York. Mr. Trump asserted that Hyatt's management had engaged in questionable accounting practices, and in 1994, Hyatt countersued for breach of contract. They settled the suits last year for an undisclosed sum.In 1993, Jay's brother Robert, who runs the Marmon Group, the family's private industrial empire, became chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers and used it as a bully pulpit to expound his fairly conservative views on Washington's role in economic matters.
 
MESHULAM RIKLIS
Mr. Riklis's empire has been coming apart since the late 1980's. He still has McCrory, the chain of five-and-dime stores he bought in 1960, but it has been operating under Chapter 11 protection for four years. The three other major companies Mr. Riklis ran in the 1980's also ended up in bankruptcy proceedings as a result of heavy debts. Mr. Riklis recently fought a battle with prostate cancer. And, to pay the settlement for his divorce from the entertainer Pia Zadora, his homes and art collection have been put up for sale. He has recently started smaller businesses, like Burger Kings in Israel.
 
HAROLD SIMMONS
Mr. Simmons is holding steady, still in control of a number of companies. Earlier this month, one of them, Valhi Inc., agreed to sell its Amalgamated Sugar Company refinery to the Snake River Sugar Company, a cooperative of 1,600 sugar-beet farmers, for $250 million in a tax-favorable transaction. Valhi is likely to use the proceeds to pay down debt and put capital into its other businesses, which include forest products, fast food and hardware products.
 
SAUL P. STEINBERG
These days, Mr. Steinberg's family owns just under 50 percent of Reliance Group Holdings, a seller of property-casualty insurance that Mr. Steinberg purchased in 1968 and used as a vehicle for his other financial dealings. Analysts say the company has been restructured well, posting strong earnings in some recent quarters. Trouble is, Mr. Steinberg suffered a stroke about a year ago. The Brooklyn-born financier needed several hours of physical therapy a day to regain the use of his left arm and hand.

HEADLINE: At Hotels, A Separate Peace

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE; BETSY WADE writes the Practical Traveler column.

 BODY:
IF you ask directory assistance in Dallas for the telephone number of the Nonsmokers Inn, you are given (214) 631-6633. If you ring, the person answering says, "Classic Motor Inn." In the difference is the history of the grand 1981 dream of Lyndon Sanders, the owner, who yielded to his managers' recommendations in 1991. Smoking is now permitted in 20 percent of the 135 rooms.
On the other hand, if you call the Country Inn and Suites by Carlson in Roseville, Minn., between Minneapolis and St. Paul, you can learn that all 57 rooms have been designated for nonsmokers. This property, which opened two years ago, operates on a franchise from Carlson, a major group of travel companies, which owns the Radisson chain. According to Thomas J. Polski, a Carlson spokesman, all Country Inns must offer at least 65 percent nonsmoking rooms, but the Roseville manager bought the idea 100 percent. 
 With the exception of the Roseville motel and apparently only a few other places, most smokers and nonsmokers should be able to find what they want in the way of a hotel room. Managers keep fine-tuning their percentages to match demand, with the result that the number of hotels providing at least some nonsmoking rooms keeps rising.
The key to getting a room to suit a need is to specify it on the reservation, and the more important this is, the more urgent the request should be. It may not always occur to those who smoke, but they should ask about rules affecting lobby spaces and hotel restaurants, unless they want to smoke standing outdoors.
The short history of the nonsmoking hotel room, which a 1985 academic study said began in 1973 at a single hotel owned by the Hotel Investors Group, demonstrates the impact of market forces, in contrast with the history of nonsmoking in public spaces -- aboard airlines, trains and buses and in restaurants -- where health advocates have turned to legislation and regulation.
California did enact hotel legislation, after what Jim Abrams, executive vice president of the California Hotel and Motel Association, describes as a long, bitter fight. As of January 1995, California hotels must provide 35 percent nonsmoking rooms. The bill was championed by the Heart Association, the state restaurant association and other groups, but passed only after the hotel group won certain amendments, Mr. Abrams said -- for instance, allowing 25 percent of lobby space for smoking, and permitting smoking at meetings except when meals are served.
But demand is having a greater impact than legislation: in most hotels, a year and a half after the law went into effect, half the rooms are nonsmoking.
In Dallas, Mr. Sanders was a premature nonsmoking innkeeper. "One time we had an oil company reserve 32 rooms," said Mr. Sanders, who now raises ostriches and other exotic animals in Fredericksburg, Tex. "When one of those people wanted to smoke, all 32 decamped." Despite such setbacks, the place did well, he said. But when other lodgings in the city began to offer smoke-free rooms to health-conscious, allergic or fastidious travelers, customers stopped flooding his inn, and his managers pressed him to let them welcome smokers, too, to fill more rooms. Since by then he had leased the motel to them, he gave in.
At the Roseville Country Inn, health issues played only a minor role in the decision to ban smoking. Thomas Robey, who has been manager since the opening, said that the driving issues were reducing cleaning expenses and capital costs for replacing carpets and furniture. The occupancy rate, he said, is running 88 percent -- remarkable in comparison with the 1995 national figure, 65.5 percent, which itself was the highest in years.
Mr. Robey said he thought it was easier to fill a nonsmoking inn with 57 rooms than one with 200. Other factors he cited were his inn's lack of meeting rooms and the presence among his steady clientele of parents of students at nearby religious colleges.
The Roseville Country Inn makes no secret of its smokelessness: it is noted on airline computer reservation systems, Country Inn directories and at the central reservation system for Carlson. But when people reserve directly, he said, the motel tries to modulate the message. "We say: 'Fine, we have reserved a queen-bedded nonsmoking room for you for that night.' And if they say they want a smoking room, we tell them we are all nonsmoking."
There are other all-nonsmoking hotels -- the 30-room Inn at Union Square and the 15-room Washington Square Inn, both in San Francisco, have been nonsmoking since 1991 -- but there is no comprehensive list.
La Suite Worldwide, a fledgling chain, planned to begin operations in 1995, franchising economy-rate motels that would be entirely nonsmoking. A year and a half later, its first property, in Kissimmee, Fla., is opening, but only 80 percent of the rooms will be nonsmoking. The retreat from 100 percent came about, said J. D. Nana, the chief executive, because about 25 potential franchise-holders rejected the idea of no smoking at all.
THE American Hotel and Motel Association says that in 1992, 86 percent of its members reported an average of 40 percent nonsmoking rooms; by 1994 the average had risen to 46 percent. A new survey is in the works.
In the last few years three divisions of the Promus Hotels group in Memphis -- Embassy Suites, Hampton Inns and Homewood Suites -- have raised their required level of nonsmoking rooms to 75 percent from around 50 percent.
At most of the hotels that make up Choice Hotels International -- Quality, Comfort, Clarion, Sleep and Rodeway -- managers are now required to provide 50 percent nonsmoking rooms. The level was raised in June last year, from 15 percent. At the Econo Lodges, the least expensive of this group, the figure is now 20 percent, according to Anne Curtis, director of communications for Choice.
At Radisson, managers are allowed to select their own levels to accommodate regional habits; the permissible range is 30 to 85 percent nonsmoking, Mr. Polski said.
At the high end of the price range, the 700-room Parker Meridien in New York, a French-owned chain, currently maintains a high 72 percent of its rooms as nonsmoking; in 1994, it raised the percentage to 67 from 47.
Hotel-motel association surveys show no clear pattern based on price, hotel size, location or type of property. Experts say the patterns are more affected by how popular a hotel is with foreigners, especially visitors from countries of heavy smokers like Japan. At the Kitano on Park Avenue in New York, 20 percent of 150 rooms are reserved for nonsmokers.
In Texas, the rise in nonsmoking accommodations is continuing. Don Hansen, the executive vice president of the Texas Hotel and Motel Association, says that the "health craze" is driving it, and that 50 to 60 percent of Texas's quarter-million hotel rooms are nonsmoking. Nonsmoking rooms at the Doubletree in Austin went from 20 to 60 percent in three years.
Many efforts have been made in Texas towns and cities to eliminate the right of hotels to provide smoking rooms, Mr. Hansen said, but there has been no statewide legislation or referendum. He described Austin as virtually a nonsmoking community so far as public spaces are concerned; however, he said, smoking is permitted in the Capitol. In the city of College Station, he said, an effort was made to eliminate smoking in all hotel rooms, but "we talked them out of it."
Two problems loom with nonsmoking rooms. The first is typified by Mr. Robey's report on the Roseville Inn. "People do smoke in the rooms," he said. "It's just once every two weeks instead of every night."
What does a hotel do when this happens, or when it must convert a smoking room to nonsmoking? All bedding and curtains go out to the laundry; pillows are replaced; rugs and carpets are shampooed; walls are washed. The ceiling and walls may be repainted and the beds replaced. Then the room may be sealed for some time with a portable air-freshener inside. The days of creating a nonsmoking room by scooping up the ashtrays and putting a tent card on the table are gone: rooms now have signs affixed to the doors, and usually on the hallway walls.
The other challenge is the reservation system. If a guest wants to book a nonsmoking room, the reservationist will usually say that the preference will be noted, but there is no guarantee. At the end of May, however, Hilton began offering confirmed reservations for nonsmoking rooms at 200 of its domestic hotels. The Hilton chain requires that at least 50 percent of rooms in its hotels be nonsmoking; the range rises to 80 percent. If a room is not available on a guest's arrival, the hotel may offer a free nonsmoking room at a nearby hotel.

The School Bell Tolls for Shop Class

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
IT was the last day of school at Hoboken High, with dismissal scheduled for noon. A side door in Bob Callahan's wood shop class was opened onto the sidewalk and the sun tumbled in, lighting specks of sawdust adrift in the air. The workbenches were tidy now, the machines cleaned and stowed.
For Mr. Callahan, after 23 years of teaching wood shop, it was literally the last day of school. The same for Nick Burke, the print-shop teacher, who was unexpectedly retiring after 31 years. At Hoboken High School and at many other schools throughout New Jersey, shop classes were dismissed forever when the school year ended. 
 Mr. Callahan will return to Hoboken High next year, after spending this school year cramming in 18 new credits for certification to teach biology and earth sciences to special-education classes. But Mr. Burke, who was a fireman before he became a teacher, will not be back in September. Shortly after learning last October that his print-shop class was being eliminated, he put in for early retirement. So far, he hasn't made any new career plans.
"Luckily, I can still drive a nail," said Mr. Burke, whose shop classes -- composed of both boys and girls -- produced nearly all of the printing for the Hoboken school district, a million pages this school year alone.
"Nick is being very modest," said Mr. Callahan, who considers his colleague a friend and mentor. "There's not a printing company in the country that wouldn't pick him up like that." He snapped his fingers.
School districts are eliminating high school shop classes for a number of reasons, but the bottom line, of course, is money. The American secondary educational system pumps as many of its competent students as possible into college. At the same time, large numbers of marginal students are placed into special-education programs, which qualify for large amounts of Federal and state funds.
Unfortunately for those in the middle, who might want to make a living with their hands, not to mention those who might want to hire them to do a job, trade classes like print shop and wood shop and home economics no longer fit easily into the educational bureaucracy's pattern of what constitutes a comprehensive liberal education for the 21st century.
"We taught students who are now doctors, lawyers -- professionals who still know something about woodworking, printing, even cooking and sewing," Mr. Burke said sadly, lamenting the loss of mainstream shop courses. And Mr. Callahan added:
"Beyond the needs of kids who aren't college-bound, that's one of the things that worries me. What about the ones going to college? Later in life, they won't need to change an electrical switch? Put in minor plumbing?"
"Hang a door?" said Mr. Burke, laughing.
"Right, try asking a contractor to come in and hang a door," Mr. Callahan said. "They don't want to be bothered with a small job. Today, you see good carpenters on television, like Bob Vila, more than in real life."
At Hoboken High, the industrial arts department once had a staff of 20. This year, it was down to four teachers and three courses: wood shop, print shop and mechanical drawing.
In Hudson County, as elsewhere, industrial arts classes are being consolidated at central vocational-technical schools. But offering shop classes at the vo-tech schools effectively puts them out of the reach of the general academic population, if only because of the time it takes out of the school day to commute between two schools.
Attempts to save shop classes failed last winter, so those arguments were mute the other day at Hoboken High, where the only project remaining in Mr. Callahan's now-quiet wood shop was to offer a simple farewell to a fine teacher, Nick Burke, about to go home and take 31 years of history with him.
A few minutes before noon, Mr. Burke glanced at the clock, sighed and shook hands with Mr. Callahan and with Jackie McClellan, a special-education math teacher who had stopped down to say goodbye.
"Anything you need, you sound off, hear?" Mr. Burke said. His two colleagues nodded.
The school band should have been there playing the alma mater with trumpets and snare drums. Instead, the bell on the wall clanged noisily exactly at dismissal time. Mr. Burke winced at the bell one last time. He smiled tightly, nodded, and walked out the wood shop door, disappearing in dazzling sunlight on Clinton Street.
A full minute passed in silence. Then in a thick voice Mr. Callahan just said, "A right guy, Nicky Burke."

HEADLINE: Mites Killing Bees Vital to L.I. Fruit

BYLINE: By LINDA TAGLIAFERRO

 BODY:
THE discovery seemed like a postscript to Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring." In April, when Frank Reiser, a field biologist at Nassau Community College, went to check on the beehives kept in his backyard, instead of the familiar buzzing, he found nothing but dead honeybees.
When Mr. Reiser called other members of the Long Island Beekeepers' Association, he found he was not alone. Most of the 90 members had suffered major losses, and one man who managed 80 hives had lost 60 of these. 
 The reason for the deaths was not merely a severe winter. The real culprits were two species of mite, the honeybee tracheal mite, Acarapis woodii, and the Varroa mite, Varroa jacobsoni, which have plagued Britain's bees for many years, and nearly wiped out beekeeping in that country in the 1940's.
These mites have already caused the mass destruction of honeybees in other states, including Florida, California and Washington, but it was not until this year that they affected Long Island's bees in such epidemic proportions.
The common honeybee, Apis mellifera, is more than a source of interest to hobbyists on Long Island and elsewhere. The insects provide pollination for over 90 commercial crops in the United States.
Pollination is essential for seed production, and the greater the number of seeds produced, the greater the quality of the fruit or vegetable. Certain fruits require multiple pollinator visits. The muskmelon flower, for example, may require 15 visits from honeybees or other pollinators to produce a high quality melon. Absent or misshapen fruit is the result of lack of pollination.
Dr. Nick Calderone, a research entomologist with the United States Department of Agriculture Research Station in Beltsville, Md., said: "There has certainly been a serious decline in both the number of wild and managed colonies, and we expect that to continue in the future. This may be the worst year in terms of colony loss that New York State has ever seen."
Some beekeepers say this could mean lower fruit and vegetable yields on Long Island and higher prices for consumers. Others hope that different pollinators in the wild will take over the job of the decimated honeybee population.
Raymond Lackey, the president of the Long Island Beekeepers' Association, estimated that 50 to 80 percent of all bees in managed hives on the Island have succumbed to the parasites. He speculated that all of the wild bees may also have died.
Mr. Lackey said Long Island honeybees were probably spared previous epidemics because there are no migratory beekeepers that serve Long Island farms. He said the mites may have entered through packaged queens and attendants, which are sold through the mail by beekeepers in other states.
Mr. Lackey said the tracheal mite is microscopic and lives within the breathing tubes of the honeybee. "We found that it moves into the breathing tubes during the first four days of the honeybee's life," he said, "because after that time period, the trachea becomes stiff enough so that the mite can no longer force its way in."
Once inside the breathing tubes, the mite penetrates the tracheal wall and sucks the blood of the honeybee. It then lays its eggs. When these hatch, the offspring mate and lay eggs, and all of these eventually penetrate the tracheal wall and parasitize the bee.
"The males are blind and never leave the host," Mr. Lackey said. "But some of the females leave the honeybee and look for a new one. As the bee moves around, the female mite can jump over to a new host."
Honeybees normally only live for about six weeks. "During the warmer months," Mr. Lackey said, "when bees gather nectar, they work themselves to death. Their wings are literally worn out." Several cycles of the tracheal mite can flourish within this brief time span.
"The problem with this mite is winter kill," Mr. Lackey said. "Bees that are born in the fall live through the winter, when it is impossible to gather nectar. During this cold weather, the bees cluster together in their hive and vibrate their wings to heat the colony.
"During the long winter months, the tracheal mites produce to the point where the bee can no longer breathe or do heavy exercise. It's like someone with a heart condition who can't walk across a room without getting winded." As a result, the bees are too weakened to maintain heat in their hives.
Another mite that has killed many honeybees is the Varroa mite. It attaches itself to the body of the bee, often under its joints, and is so large than it is visible to the naked eye.
Dr. Calderone said infestations of this mite are invariably fatal to honeybees if untreated. "Colony mortality occurs within six months to two years after becoming infested," he said.
Some Long Island beekeepers have given up as a result of the epidemics, because of the costs and labor-intensive nature of starting up again. Ray Mathie, a resident of Southold who has managed hives for 20 years, said: "The mites knocked me out this year. I had 30 hives and they all died. I can't start over again."
Thor Eriksen of Ridge, who has kept hives for 15 years, has decided to persevere despite his losses. He now manages 70 hives. He said his colonies were not affected this year, but were devastated last year, when he lost 40 out of 50 hives to the parasites. "My colonies seem to have gotten the mites before everyone else's," he said. "Maybe it's because I have so many of them all over the place."
Mr. Eriksen bought tracheal-mite-resistant bees from a breeder in Georgia. The bees were developed by the Agriculture Department. The colonies have been thriving, and Mr. Eriksen rents them out to farmers in the spring.
Suffolk is the leading agricultural county in New York State, based on the wholesale value of its agricultural products. Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County estimates that the total value of agricultural production comes to $130 million a year. This has an economic impact of $750 million on Long Island, according to the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
William Sanok, agent at Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County in Riverhead, said: "The trouble with this honeybee situation is that it doesn't just show up as an acute problem. It's not as if one day, we just don't have pollination and everyone gets excited about it. It's more of a chronic problem. You have reduced pollination, reduced fruit set and reduced crops. It's almost insidious."
He added, "There are other insect pollinators, but the honeybee is really the one that we depend on, because it's the hardest worker and the most productive."
Some farmers are not too concerned. Thomas Wickham of Wickham's Fruit Farm in Cutchogue said he did not consider the situation catastrophic. He said, "We have had more difficulty pollinating our fruit crops in recent years, and that could be a reflection of a reduced honeybee population."
Richard Anderson, owner of Anderson Farms in Riverhead, rented colonies from Mr. Eriksen this year. He said pollination has been a problem during the last few years, and that it has got progressively worse.
"I don't see the wild bees any more," Mr. Anderson said. "They used to come out of the trees and our abandoned barn. They were always visible."
Andrew Amsler, an owner of Richter's Orchard in East Northport, said the orchard lost a dozen hives over the winter. "There were always colonies of wild bees out in the woods," Mr. Amsler said, "but this year, I noticed very few of them around. We depended very heavily on the ones that we rented this year."
Treatment for the mites is limited. This is partly because beekeepers must be careful to avoid killing the bees or contaminating the honey. Menthol is used to hold down tracheal mites.
The only federally approved mite killer for the control of Varroa is Apistan, a synthetic pyrethroid. Although this has proved effective, Dr. Calderone said, "The big problem on the horizon is news out of Europe that the mites there have developed a resistance to Apistan in the past few years, and so we anticiate that will happen here in the next few years."
Dr. Calderone said he had worked with the Agriculture Department on developing an integrated pest-management strategy to deal with the infestation, and he will continue this work at Cornell University when he assumes a position there this July.
"In the long run," he said, "we'll probably have to keep modifying that program to take into account changes that the mites undergo. They have the ability to adapt to our control strategies. The long term goal will be the development of a population of mite-resistant bees."

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Stanley Bergman;
From Small Beginnings to a Company With Millions in Sales

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG

 BODY:
BACK in the 1930's, a pharmacist in Woodside, Queens, began sending product fliers to local doctors to try to increase sales. He knew that he would have to offer lower prices. What Henry Schein did not know, however, was that he had discovered a market that would transform his tiny business into the world's largest direct marketer of health care products and services to office-based practitioners.
Today, customers of Henry Schein Inc. in Melville include 200,000 dental practices and labs, physicians' offices and veterinary clinics in North America and Europe. Many products are shipped from a huge, automated distribution center in Port Washington -- one of eight the company has built worldwide. 
 But, the company had its share of rough times, too. In the early 80's, a slew of competitors left it barely profitable. That is where Stanley Bergman came in. With an aggressive plan of corporate restructuring that included hiring hundreds of highly skilled Long Island employees, Mr. Bergman turned the company around.
Last year, Henry Schein reported sales of $616 million. The company went public in November. Since 1990, it has grown at a compounded annual rate of 22 percent. In 1995, it acquired 14 operations with $100 million in revenue, and 10 more acquitions are in the works. And it is a leading Long Island employer, with a regional staff of more than 900 (the company employs 2,700 people worldwide).
Mr. Bergman, 46, who has been the chief executive officer since 1989, earned a bachelor of commerce degree from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannnesburg. He came to the United States in 1976 and became a certified public accountant. Before coming to Henry Schein, he was a manager at the accounting firm of BDO Seidman. He lives in Northport with his wife, who is a physician, and two teen-age sons.
Q. Your company had some pretty humble beginnings. How did it prosper?
A. It was in the 70's that things really took off. That's when the Schein family discovered the dental market. There were around 3,000 dental distributors back then. But they sold products at relatively high prices and with relatively poor service. So the Scheins decided to put together catalogues which would offer them at lower prices and have them ready for immediate delivery. That was a pretty new concept at the time. And it's what really gave rise to the Henry Schein business. The pharmacy was phased out and, by the late 70's, Henry Schein Inc. was doing around $40 million in sales. It had to be moved to Port Washington for more space. This is a company which, up until the 60's, was basically a soda fountain.
Q. You have the largest automated catalogue business in the health care field. How did it begin?
A. In the late 70's, Henry's older son, Jay, joined the company. He was a Wall Street attorney, and he'd witnessed the automation of Wall Street. He saw all the big brokerage firms putting in computers, and he brought that notion to us. We spent the first few years of the 80's putting in computer systems to let us do "automated" processing -- the picking and packing of products. This was one of the first companies to automate the distribution cycle, and we went all the way through to automated catalogues. These catalogues were really the start of electronic publishing.
Q. Your automated warehouses help you keep discount prices?
A. Yes. We compete with about 900 local and regional distributors. They usually work from small branch offices, and it's expensive for them to ship too far. So we built eight giant automated warehouses -- three in the U.S. and five in Europe -- so we could reach more customers more economically
Q. Five years ago, the company was divided in two. Why?
A. Henry had invested in a generic drug company. And his son Jay formed a lobby group asking Congress that methods be developed to bring generic drugs to market in an orderly fashion. In 1984, Congress passed a law which provided a fair way of getting F.D.A. approval for these drugs. That really gave birth to the generic drug industry as we know it. So Henry's investment took off -- it became known as "Schein Pharmaceutical" -- and we spent the next five years growing it. But we didn't pay much attention to Henry Schein Inc. So, we had to decide whether to get out of it or focus more time and money on it. We decided to split it into two separate companies so we could focus more on each.
Q. But, you had your work cut out for you re-building Henry Schein ?
A. Yes. It was barely profitable, because we hadn't paid much attention to it. We needed a strong plan to turn it around. The first step was to diversify -- to move further into the medical and veterinary markets. Then, we decided to move into Europe.
Q. What prompted that decision?
A. I was at a dental show in Europe in 1989, and each time I gave someone a business card, I found they already knew our company. I guess we had a good reputation there because American dentistry is still considered the best in the world. If you're a dentist in Western Europe, for example, you'll probably come to the U.S. periodically for continuing education. So we decided to bring our marketing concepts there.
Now, we're in seven countries in Europe and hope not just to increase our market penetration there, but to expand into Asia and South America. Our distribution system is something that many countries are ripe for. We think the Japanese market is ready for the catalogue direct marketing business but, so far, they've done everything possible to keep us out.
Q. Still, going international was not enough to turn the company around?
A. No. In the early 80's, our competitors started copying us. They came out with catalogues, they started discounting their products and improving their service, and the bottom line was we started looking just like them. We had to differentiate ourselves again in the dental world, and we did it with value-added service.
We took the view that the dental practice was actually a small business: We went to our customers and suggested they run their practices as such. We developed practice management software, which is really no different than the software that runs any kind of business -- it handles billing, scheduling, etc. And now, 16,000 dental practices in the U.S. are using it. We also got into patient financing -- giving dentists a line of credit which they could offer to their customers who didn't have insurance, for example. And we did credit card processing -- we got our clients credit cards at lower rates than the traditional banks.
Q. So you became problem-solvers of sorts?
A. Yes, but it wasn't something that Henry Schein thought up. Large drug wholesalers have built huge businesses around the notion that, if you help your clients to generate more income, you'll be more successful. Selling products becomes a byproduct of that. We went looking for ways our customers could increase their business -- the software and lines of credit were part of it. In the 80's, we made dentists aware of the need to glove and mask up for protection from AIDS and hepatitis B. Universities had been telling them this, but we commercialized it by developing seminars and manuals on infection control. These were an important ingredient of our success.
Q. Is this how you developed the concept of 'veterinary dentistry'?
A. Yes. We've always sold some products to veterinarians. It's a market with great growth potential. And, we knew dentistry was a way for vets to generate some additional income. So, we worked with several universities to develop programs to teach it to them. Most vets in the country now practice it to some extent. This may be simple teeth cleaning, or more sophisticated procedures like dental implants. We do a lot of work with zoos, where they're caring for some very expensive animals.
Q.Although two-thirds of all dental practices in the United States and Europe are your clients, dollar-wise you hold a relatively small share of the market. Why?
A. Because, up until last year, we were precluded from the large equipment market. We sold less expensive, consumable goods. Now, we've purchased a company which has gotten us into high ticket items, like medical and dental diagnostic equipment. But we're still the Wal-Mart of this business, not the Bloomingdale's. We appeal to the cost and value-conscious consumer. We introduce new equipment when the prices settle down.
Q. How has managed care affected your business?
A. Hospitals and drugstores were the first to feel reimbursement pressures. But that revolution occurred about 10 years ago. Now, it's our customers -- the doctors and dentists -- who are feeling the pressure. They're expected to do a lot more procedures while getting less and less reimbursement. So we're in an environment that's very concerned with cost containment.
We're also witnessing the "industrialization" of health care. Networks are forming -- not in a major way yet on Long Island, but in California, for example, there are businesses which buy practices. They want structured purchasing arrangements. So we try to get prime vendor contracts with them. If they agree to buy only from us, we can negotiate better prices with the manufacturers, because they're getting more business. So far, we have contracts with the U.S. Army and several major U.S. dental schools. And we've implemented a low price guarantee, just like when you buy a TV at Nobody Beats the Wiz. So far, we're the only ones doing that in health care.
Q. You have extended your marketing efforts beyond just direct mail?
A. Yes. Our competitors tend to market either through direct mail, telephone sales, or through field sales consultants -- the people who sell door-to-door. But we use all three. We're the only ones in this business using that mix. Before that, we were basically waiting for our phones to ring, waiting for the catalogue orders to come in. Now we have catalogues which let you order by touch-tone phone or electronically. We back them up with tele-sales, and then we send out field sales consultants to cement the relationships. It's been very cost-effective, and a very productive way of generating sales.
Q. When you needed more space, you chose to expand on Long Island. Why?
A. Because we have one of the best tele-sales operations in the whole health care industry right here, and that's hard to replace. These aren't just salespeople -- they have to know health care products. We either hire people who can sell and then teach them about the products, or we hire people like dental assistants, veterinary assistants and nurses -- people who know the products -- and teach them how to sell. This is a highly skilled work force. We could open a tele-sales center in Nebraska and pay people less. But it would be hard to get that expertise. And, we got assistance from the state, Suffolk County and the Town of Huntington to stay here.
Q. Which of your markets is best poised for growth?
A. The medical market is a $4 billion market, and we have a relatively small share, so there's some good growth potential there. And the international market is infinite. You just can't do everything at once.

Need for Sleep in a Cacophonous World

BYLINE: By ALIX BOYLE

 BODY:
ALMOST everybody needs more sleep. Newborns do tend to get the 20 hours a day they need, but by high school -- what with television, homework and social pressures -- youngsters are getting as little as 6 hours a night. Working adults, stressed-out by job pressures and also glued to the television, are equally sleep-deprived. And elderly people tend to throw their nighttime sleep off schedule by napping during the day.
Then there are the medical sleep disorders: insomnia affects 40 million Americans, and 400,000 have narcolepsy. Fifty percent of adult men snore, a sign of sleep apnea, which affects an estimated 18 million people in the United States. 
 This is the picture presented by Vahid Mohsenin, an associate professor of medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine and director of the Yale Sleep Disorders Program. Dr. Mohsenin, who attended medical school at Shiraz University in Iran and completed his training in San Francisco and New Haven, discussed his work in a recent interview. Following are excerpts from the interview:
Q. Are we getting enough sleep?
A. The consensus in the United States is that we're not. Over the last 100 years or so, we've lost about an hour and a half to two hours from our nighttime sleep due to many societal and environmental changes: industrialization, the need for shift work, a 24-hour society, economic needs and competitiveness. People try to adapt to sleep loss over time, but then insidiously, they start experiencing problems at work, problems at home; they're spending less time with the family and friends. Yes, we're chronically sleep deprived.
Q. How much sleep do we need?
A. It's estimated between seven and eight hours. Kids need more, about eight and a half to nine hours, because they need to grow. Just one or two hours makes a major difference in their performance.
Older people tend to divide their sleep; they nap in the daytime and get less sleep at night. On average they get the same amount of sleep, but they spread it out.
Q. How do we develop good sleep hygiene?
A. You have to have a regular bedtime and a regular rising time. No work-related things, no television, in the bedroom. No coffee, no alcoholic beverages, within two to three hours of sleeping. It's a common myth that alcohol is good for sleep. Yes, you do fall asleep, but then your sleep quality is actually markedly disturbed in frequent wakenings or disruptions. Medications that can interfere with sleep should be taken in the morning. A small snack would be useful before bedtime. Smoking is not good. Reading something boring is good.
Q. How does insomnia start?
A. If it takes too long to fall asleep, people start to get nervous and then they get into a vicious cycle. They start concentrating on their sleep pattern and the lack of sleep in the nighttime, then they have a preoccupation in the daytime about not being able to sleep the night before. They get into a cycle we call psychophysiological insomnia.
Q. What's the treatment?
A. You treat the underlying medical or psychiatric condition -- heart conditions, diabetes and depression, for example. You treat the conditions with behavior therapy. Or you can use sleeping medications, but not for more than three to five weeks because people develop a tolerance to them and become dependent.
Q. What are the main sleep disorders?
A. There are four.
There are those that originate from within the body like sleep apnea, or narcolepsy or seizure disorders. There's something within the body physics that creates these problems.
Then there are external factors like noise, shift work, time-zone changes.
There are primary disorders not related to sleep itself, what are called parasomnias -- night terrors, sleepwalking, bedwetting and REM behavior disorders, people acting out their dreams. There's nothing wrong with their sleep, but other mechanisms are faulty.
Finally, people who abuse drugs and alcohol have trouble. Sometimes they have a transient sleep problem, then they define alcohol as being the treatment. Or they abuse sleeping medications; they get hooked.
Q. What role does sleep play in traffic accidents?
A. Sleep deprivation is a major cause of accidents. The National Commission of Sleep Disorders, formed by Congress in the late 1980's, came up with staggering statistics.
The Exxon Valdez accident was directly related to the third mate's lack of sleep in the preceding 48 hours. It was not due to the alcohol consumption of the captain. The captain was not in charge at the time; the third mate was. They were loading cargo and he did not get more than like six or seven hours of sleep in the preceding two days. Then, despite lookouts telling him about the reefs, he didn't hear them or couldn't pay attention and he ran aground.
Most of the major industrial accidents occur between midnight and 6 A.M. Most truckers get into trouble in those hours despite the fact that there are fewer trucks on the road. Truckers are known to be sleep-deprived. A survey by the Department of Transportation found that on average they get five hours of sleep.
Q. Melatonin is being touted as cure for insomnia. What do you think?
A. Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland and it surges in the body around sleep time and falls off before rising time. Elderly people lose the diurnal pattern of secretion. This group, in addition to transmeridian travelers, pilots and shift workers, can benefit from melatonin. In the general population, melatonin has not been shown to be effective.
Q. What is narcolepsy?
A. An abnormality of the neurotransmitters in the brain that regulate the sleep and awake state. It causes excessive daytime sleepiness; people have an urge to nap and have spells of muscle weakness and falling. The treatment is medication: stimulants like Ritalin will keep people awake during the day and tri-cyclic antidepressants will prevent weakness.
Q. What is sleep apnea?
A. The cessation of breathing during sleep; people and can't get oxygen. If they stop breathing more than 20 times per hour then they are at major risk of developing hypertension, stroke, heart attack, and congestive heart failure.
It's a very serious condition if it goes untreated. It's estimated that there is $400 million of direct cost associated with treating sleep apnea not to mention the indirect cost of loss of productivity, loss of property. People wake up in the morning and feel as if they never slept. They don't have any recollection of the awakenings because they were very short. The brain doesn't register anything unless you're awakened for more than three minutes.
Some people tell me they gasp for air, but most say they sleep through. When you ask them the next morning, "How many times were you awake last night?" they say one time, two times. But if you monitor them in the laboratory, they awakened 100 times. That's the crux of this problem because every time they're aroused, the blood pressure goes up, so they are exposed to these multiple episodes of hypertension during sleep.
Q. How do people realize they have sleep apnea and then get help?
A. They are brought in by their bed partner or spouse because they are snoring loudly, thrashing around. They come in because they can't function during the daytime, they can't stay awake, their mood changes, they become depressed, they develop hypertension. They get involved with accidents and injuries; they go to cardiologists for heart failure, hypertension; they go to psychologists and psychiatrists because of depression and mood changes. It's not recognized commonly because doctors are not sensitive to these symptoms.
Q. What are the treatments for sleep apnea?
A. The standard treatments now are dental prostheses, devices that create more space behind the tongue. This only works in people who have mild apnea.
Nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is a pump connected to a mask worn over the nose that will provide the pressure throughout the respiratory system preventing the collapse of the airways. It's highly effective, compliance is reasonable, and many people benefit from this. It's not ideal but it's the best we have.
Surgery and laser, to open up the airway, is reserved for people with specific conditions.

HEADLINE: Keeping Legal Help Reachable to the Poor

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS

 BODY:
DESPITE fears of restructuring legal services for poor people, a consensus among lawyers in the field seems to be building that, "It's not as bad as we feared it would be."
The backdrop to the changes is a 30-year battle by conservatives to reduce or eliminate support for the Legal Services Corporation, the federally funded Great Society-era umbrella agency that oversees legal help to the poor -- whether it be landlord-tenant disputes, consumer fraud or family issues like domestic violence, child custody and divorce. 
 Last year Congress voted to slash the corporation's budget by one third, to $278 million; eliminate specialized projects including those for migrant workers, and prohibit lawyers who receive any income from the corporation from filing class action suits (often used in the past to alter public policy), challenging new welfare laws or lobbying the government on behalf of their clients.
Until last year's changes, Connecticut's legal help for poor people consisted of four agencies: the New Haven Legal Assistance Association, serving New Haven with a branch office in Derby; Neighborhood Legal Services and the Legal Aid Society of Hartford, both serving Hartford, and Connecticut Legal Services, serving the rest of the state.
The new Federal mandate initiated a great debate and a lot of soul-searching among staff attorneys about whether to take the money -- with the strings attached -- or refuse it to maintain their options, albeit with considerably less funding. What they came up with was a compromise, a two-tiered system they hope will allow maximum flexibility.
The directors of the legal help groups pooled their Federal money and created Statewide Legal Services, an entity that is abiding by the restrictions laid down by Congress. Meanwhile, the two Hartford agencies (soon to merge into one) and the New Haven office, with no Federal funding, remain free to file class-action suits and to lobby.
Formerly, clients would walk in or call the offices and be screened to determine what kind of help they needed and how quickly they needed it. Some -- victims of spousal abuse or those threatened with eviction -- were given help immediately.
Now, when people contact one of the offices, they talk to a receptionist who gives them a toll-free number for Statewide Legal Services, where they are screened by a central staff. They are often asked to fax or mail in relevant material. If the person is eligible, help is provided either by lawyers at the central office, or the case may be sent back to the office where the initial contact was made.
Glenn Falk, a long-time lawyer in the New Haven office, argued that his office should take the Federal money, even with the strings attached. "There was $1.5 million for Connecticut that came with restrictions," said Mr. Falk. "That's 30 lawyers' worth of money. That's an awful lot of helping people. I'm not so naive as to think that class action suits are not important -- I sued the New Haven Housing Authority numerous times."
But by taking the money, he felt, attorneys could provide concrete legal help to more poor people while the public policy advocacy pursued through class-action suits and lobbying could be done -- and was being done -- by many other agencies.
Mr. Falk said he feared people who need help would fall through the cracks. He worries especially about illiterate clients who are likely to have a harder time navigating the new system.
Amy Eppler-Epstein, a colleague of Mr. Falk's in the New Haven office, took a completely different view. "I'm really glad we made the choice we did," she said. "It was certainly not without pain. Part of the pain was that a couple of intake screeners were laid off. But I think the telephone screening is beginning to work pretty successfully and better than I was afraid it might.
"We are getting lots of people referred back to us," she continued. "I know some people have not been able to get through on the phone; I also know that, before, people would wait for three hours in our waiting room."
She said that people with mental disabilities or those with complicated paperwork would still be seen in the office rather than being given the toll-free number.
She added that neither the old system nor the new one was perfect; "the frustration with both," she said, "is the lack of resources compared to the problem." But she doubted that more people were falling through the cracks now than under the old system. "I used to get 40 cases a week in the housing unit," she said, "and that's what we get now."
Patricia Kaplan, director of the New Haven office, is even more positive about the changes. Given both the Federal cutbacks and a 50 percent drop in Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts funds due to the sluggish economy, she says, "Setting up this new entity was a godsend because it meant I could carve off my intake function, and it can be done more efficiently from a central location. That meant I could keep my advocacy staff of lawyers and paralegals."
Norman Janes, former director of Connecticut Legal Services and now director of the new Statewide Legal Services, calls the new plan "an excellent response to a difficult situation. I call this functional specialization." Funding cuts over the years have meant a drop in total staff throughout the state from 185 in 1980 to 112 in 1995 to 88 in 1996.
Mr. Janes says the fact that his agency is barred from taking on class action suits is not a problem "because we are part of a network that will get people what they need."
He expects the organization to handle 45,000 to 50,000 clients this year. He adds that it's hard to make an exact comparison with 1995, but that the numbers are very similar. "From 9 to 3 the phones are busy constantly."

HEADLINE: Battling Dumpsites in Poor Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS

 BODY:
WHAT do urban parks and illegal dumping have to do with environmental justice?
Plenty, according to those involved with the environmental equity program of the State Department of Environmental Protection, which announced its policy in 1993: "No segment of the population should bear a disproportionate share of the risks or consequences of environmental pollution or be denied access to environmental benefits, such as parks and forests, fishing and outdoor recreation." 
 To address the issues, the department proposed several ways to promote environmental health as well as to stimulate economic development in urban areas. To carry out the program, the department's air, waste and water management bureaus prepared plans.
The department also created regional environmental justice community advisory boards in Hartford and New Haven that meet monthly and provide environmental activists, neighborhood residents and representatives of municipal departments an opportunity to hash out problems and discuss solutions.
In October 1994 the department helped sponsor a statewide conference with the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union that attracted 350 people.
The environmental equity program is led by Edith Pestana, a public health and environmental consultant.
"The D.E.P. founded the environmental equity program," Ms. Pestana said, "in response to the growing body of evidence both nationally and statewide that indicates that low-income, racial and ethnic minority groups are exposed to higher than average amounts of environmental pollution."
Sources of exposure, she says, include illegal dumping, sewer overflow, toxic air emissions, leaking underground storage tanks, solid- and hazardous-waste disposal centers, abandoned hazardous-waste sites and substandard housing.
Ms. Pestana pointed out that the success of environmental organizations and governmental agencies in preventing the establishment of hazardous-waste sites in other areas pushes such sites to areas where poor people live.
One way to help safeguard poorer communities from getting more than a fair share of such sites, Ms. Pestana says, is to create partnerships among industry, municipalities and the community. Another is to minimize the creation of pollution anywhere.
A recent meeting in New Haven brought together more than a dozen people from community groups, the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the city's parks, business development and public works departments.
A detailed discussion of the number of urban dumpsites that have been cleaned up so far (140) took place. Garbage that littered sites, it was reported, is being hauled away and in its place is something much more attractive: wood chips. "Wood chips are magic," says Ms. Pestana. "It gives the impression that there's ownership there. It's not an abandoned lot and it looks like it's going to be put to use. So people say, 'I better not dump here.' " The first lots were cleaned more than a year ago and some have been turned into community gardens.
In case the magic is not strong enough to keep dumpers at bay, however, the activists are aiming to increase their arsenal.
The city is proposing legislation to increase the fine for illegal dumping from its current $99 a day -- which many say is low enough to make dumping worth the risk -- to perhaps 10 times that much.
New Haven is also considering putting a lien on the personal property of those caught dumping illegally. Both these actions require state approval. The environmental equity program has pledged to support the city in its efforts.
Carmen Mendez, a development planner with the New Haven Department of Public Works, says, "Illegal dumpers' attitude is that it's O.K. to dump in poor, minority neighborhoods. Our attitude, in terms of environmental justice, is that it's not O.K."
Among other weapons are palm cards being distributed in targeted neighborhoods and signs posted at former dumpsites; the signs urge residents to report illegal dumping and encourage them to help maintain the cleaned-up sites.
"We let neighbors know they also have a responsibility to their neighborhood," says Ms. Mendez. "Some people feel, 'Someone else should clean it up because I didn't dump it there.' We understand that, but it's not the most helpful attitude."
Another issue for the New Haven advisory board is West Rock Ridge State Park. Once a city park, it was given to the state because New Haven lacked the money to operate it. When the state took over, it added other property to the park but closed the paved drive to the top of the traprock ridge and Three Judges Cave, a popular destination. As a result, though the park is technically open to hikers and bikers, it is inaccessible to many people: those with younger children in tow, elderly men and women, and people who get around in wheelchairs, for example.
Shortly after the meeting, the state agreed to open the park on weekends from spring through fall.
The Environmental Protection Department's commissioner, Sidney Holbrook, says of the decision, "It is a direct result of feedback received from local residents and the advisory board. This is just one example of the results than can be seen as the D.E.P. works more closely with urban communities in response to their needs for access to natural resources."
The mandate of the environmental equity program is broad, encompassing research and follow-up of exposures to environmental hazards in both the community and the workplace. In collaboration with the State Health Department and Southeast Asian community organizations, for example, fish advisories have been translated into Cambodian, Laotian, Vietnamese and Hmong.
Immigrants from Southeast Asia as well as from Latin America (the advisories have also been published in Spanish) have traditionally eaten large amounts of fish and therefore depend disproportionately on seafood from polluted waters.
Tangible successes include the clean-up of 200 illegal dumpsites in urban areas around the state. And, in New Haven at least, there seems to be a lot of good will on both sides.
Shunte Corley is a New Haven high school student and a member of the Natural Guard, a group of New Haven young people who work on environmental justice issues.
Mr. Corley is impressed by what he's seen so far. "I think they're doing a lot," he said, "because they're taking their time to come down here and work in neighborhoods that some people feel no one ever does anything for."
He said the group went to the program with a list of sites that needed a cleanup "and they acted immediately and got things done, so we really appreciate that." One of the worst eyesores was a big dumpsite adjacent to a community garden in the Newhallville section of the city, which is where Mr. Corley lives. Now, it is clean.
Diana Edmonds, executive director of the Natural Guard (which created the community garden), said of the D.E.P., "They have really come through with everything they said they'd do."
"But," she added, "the community advisory board is not representative of all the neighborhoods and issues" that should be at the table.
Ms. Edmonds says it's not for lack of trying on the part of those already active to get more people involved, but that people are overwhelmed with meetings and other commitments.
There are more city employees than residents from the targeted neighborhoods at the meetings, although, Ms. Pestana points out, some municipal workers are also city residents.
In Hartford, the program suffered a major setback recently when, despite support from the environmental equity program, the Environmental Protection Department granted a permit to expand the regional landfill over neighbors' opposition.
"The D.E.P. couldn't find any regulatory reason not to grant the permit," Ms. Pestana said. "The community is upset about it. That's one of the reasons it's been difficult to get people out in Hartford -- they're disappointed with that decision."
She added that her program pushed the department to require more stringent regulation of the operator, and a permit for expansion would not be issued until some compliance issues were resolved. Ms. Pestana described the situation as a good example of the tightrope walked between state bureaucracy and the communities most affected by pollution. "It's all about trust."

HEADLINE: To Be Young, Indian and Hip

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
JAY DABHI, 20, steps out of the dim red deejay booth, lights a Newport and scans his territory, the main floor of Planet 28 in Chelsea. It is just after midnight on a warm spring Friday, and the discotheque is thick with smoke and attitude. Over to the right, in front of the mirrored wall, an ex-girlfriend of Jay's in a retro halter, puckering her red lips around a red straw, tries not to gaze at herself. On the sidelines, young men sporting carefully pruned goatees stand in crescent-shaped clusters.
The house is packed with young Indians and Pakistanis in satin mini-skirts and perfectly slack blue jeans that hang just-so over their sneakers. This is a strictly "desi" crowd, desi being the Hindi word for "homeboy" or "homegirl." It seems as if everybody at Planet 28 is checking out everybody else. There is a crisp post-adolescent tension in the air. A bad-boy bravado. Jay, known in this scene as deejay Lil Jay, can taste it. "Gonna be a fight," he says from his perch. "Too many guys." 
 He turns around, climbs over a man in dark glasses who seems to have passed out on a worn couch and returns to his booth. He scratches for a few bars, throws in the Fugees and then, some Junior Mafia, its "get muh-ney" chorus punctuated by a mystery voice that cries "India" on the downbeat, over and over like a mantra. The dancing masses nod in unison. Later, Lil Jay tosses a few surprises -- a Hindi song from the popular Bombay movie, "Disco Dancer" or a perennial "bhangra" favorite, a folk song from the wheat fields of Punjab, laid over a frenzied house track.
A distinctly South Asian youth culture, rooted in hip-hop and Hindi pop, is flourishing in New York City, as children of the growing numbers of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent come of age. Lil Jay, along with the dozens of deejays and party promoters, is one of its creators and caretakers.
The fruits of their subculture can be found this night at Planet 28 -- one of several clubs and restaurants rented out by party promoters and packed by crowds of South Asian teen-agers and college students. It can be found in the hip-hop groove Lil Jay mixes with a classic Hindi ballad, in the rumble that breaks out at Planet 28 between young boys in informal cliques, in the tapes and CD's produced in local studios and basements and sold in Jackson Heights music shops, in the culture clash between young South Asians looking to loosen the strictures of their subcontinental parents.
Although this group is neither old enough nor has been around long enough to make an impact on the city's cultural mainstream, Jay and his friends offer a window into a new generation's acculturation. And an important part of this is the music and club scene that many people would write off as frivolous. Lil Jay's musical specialty is Hindi remix, a melange of pop songs from Bombay movie musicals and house, rap, reggae, tribal -- whatever gets the crowd dancing. Grounded on the principle of sampling and syncretism and spawned by the British-Asian musical brew "bhangra," Hindi remix is a fitting sound for Jay's generation -- South Asian youths nourished by two worlds, trying to create their American style.
The task requires delicate balance, says Madhulika Khandelwal, the acting director of the Queens College Asian-American Center. "They're struggling with both parts -- how to package the Indian part and how to find their place in American society," she says. "I see in them a big confusion in where they fit in the racial schema in the United States."
In recent years, a number of academic books and articles have wrestled with the way in which the children of today's immigrants are assimilating into American culture. Will the second generation, the scholars ask, follow many of their European predecessors and gradually assume American cultural norms and climb the economic ladder? Or as members of racial minority groups, will their experience be different?
Whatever. So far, one thing is certain: this generation of South Asians wants to have fun.
 
 
 
'Hoody Down
 Jay and his friends don't see themselves as white. Nor do they describe themselves as Asian, except when it is to their advantage, as when they have a hard time renting clubs. Indian parties have acquired a reputation for rowdiness -- partly as a result of frequent fights between cliques -- so "when we want a space, we don't say it's an Indian party, we say it's an Asian party," Jay says.
At Planet 28, Jay correctly predicts a rumble. By 1 A.M., the line outside has grown long and impatient. On the main floor, the crowd moves to Jay's mix. Vodka tonics are poured, joints lighted up in the ladies bathroom.
Downstairs, DJ Red, named after his naturally reddish locks, spins his specialty reggae. In a flash, two young men start pushing and shoving. One belongs to Punjabi by Nature, or PBN, a clique for those whose parents come from the northern Indian state of Punjab. The other is Afghani and hangs with Madina, a crew of Pakistani and Indian Muslims.
Jay rushes downstairs to mediate, but the brawl quickly spills out into the street. A friend of Jay's grabs a beer bottle and shatters it over the head of a PBN member before the police arrive to break it up.
Later that night a PBN carload cruises through his neighborhood. The PBN crew spots another teen-ager who was in the fight outside Planet 28. Shots are fired. A bullet grazes the back of the young man's head.
Jay describes the night the next afternoon. He has called the PBN guys, urged them to chill. But he says he is tired of mediating, tired of watching the same thuggery every weekend. If it wasn't for the music and money, he would find something else to do. "They're boring," he says of the clubs. "Same people. Same fights. Same gossip."
Gang rivalries have quieted down in the last year, Jay and his friends say. Some boys have matured. Others have gone to jail. Some cliques have disbanded and the activities of others are limited to occasional brawling and gunfights along with credit-card and illegal phone scams. "They're not real gangsters," Jay says.
At Planet 28, Jalak Patel, 19, a frequent clubgoer, attributes the violence to machismo. "It's like an ego thing," she says. "They can't even say sorry if they bump into you. They have no class. They come all, like, 'hoody down. They don't care. They just want to fight."
'Hoody means tough. Its traces can be detected in a swagger, an accent, a hairdo, the rolling of an eye, a weapon.
But it's hard to break the club habit. Jalak and a friend, Sonal Patel, 18, have been doing the scene since they were 15. Just about every weekend there's a new party to check out, a new promoter renting some new nightclub in Manhattan and charging $10 to $15 a head to get in.
At Planet 28, the dance floor is bumping with 'hoodies. Tommy Hilfiger's red, white and blue gear -- the sartorial rage of the hip-hop nation -- dominates. Near the bar, a lanky young man has corn-rowed his hair in a style reminiscent of an earlier Snoop Doggy Dogg. But as in many nightspots popular among the desi crowd, the only black people are security guards.
"Indian people are secluded," Jay observes. "They like to hang out only with themselves."
 
 
 
Knowing the Culture, and the Guys
 Hetal Patel (no relation to Jalak or Sonal) hangs only in the desi scene. In the summertime, much of her time is spent in her Jackson Heights home watching Hindi movies on ITV, the local Indian cable station, or waiting for her favorite Bollywood stars (Bollywood is Bombay's Hollywood) to lip-sync their latest hits or dipping into an Indian chat room on the Internet. Hetal, 17, who is headed for York College in the fall, does not go to hip-hop shows or rock concerts. She rarely watches a Hollywood movie and buys non-Hindi pop music only occasionally. "I'm not interested," she says.
She is interested in scenes like the one at the Nassau Coliseum one recent evening. A main attraction of the five-hour marathon performance by the Bollywood heartthrob Shahrukh Khan and other entertainers was the cruising that went on in the lobby before, during and after. "Oh my God," Hetal whispers to her sister, Krupa, "All my exes are here." Hetal is busy meeting and greeting tonight, coy with the boys who seem interesting or interested, short with girls she doesn't particularly like.
"These are my own people," she gushes. "I feel we share something. We're all Indian. We all know our heritage. We all know our culture." Onstage, Mr. Khan prances about in snug black leather pants, lip-syncing to a hit from a recent film. Hetal and Krupa mouth the words, grooving in their seats. Later, Mr. Khan offers a shout-out to "the Gujaratis in the house." Hetal and Krupa scream and cheer for their parents' home state. Then, he offers a shout-out to "the Pakistanis in the house." The sisters whisper "Boo."
 
 
 
Outside Desiland
 Far from Hetal's desi universe, Mike Khahera of Floral Park, Queens is steeped in the world of the hip-hop kingpin Afrika Bambaataa's Universal Zulu Nation. Nation members call themselves a youth organization, but its detractors, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, call it a dangerous gang.
Mike is 18 and burly, the youngest son of Punjabi immigrants. Fresh out of Martin Van Buren High School, he works at the local Taco Bell.
He and his brother Mac, a student at St. John's, are waiting for Jay on their parents' front lawn one afternoon. Mike clutches a pair of Zulu Nation amulets. He waits until Lil Jay drives up before slipping them on. His parents are fiercely disapproving of his involvement in Shaka Zulu, the Nation's security squad, he says, so he doesn't wear the amulets around the house.
Afrika Bambaataa, Mike announces, is interested in the sounds of bhangra and Hindi remix. Mike led him on a tour of Jackson Heights record stores last weekend and today, he wants to hook him up with Lil Jay. "Be cool," Mike's older brother, Mac, instructs Jay. "Say 'whassup, whassup!' He's real cool. He's got a lotta juice."
It's an exciting prospect. Jay is itching to venture beyond the Indian scene, to have a broader, more diverse following. He asks Mike how to join the Nation, if they have a chapter for deejays.
Mike, who was turned onto Zulu Nation by some non-Indian friends in Queens Village, has been asked to recruit some Indians to start a chapter in Jackson Heights, but he is a bit skeptical. Mike prefers his black and Hispanic friends over the Indian scene. "I just don't like chillin' with them," he says. "See, a lot of Indian people, they see me wearing Zulu stuff. They don't know nothing about Zulu Nation. But they'll be, like, 'Oh, he's trying to be black.' They don't ask. A lot of Indian people think they're better than blacks."
 
 
 
New Worlds? No Thanks
 A few years ago, Jay wasn't hanging in the Indian scene either. Most of his friends were Hispanic. They lived in the same neighborhood. They looked alike and dressed the same: hair slicked back, jeans hanging perfectly over sneakers, fixed to the ankles by carefully concealed rubber bands. They liked the same kind of music: free style and house, KRS-One and Tribe Called Quest. "Back then," he said, "it was, like, the Indians didn't party."
Then in October 1990, Jay reluctantly checked out a party at the Gujarati Samaj, a community center in Flushing frequented by his father and his uncle. That's where he heard Hindi remix for the first time. The next year, he heard the British deejay Bally Sagoo's seminal album, "Star Crazy." "After 'Star Crazy,' it all blew up," he says. "I was, like, wow! I had never heard Indian music mixed before. So I started doing it."
He was barely 14, a scrawny kid who had to perch on top of a milk crate to reach the turntables. (The nickname Lil Jay has stuck ever since.)
The Gujarati Samaj party scene exploded in the next couple of years. But the gang fights got so heated that no one wanted to party there anymore. Lil Jay slipped deeper into the desi scene. There were India Day parades to attend. Shows at the Nassau Coliseum to check out, if you wanted to pick up girls. Clubs to be at. Clubs to spin at. Albums to produce. The first was two years ago for a Queens rapper who calls himself Style Bhai. (Bhai is the Hindi word for brother.) The second, Jay's own remix collection, is due out later this summer.
These days, he occasionally runs into his Hispanic friends from the neighborhood, gets a quick update under the rumble of the el along Roosevelt Avenue. But Jay's closest friends are Indian. He sees them on the Indian party circuit. They all have Indian girlfriends. And they won't say a word about the non-Indian women they have dated.
Only one of Jay's friends dates a non-Indian, a young woman from Puerto Rico. Jay's girlfriend, Vicky Sheth, 19, is not only Indian; her family, like his, is from the Gujarat province. While dating a non-Indian woman would open up new worlds, the thought is also scary. "You would learn a lot, I guess," Jay says. "But you also couldn't share a lot. Like, I can talk to my girl in my language. We have a lot in common. If her parents say 'You can't go nowhere,' I understand. She's Indian."
 
 
 
A Defining Difference
 In most Indian families there is a decided difference between how boys and girls are raised. Jay's sister, Binita, 28, scowls when she compares her teen-age years with her younger brother's. Binita was held to curfews. Jay gets to come home at any hour. "He gets away with more than I ever did in my whole lifetime," she says.
Sulabhi Dabhi stirs the Saturday afternoon tea for her husband, Pravin, in silence, wordlessly affirming her daughter's pronouncement.
Jay is the Dabhis' only boy, the baby. He was born under a bright morning sun, she says, "so the nighttime is his time." Still, she frets and fusses over his safety. Will he get caught up in a rumble? Will he get shot? Her concern has dampened her initial enthusiasm for her son's immersion in the Indian scene. "Until he is here," she says pointing to the couch, "I am right here."
Jay is his mother's boy. She, his advocate. He has inherited her delicate skin, her quick, dancing eyes and her passion for music. Occasionally, she brings home Hindi tapes for him to sample. She knows which voice belongs to whom, which song belongs to which film, its plot, its stars, the year it was made.
"Who is that, Ma?" Jay says looking up from his tape deck. It's a melodramatic Hindi ballad jammed into a middle of a boisterous 11-minute house mix, one of nine tracks on Lil Jay's coming album.
She holds up her right index finger, squints up at the ceiling. "Disco Dancer, na?" she guesses. "Must be Amit Kumar or Kishore. Yes, Kishore. 1982." She hands her husband his milky tea.
Mr. Dabhi, an accountant at Atlantic Records, doesn't pay much attention to the goings-on in the music industry (except, he is fond of recounting, the time Donna Summer came into his office in search of a phone). And he cautions Jay against a career in music. "He wants me to own a candy store," Jay says.
Mr. Dabhi demurs. "It's up to him," he says. "My main goal is that he gets a degree, at least one degree. I always tell him, 'No one can take that away.' "
Jay groans as his father recalls his earlier years of toil in America -- first earning his business degree and now working at Atlantic and running his candy store on Roosevelt Avenue on weekends. "C'mon, we're Indian," Jay pipes up.
Jay is anything but certain about his future. He cannot see himself behind a candy store counter, or poring over accounting ledgers. He tells his father he will graduate with a business degree from St. John's University, where he is a sophomore, but he cannot drum up the least bit of enthusiasm for a business degree, or the career it might lead to.
Jay is deep into his music. And he makes a good living at it, as much as $300 a party. Still he is dead-set against pursuing it professionally. Too unstable, he says. He'd like a salaried job. A paycheck every week. A wife and some babies. A house in Queens, maybe on Long Island. Preferably a mixing studio in the basement.
With a summer job at a capital management company in Manhattan, his girlfriend, also a sophomore at St. John's, seems well on her way into corporate America. "You know what's the biggest influence on me and my friends?" he says later. "Parents, but also girlfriends. Girlfriends nag. They're always like 'Go to school. Go to school.' "
For Jay, the reopening of school in September will mean the start of the serious party season. Passing out fliers. Searching out new clubs. Making money. He hopes that by then, his own remix album will be out. He'll take it himself to Indo-Pak music shops around town, and maybe hire a distributor to take it to South Asian groceries and record shops around the country. Marketing Hindi remix beyond the desi circuit is beyond his wildest imagination. "They won't buy it. Will they?" he wonders. "Even white people?"
His album will feature one original track: his friend Dee Rock rapping over Alisha's high soprano hit, "Made in In-di-aah." There's a Caribbean lilt in Dee Rock's rhymes, offering homage to the deejay. "Lil Jay dropping bombs like the U.S. on Hiroshima." The rest are remixes of American and Indian pop. "All illegal," Jay says gleefully. Underground remix tapes are a risky business. Indian music producers have recently begun suing Indian-American remix artists for lifting their songs without permission, and deejays, Jay says, have lifted each other's remixes and packaged them as new music.
Sitting in his living room, Jay plays his demo tape. One track weaves the delicate voice of Bombay singer Asha Bhosle with the booming refrain, "Shake what your mama gave 'ya." Jay doesn't understand much more than a few stray words. He furrows his brows and tries to translate. "Come dance? Come dance hard? Or something like that," he says tentatively. "So that's why it goes with 'shake what your mama gave ya.' " Then he giggles and peers into the kitchen to make sure his Mama doesn't hear him.

Suspicion: The Renters' Story

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
THE chicken was perfectly cooked. I swore to that, but Mildred Blechman, recently blind, distrustful of her new, giant Lighthouse stove timer, wasn't so sure. She urged us to eat more of the rice, very healthy, and the cranberry sauce, refreshingly tart. The sky was just beginning to darken beyond the 24th-floor windows of the Waterside Plaza apartment, but she couldn't see the East River below, or the needles of midtown, still sparkling to the west. She couldn't read the United Nations reports piling up or the legal brief that her husband, Rafael, was studying in preparation for the tenants' meeting. Macular degeneration had reduced the vision in one eye to near uselessness, then last Dec. 20 vision in the other eye disappeared as suddenly as if a shade had been pulled down.
"I really hate this," she said, looking in the direction of my voice. "It's another reason I don't want to move. At 78, I just don't want to have to get used to a place I've never seen." 
 Mr. Blechman, who is 85, insisted: "If they raise the rent, I want to move. I didn't work 60 years, and put a few bucks away for my old age to give it to some landlord."
The landlord in question is Richard Ravitch. His tenants now regret his failures in politics and baseball negotiations since he now has more time for them.
Twelve years ago, the Brooklyn-born Blechmans sold their Merrick, L.I., home and moved back into the city to be near their three children and the first of three grandchildren. They considered Waterside a renters' paradise, an interracial 1,500-apartment complex with good security, convenient shopping, community rooms, discount theater tickets, lavish holiday parties put on by the management (all thanks to Mr. Ravitch) and the feel of a small town. They paid only $1,322 per month (it is up to only $1,520 now) for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with eastern and southern views. This is below market value because the complex was built under the Mitchell-Lama laws intended to create affordable housing. Tenants had to qualify. There are less expensive apartments in the four-building complex for low-income families. The builder, Mr. Ravitch, got tax and mortgage breaks and, in exchange for a limit on profit, a limit on risk.
For the Blechmans, it was the good life of concerned middle-class seniors. Mr. Blechman, a retired certified public accountant, played bridge and golf. Mrs. Blechman, a semiretired interior designer, represented the Gray Panthers at the United Nations; Maggie Kuhn had personally picked her. They read current books, went to plays and concerts, wrote to politicians demanding that poor people and peace be given a chance. They spent the three winter months in warm Western states.
"In 1989, the place started going downhill," Mr. Blechman said. "Ravitch lost the Democratic mayoral primary, and he said, 'Now, I'll be a landlord.' "
"He said it to you?" I asked.
"Never met the man," Mr. Blechman said.
This was just before dinner, while he was giving me the tour. Set between the F.D.R. Drive and the East River around 25th Street, Waterside Plaza did seem like an oasis in the city; young familes and old folks strolled the plaza, kids skated and practiced smoking, all a footbridge away from First Avenue. But Mr. Blechman, who is a member of the tenants' executive council, pointed out leaks in the garage (where many cars had M.D. plates), and ugly patches in the concrete and the carpets, results, he said, of a
reduction in services and full-time personnel. He says many tenants think it is all part of a plot to raise rents to market value, drive the renters out and eventually sell the complex as a co-op. This may well be renters' paranoia and the demonization of Mr. Ravitch.
All of this was repeated and chewed over in the tenants' crowded, heated, two-hour meeting last Tuesday night. They listened to their president, Steve Smollens, and a council member, Jim Mahon, discuss the organization's lawsuit against Mr. Ravitch and the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. It seeks to overturn a 27.5 percent rent increase over four years, surcharges and vacancy decontrol. The fighting words "rent strike" filled the air.
Back upstairs afterward, over dessert and coffee, Mr. Blechman was debriefed by Ms. Blechman.
"It's our fault," he said. "When we abandoned the poor and the homeless, the rich like Ravitch came after us. To get their welfare."
"We need to reach out to other tenants' groups," she said, ever the Panther.
"This is a microcosm of what's happening in the city, the entire country," he thundered. "An economy created for big business, the hell with everybody else. And I'm not going to pay for it."
"So, Ralph," Ms. Blechman asked, "where are we going to go?"
