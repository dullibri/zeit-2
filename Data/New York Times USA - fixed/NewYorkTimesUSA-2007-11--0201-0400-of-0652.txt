REFINERY FIRE The Valero Energy Corporation, the biggest United States refiner, said its refinery in Port Arthur, Tex., was processing 185,000 barrels of oil a day, about 57 percent of capacity, after a fire early yesterday. Output is expected to increase over the next few days as the company begins to bring the refinery back into operation, Bill Day, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail message.
 The fire in the refinery's diesel hydrotreater followed a power disruption, Mr. Day said. The refinery, Valero's largest, is capable of processing 325,000 barrels of oil a day, the company said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) 
 A BIGGER STAKE IN GANNETT Brandes Investment Partners, the biggest investor in Gannett, has nearly doubled its stake in the newspaper publisher as the stock hits 10-year lows. Brandes owned 26.2 million shares in Gannett, or 11.3 percent of the company, as of Oct. 31, according to a regulatory filing, up from 15.5 million shares in March. Brandes, an investor in companies that have lost favor on Wall Street, also owned stakes in publishers McClatchy and The New York Times Company as of September.(BLOOMBERG NEWS) 
 TOY BEAD EXPORTS SUSPENDED 
 The Chinese government's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine ordered late yesterday a suspension of all exports of toy beads sold around the world under the brand names of Aqua Dots and Bindeez. The United States and Australia ordered recalls of the product this week after seven children became ill when they ate the beads; the beads have a chemical on their surfaces that the human body metabolizes to become GHB, a ''date rape'' drug that can cause unconsciousness and asphyxiation. Also yesterday, the Hong Kong government said that it had confirmed the presence of the chemical on the beads and was investigating whether Hong Kong laws were broken, as Hong Kong businesses helped organize the distribution of the beads from mainland Chinese factories.

 EUROPEAN FORECAST DIMS The European Union yesterday cut its economic forecasts for the next two years. ''Clouds have clearly gathered on the horizon with this summer's turbulence in the financial markets, the U.S. slowdown and the ever-rising oil prices,'' the union's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said. The European Commission forecast that growth in the bloc would slow to 2.4 percent in both 2008 and 2009, from 2.9 percent in 2007. (AP) 
 RETURNING $1.6 MILLION The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, handed over $1.6 million to the Brazilian government that had been illegally transferred to New York by unlicensed money service businesses in Brazil. The money came from $17.7 million that Mr. Morgenthau, above, froze last year after 34 people and 16 off-shore companies were indicted for running illegal money transfer firms in New York through accounts at Valley National Bank, a unit of Valley National Bancorp. Of that amount, $4.8 million has been forfeited so far and will be split between Brazil, New York and the United States government. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 IPHONES ABROAD Customers in Germany and Britain lined up to buy the iPhone as it made its debut there yesterday, with Apple hoping to replicate the success that the combination cellphone, music player and Web browser has seen in the United States. In Germany, the phone went on sale at more than 700 T-Mobile shops, including one in Cologne that opened just after midnight with some 350 customers already waiting outside. (AP)
 BUILDER SEEKS BANKRUPTCY Levitt & Sons, a home builder that pioneered the planned suburban community with Levittown on Long Island, N.Y., filed for bankruptcy, becoming the latest casualty in the housing market collapse. The company, a unit of the Levitt Corporation, today filed a Chapter 11 petition in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where it is based. Levitt listed debt of more than $100 million.

HEADLINE: Gaza's Isolation Takes Toll On Students and Prices

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting.

DATELINE: GAZA 

 BODY:
Miriam Ashour will turn 18 in November and speaks English with only the slightest of accents. She has a scholarship to study for a college degree in business administration at Columbia College, affiliated with the United Methodist Church, in Columbia, S.C.
 But she will miss at least the first semester. She is among some 670 Gazans enrolled in schools abroad who have been denied permission to leave the territory.
 That number includes six Fulbright scholars. Another two students, including Ms. Ashour, are sponsored by the Hope Fund, and a third by the Open Society Institute. At least 35 are enrolled in American institutions, according to an Israeli lobbying group, Gisha, which has sued the Israeli Supreme Court on behalf of the students. 
 Ms. Ashour said she still hoped to be allowed to leave, ''but I feel sad, because I may lose the scholarship.'' 
 Israel and Egypt have tightened the movement of goods and people into and out of Gaza since Hamas routed Fatah in June and took control of Gaza. The main goods crossings are shut, as is the Rafah crossing to Egypt for people. Israel is trying to use only the crossing at Kerem Shalom, which it controls, but Hamas and other militants have been mortaring it intermittently and demanding that the other crossings be opened.
 Israel has declared Gaza a ''hostile entity'' and is moving to reduce its supplies of energy to the territory, while maintaining imports of essentials for life, hoping to put economic pressure on Hamas to stop constant rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel. Gaza is thus isolated diplomatically and economically.
 According to the United Nations, an average of 74 truckloads of goods a day entered Gaza in October, down from 253 truckloads a day in April. The consequences have meant a shrinking economy coupled with a severe increase in prices even for basic foodstuffs like flour, cooking oil and chicken.
 The average income of nonrefugees in Gaza has dropped 22 percent since June and 70 percent of them are now existing on less than $1.20 a day, compared with 55 percent in June, according to the World Food Program.
 Since June, wheat prices have increased 40 percent, bread prices 20 percent and rice 15 percent. But because of the inability to export, the prices of vegetables have fallen 30 percent or more, further undermining the agricultural sector.
 ''Israel won't allow a humanitarian crisis,'' said Miri Eisin, spokeswoman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. ''But Hamas forcibly took over Gaza, and they are the rulers now, and we don't have to work after a violent takeover with people who attack us every day.''
 Asked if she understood Israeli policy, Ms. Ashour said: ''Yes, I do understand. Maybe if I were in their place I would do the same thing. But my family is clean. I'm not a hazard to anyone.''
 Ghassan Matar, 25, is a Fulbright scholar who has had to delay his studies in business information systems at Central Michigan University. ''No such field of studies exists in Gaza,'' he said. ''My dream is to focus on outsourcing in software, so I can invest in Gaza's human resources. Such a field can flourish even if the crossings are closed.''
 But Mr. Matar, who was supposed to start school on Aug. 27, is stuck in Gaza. The university, he said, has agreed to let him begin in the spring semester, in January. ''I'm afraid to lose this chance,'' he said. ''I've worked two years to get this scholarship.'' He describes himself as apolitical. ''I blame all the parties,'' he said.
 The issue of the students has embarrassed the Israeli government, which is facing lawsuits and bad publicity for denying ordinary Gazans the chance to study in the West.
 Christopher Gunness, a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, dealing with Palestinian refugees, said, ''It cannot be in Israel's interest to shrink the intellectual space in which peace and moderation can grow in Gaza.''
 He added: ''The next generation must have a decent education, both as a bridge from this shut-down Gaza and over which different values can find their way in. We all need to step back and look at the bigger picture. Isolation risks driving the younger generation into the hands of the radicals.''
 Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said that Hamas mortars had complicated the exit of students and the infirm, but that the government wanted to solve the student issue. ''We don't want to keep students locked up inside Gaza,'' Mr. Regev said. ''It's kind of a self-inflicted wound. We hope to have a solution shortly.''
 Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the army's coordinating office that deals with Gaza, said the issue was complicated. The Erez crossing into Israel was problematic, in part because Jordan did not want to handle hundreds of students, he said, followed by as many as 4,000 people seeking medical attention abroad. 
 An earlier effort to bus Gazans through Erez to Nitzana into Egypt was dangerous and long, he said, so now Israel wants to use Kerem Shalom. But Hamas regularly mortars it, and the airport authority that ran it removed security equipment when it was shut. ''We're trying to find a way to get them out with a high level of security,'' Mr. Dror said. ''If Hamas stops attacking Kerem Shalom, we can move out several hundred people a day.''
 But the problems of the students can seem minor compared to other restrictions. Marwan Sawafiri, 40, who runs the Sawafiri for Chicken shop in Gaza City, said the price of chicken has risen about 40 percent since the end of Ramadan in mid-October, when Israel stopped allowing special shipments for the holiday. 
 Gazans raise chickens, he said. But the chickens are hatched from fertilized eggs imported from Israel, and fed with Israeli chicken feed. ''Now we get many fewer imports, so the prices go up,'' he said. 
 Coca-Cola and packaged fruit juice have disappeared from shops, and a printer cartridge costs $60. Even the price of flour, considered a necessity by Israel, has gone up 40 percent, said Muhammad Hassouna, 30, who runs his family's grocery. 
 Hamad Dahdar, 25, the chief butcher at a clean but nearly empty meat shop, has been told that he can work only 20 days a month, to save other jobs. His income has gone down by a third, to $200 a month, ''and you can see, we're just standing around,'' he said.
 Stewing beef has gone up a third in price, ''and people who once bought a kilo buy only a half,'' he said. Beef and lamb are also imported through Israel and quantities are down. But taxes are not. The Hamas administration in Gaza, cut off by the Fatah-appointed government in Ramallah, is taxing imports, from cigarettes to beef. ''Now we have two governments,'' Mr. Dahdar said. ''And both of them want to collect taxes.''

HEADLINE: As Oil Soars, Natural Gas Is a Bargain

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
E-mail: norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As oil prices surged over the last few months, natural gas prices in the United States did something that could help to cushion the economic shock. They fell.
 A result is that those who heat their homes with natural gas -- by far the dominant fuel in the United States -- will see prices roughly in line with last winter's. But for those who use heating oil, as many do in the Northeast, prices seem likely to be about 50 percent higher than they were last winter.
 Oil and gas prices have never moved in lock step, in part because each has different users. But the bigger reason is that one is part of a global market and the other is not. 
 Tankers can move oil or refined products to anywhere from anywhere, and will do so if prices rise in one region relative to those in another. Growing demand for oil in Asia, as well as fears of instability in the Middle East, have helped to raise oil prices.
 Natural gas, on the other hand, has limited worldwide transportation. The market for liquefied natural gas is growing, and is a significant part of energy planning in China and other countries. But there is little capacity to move L.N.G. out of the United States if prices here fail to keep up with those in other parts of the world, as they have this year. While some power plants can shift between oil and natural gas, most users cannot, no matter how much prices get out of line. 
 And they are out of line now. Oil costs about 60 percent more than it did two years ago, but natural gas is selling for about a third less than it was during the winter of 2005-6, when there were fears of natural gas shortages. It has been more than a decade since the United States headed into a winter with natural gas this cheap relative to oil.
 The charts show what has happened this year, focusing on futures contracts for delivery of oil and natural gas in February, at the height of the winter. They also look at the prices of February contracts as winter was approaching in past years.
 At the end of 2006, oil for delivery in February 2008 cost $67.18 per barrel, while natural gas for delivery then was selling for $8.90 per million B.T.U.'s. Starting this summer, the price of oil began to soar, to the point that it exceeded $94 a barrel this week. But gas costs a little less than it did at the end of last year.
 On a relative basis -- comparing the amount of energy bought with a dollar's worth of oil with a dollar's worth of natural gas -- the price for gas is now about half that of oil. That was the ratio prevailing back in 1990 and 1991, when the ''gas bubble'' of excess American production was viewed as holding down natural gas prices. It is the opposite of what happened two years ago, when gas became scarce and prices surged to levels well above those of oil.
 The fact that natural gas prices have not risen could be good news for the American economy, which has been troubled by reports of slowing retail sales as home prices fall. Americans will be paying much more for gasoline and home heating oil this winter, but those who heat with gas -- assuming unexpected weather does not cause big price movements -- could end up both warm and with enough money to buy other things.

HEADLINE: Exports Help Shrink the Trade Deficit to Lowest Level in Two Years

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
A surge in export sales, fueled by the dollar's record-low value against the euro, sent the United States trade deficit to its lowest level in more than two years, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
 That would usually be considered good news for the economy. A narrower trade deficit signals strong demand for American goods and services, a boost for domestic businesses.
 But foreigners are flocking to American products for a simple reason: the dollar has hit record lows against the euro. Domestically, a weak currency can lead to higher prices on a broad range of products, clamping down on consumers' ability to spend. 
 All of which means that today's trade report is something of a double-edged sword.
 ''It's good news for U.S. producers,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at the research firm Global Insight. ''And it's bad news for U.S. consumers.''
 The gap between what Americans import and export shrank 0.6 percent in September, to $56.4 billion. The deficit in August was revised down, to $56.8 billion. A year ago, the deficit was $64.1 billion.
 The report came as cheerful news to economists who said that United States companies are more dependent than ever on foreign sales. 
 ''We absolutely, desperately need to get strength from exports,'' Mr. Gault said. ''It's not going to prevent the economy from slowing down, but it may limit the damage.''
 Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned this week that the ailing dollar will contribute to a curbing of economic growth in the coming months.
 Gary C. Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he was cautiously optimistic about the trade report, but he noted that the United States may be more vulnerable to global financial shake-ups.
 ''The way this will come back to bite us is if the rest of the world really slows down,'' Mr. Hufbauer said. ''I'm not at all sure that the emerging countries and Europe and Japan will stay on this nice good growth path they're on right now.''
 In one good sign for the domestic economy, prices of nonenergy imports rose only 0.3 percent last month, a sign that the risk of inflation may be contained. The price of crude oil has surged in recent weeks to record levels, but the increase has not bled into other foreign products.
 The price of exports also rose in October by 0.9 percent, a jump from September's tepid 0.3 percent pace, the Labor Department said today. Higher-priced exports mean that American businesses are charging customers more for products, a boon for domestic companies. 
 The trade report suggested that foreigners are traveling to the United States in large numbers, perhaps on the spending strength of the record-high euro.
 Export sales of food and beverages leaped 9.4 percent in September, while sales of imported foods and beverages dipped 0.4 percent in the same period. 
 Over all, export sales rose 1.1 percent in September and are up 13.6 percent for the year. Consumer goods, semiconductors, and food and beverage items led the gains.
 On the domestic front, Americans bought slightly more foreign products, with sales of imports up 0.6 percent in September after a 0.7 percent decline in August. Aircraft and technology goods recovered somewhat from recent declines.

HEADLINE: Lessons in Shakespeare, From Stage to Boardroom

BYLINE: By HARRIET RUBIN

 BODY:
James Dimon rediscovered Shakespeare shortly after he was fired from his job as president of Citigroup by the man who had been almost like a father to him, Sanford I. Weill. 
 As Mr. Dimon recounts it, he was invited to give a talk at Columbia Business School to students who had been studying power and succession using ''King Lear.'' Mr. Dimon said he learned that afternoon in 1998 that in that play Shakespeare had written a case study that eerily predicted his dismissal from Citigroup and the rise and fall of Charles O. Prince III, who got the top job at Citigroup that once seemed likely to go to Mr. Dimon. 
 In an interview this week, as reporters were pressing him to discuss why his current employer, JPMorgan Chase, has so far weathered the subprime storm better than its rivals, Mr. Dimon took time out to acknowledge Shakespeare's lessons. 
 ''In tough times like these, you see more of the good and more of the bad in people,'' Mr. Dimon said. ''You can go for a long time and be fooled by people's behavior, but Shakespeare gives you insights that help you understand the people you are dealing with. 
 ''I don't relate what's happening so much to the market as to how people behave. You want to know that in the foxhole with you is a person of good character, that they have a true north. Shakespeare is even better than Freud in showing you the characters you are dealing with.'' 
 Shakespeare has been a staple of management training for a long time. But only in the last few years have programs been started that use Shakespeare's works to teach chief executives the vulnerabilities to which the powerful are susceptible. 
 ''C.E.O.'s are the modern kings and queens of the global world,'' says Kevin Coleman, a Shakespearean actor who dramatizes for chief executives how a mistake made in the global economy might have vast and unintended consequences. 
 Ken Adelman, a former Reagan administration official, and his wife, Carol, have been dressing managers in Elizabethan costumes since the 1990s. Senior executives have been increasingly joining the classes and re-enacting the speech in which Henry V urges his ''band of brothers'' to fight to the death. In 2002, Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass., became the new home of the Radcliffe-affiliated Arden Institute and offers quarterly seminars that analyze the moral actions of leaders. The Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Va., has had a sideline in management coaching in conjunction with the Federal Executive Institute, but is tailoring its newest programs to leadership development. 
 David Rothkopf, the co-founder of a consulting firm that helps chief executives manage risks, said that character was ''more crucial now than ever because past performance is no indicator of future performance.'' He added: ''Experience falls away and all you're left with is character. That's the master insight of Shakespeare and a necessary insight because the higher a person rises, the less likely that someone's going to call him on his flaws.'' 
 Stephen Greenblatt, a professor of Renaissance literature and an expert in Shakespeare at Harvard, said that ''Henry V'' appeals to chief executives not because there are four or five management principles to be made of his career. '''Henry V' is actually a play about the necessity of betraying your friends at court, and dealing with the cost of that,'' Professor Greenblatt said. ''Studying the consequences of these actions makes powerful people more richly human.'' 
 Mr. Coleman said he noticed the chief executives in a recent audience grow pale as he played the role of Hamlet confronted by the ghost of his father. 
 ''The ghost demands, 'if you love me you will avenge my murder.''' The C.E.O.'s told him, Mr. Coleman said: '''This is the dilemma we face: what is our responsibility to shareholders, to employees, to clients?' It became an emotional discussion. C.E.O.'s who have to be so certain, so in control, were asking, 'What do I do as a person? Where does my loyalty and my sense of love and justice lie?''' 
 Chuck Schwager, chief executive of the Polaris Healthcare Corporation in Boston, said he had a conversion experience at a lecture on Shakespeare and power at Arden and became a part-time actor. ''There are sensitivities about power that Shakespeare knew better than I did, and I wanted to find out what those were,'' Mr. Schwager said. 
 Dana Gioia, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, said that Shakespeare was the last writer who lived at a socially fluid time that permitted him to work in close proximity both to kings and queens and to working people. He grasped the psyche of power, Mr. Gioia said. 
 ''Corporations tend to be run by very ambitious and focused men and women,'' Mr. Gioia added. ''They are not likely to be people who have learned the human truths that art teaches best. The higher you get in corporate life, the more you need the truths you get from Shakespeare, which point you in directions rather than provide you pat answers. We remember truths more vividly when they are embodied in a story.'' 
 Shakespeare was fascinated by the art of leadership, Professor Greenblatt said, and used his insight to found and lead London's most profitable theater. 
 It is Shakespeare's very human language, says Ralph Alan Cohen, director of the Blackfriars, that helps contemporary leaders keep things honest. ''Shakespeare's language is not old English. It's young English. It has all its hormones and is full of life. Organizations try to hide the force of human truth in every kind of Latinate term we can find, like 're-engineering' or 'Six Sigma.' Shakespeare empowers people to trust their own language, not the bureaucratic line.'' 
 James Fugitte, the chief executive of the Wind Energy Corporation, a start-up company, said the plays' language gave him insight into power. Mr. Fugitte said he was handed the leadership of a bank in Lexington, Ky., at age 27 and discovered that mastering the intricacies of portfolio management was not enough. ''I learned the hard reality that people don't always tell the truth, they welch out on deals and don't repay loans.'' 
 To grasp human motivation, Mr. Fugitte said he started reading Shakespeare. That, he said, is when he realized that he, too, was not all he seemed, hardly the commanding leader: ''I have the banker's habit of trying to avoid chaos. I don't let myself completely out. I feel like I've got to have a reserve against the next emergency.'' 
 To put himself in a fresh mind-set, he memorized the speeches of Falstaff, the king of amiable chaos, who keeps nothing in reserve. '' 'A plague on all cowards,' Falstaff shouts. He's out there and that's what I need to do, to get beyond the impulse to analyze, control everything and stop it from happening.
 ''It's a Falstaffian world. When I began my career, there was a scarcity of capital. Now there's an abundance of capital.'' Falstaff, he added, ''C'est moi.'' 
 Mr. Coleman, the actor, said that no other author ''has as great a hold on our psyches.'' Shakespeare, he added, is ''the operating system in our brains, always there, quietly humming.'' Of the top 10 books on almost all high school reading lists, 4 are usually by Shakespeare, and the others, like ''A Separate Peace'' or ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' are inspired by Shakespeare, Mr. Coleman added. ''He becomes the voice of authority. Whatever you do, he'll haunt you for the rest of your life.''

The Federal Communications Commission is preparing to impose significant new regulations to open the cable television market to independent programmers and rival video services after determining that cable companies have become too dominant in the industry, senior commission officials said.
 The finding, under a law that gives the commission expanded powers over the cable television industry if it becomes too big, is expected to be announced this month. It is a major departure for the agency and the industry, which was deregulated by an act of Congress in 1996. 
 Officials say the finding could lead to more diverse programs; consumer groups say it could also lead to lower rates.
 Heavily promoted by those groups and by the commission's Republican chairman, Kevin J. Martin, the decision would be a notable exception to the broad deregulatory policies of the Bush administration. Officials in various agencies have relaxed industry regulations and have chosen not to challenge big corporate mergers. 
 ''The finding will provide the commission with additional authority to assure that there is opportunity for additional voices,'' Mr. Martin said Friday in an interview. ''It is important that we continue to do all we can to make sure that consumers have more opportunities in terms of their programming and that people who have access to the platform assure there are diverse voices.''
 The commission's conclusion that the cable industry has grown too large will be used to justify a raft of new cable television rules and proposals. They include a cap that would prevent the nation's largest cable company, Comcast Corporation, from growing, and would prevent other large cable companies, like Time Warner, from making any new large cable acquisitions.
 The decision comes as Mr. Martin is about to formally announce his plan to relax a different media ownership rule. That rule has restricted a company from owning a newspaper and a television or radio station in the same community. 
 How dominant the cable industry is has been a matter of dispute. The largest cable companies say they are under increasing competition from the satellite and telephone companies. But commission officials and consumer groups say that the large cable companies dominate the marketplace. They cite as evidence the fact that cable rates have risen significantly faster than inflation. 
 Next week, Mr. Martin is expected to formally propose that the newspaper and broadcast cross-ownership restriction be relaxed in the nation's largest cities if the television station is not one of the largest in the community. He has told officials that he hopes to complete action on that rule in December.
 The cable finding suggests that Mr. Martin is not approaching the media ownership debate with a uniform deregulatory approach -- as his predecessor did -- but is instead taking a more nuanced approach and intervening in one market, cable television, even as he tries to loosen the rules for other media conglomerates.
 In the cable proceeding, senior commission officials said that this month the agency would announce as part of its annual report on the state of the video services market that it has broad new regulatory authority over the cable industry under the so-called 70/70 rule of the Cable Communications Act of 1984.
 Under that provision, the agency may adopt rules necessary to promote ''diversity of information sources'' once the commission concludes that cable television is available to at least 70 percent of American households, and at least 70 percent of those households actually subscribe to a cable service. 
 Officials and consumer groups said that the 70/70 cable television finding would provide the legal basis for the commission to adopt rules in the coming weeks and months aimed at increasing programming and reducing rates for consumers.
 The consumer groups and networks that are independent of the cable companies have long maintained there is no adequate process for the commission to sort complaints when a cable company refuses to carry programs.
 The commission is preparing to take steps to make it less expensive for rivals of the largest cable conglomerates to buy their programs -- so that, for instance, a satellite company would find it less expensive to buy programs by the Turner Broadcasting System, a unit of Time Warner.
 One of the proposals under consideration by the commission would force the largest cable networks to be offered to the rivals of the big cable companies on an individual, rather than packaged, basis. That proposal, known as ''wholesale a la carte,'' is vigorously opposed by the large cable companies.
 The agency is also preparing to adopt a rule this month that would make it easier for independent programmers, which are often small operations, to lease access to cable channels.
 And Mr. Martin has been circulating a plan that would use the finding on cable television dominance to set a cap on the size of the nation's largest cable companies so that no company could control more than 30 percent of the market.
 The limit would prevent Comcast from acquiring more cable companies and would significantly limit the growth of other large players, notably Time Warner. The commission's previous cap on cable ownership was thrown out six years ago by a federal appeals panel that said the agency had not provided an adequate justification for the rule.
 Immediate winners from the cable finding are independent program networks, like NFL Network and Hallmark Channel, that do not have business affiliations with the cable companies, the satellite television companies and the telephone companies that are seeking to compete by offering their own video services.
 Consumer groups applauded the cable television decision, although some speculated that it could give Mr. Martin some political cover as he sets about taking other aspects of media control in a deregulatory direction. (The groups oppose the deregulation of other media ownership rules.)
 ''The 70/70 finding is enormous,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, an advocacy organization devoted to diversity of voices and ownership that has opposed consolidation in the media. ''It gives the commission a blank check to regulate an industry that Congress had largely deregulated.'' Fearing new regulation, the cable industry has lobbied the commission for years to challenge the method used to count the market. 
 Officials and lobbyists from the cable industry criticized the finding, saying that independent studies and the commission's own analysis from last year have concluded that cable television, while available to far more than 70 percent of American households, is actually used by far less than 70 percent of those households. They also suggested that Mr. Martin had an overly expansive view of the rule, and that it could only be used in limited circumstances. 
 ''Every independent analysis of the marketplace shows that cable serves less than 70 percent of the nation's households,'' said Kyle McSlarrow, the president and chief executive of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the industry's main trade group. ''And even the F.C.C. staff concluded last year that cable was well short of this threshold.
 ''The provision itself is a relic of decades-old regulation and there is no basis for reviving it now,'' Mr. McSlarrow added. ''Twisting statistics in order to breathe life into this rule is simply another attempt to justify unnecessary government intrusion into a marketplace where competition is thriving and new technology is providing consumers more choices, better programming and exciting new interactive services.'' 
 By contrast, consumer groups and phone companies have urged the commission to invoke the rule. They say it gives the commission broader authority than the cable industry has claimed.
 ''The finding will give the commission an arsenal of tools to limit discriminatory practices -- notably exclusive dealing, tying arrangements and other relationships -- if they harm the diversity of programming,'' said Gene Kimmelman, vice president for federal affairs at Consumers Union and an outspoken critic of the cable television industry.
 The commission's finding and its expected new regulations are the latest moves by Mr. Martin against the cable industry's largest players.
 Mr. Martin has repeatedly criticized the companies for rapidly raising rates and providing many channels that few viewers watch. He also expressed alarm about the close business ties between the cable companies and many of the largest producers of programs.
 And Mr. Martin has urged the companies to offer consumers more choices so that they do not have to pay for dozens of channels that they never watch.

HEADLINE: House Backs Tax Relief Bill, But Fate in Senate Is Unsure

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
The House passed a $78.3 billion tax bill on Friday that would shield about 21 million people from the alternative minimum tax next year, and pay for it in part by ending tax breaks for private equity funds, hedge funds and other partnerships.
 But the bill, approved 216 to 193, faces a highly uncertain future in the Senate. Republicans are staunchly opposed to any tax increases, and some Democrats are torn between appealing to their party instincts and alienating some of their big contributors. 
 President Bush has already threatened to veto the bill, which also includes extensions of several other tax provisions, if it includes higher taxes that would shift more of the tax burden to the wealthy. He argues that Congress should freeze the alternative minimum tax without trying to make up the $50.6 billion revenue loss for the 2007 tax year.
 Following Mr. Bush's prescription, however, would increase the budget deficit, something Democrats have vowed to avoid. Because it is not adjusted for inflation, and because of the way it interacts with Mr. Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, the alternative tax has exploded in the last six years and is set to hit people with incomes as low as $50,000.
 Congress has prevented that expansion by passing a series of one-year ''patches,'' but the cost of those patches has exploded. House Democrats said their bill was both fiscally responsible and fair, protecting middle-income families without additional borrowing by repealing tax breaks that benefit the wealthiest people in the world.
 ''This is not a tax increase,'' declared Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''This is the closing of a tax loophole, and you should be proud to participate in that.''
 Republicans charged that Democrats were simply raising taxes, because Congress never seriously intended to impose the alternative minimum tax on anybody but a handful of millionaires.
 ''The A.M.T. is crazy; it was never meant to apply to middle-class taxpayers,'' said Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana. ''Why are we trying to collect it?''
 But President Bush and his Republican allies have been dodging this issue for years. All of Mr. Bush's budget plans have counted on a rising torrent of revenue from the alternative minimum tax, and his most recent plan assumes $1 trillion in such revenue over the next decade.
 Democrats, for their part, are torn between trying to tame the tax and keeping their promises about fiscal discipline. 
 If Congress fails to act within the next few weeks, the alternative minimum tax will hit 21 million families with an average tax increase of $2,000 on their 2007 tax returns. 
 But if Democrats pass a tax cut without trying to make up for the missing revenue, they would be undermining their signature tool for enforcing fiscal discipline: the ''pay as you go'' rules, which require that any new tax cut must be offset with tax increases or spending cuts in other areas.
 The alternative tax, first imposed in 1969 to make sure that tax deductions and loopholes did not allow very wealthy people to escape paying income taxes altogether, is a parallel tax calculation that blocks many tax breaks for individuals.
 Congress and President Bush have prepared their budget proposals on the assumption that the A.M.T. revenues would soar each year, hitting $50 billion in 2007 and totaling about $1 trillion over the next decade. The fight is over how -- or whether -- to make up for the cost of restraining the tax, which tends to hit particularly hard at two-income families with children in states with comparatively high state income and local property taxes.
 Senate Democrats have such a narrow majority that many pivotal lawmakers are doubtful they can satisfy the pay-as-you-go rules and still muster the 60 votes needed to shut down any Republican filibuster. On top of that, Democrats like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York have been hesitant to endorse raising taxes on managers of private equity funds like the Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group.
 ''I don't know what will happen,'' said James Manley, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada. ''Republicans have made it crystal clear that they will block passage of the House bill in the Senate, because they don't believe the A.M.T. relief should be paid for -- even by closing tax loopholes.'' 
 Mr. Reid told reporters this week that the Senate would not take up the issue until December. 
 Private equity funds have spent millions lobbying in defense of the tax break for ''carried interest,'' which is the share of profits that fund managers receive as a fee for their work on behalf of their investors.
 Under current law, carried interest is taxed as capital gains, at 15 percent. Under the House bill, carried interest would be taxed at individual rates of up to 35 percent.
 Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Private Equity Council, defended the tax treatment of carried interest as a longstanding practice that was not a special loophole.
 ''The premise of the question is that you have this big tax loophole that is providing unearned and unwarranted tax relief,'' Mr. Lowenstein said. ''But it's part of the tax code that's been there for the better part of a century.''
 To reinforce that argument, the Blackstone Group, one of the world's biggest private equity buyout firms, paid the Ogilvy Group $3.74 million for lobbying work this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that monitors money in politics.
 The Private Equity Council, an industry trade group, has hired numerous well-connected Democratic lobbyists. Among them are Vic Fazio, a former member of Congress from California, and John Talisman, a former assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy under President Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: C.E.O. Evolution Phase 3

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Has the time come for C.E.O. Version 3.0?
 The first iteration made its mark in the 1990s, as chief executives like Sanford I. Weill, Gerald M. Levin, John F. Welch Jr. and Michael Eisner built empires, not to mention their profiles, at the companies they ran: Citigroup, Time Warner, GE and Disney. 
 When the shares deflated earlier this decade after the burst of the tech bubble and various corporate scandals, a new cadre moved in: the Fix-it Men. They were lower-key leaders like Charles O. Prince III of Citigroup and Richard D. Parsons of Time Warner, whose job it was to repair the excesses and mistakes of their predecessors.
 Now, management experts and longtime watchers of corporate America say the current environment demands, and is attracting, yet another kind of chief executive: the team builder. 
 ''It's someone who can assemble a team that functions as smoothly as a jazz sextet,'' said Warren Bennis, a professor of management at the University of Southern California and author of many books on leadership.
 In the last week, Mr. Prince and Mr. Parsons both announced they would be stepping aside. Mr. Prince's abrupt exit followed huge losses that dragged down Citigroup's long-stagnant stock, while Mr. Parsons is retiring at the end of 2007 after a five-year tenure, during which he stabilized the company but failed to move Time Warner shares higher. 
 A third chief executive, E. Stanley O'Neal of Merrill Lynch, was forced out late last month after his firm announced an $8.4 billion write-down.
 Mr. O'Neal substantially increased Merrill's revenue and profit during his tenure but has been criticized for forcing out subordinates he perceived as rivals, while several top executives left Citigroup during Mr. Prince's reign. Now both companies find themselves searching for permanent replacements. 
 ''They've got to have not just the cognitive ability to run a major firm, which Stan O'Neal definitely had, but the ability to make people feel like they're working together,'' Mr. Bennis said.
 Merrill and Citi might consider looking at chief executives like A.G. Lafley of Procter & Gamble or W. James McNerney Jr. of Boeing as archetypes of the new model, according to Mr. Bennis.
 ''Both felt the need to make sure the top hundred people know that they're in this together, that their fates are correlated,'' Mr. Bennis says. ''That's what it will take to succeed in this century.''
 Mr. Lafley and Mr. McNerney have won plaudits not merely for their personal style, but also for their bottom-line performance, with shares of Procter & Gamble and Boeing easily outpacing the likes of Citigroup and Time Warner, as well as the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, over the last two years.
 That's no coincidence, according to Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management there. ''The academic research says if you want to predict what the future financial performance over the next one to three years will be, you need to know the top team,'' he said.
 Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for executive programs at the School of Management at Yale, says the style of today's best chief executives differs from both the empire builders and the cleanup specialists. 
 The former were known for public swagger and boardroom-size egos, while the latter often excelled at a narrow set of skills, Mr. Sonnenfeld said. He cited Mr. Prince's skills as a lawyer who was able to get his company back into the good graces of regulators after Mr. Weill's departure. Others say Mr. Parsons was a strong administrator, but failed to offer a strategy that satisfied Wall Street. 
 Mr. Sonnenfeld says Mr. Lafley and Mr. McNerney, along with Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox, possess the vision of the empire builders without their overpowering egos, while also bringing more personal warmth to the corner office
 Ms. Mulcahy, for example, was able to cut jobs and restore Xerox's profitability ''without coming across as mean-spirited,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said. Mr. Lafley ''is disarmingly unpretentious,'' he added. ''He never comes to my summits and I've never been a consultant for him, but he towers over other C.E.O.'s when it comes to putting in people stronger than himself or his ability to talk about setbacks.''
 Mr. Lafley has spent his entire career at Procter & Gamble, while Mr. McNerney arrived at Boeing after decades at General Electric, long regarded as something of a management boot camp, and after a successful stint as chief executive of 3M. Although clearly an outsider at Boeing, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, ''he learned to listen to the culture there.''
 This approach, he said, means these leaders were able to ''introduce change but people don't hate them for it; the team comes to them.''
 Mr. O'Neal, on the other hand, ''fired people who shouldn't have been fired,'' Mr. Bennis said. Mr. Prince, he added, ''was always in the shadow of Mr. Weill; he never was able to build his own team.''
 And when disaster struck in the form of billions in losses from the subprime meltdown, these weaknesses came back to haunt Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. 
 ''Whenever you have such a stunning decline, errors become much more visible,'' Mr. Bennis said.
 Of course, just as chief executives shape the times, so do the times shape them. ''There's a theory that the people who get to the top at big companies should be best at solving the problems of their era,'' Mr. Useem said.
 In fact, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, the original archetype was what he called ''the custodian,'' leaders who came of age during the Organization Man era of the 1950s, but were overwhelmed by the rapidly shifting economic landscape of the 1970s and 1980s. 
 They were followed by the empire builders who focused on mega-mergers and financial management in the 1990s to deliver the growth Wall Street demanded while getting big enough to achieve economies of scale and beat back foreign competitors. 
 The cleanup artists arrived on the scene in the wake of the collapse of Enron and WorldCom and the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which tightened government oversight of public companies. 
 At the same time, investors were demanding quick fixes. In Time Warner's case, Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, pressed for a quick breakup of the company, something Mr. Parsons was able to stave off.
 Business schools are also opting for the 3.0 approach. At the Yale School of Management last year, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, the dean and faculty threw out the old first-year curriculum that emphasized individual disciplines like finance and marketing and replaced it with a team-oriented approach, with professors teaching these subjects jointly. In addition, he said, ''We have students, faculty and staff assemble their own teams as part of their training to be future execs.''
 What will be the main challenge in the next 5 to 10 years? Mr. Useem predicted it would be achieving double-digit growth internally, without the benefit of huge deals or accounting sleight-of-hand. ''That's why I think the baton will go to the manager who will stimulate a division and will be creative and innovative,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Recession? What Recession?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
If it looks like a recession and feels like a recession ...
 ''Quite frankly,'' said Senator Charles Schumer, peering over his glasses at the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, ''I think we are at a moment of economic crisis, stemming from four key areas: falling housing prices, lack of confidence in creditworthiness, the weak dollar and high oil prices.''
 He asked Mr. Bernanke, at a Congressional hearing Thursday, if we were headed toward a recession. 
 An aide handed the chairman his dancing shoes, and Mr. Bernanke executed a flawless version of the Washington waffle. He said: ''Our forecast is for moderate, but positive, growth going forward.'' He said: ''Economists are extremely bad at predicting turning points, and we don't pretend to be any better.'' He said: ''We have not calculated the probability of recession, and I wouldn't want to offer that today.''
 With all due respect to the chairman, he would see the recession that so many others are feeling if he would only open his eyes. While Mr. Bernanke and others are waiting for the official diagnosis (a decline in the gross domestic product for two successive quarters), the disease is spreading and has been spreading for some time.
 The evidence is all around us. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland told Mr. Bernanke that many members of Congress are holding forums in their districts ''to help people who are coming to our doors, literally with tears in their eyes, and trying to figure out how they're going to manage a foreclosure that's right around the corner.''
 The housing meltdown is getting the attention, but there's so much more. Bankruptcies and homelessness are on the rise. The job market has been weak for years. The auto industry is in trouble. The cost of food, gasoline and home heating oil are soaring at a time when millions of Americans are managing to make it from one month to another solely by the grace of their credit cards.
 The country has been in denial for years about the economic reality facing American families. That grim reality has been masked by the flimflammery of official statistics (job growth good, inflation low) and the muscular magic of the American way of debt: mortgages on top of mortgages, pyramiding student loans and an opiatelike addiction to credit cards at rates that used to get people locked up for loan-sharking.
 The big story out of Mr. Bernanke's appearance before the Joint Economic Committee was his prediction that the economy was likely to worsen. Only the people still trapped in denial could have believed otherwise.
 This is what Representative Maurice Hinchey of upstate New York told the chairman:
 ''This economy is not doing well. And the example of the mortgage closures on 2 million people -- and maybe a lot more than that as time goes on -- is really not the cause of the economic problem we're facing, but it's just a factor of it. It's a factor of the weakness of this economy.''
 In an interview after the hearing, Representative Hinchey discussed the disconnect between official government reports and the reality facing working families. He noted that the unemployment rate does not include workers who have become so discouraged that they've given up looking for a job.
 And the most popular measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, does not include the cost of energy or food, ''the two most significant aspects of the increased cost of living for the American people.''
 The elite honchos in Washington and their courtiers in the news media are all but completely out of touch with the daily struggle of working families. Thirty-seven million Americans live in poverty and close to 60 million others are just a notch above the official poverty line.
 An illness, an auto accident, the loss of a job -- almost anything can knock them off their rickety economic perch.
 We hear over and over that consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of the gross domestic product, but we seldom hear about the frightening number of Americans who are trying desperately to maintain a working-class or middle-class style of life while descending into a sinkhole of debt.
 ''We have an economy that is based on increased debt,'' said Mr. Hinchey. ''The national debt is now slightly above $9 trillion, and ordinary working people are finding that they have to borrow more and more to maintain their standard of living.'' 
 ''The average now is that people are spending close to 10 percent more than they earn every month. Obviously, that can't be sustained.''
 The chickens of our denial are coming home to roost with a vengeance. Meanwhile, the elites are scouring the landscape for signs of a recession.

HEADLINE: In Battery Buying, Enough Decisions to Exhaust That Bunny

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
 DAYLIGHT saving time ended this week, and we were all told that it would be the perfect time to change the batteries on our smoke alarms.
So I go to my local drugstore, look at the selection and feel the same niggling doubt I have every time I buy batteries. Should I just choose the cheapest store brand? My wallet says yes, but I wonder if I am being penny-wise and pound-foolish.
 If I decide on a major brand, like Energizer or Duracell, do I buy the least-expensive option available? Or do I want the slightly pricier titanium or the top-of-the-line lithium ones?
 And what about rechargeables? 
 Batteries are like so many products today: too many choices with too little information and too much hype.
 So here is what I have sorted out.
 Alkaline batteries are the workhorse of the battery world. They are good for many everyday uses, particularly items that do not use much energy or are considered ''low drain.'' 
 Your smoke alarm, most children's toys and kitchen clock will run just fine on alkaline batteries and there is no real need to move up.
 The brand name does not matter that much if you are buying double or triple A batteries, said Bryan Noonan, vice president of Zbattery.com, a battery supplier that is worth looking at to buy lower-priced brand-name batteries. But avoid buying carbon zinc batteries, also known as heavy duty, he said. The name is a misnomer, as they do not last as long as basic alkaline.
 In tests that Mr. Noonan's company has done on C, D and 9-volt batteries, Energizer and Duracell lasted 20 percent longer than store or off-brand names, he said.
 On the Web site of the CVS drugstore, four store-brand AA alkaline batteries cost $3.99, which was $1 less than the same type and quantity of Energizer batteries.
 A November 2006 Consumers Report on AA batteries ranked Kirkland Signature (the Costco brand) alkaline battery as the best value for money for AA batteries, followed by Duracell Coppertop and Rite-Aid.
 Energizer Titanium, however, attracted me. Maybe it was because it sounded so sleek, so powerful -- like something Superman would use to fight off the effects of kryptonite. And at $5.69 for a four-pack of double As, maybe it was worth it.
 ''Titanium is good for high-drain devices such as digital cameras and MP3 players,'' Mr. Noonan said. ''They are a little more expensive, but last between 25 and 50 percent longer.'' Small amounts of titanium-containing compound are added to the battery to improve performance by lowering resistance, so less charge is lost as heat.
 Consumer Reports ranked them No. 1 among ''premium alkaline batteries.''
 The top of the line are lithium batteries (not to be confused with lithium-ion batteries, which are typically used in laptops and cellphones) which cost $9.99 for Energizer AA batteries at CVS, $4 more than the superalkaline ones.
 But they may be worth it. Digital cameras with lithium batteries took seven times the number of photos that those with alkaline batteries did, said Tony Mazzola, technical marketing manager for Energizer.
 ''The biggest benefit of lithium batteries is that you don't have to change them as often,'' Mr. Noonan said. Their shelf life is also better. Mr. Mazzola said lithium batteries hold their power, unused for up to 15 years compared with alkaline batteries, which have a shelf life of up to 7 years.
 Speaking of storage, contrary to popular belief, it is not a good idea to store batteries in a refrigerator. It does not prolong shelf life and the condensation when you take the batteries out can actually damage them.
 On to rechargeables, which generally are more expensive than one-time-use batteries ($11.29 for an Energizer four-pack of double As at CVS, not including the price of the recharger, which retails for $9.99.) But are they a better bet economically and environmentally?
 Again, it depends on what you are using them for. Rechargeable batteries can be a better value over the long term in products that use short bursts of power, like digital cameras, hand-held games and some toys.
 But that is true only if you use the item frequently. Do not put rechargeable batteries in flashlights, for example, or a camera that you use only occasionally because they drain quickly even when the gadget is not in use. So if you leave your camera sitting around for a month or so, you probably will have to recharge the batteries before you can shoot, said Isidor Buchmann, chief executive of Cadex Electronics, which runs a helpful Web site called www.batteryuniversity.com
 ''A good rule of thumb is, if you can't remember the last time you used that device, it's probably not a good place to use rechargeables,'' Mr. Mazzola said.
 Most of the round rechargeable batteries -- that is AA, AAA and the like, as opposed to those found in your cellphone or laptop -- are made of nickel metal hydride, which is largely replacing nickel cadmium. They have a storage life of four to five years.
 To address the problem of betteries that drain quickly, Duracell has introduced a nickel metal hydride rechargeable battery that retains power for up to a year. Called Duracell Pre-Charged Rechargeable, it is intended specifically for use in digital cameras, MP3 players and portable games, with a price of about $12.99 for four.
 It is true, as every instruction booklet warns, that you should not mix regular and rechargeable batteries, or for that matter, put new batteries in with old, Mr. Buchmann said.
 ''It's like a chain, and the old battery will be the weak link,'' he said.
 Once I started looking into batteries, it was easy to get sucked into an endless stream of questions. Fortunately I already wrote about the issue of cellphone batteries in a previous column (March 3, 2007). 
 But I will address iPods, since with them, unlike most hand-held gizmos, there is no obvious way to replace the battery.
 One option is to send the iPod to Apple, at a cost of $59 and $6.95 for shipping. The company's Web site says the whole process should take about a week. But you have to remember to back up your tunes on a hard drive because they will not be saved on the replacement.
 Apple warns that the replacement iPod may be new, used or refurbished.
 There is also the option to buy an iPod battery over the Internet. For example, LaptopsforLess.com sells a battery for most iPods, along with a little tool to install it and step-by-step instructions for $15.95 plus $7 shipping..
 ''You don't have to back up your music and you don't have to send off your iPod,'' said Jeff Gardner, chief marketing officer of LaptopsforLess.com. ''It's really easy to do -- it doesn't require a lot of electrical know-how.''
 But Lance Ulanoff, editor in chief of PC Magazine, who has written about iPod batteries, did not recommend a do-it-yourself battery replacement.
 ''It's still a risky operation,'' he said. ''Most iPods don't have visible screws and prying it open can lead to damage and void the warranty.'' 
 Another option is www.pdasmart.com, which will either supply you with a battery or replace it for you.
 One thing everyone agrees on is that all batteries should be recycled, and most communities offer battery recycling sites. For rechargeable batteries, you can log onto www.call2recycle.org, or call 1-877-2-RECYCLE (1-877-2-732-9253) and find the location of a local site that collects rechargeable batteries, including those in laptops and cellphones.
 I am sure this is not the last word on batteries. But right now, there is one tool that is thoroughly drained and needs to be recharged: my brain.

HEADLINE: Cool Cars And Hot Laps In Malaysia

BYLINE: By TOWLE TOMPKINS. 
Towle Tompkins is director of television operations at RSN Television in Portland, Me.

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 

 BODY:
 EVEN though the woman in full burqa isn't taking a picture of me with her cellphone, it's still a special moment as Faisal Asri instructed me to brake late approaching the turn, downshift and accelerate toward the apex and then floor it.
 Easy for Mr. Asri, because he's a championship motorcycle racer and an important member of the motorsports division of Proton, Malaysia's national car company, which is also the parent of Lotus, the British sports car maker. Not so easy for me, since my racing experience consists of one day at the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving and occasional G-force forays on karting tracks and Interstate 95 exit ramps. Plus, I'm driving a Lotus in Malaysia, so I'm shifting with my left hand and tracking the car from the unfamiliar right-hand side. 
 I am also intimidated by the Sepang International Circuit, home to a Formula One race, the Malaysian Grand Prix, and a course considered one of the world's fastest and best laid-out. Not that I'm negotiating the 3.4-mile, 15-turn circuit all that fast, but my hope is that after the inaugural lap, I'll be able to make like Michael Schumacher. 
 Malaysia, like much of Asia, is slightly car crazy. It's reminiscent of California in the 1960s, when racing and cool cars were prominent components of the culture. But in Malaysia the soundtrack is less the Beach Boys' ''Little Deuce Coupe'' and more Rihanna's ''Shut Up and Drive.''
 Video games like Grand Prix Challenge and Forza Motorsport, plus the expansion of Formula One racing into Japan, China, Turkey and Malaysia, have helped to fuel the passion. 
 In return, Asia-grown automotive pursuits like drifting, where competitors try to slide their cars sideways in a half dozen consecutive drifts, have found popularity in America.
 Malaysians, however, don't have an easy time indulging their automotive desires, and are more often spectators than participants. The biggest hurdle is the country's per person purchasing power parity, which was $12,900 in 2006 compared with $44,000 in the United States. Basic transportation like the Proton Persona sedan costs about $14,000, about the same as a Mazda 3 in the United States, but takes a higher percentage of the average income. Step up to, say, a BMW 325i and the base price is more than $87,650 in Malaysia versus the equivalent model, the 328i, at $33,175 in the United States. 
 The streets of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital and largest city, teem with motorcycles and mopeds as well as econobox Protons, Toyotas, Hondas, Kias, Nissans and Peugeots. This makes significantly more expensive Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus and Lotus models stand out like truffles on a deli platter. 
 Yet the high cost of buying an automobile in Malaysia hasn't stopped at least a local niche manufacturer from entering the market. Since 2000, TD Cars, based about 15 miles outside Kuala Lumpur, has been selling a two-seater in the style of a 1950s MG TD roadster. Based on a design that originated in Australia in 1984 and incorporates some elements from MG's later TF series, the Malaysian TD has a 130-horsepower 2-liter Toyota engine.
 K. B. Woo, a principal in TD Cars and the director of Malaysia's Institute of the Motor Industry, let me and my colleague, Jessica York, take his red TD 2000 Silverstone MK II for a spin. 
 It was Malaysia's Independence Day holiday, so Kuala Lumpur's streets were relatively uncrowded. During our half-hour drive, we found that the fiberglass-and-steel car had roughly the same acceleration as a Mazda MX-5, but with considerably less handling and steering sophistication, and with a snugger interior. 
 What the TD 2000 does, though, is attract as much attention as Paris Hilton at a bail hearing. The woman in full burqa, standing at the base of the Petronas Towers, whipped out her cellphone to record our passing.
 TD Cars would like to enter the American market, but meeting safety regulations would be difficult. Not only that, the car retails in Malaysia for $50,500 and up.
 Proton says it has no plans to import its sedans to the United States. Ahmad Fitzrie Baharom Alam Shah, an American-educated executive in Proton's corporate planning division, said the company was ''concentrating on regaining market share that we lost'' after regional trade restrictions were eliminated last year.
 This allowed other Asian manufacturers to encroach on Proton's hegemony but, as he noted, ''China, South Africa and Iran are the growth markets for us.'' The three countries are expected to help Proton significantly increase its 200,000 annual output. 
 He said the engineering and development prowess of Lotus gave Proton an edge in producing its bread-and-butter sedans. As for performance forays, that's where Mr. Asri comes in. He is deeply involved in the company's R3 initiatives. That stands for race, rally and research, and is Proton's version of Nissan's Nismo and Toyota's TRD in-house performance divisions. 
 Proton takes, for example, its Savvy hatchback, adds spoilers, camshafts, steel wheels, performance tires and one of those Alaska pipeline-size tailpipes and turns it into the kind of boy racer familiar to Americans who regularly see tricked-out Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas. Mr. Asri also plays a part in keeping Proton's cars involved in rally and endurance racing and in sponsoring an A1 race, with national teams competing in a world cup format, at Sepang this month.
 Lotus accounts for much of Proton's image outside Asia. From its 1948 origins to its current Elise and Exige models, Lotus has adhered to the ''subtract weight to go faster'' theory of sports car design. An American version of the midengine Elise accelerates from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in less than five seconds -- and at 1,975 pounds, weighs a thousand pounds less than the New York Giants offensive lineup. 
 Lotuses are known for their go-kart-like handling as well as their handcrafted feel and are essentially racecars that have been tamed for everyday driving.
 At Sepang, with helmets snugly in place, Ms. York and I rode a couple of laps in a Proton Persona with a professional driver, Oh Kah Beng, at the wheel. Mr. Beng's brisk tour gave us a sense of the circuit's combination of challenging chicanes, fast straights and blind uphill turns. Then it was on to the Elise.
 Michael Schumacher, the Formula One driver, says in a new book about his 91 Grand Prix wins and 7 World Championships, that there are stretches like the Turn 5 and 6 combination in Malaysia ''where all you can do is brace yourself with all your strength against the centrifugal forces; you're fighting to be able to do things like keep your head up or change gears; you're fighting to keep control.'' 
 I know what he means: driving the Lotus fast -- and in control -- at Sepang was difficult. Some of the challenge I ascribe to the right-hand driving position and shifting. Mostly, it's my inexperience with the car and the course.
 My couch-potato preference has always been open-wheel racing -- IndyCar, Formula One, Champ Car -- so charging around a genuine Grand Prix track was quite entertaining. Both Ms. York's red Elise and my blue version easily exceeded 100 m.p.h. on the two main straights, and after six laps I felt that I had mastered some of the turns, although the first-gear hairpin that links the two straights was still a ragged exercise. The lightness of the car, the power from its 1.8-liter 190 horsepower engine (designed by Toyota and built by Yamaha) and its superb suspension made the Lotus a thrilling delight to drive fast.
 An autumn storm is approaching and we pull into the pits. We realize that we've been quite lucky to turn some hot laps and gain some high-speed confidence at this storied track.
 We also know that we will have to use this experience only for good. After all, I-95 exit ramps await our return home.

HEADLINE: Jordan, Fearing Islamists, Tightens Grip on Elections

BYLINE: By THANASSIS CAMBANIS

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
This month's legislative elections were supposed to be a watershed in this pro-American kingdom's slow but committed march to democratic change.
 But Hamas's rise to power in the Palestinian Authority and its violent takeover of Gaza in June have cast a heavy shadow over politics in Jordan, where a Hashemite monarch maintains a tight, authoritarian grip on a restive Palestinian majority and an activist Islamic opposition. 
 As a result, the government has dropped plans to change its byzantine electoral law, prohibited some critics from seeking office and threatened to bar independent observers from the polls. And, with less than two weeks before the Nov. 20 vote, opposition candidates are accusing the government of rampant voter fraud.
 The government's fears have resonated in some quarters of the liberal elite that just two years ago was pushing for a political overhaul that would allow national parties and free, fair elections. But Jordan's system restrains not only Islamists but also secular liberal parties and advocates of Palestinian rights. Many in the opposition accuse the government of using the specter of rising Islamism to justify autocratic rule. 
 ''We have democracy, but we don't want it to go to an extent where the radical people could rule the country,'' said Hakem Habahbeh, a pilot who was spending a recent evening at the campaign tent of Ahmed Saffadi, in a wealthy, liberal enclave. Mr. Saffadi, a former military officer and now a cellphone company executive, is running for Parliament from the third district of Amman, the capital. Political discussion in the tent ran late into the evening. Most of the talk involved rising prices and unemployment, and fear that Jordan's Islamists could follow the example of Hamas and rise to power. 
 ''We can't have more freedom right now, conditions don't allow it,'' said Ahmed Saleem, another Saffadi backer at the tent. With the examples of disorder nearby in the West Bank, Gaza and Iraq, he said, liberals in Jordan have set aside demands for political freedom. 
 ''Jordan needs stability,'' said Mr. Saleem, a bureaucrat in the mayor's office. ''We don't like to make trouble.''
 The slowdown in democratization has further alienated Jordan's only significant opposition party, the Muslim Brotherhood's Islamic Action Front, which commands deep support in urban areas, especially among Jordanians of Palestinian origin. The party has put forward 22 candidates, even fewer than it did in 2003, saying they would not stand a chance against the widespread government fraud it expects. 
 The Islamic Action Front boycotted municipal elections in July amid charges that the government was busing soldiers to districts and ordering them to vote for pro-government candidates. 
 Though some in the party say it would be better to participate in the coming elections, even if the voting is compromised, Zaki Bani Rsheid, the secretary general, argued for another boycott. 
 Mr. Bani Rsheid contends that in a completely open election, Islamists would win a plurality of votes and the right to form a government. (In the last parliamentary election in 2003, the Islamic Action Front won 17 of 110 seats.) 
 ''We gave the government legitimacy and got nothing in return,'' he fumed this week. ''The election will not be fair.''
 Islamists in Jordan have been given greater latitude to take part in political life than in most Arab countries, but Mr. Bani Rsheid says the government insists on ''no reform, no political change, no democracy,'' because ''they are looking at what happened to Hamas.''
 The elected legislature has limited powers in Jordan's heavily centralized monarchy, but the body has the authority to introduce legislation, which it rarely does, and to censure the cabinet, which it has done on occasion. All 110 legislative seats will be decided in the election.
 Independent Jordanian groups have trained thousands of monitors and have been tracking the campaign for illegalities, but they have been in a protracted fight with the government over access to polling stations.
 Already, candidates have charged that the government has illegally shifted the registrations of tens of thousands of voters to provinces where pro-government candidates need more votes. The government has denied the accusations but has refused to open the registration rolls to scrutiny. 
 Two people have been arrested on suspicion of offering money for votes. Analysts like Nahed N. Hattar, a Christian who writes for the Arab al Youm newspaper, said such vote buying is rampant. Mr. Hattar blames an influx of money from rich candidates, and from competing power centers in the government, which he says offer money for votes to maximize their parliamentary blocs.
 Beyond allegations of cheating, the election system is set up in a way that makes it hard for Islamists and other opposition candidates to compete. 
 The election law reserves seats in Parliament for women, and Christian and Circassian minorities. Gerrymandered districts overrepresent rural areas where Jordanian tribes are strong, and underrepresent urban areas dominated by Jordanians of Palestinian origin.
 Here in the capital, where more than a third of Jordan's population lives, every legislator represents about 95,000 people. In the rural provinces of Al Karak and At Tafilah, by contrast, each legislator represents about 2,000. 
 The government has not shied away from direct interference. In October, authorities banned Toujan al-Faisal, a former lawmaker and an outspoken critic of government corruption, from running for Parliament because of her 2002 conviction for ''harming the state's dignity.'' Ms. Faisal served 100 days in prison for the offense, which stemmed from her criticism of the government's approach to car insurance.
 ''Here the head of a corrupt government decides who can and cannot run for office,'' Ms. Faisal said in an interview in her home here. ''They want a Parliament that won't hold the government accountable for corruption.''
 For the most part, candidates have focused on issues like fighting inflation and promoting youth. Still, some slogans and speeches explore delicate topics, like the links between Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and those in Jordan, where the population is 30 percent to 60 percent Palestinian, depending on who is estimating. Credible estimates put the figure at 50 percent to 60 percent. 
 The campaign of Najati al Shakhshir, a Palestinian businessman who made much of his fortune renting cars in Jordan and Iraq, is based largely on demanding more rights for Palestinians. Palestinians, for example, are not allowed to hold senior jobs in the military. 
 ''All Jordanians have equal rights and obligations, no matter where they were born,'' said Mr. Shakhshir, whose family is from Nablus, in the West Bank.
 Such talk alarms some Jordanian analysts, who say it will only raise tensions between Jordanians of Palestinian origin and those East Bank Jordanians who lived here before the first influx of Palestinian refugees in 1948. 
 And the Muslim Brotherhood's party has done little to temper fears spurred by the Gaza takeover. A former secretary general of the Islamic Action Front, Hamza Mansour, is running a firebrand campaign with language almost identical to that of Hamas. 
 ''We must not give up the resistance,'' Mr. Mansour, a Palestinian whose family came to Jordan from Haifa, said Tuesday. ''We must never give up the right of return. We must condemn the embargo of Gaza!''
 At a voter rally in Amman's poor, hilly second district, Mr. Mansour -- wearing a traditional white tribal scarf on his head and a suit and tie -- showed a slide show featuring armed and masked Hamas fighters to about 75 men. His posters show two crossed swords supporting a Koran beneath the slogan, ''Choose Islam as your weapon.''
 ''The system has disfigured democracy,'' he shouted hoarsely. ''Don't let them hold us back.''

HEADLINE: Notes for a Theory of the Road Movie

BYLINE: By WALTER SALLES. 
Walter Salles, the director of ''Central Station'' and ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' is currently working on a film adaptation of ''On the Road.''

 BODY:
What is the origin of road movies? A year ago, I interviewed Wim Wenders on this topic for a documentary about ''On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac and the legacy of the Beat generation.
 For me, the first documentary filmmakers, like Robert Flaherty, the creator of the landmark 1922 film ''Nanook of the North,'' were the founding fathers of this narrative form. Jorge Luis Borges once said that what interested him in literature was naming what had not yet been named. The early documentary pioneers did exactly that. A movie like ''Nanook'' or ''Song of Ceylon,'' Basil Wright's 1934 classic about life in what is now Sri Lanka, depicted a human and physical geography that had not been captured before in moving images.
 Flaherty, Wright and their peers had their own predecessors: painters and photographers who, before the birth of cinema, traveled to foreign latitudes and recorded what was to that point unknown to outsiders. In terms of storytelling, ''The Odyssey'' seemed to me the basis of it all, the source from which all road films, including Wenders's own ''Paris, Texas,'' seemed to arise. 
 Wenders argued otherwise. For him, the origin lay even further back in history -- in our nomadic roots, in mankind's primal need to leave an account of its passage on earth. If you accept this vision, the cave paintings of Lascaux and Altamira are the true first accounts of life in movement. The first road narratives, of sorts.
 In cinema, the earliest road movies were about the discovery of a new land or about the expansion of frontiers, as with westerns in North America. Films like ''The Searchers,'' John Ford's masterpiece set in the aftermath of the Civil War, were about a national identity in construction. Especially in later decades, road movies also tried to accomplish a different task: to show national identities in transformation. Edgar G. Ulmer's 1945 movie, ''Detour,'' an early film noir about a New York pianist who travels a dark road to Hollywood, was an account of a country plagued by individualism and greed. The film that defined road movies for today's audiences, Dennis Hopper's ''Easy Rider,'' was about the end of innocence and the implosion of the American dream during the Vietnam years.
 Such films suggest that the most interesting road movies are those in which the identity crisis of the protagonist mirrors the identity crisis of the culture itself.
 On Structure and Character
 In terms of their narrative architecture, road movies cannot be circumscribed by the traditional three-act structure of so many mainstream films. Road movies, for instance, are rarely guided by external conflicts; the conflicts that consume their characters are basically internal ones.
 Characters like David Locke in Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Passenger'' or Phillip Winter in Wenders's ''Alice in the Cities'' suffer from a need to redefine themselves. Both are uncomfortable in their shoes. Locke, a journalist, opts to rebaptize himself by trading identities with a dead gunrunner. Winter, also a journalist, searches for a new frame of reference in a foreign country, where he stumbles into playing a father role for a young girl. Both understand that if something is gained along the way, much will also be lost.
 Because road movies need to trace the internal transformation of their characters, the films are not about what can be seen or verbalized but about what can be felt -- about the invisible that complements the visible. In this sense, road movies contrast starkly with today's mainstream films, in which new actions are created every three minutes to grab the attention of the viewer. In road movies, a moment of silence is generally more important than the most dramatic action.
 After directing three road movies myself (''Foreign Land,'' in collaboration with my friend Daniela Thomas, ''Central Station'' and ''The Motorcycle Diaries''), I believe that a defining aspect of this narrative form is its unpredictability. You simply cannot (and should not) anticipate what you will find on the road -- even if you scouted a dozen times the territory you will cross. You have to work in synchronicity with the elements. If it snows, incorporate snow. If it rains, incorporate rain.
 Likewise, a road movie should be transformed by the encounters that occur on the margins of the road. Improvisation becomes necessary and natural. In shooting ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' about Ernesto Guevara's transformation into Che as he witnesses social and political inequities on a journey through South America, my crew and I constantly tried to incorporate what reality was offering us, mixing our actors with the locals we met in the small communities we came across. 
 In doing different road movies, I also came to realize that a good screenplay grants you more freedom to improvise than a weak one. It's like jazz: the better the melody, the easier it is to wander away from it, because it will also be easier to return to it later.
 On the Line Between Fiction and Documentary
 There is no such thing as two road movies that look alike. In terms of film grammar, the road movie is limited only by one obligation: to accompany the transformations undergone by its main characters as they confront a new reality. The road movie is not the domain of large cranes or steady-cams. On the contrary, the camera needs to remain in unison with characters who are in continual motion -- a motion that shouldn't be controlled. The road movie tends, therefore, to be driven by a sense of immediacy that is not dissimilar from that of a documentary film.
 This correlation between two worlds -- fiction and documentary -- raises a theoretical point that brings me back to Robert Flaherty. Although Flaherty's films are usually thought of as documentaries, he sometimes staged key elements of the plots so that the films were in some respects closer to fiction. He's not framing an actual family of fishermen in ''Man of Aran,'' his 1934 movie about premodern life on the Aran Islands; he created a family for the film, a hypothetical family that he thought could better represent the reality of the Aran fishermen. (He was, by the way, severely criticized for this sort of alteration.)
 In search of the epic, Flaherty did violate the boundaries of the what came to be seen as the traditional documentary. If that happened, it's because he was not only recording Nanook the Inuit. He was also filming Nanook the Story.
 More recently, Abbas Kiarostami's 2002 film, ''Ten,'' about a woman driving a car in Tehran, blurred the line between fiction and documentary even more. Over the course of the movie, the woman has 10 conversations with passengers. The driver is an actress -- or maybe not. The boy who is confronting her may be her real son, but it's hard to tell. The prostitute the woman gives a ride to may be a real prostitute -- or not.
 There is no more objective truth, only the truth of observation. There is no longer the outside (the world) and the inside (its imaginary representation) but only the film, which is the synthesis of the world and the imagination of the filmmaker.
 Back to road movies. The more the line between fact and fiction is obscured, the more interesting the result is for me. ''Iracema,'' a Brazilian road movie shot in the '70s by the directors Jorge Bodanzky and Orlando Senna, is a perfect example of this. An actor playing a truck driver is thrown into a hard new reality: the Trans-Amazon Highway that was being built at the time by the Brazil's military regime to ''colonize'' a region originally occupied by forests. A few nonactors play roles in the film; others play themselves. It is virtually impossible to know who is merely representing a reality and who is truly living it. Because of that ambiguity, ''Iracema'' is one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences I have been fortunate enough to have.
 As Godard once said: All great fiction films drift toward documentaries, as all great documentaries drift toward fiction. If you go deeply in the direction of one extreme, you will sooner or later find the other. The road movie may well be the film genre that lends itself most naturally to this blurring of boundaries.
 The Horizon (or, What Comes Next)
 I recently interviewed the American poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, also for the documentary about Kerouac and ''On the Road.'' We were driving on the outskirts of San Francisco. At one point, he looked outside the window and said: ''You know, in the '50s, there was still a country to be mapped. We didn't know what we would find at the end of the road. Today, everything has changed. With TV, there's no more 'away.' ''
 The recent work that may best address this state of affairs is Jia Zhangke's 2004 fiction film, ''The World.'' In a global theme park located outside a large Chinese city, visitors can spend the morning visiting simulacra of the Eiffel Tower, the Egyptian pyramids or Big Ben. In the afternoon, the Leaning Tower of Pisa or the twin towers. The theme-park workers evolve in this strange reality where time and space have collapsed -- and they don't survive it.
 In a world in which there's no more ''away'' and in which distance has disappeared, do road movies still have a reason to exist?
 Sometimes, when I'm in an especially melancholic mood, I think that the answer is no. But every time I turn the TV on and see a reality show, I change my mind. Reality shows offer the audience the illusion that they can live through certain experiences, but only vicariously. What is sold is the impression that all has been lived and that nothing is left to be experienced anew.
 Road movies directly challenge this culture of conformity. They are about experiencing, above all. They are about the journey. They are about what can be learned from the other, from those who are different. In a world that increasingly challenges these ideals, the importance of road movies as a form of resistance can't be dismissed.
 Last but not least: the era of the globalized economy has created a different form of movement, dictated by a new kind of migration: an economic one. In different parts of the world, people now increasingly travel because they need to and not because they want to. A road movie like Michael Winterbottom's ''In This World,'' about Afghan refugees making their way to Britain, captures this urgent social-political reality better than many other film genres. It's more proof that road movies are as necessary as ever to tell us who we are, where we come from and where we're heading.

HEADLINE: Sheryl Tierney, Richard Finch

 BODY:
Sheryl Tierney and Richard C. Finch were married last evening at St. Bartholomew's Church in Manhattan. The Rev. Mark Bozzuti-Jones, an Episcopal priest, officiated. 
 The couple, both 37, met at Boston College, from which they graduated, she magna cum laude and he cum laude. 
 The bride is a senior vice president of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder, an investment advisory firm in Manhattan. She is a chartered financial analyst, concentrating on the health care industry. She is also a volunteer for the New York Junior League, where she is the vice chairwoman of fund-raising for the Winter Ball committee. 
 She is the daughter of Rosemary Tierney and Charles Tierney of Brooklyn. Her father, a retired New York police detective who worked out of the 66th Precinct in Brooklyn, is now a student adviser on the adjunct faculty of Kingsborough Community College there. Her mother retired as an executive assistant for Autranet, a brokerage in Jersey City. 
 The bridegroom is a management consultant specializing in the media and entertainment industries at Accenture in Manhattan. He received a Master of Philosophy in economics from Oxford. His first marriage ended in divorce.
 He is the son of Nancy Finch and Richard Finch of Philadelphia. His father is the director of veterans services at the Impact Services Corporation, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia that tries to find work for unemployed veterans. His mother is an office manager for an endodontist in Philadelphia.
 Ms. Tierney and Mr. Finch met in 1990 as sophomores working on the Boston College school newspaper. The following year, they were in the same study-abroad program at Oxford, sharing an apartment with four other students. Ms. Tierney and Mr. Finch felt a mutual attraction, but each was dating someone else.
 Upon graduation, each considered returning to Oxford for a master's degree. But Ms. Tierney decided to remain in the United States, and Mr. Finch returned to England. After obtaining his master's, Mr. Finch moved to Argentina, working as a language instructor. In 1996 he arrived in New York to work for Accenture. For the next 10 years, their contact was casual: exchanging Christmas cards and seeing each other at parties. 
 The two reconnected in April 2006 when Ms. Tierney decided to have a housewarming at her home on Sutton Place in Manhattan. She learned through mutual friends that Mr. Finch was available and invited him. He accepted, and before leaving that evening he suggested that they have dinner soon.
 Between entree and dessert, they decided to embark on another international adventure together. ''I had always wanted to go to India, but was having a hard time recruiting someone to go with me,'' Ms. Tierney said.
 In the process of planning a two-week trip that was still months away, Ms. Tierney and Mr. Finch met often to research and plan their trip. 
 By July, they were a couple. In October, their journey together began: from Chandni Chowk in Delhi, to the Taj Mahal, the forests of Ranthambore, the outskirts of the Thar Desert and the lakes of Udaipur. After their return, he proposed on Thanksgiving.
 ''I did, of course, have an interest in going to India,'' Mr. Finch said. ''But to be truthful, I probably would have had an interest in any place Sheryl wanted to go.''

HEADLINE: Mourning TV

BYLINE: By DAMON LINDELOF. 
Damon Lindelof is the co-creator and head writer of the television series ''Lost.''

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 TELEVISION is dying.
 I should have realized this four years ago when I first got my TiVo box, but denial is always the first stage of grief. I simply couldn't acknowledge that this wonderful invention heralded the beginning of the end.
 TiVo stores your favorite movies and shows on its hard drive, allowing you to pull up last night's episode of ''The Daily Show'' as easily as you click open documents on your laptop. In fact, once you download the original broadcast -- sorry, I meant to say ''record'' it -- you can watch it at your leisure. The next morning. Next year. Your call. Because now? You own that episode.
 Best of all, you got it free.
 Television has always been free. Sure, if you want all the N.F.L. games in high definition, you have to pay the piper, but the broadcast networks still offer their entire schedules for absolutely nothing. The only catch, of course, is that you have to watch commercials. Economically, it's a fair deal. The network pays for the shows, gives them to viewers, and makes its cash back through advertising. Which regrettably brings us to the most wonderful thing TiVo does: It enables you to ignore the commercials that keep the whole system running. 
 Twenty percent of American homes now contain hard drives that store movies and television shows indefinitely and allows you to fast-forward through commercials. These devices will probably proliferate at a significant rate and soon, almost everyone will have them. They'll also get smaller and smaller, rendering the box that holds them obsolete, and the rectangular screen in your living room won't really be a television anymore, it'll be a computer. And running into the back of that computer, the wire that delivers unto you everything you watch? It won't be cable; it will be the Internet.
 This probably sounds exciting if you're a TV viewer, but if you're in the business of producing these shows, it's nothing short of terrifying. This is how vaudevillians must have felt the first time they saw a silent movie; sitting there, suddenly realizing they just became extinct: after all, who wants another soft-shoe number when you can see Harold Lloyd hanging off a clock 50 feet tall?
 Change always provokes fear, but I'd once believed that the death of our beloved television would unify all those affected, talent and studios, creators and suits. We're all afraid and we'd all be afraid together. Instead we find ourselves so deeply divided.
 The Writers Guild of America (of which I am a proud member) has gone on strike. I have spent the past week on the picket line outside Walt Disney Studios, my employer, chanting slogans and trudging slowly across the crosswalk.
 The motivation for this drastic action -- and a strike is drastic, a fact I grow more aware of every passing day -- is the guild's desire for a portion of revenues derived from the Internet. This is nothing new: for more than 50 years, writers have been entitled to a small cut of the studios' profits from the reuse of our shows or movies; whenever something we created ends up in syndication or is sold on DVD, we receive royalties. But the studios refuse to apply the same rules to the Internet. 
 My show, ''Lost,'' has been streamed hundreds of millions of times since it was made available on ABC's Web site. The downloads require the viewer to first watch an advertisement, from which the network obviously generates some income. The writers of the episodes get nothing. We're also a hit on iTunes (where shows are sold for $1.99 each). Again, we get nothing.
 If this strike lasts longer than three months, an entire season of television will end this December. No dramas. No comedies. No ''Daily Show.'' The strike will also prevent any pilots from being shot in the spring, so even if the strike is settled by then, you won't see any new shows until the following January. As in 2009. Both the guild and the studios we are negotiating with do agree on one thing: this situation would be brutal.
 I will probably be dragged through the streets and burned in effigy if fans have to wait another year for ''Lost'' to come back. And who could blame them? Public sentiment may have swung toward the guild for now, but once the viewing audience has spent a month or so subsisting on ''America's Next Hottest Cop'' and ''Celebrity Eating Contest,'' I have little doubt that the tide will turn against us. Which brings me to the second stage of grief: anger.
 I am angry because I am accused of being greedy by studios that are being greedy. I am angry because my greed is fair and reasonable: if money is made off of my product through the Internet, then I am entitled to a small piece. The studios' greed, on the other hand, is hidden behind cynical, disingenuous claims that they make nothing on the Web -- that the streaming and downloading of our shows is purely ''promotional.'' Seriously?
 Most of all, I'm angry that I'm not working. Not working means not getting paid. My weekly salary is considerably more than the small percentage of Internet gains we are hoping to make in this negotiation and if I'm on the picket line for just three months, I will never recoup those losses, no matter what deal gets made.
 But I am willing to hold firm for considerably longer than three months because this is a fight for the livelihoods of a future generation of writers, whose work will never ''air,'' but instead be streamed, beamed or zapped onto a tiny chip. 
 Things have gotten ugly and the lines of communication have broken down completely between the guild and the studios. Perhaps it's not too late, though, for both sides to rally around the one thing we still have in common: our mourning for the way things used to be. Instead of fighting each other, maybe we should be throwing a wake for our beloved TV.
 Because the third stage of grief is bargaining.
 And bargain we must, because when television finally passes on, there will still be entertainment; there will still be shows and films and videos, right there on a screen in your living room. And just as the owners of vaudeville theaters broke down and bought hand-crank movie cameras, the studios will figure out a way to make absurd amounts of money off of whatever is beaming onto whichever sort of screen.
 And we'll still be writing every word.

HEADLINE: Back to Basics

BYLINE: By LISA KEYS

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, developers created amenities to make their buildings stand out from the pack. Buyers returned the favor, rushing to the newest building with the latest gimmick and snapping up apartments as fast as they became available.
 Many of those people are now living in buildings with pet spas, basketball courts, screening rooms and the occasional climbing wall. 
 But now developers are waving white flags, trading in outre amenities for well-executed must-haves and quality construction. ''Absolutely, it's back to basics,'' said Harry Dubin, director of sales and marketing at the Athena Group, a developer based in Manhattan whose recent projects include the A Condominiums in Jersey City. 
 Buyers, too, are becoming increasingly wary, developers and marketers say. Manhattan condominiums now cost, on average, $1,178 a square foot, according to a recent report by the Miller Samuel appraisal company for Prudential Douglas Elliman, and many buyers are hesitant to spend a lot of money on extras. And with one eye on the resale market, they don't want expenses that drive up monthly common charges. 
 So instead of trying to tempt buyers with a long list of luxurious amenities, developers are trying to provide only those that buyers see as essential. The new standard calls for a gym, a party room and outdoor space like a common roof deck, if possible.
 Kelly Wines, 28, has a dog, a fitness regimen and a busy schedule. And yet, when she went shopping for a condo, she wasn't looking for a pet spa or a fancy gym with treatment rooms. 
 ''I don't need a dog run,'' said Ms. Wines, whose toy poodle is named Chloe. ''When I walk her, I walk her wherever I'm going. And I don't think it's that hard to get my dog to the groomer. There are so many services in New York that cater to pets, I didn't need one in the building.''
 Top priorities for Ms. Wines were outdoor space and a chef's kitchen, because she likes to cook. She found what she was looking for at 100 West 18th Street, a building with 43 apartments developed by the Brauser Group. The one-bedroom apartment she is buying has the private balcony and the high-end kitchen appliances she wanted. 
 The building, still under construction, will also have a common room, a refrigerated room for grocery deliveries and a gym, which Ms. Wines has decided is ''nice to have,'' even though she is already a regular at a Pilates studio.
 Ms. Wines says she is paying ''under $1 million'' for her apartment, and the common charge will be around $1,000 a month. Even so, she believes that she's getting a bargain. 
 ''For condos, its tough to get a decent-priced common charge when you have so few units,'' she said. But because the building's features were just what she wanted, ''I'm not paying for something I'm not going to use,'' she said. 
 Some amenities have a life span all their own. In the 1980s, buildings with swimming pools were all the rage, and they made a comeback in the most recent boom. But there is a downside. ''When you put a pool in, everyone says it's great,'' said Allen Goldman, president of SJP Residential Properties. ''Then, after it's in, they say, 'My God, why are the condo charges so big?' A pool is incredibly expensive to maintain. Then they say, 'No one is ever there.' And you know what? No one ever is.'' 
 SJP is putting the finishing touches on 45 Park Avenue, a 105-unit condo at 37th Street with a concierge, terrace, gym and lounge. It does not have a pool. 
 Even Louise Sunshine, once the grande dame of extravagant amenities, senses a scaling back. Ms. Sunshine, who began her career working for Donald Trump in the 1970s, founded her own marketing company in 1985. It merged with the Corcoran Group two years ago, and she is now director of development for the Alexico Group. 
 ''We started out with a few amenities,'' she said, ''then we kept adding as time went on.''
 Over the last 10 years, Ms. Sunshine said, the trend was ''one-off amenities, things that made people feel better about living in their buildings, made their buildings more exciting.'' As examples, she cited pet-washing salons, elaborate family activity centers and bowling alleys. 
 Then the shift toward simplification began a few years ago, Ms. Sunshine said, when ''name'' architects started to design new condominiums. ''Those stars began to create a world of their own, a value of their own, a lifestyle for these buildings of their own,'' she said. ''You don't need a badminton court when you have great architecture, great design, great views, great quality and the basic requisites.''
 Of course, for Ms. Sunshine, basic is relative. At the Laurel, a condominium being developed by Alexico on the Upper East Side, prices average $1,800 a square foot, with amenities that include a triathlon training center (with two pools), a screening room and a game room.
 ''As a developer, I think it's much more preferable to do a few things and to do them well,'' Ms. Sunshine said. ''There's a point at which amenities don't have much of a return -- they don't make all that much sense.''
 As developers take a second look at the bottom line, they are considering not just amenities but also escalating construction costs and the lack of buildable land in Manhattan. 
 Veronica Hackett, the managing partner in the Clarett Group, says that the math on pricing is evolving. 
 Consider a 1,400-square-foot apartment priced at $1.68 million. ''If I'm going to take 50 square feet out of that apartment and put it into a gym, a pet spa or whatever, that leaves me with 1,350 square feet,'' she said. ''I still need the same $1.68 million for that unit, or I'll never achieve my 25 percent profit margin.
 ''As a developer, I'm going to ask myself: What are the things that are most attractive to my buyer at that price range, in that location?'' 
 The Clarett Group is currently developing the Sky House, a luxury building with 139 apartments at 11 East 29th Street. It features a concierge, a gym and a children's playroom. Marketing for the building focuses on its skyline views. 
 ''When it comes down to it, people are going to look at a total package,'' Ms. Hackett said. ''Do they want a pet spa, or do they want a great kitchen and the right windows? Things come and go, but quality and classic never go out of fashion.''
 David Wine, the vice chairman of the Related Group, said that the ''less is more'' trend could be attributed, at least in part, to construction costs. ''Costs are through the roof,'' he said. ''If a developer is going to plan something, they're really going to think twice in terms of cost. A developer today has to make every square foot as productive, economically, as possible.''
 Then, there is the dwindling availability of large lots throughout Manhattan, leading some developers to focus on smaller projects that can be built and sold in far less time than a behemoth. 
 ''I don't want to be the guy with 250 condo units to sell in this market,'' said Scott Aaron, director of development at the Brauser Group. ''You don't want to be out there selling for two, three years. You like to be able to sell out within the time frame that you're constructing the building.''
 There are, of course, exceptions. At the highest reaches of the market, hotel-style living is still the rule, and residents expect swimming pools, spa services, high-end room service and hefty monthly charges to match. 
 At buildings in up-and-coming areas -- Harlem, say, or Long Island City, Queens -- amenities can stillserve as a lure, and buyers may rely on in-building services if they are in short supply in the surrounding neighborhood. 
 But these are the exceptions, developers say, and the paring down of costs is even extending to the suburbs. 
 Last fall, Marianna Greenberg and her husband, Marlon, looked at new condominiums in Jersey City. ''I wasn't interested in the humongous buildings with the swimming pool, tennis courts, all those things,'' said Ms. Greenberg, 38, who operates Besu Salon and Day Spa in the Gramercy Park area. ''Who would really, in real life, come home and play tennis every day? Even if you live in the building, you end up paying for it. It's in your maintenance.''
 Though they looked at developments like the Shore Club Condominiums and Trump Plaza Jersey City, the couple settled on the A Condominiums, the Athena Group's development, which has 250 apartments, each with outdoor space, as well as a gym, a party room, a common terrace and a parking garage. 
 The Greenbergs' two-bedroom cost $705,000, and the relatively low monthly common charge of $780 sealed the deal. 
 ''The building is beautiful, clean and convenient, and it has all the amenities I'd like to use,'' Ms. Greenberg said. ''That's more than enough for me.''

HEADLINE: Serfs of the Turf

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS. 
Michael Lewis, a contributing writer at The Times magazine, is the author, most recently, of ''The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.''

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
 THE three most lucrative college football teams in 2005 -- Notre Dame, Ohio State and the University of Texas -- each generated more than $60 million for their institutions. That number, which comes from the Department of Education, fails to account for the millions of dollars alumni donated to their alma maters because they were so proud of their football teams. But it still helps to explain why so many strangers to football success have reinvented themselves as football powerhouses (Rutgers?), and also why universities are spending huge sums on new football practice facilities, new football stadium skyboxes and new football coaches. 
 Back in 1958 the University of Alabama lured Bear Bryant with a promise of $18,000 a year, or the rough equivalent of $130,000 today; last year the university handed Nick Saban an eight-year deal worth roughly $32 million. Several dozen college football coaches now earn more than $1 million a year -- and that's before the books, speeches, endorsement deals and who knows what else. Earlier this season the head coach at Texas A&M, Dennis Franchione, was caught topping up his $2.09 million salary by selling to Aggie alums, for $1,200 a pop, his private football-gossip newsletter. 
 The sports media treated that particular scheme as scandalous. Texas A&M made its coach apologize, and promise to stop writing for a living. But really Dennis Franchione's foray into high-priced journalism was just an ingenious extension of the entrepreneurial spirit that's turned college football into a gold mine. The scandal wasn't what he did but how it was made to seem -- unusually greedy. 
 College football's best trick play is its pretense that it has nothing to do with money, that it's simply an extension of the university's mission to educate its students. Were the public to view college football as mainly a business, it might start asking questions. For instance: why are these enterprises that have nothing to do with education and everything to do with profits exempt from paying taxes? Or why don't they pay their employees?
 This is maybe the oddest aspect of the college football business. Everyone associated with it is getting rich except the people whose labor creates the value. At this moment there are thousands of big-time college football players, many of whom are black and poor. They perform for the intense pleasure of millions of rabid college football fans, many of whom are rich and white. The world's most enthusiastic racially integrated marketplace is waiting to happen. 
 But between buyer and seller sits the National Collegiate Athletic Association, to ensure that the universities it polices keep all the money for themselves -- to make sure that the rich white folk do not slip so much as a free chicken sandwich under the table to the poor black kids. The poor black kids put up with it because they find it all but impossible to pursue N.F.L. careers unless they play at least three years in college. Less than one percent actually sign professional football contracts and, of those, an infinitesimal fraction ever make serious money. But their hope is eternal, and their ignorance exploitable. 
 Put that way the arrangement sounds like simple theft; but up close, inside the university, it apparently feels like high principle. That principle, as stated by the N.C.A.A., is that college sports should never be commercialized. But it's too late for that. College football already is commercialized, for everyone except the people who play it. Were they businesses, several dozen of America's best-known universities would be snapped up by private equity tycoons, who would spin off just about everything but the football team. (The fraternities they might keep.) 
 If the N.C.A.A. genuinely wanted to take the money out of college football it'd make the tickets free and broadcast the games on public television and set limits on how much universities could pay head coaches. But the N.C.A.A. confines its anti-market strictures to the players -- and God help the interior lineman who is caught breaking them. Each year some player who grew up with nothing is tempted by a booster's offer of a car, or some cash, and is never heard from again. 
 The lie at the bottom of the fantasy goes something like this: serious college football players go to college for some reason other than to play football. These marvelous athletes who take the field on Saturdays and generate millions for their colleges are students first, and football players second. They are like Franciscan monks set down in the gold mine. Yes, they play football, but they have no interest in the money. What they're really living for is that degree in criminology.
 Of course, no honest person who has glimpsed the inside of a big-time college football program could actually believe this. Even from the outside the college end of things seems suspiciously secondary. If serious college football players are students first, why -- even after a huge N.C.A.A. push to raise their graduation rates -- do they so alarmingly fail to graduate? Why must the N.C.A.A. create incentives for football coaches to encourage their players even to attend classes? Why do we never hear of a great high school football player choosing a college for the quality of its professors? Why, when college football coaches sell their programs to high school studs, do they stress the smoothness of the path they offer to the N.F.L.? 
 It's not that football players are too stupid to learn. It's that they're too busy. Unlike the other student on campus, they have full-time jobs: playing football for nothing. Neglect the task at hand, and they may never get a chance to play football for money. 
 Last year the average N.F.L. team had revenue of about $200 million and ran payrolls of roughly $130 million: 60 percent to 70 percent of a team's revenues, therefore, go directly to the players. There's no reason those numbers would be any lower on a college football team -- and there's some reason to think they'd be higher. It's easy to imagine the Universities of Alabama ($44 million in revenue), Michigan ($50 million), Georgia ($59 million) and many others paying the players even more than they take in directly from their football operations, just to keep school spirit flowing. (Go Dawgs!) 
 But let's keep it conservative. In 2005, the 121 Division 1-A football teams generated $1.8 billion for their colleges. If the colleges paid out 65 percent of their revenues to the players, the annual college football payroll would come to $1.17 billion. A college football team has 85 scholarship players while an N.F.L. roster has only 53, and so the money might be distributed a bit differently. 
 ''You'd pay up for the most critical positions,'' one N.F.L. front office executive told me on the condition that I not use his name. ''You'd pay more for quarterbacks and left tackles and pass rushing defensive ends. You'd pay less for linebackers because you'd have so many of them. You could just rotate them in and out.'' 
 A star quarterback, he thought, might command as much as 8 percent of his college team's revenues. For instance, in 2005 the Texas Longhorns would have paid Vince Young roughly $5 million for the season. In quarterbacking the Longhorns free of charge, Young, in effect, was making a donation to the university of $5 million a year -- and also, by putting his health on the line, taking a huge career risk. 
 Perhaps he would have made this great gift on his own. The point is that Vince Young, as the creator of the economic value, should have had the power to choose what to do with it. Once the market is up and running players who want to go to enjoy the pure amateur experience can continue to play for free. 
 And you never know. The N.C.A.A. might one day be able to run an honest advertisement for the football-playing student-athlete: a young man who valued so highly what the University of Florida had to teach him about hospitality management that he ignored the money being thrown at him by Florida State.

HEADLINE: A Homeland Beckons

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
IN a soundproof glass booth in the back of a travel agency on Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, Alex Polanco was murmuring into his microphone in Spanish. ''We want to know your thoughts, your opinions,'' said Mr. Polanco, a host of Grupo Radial Delgado, a tiny radio station aimed at New York's Ecuadorean immigrants. ''The Plan of Return, is it good? Is it bad? The lines are open.'' 
 After a few minutes of banter with his co-host, Georgeline Paredes, a phone lit up. 
 ''We have a caller!'' Mr. Polanco announced.
 In a gravelly voice, the man identified himself as an Ecuadorean illegal immigrant living in Brooklyn and said: ''I don't think the government should support us returning. They should support us staying here.'' 
 Up and down Roosevelt Avenue, the main artery of New York's South American communities, Ecuadoreans have been debating the same questions as Mr. Polanco's caller for the past three weeks, ever since Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, announced a program to entice emigrants back to the mother country. 
 The program, called Plan Retorno, will be open to Ecuadorean citizens worldwide and will take effect for Ecuadorean-Americans in February. To lure them home, Ecuador will raise or end ceilings on the value of cash and goods they can bring back; offer them attractive loans to build houses and start businesses; and let them ship home their cars without paying the usual high import duties. 
 Mr. Correa, who took office in January with strong support from the expatriate vote, announced the plan in Murcia, a city in Spain with a large Ecuadorean population. In presenting the plan, he described emigration as ''the most palpable proof of the political, economic and social disaster'' of his predecessors.
 For New York's Ecuadoreans, estimated by the Census Bureau as 177,000 people in 2006, Mr. Correa's offer has raised a question that lurks in the heart of many immigrants: Would I go back if I could? Although many long to return, there is also the sense that to do so is impossible.
 Roosevelt Avenue is a testament to the divided lives of New York's Ecuadoreans. The street is home to ''Star Trek''-style videoconferencing centers where clients can have ''virtual family reunions'' with relatives back home. Supermarkets sell frozen guinea pig, an Ecuadorean delicacy. At branches of Ecuadorean chains like Creditos Economicos, shoppers can buy a television and have it shipped home. In various ways, the avenue represents an ingenious attempt to live in two countries at once. 
 As the presence of these stores also suggests, many of the city's Ecuadoreans have children or spouses back home whom they long to rejoin. 
 ''I have a wife and three sons in Ecuador,'' said Cesar Tella, a 23-year-old waiter who on a recent afternoon was sitting in the waiting room of an American branch of Banco del Austro, an Ecuadorean bank. Mr. Tella has not seen his family in five years. ''We talk three times a week,'' he said, ''and every time, they ask me when I'm coming home.''
 If Mr. Tella stays away, it is for an obvious reason: Ecuador's economy has been a shambles since the late 1990s, when the banking system collapsed and inflation skyrocketed. Ecuador's poverty rate last year was more than 38 percent, and unemployment is 8.8 percent, nearly double the rate in the United States. Home prices and utility rates in Ecuador can approach American levels, but the average wage is far lower. 
 ''I was a nurse, and I was making $150 a month,'' said Erika Iniguez, 27, who came from Ecuador in July and is taking an English class near Roosevelt Avenue. ''And the wages don't go up.'' 
 For this reason, many Ecuadorean New Yorkers say Mr. Correa's plan will fail. 
 ''The plan would be beautiful and ambitious if everything were in place, because it would be the marvel of the world to return to paradise,'' said Marta Zambrano, who runs the Ecuadorean International Center, a nonprofit immigrant aid group. ''But coldly, I don't think it will work.'' 
 One day last week, the Ecuadorean Consulate near the United Nations was mobbed with people seeking documents and holding up babies for passport photographs. ''Ask people if they want to go back,'' said Jorge Lopez Amaya, the weary-looking consul general, who works in a large office decorated with figurines of tropical birds. ''They'll say: 'Yes, but no. Yes, we want to go back, but there's no work.''' 
 TO ensure that emigrants have a better country to which to return, said Mr. Amaya, the Ecuadorean government is improving education, health care and sanitation. He added that the money that expatriates send home to their relatives does not improve the country. ''They don't save it, they spend it,'' Mr. Amaya said. ''We want people to come back to Ecuador and start producing wealth, which is different and is much better for the economy.'' 
 A few New York Ecuadoreans, however, do express interest in returning. Mr. Polanco's second caller was a man who said he came from the coastal city of Guayaquil. ''I have four friends here in New York who've gone back, and they're in magnificent shape,'' he said. ''They're using what they've learned here: painting, truck driving, construction. They're rolling in it.'' 
 Outside Mr. Amaya's office, an immigrant named Maria, a 45-year-old garment worker with long black hair and hoop earrings, waited for her daughter to collect some documents. Maria said that she had a younger daughter back in Ecuador, a 15-year-old whom she had not seen in 14 years. Maria had paid $15,000 to smuggle her younger daughter into the country, but immigration authorities had caught the girl, and Maria did not have enough money to try again. 
 ''It hurts us to be here,'' Maria said. ''Every time we talk, she asks for the money to come here. We suffer. But how are we going to go back, if there's no possibility of a better life there? The truth is, we made something that works here.''

HEADLINE: Rock 'n' Revolution

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
COUNTLESS rock bands have sung about rebellion. One of the few that can claim it spurred a revolution is the Plastic People of the Universe, who -- starting with no political agenda -- catalyzed democracy in Czechoslovakia.
 The story of the Plastics (as fans call the band) is central to Tom Stoppard's play ''Rock 'n' Roll,'' although it is told from the sidelines by fictional characters. It's a story not of activism but of whimsy treated as sedition, stubbornness met by brutality and a regime unknowingly consolidating its opposition. Repression amplified the band's impact, though at serious personal cost to the musicians. 
 Throughout ''Rock 'n' Roll'' music is never mere entertainment. It's not propaganda, either; there are no political or protest songs. (The Plastics have recorded only one directly political song during their career.) Instead music is variously a refuge, a cry from the heart, a flag of defiance and a token of freedom. ''The play perhaps could be called 'It's Not Only Rock 'n' Roll,''' Mr. Stoppard said. ''Because it's not.'' 
 The Plastic People of the Universe got started in Czechoslovakia in 1968, the year Soviet tanks rolled into Prague and shut down the liberalization known as Prague Spring. The band was a gaggle of arty hippies who considered themselves outside politics. But in the mid-1970s the Plastics' run-ins with an increasingly stifling Communist government spurred the Czech human-rights movement named after its petition and manifesto, Charter 77, which was a direct response to the trial and imprisonment of musicians. From a decade of resistance by Charter 77 came the bloodless Velvet Revolution that ended Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. 
 The Plastics' dark, low-fi music is far better known to human-rights groups than to rock fans. It has appealed to downtown New York musicians with its angularity and intransigence, and the critic Ritchie Unterberger gave the band a chapter in his 1998 book, ''Unknown Legends of Rock 'n' Roll: Psychedelic Unknowns, Mad Geniuses, Punk Pioneers, Lo-Fi Mavericks & More.'' A Czech label, Globus, has reissued the complete Plastic People catalog on CD, and most of the albums are available at tamizdat.org. 
 ''They're the kind of band that people who follow the history of underground music know about them or reference them, but almost nobody has actually heard them,'' said Jimmy Johnson, chief executive of the mail-order company Forced Exposure, which carries many little-known bands and used to stock the Plastics. ''We could sell hundreds of copies of their first album, if we could get it.'' 
 Mr. Stoppard, 70, is Czech, but his family emigrated in 1939 and did not return. In an interview at the Bernard J. Jacobs Theater, where the play opened last Sunday, he said he had been aware of the Plastics as a human-rights case since the '70s but discovered their music only when he began writing ''Rock 'n' Roll.'' He also discovered articulate, contentious writings by the Plastics' manager and strategist, Ivan Jirous, and by the playwright Vaclav Havel, a founder of Charter 77, who became president of Czechoslovakia in 1989. (The Plastics' album ''Leading Horses'' was recorded in 1981 at Mr. Havel's farm, after the farmhouse where the music was first performed was burned down by the Czech secret police.) 
 Characters in ''Rock 'n' Roll'' recount actual events and take up longtime arguments -- sometimes in the words of people who made them at the time -- as they grapple with questions about ideology and pragmatism, politics and counterculture, materialism and spirit, language and lies, art and economics. As the play moves toward the present, one character proclaims, '''Make love not war' was more important than 'Workers of the world, unite!''' And while the play shows the countercultural triumph of music, Mr. Stoppard said political change isn't that simple. ''Make love, not war: That's another utopian idea,'' he said. ''And you can imagine it working very well in a utopia, whether it's a desert island or a plot of land in the wilds of the Appalachians where 300 people are making love, not war. It might work that way. But it doesn't seem to be a serious operating factor in the way the world goes.''
 Like Mr. Stoppard's other plays ''Rock 'n' Roll'' is full of pairings and balances: parallel characters, contrasted events, dialectics. It takes place in capitalist England and in Communist Czechoslovakia, and it revolves around Max, a die-hard Marxist professor enjoying academic freedom at Cambridge University, and Jan, a Czech student he briefly mentors. Jan's strongest passion is for the psychedelic LPs he brings back to Prague; his fervor for the Plastics derails his life. 
 Another thread in ''Rock 'n' Roll'' involves Syd Barrett, who led Pink Floyd until the damage from drugs and mental illness left him a recluse in Cambridge; the play makes him one of Max's neighbors. Rock songs blare between scenes while their discographical information is projected on a video screen, and the play's finale takes place at the first concert by the Rolling Stones in Prague. 
 The Plastics themselves begin and end the current Czech production of ''Rock 'n' Roll'' at the National Theater in Prague, performing live.
 Ivan Bierhanzl, who has worked with the Plastics intermittently since 1979 and is now the band's manager and plays upright bass, said the Plastics were the first rock band to perform at the National Theater, which is more likely to present opera or Shakespeare. Once, the government would not permit the Plastics to perform in public at all, much less at the capital's highbrow showplace. 
 The Plastics started as fans, and mimickers, of iconoclastic American bands including the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention and the Fugs. Like other late-1960s rockers worldwide, they turned shows into happenings, collaborating with visual artists; the Plastics performed in wild makeup, wearing robes made of bedsheets. ''We were just a band of freaks, playing rock and roll,'' Mr. Bierhanzl said by telephone from Prague before one of the Plastics' National Theater performances. ''It was the problem of the Communist government and the party that they didn't like us. They didn't like our aesthetics because it was something from the West -- longhairs, capitalism.''
 Around the same time that the Plastics were confounding their authoritarian government, another psychedelic movement -- tropicalism in Brazil -- was doing something similar, with sunny, gleefully scrambled postmodern pop that made Brazil's dictatorship suspicious. Two ringleaders of tropicalism, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, were first jailed and then ordered into exile -- going to England, where they ending up learning additional ways to internationalize their music. (Mr. Gil is now Brazil's minister of culture.) But for years Communist Czechoslovakia kept most of its rock underground inside the country. 
 The government revoked the Plastics' credentials as professional musicians in 1970, taking away access to both equipment and official gigs. As they would for nearly two decades, the Plastics persisted, under conditions that make punk-rock look like a luxury cruise. ''We were workers,'' Mr. Bierhanzl said. ''For us it was important just to play and listen to our music, and absolutely not to be some heroes.'' 
 Led by the composer Milan Hlavsa, who died in 2001, the Plastics turned from imitating American songs to writing their own. They built homemade amplifiers from scrounged transistor-radio parts, and they rehearsed, quietly, in living rooms, perfecting the material they might find a chance to perform at semiprivate concerts once or twice a year. Paraphrasing some ideas from Mr. Jirous, Mr. Stoppard said that the Plastic People ''had an advantage in a certain sense over bands in the West, because they never had to face the temptation.''
 ''There was never the possibility of a desire for recognition being gratified,'' he said. ''So it was never on the table as something which might, as it were, change the way you play and the songs you choose.''
 The Plastics' songs never sounded like party music. Along with the drone of the Velvet Underground, they picked up the dissonances of Eastern European music, added the counterpoint of instruments like bass clarinet and viola, and tossed in flurries of free-jazz saxophone. The vocals cackled and growled in Czech, singing gallows-humored modern poetry. The authorities called the music morbid and weren't necessarily wrong. The Plastics defied ever-optimistic official pronouncements simply through their bilious, discontented tone. 
 The Plastics' most celebrated album, ''Egon Bondy's Happy Hearts Club Banned,'' had lyrics by the poet and provocateur Egon Bondy, like those in ''No One'': ''No one/Nowhere/Never/Ever/Got anywhere/Who me?/Such a fool/I am not.'' The songs were recorded in 1974; tapes were smuggled out of Czechoslovakia and released as an LP four years later in France, and copies slipped into Czechoslovakia. Nowadays, as music easily whizzes around the world via the Internet, ''Rock 'n' Roll'' -- with scenes of Jan and his fragile, irreplaceable collection of Western LPs -- recalls how precious vinyl once was. 
 Plastics concerts were rare, clandestine events organized with sly humor. After the band's credentials were revoked, it managed to perform at first under the auspices of its manager, Mr. Jirous, an art historian. He would rent a hall for a lecture-demonstration on Andy Warhol and Pop Art; then, after a brief presentation, the Plastics would ''demonstrate'' a full-length concert set of Velvet Underground songs. Under Czech law couples getting married could book their own wedding entertainment, so some Plastics friends and fans took their vows and held concerts of the ''second culture'': one separate from both officially sanctioned art and the explicit opposition. 
 The Plastics didn't set out to challenge the regime, but to ignore it. ''Everybody else just collaborated a little bit with the regime because of work, of money, of studying and jobs and so on,'' Mr. Bierhanzl said. ''So everybody was a little bit in touch with the government but our crazy band. We were different.'' 
 They were not ignored in return; crackdowns grew increasingly severe. The government's attitude, Mr. Stoppard said, was, ''If you're not with us, you're against us.'' 
 In 1974 the Plastics arranged one of their underground concerts in the village of Ceske Budejovice, but the government found out about it. Before it began, fans were shunted into a tunnel and ambushed by club-wielding policemen. All were photographed for police files, and some students were expelled, ending their academic careers. 
 At first the government took the Plastics more seriously than the opposition did. As ''Rock 'n' Roll'' recounts, there was little respect, on either side, between the politicos and the freaks. ''The rock 'n' roll band didn't think much of the intellectual dissenters, and the intellectuals didn't think much of these dropouts,'' Mr. Stoppard said. ''The idea was that dropping out was not in fact an adequate response: opting out, 'Leave me alone.' Everybody had a perfect right to do it, but it wasn't opposition.''
 The government took care of that. In 1976, after the Plastics and friends staged another festival of the second culture, 27 people were arrested.
 Vratislav Brabenec, the Plastics' saxophonist and sometime lyricist, and Mr. Jirous were convicted of ''organized disturbance of the peace'' and imprisoned. ''They made a big mistake with this trial,'' Mr. Bierhanzl said. ''Without it, maybe nobody would be interested about this band, but the trial was big P.R. for us.'' At the trial dissidents and dropouts found common ground and forged their alliance. 
 But it would be more than a decade before they prevailed. In the meantime conditions grew worse. Band members were repeatedly interrogated by the police and sometimes beaten. The Plastics stopped giving concerts after 1981, making music only in private. Mr. Brabenec emigrated to Toronto in 1982. Mr. Jirous spent years in jail. Mr. Hlavsa held the band together until 1988, and then split off his own band with some former Plastic People under a new name: Pulnoc (Midnight), which was allowed to perform in Czechoslovakia and the West. On the eve of the Velvet Revolution the Plastic People were gone. It was hard to tell if the government had finally worn them down or if -- despite their conscious intentions -- they had somehow served their historical purpose. 
 Topical protest music can rapidly turn into an artifact; the people involved are gone, the causes won or lost, the slogan grown irrelevant. By the 1990s reggae and hip-hop had outflanked rock as global protest music, although rockers like Bruce Springsteen still lead arena-size protest singalongs. Like much music written under authoritarian regimes, the Plastic People's songs may well hold double-entendres and sidelong references that attentive local listeners could glean at the time. But their music is more a mood than a manifesto; its bitter, sardonic disquiet lingers. 
 Mr. Bierhanzl said the Plastics now were ''living in contemporary time.'' The band reunited in 1997 for the 20th anniversary of Charter 77 and has stayed together, with some new members, since the death of Mr. Hlavsa. It is making an album of new material for its own 40th anniversary and releasing an archival DVD. 
 But it is still exorcising memories by performing at the National Theater. Back in 1977, as the Charter 77 movement was gaining international attention, the Communist government summoned artists to that theater and pressured them to sign a denunciation of the human rights movement. Many were sympathetic to Charter 77's goals and close to its members, but they had families to support and jobs to protect; they signed. ''For us,'' Mr. Bierhanzl said, ''it's some kind of satisfaction that now we can play in the same hall.'' He chuckled. ''But it's history.''

HEADLINE: What Market Slump?

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH there are many questions about the direction of the Manhattan real estate market, the evidence to date shows that the market remained strong last month, continuing right through the last closings.
 The number of sales in October was well above the number recorded during the corresponding month a year earlier although a bit behind the huge volume of sales recorded over the summer, according to a tabulation of co-op and condominium transactions that were filed with the city through the first seven days of November. The number of sales of trophy properties costing more than $4 million increased sevenfold from October 2006.
 Prices also remained high, close to the record prices recorded over the summer, and well above the level in October 2006, when the market was in deep doldrums, and there were worries that the market had begun to turn. 
 Median prices were 16 percent higher last month than a year earlier, and average prices were 45 percent higher than during that slow October a year earlier. 
 Inventories of unsold co-ops and condos were up from the summer but remained low in October, 22 percent below the inventory reported a year earlier, according to figures provided by Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and an executive vice president and the director of research at Radar Logic.
 So far, city records show that 53 properties closed for more than $4 million in October, including a five-story 7,000-square-foot landmark town house bought by Martin Scorsese on East 64th Street on Oct. 10 for $12.5 million. Last October, there were seven closings.
 Then there was the full-floor three-bedroom apartment, with two terraces, bought for $8.2 million on Oct. 19 by Douglas R. Lebda, the founder of LendingTree, the mortgage broker and referral company, in the Legacy, a six-apartment condominium carved out of a former garage at 157 East 84th Street.
 Mr. Lebda is now the president of IAC/InterActiveCorp, the Internet conglomerate put together by Barry Diller, which acquired Lending Tree in 2003. Property records do not list any mortgages on his new apartment.
 Consider, too, the $33.4 million sale at 834 Fifth Avenue on Oct. 30 by Loida N. Lewis, the widow of Reginald F. Lewis, the founder of the Beatrice Foods chain. It was sold to Dr. Mark Rachesky, the founder of a fund that invests in distressed properties, and the former chief investment adviser to the financier Carl C. Icahn.
 To pessimists, the high prices this summer and fall may be remembered as the peak of the New York real estate market, as the impact of the national housing malaise, job cuts and falling bonuses on Wall Street work their way through the Manhattan market.
 Marcia Van Wagner, an economist and deputy city comptroller, said that while economists can forecast trends, they have trouble predicting just when a ''turning point'' will appear. Nevertheless, she said that her agency was updating its economic forecasts as concerns mount, and that she was expecting a slowdown in the real estate market, perhaps later this year or next year.
 But there is another view: As long as Manhattan remains one of the world's great cultural and financial playgrounds, the real estate market can continue to rise. While much of the country has been worrying about foreclosures on subprime mortgages, researchers the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University found last month that only a tiny fraction of Manhattan apartments, eight-tenths of 1 percent, were bought with subprime loans last year. 
 Last month, two researchers at the consulting firm Business360, John Marchant and Roger Sharp, analyzed long-term trends in Manhattan real estate prices and despite the national credit crisis that emerged over the summer, they predicted that Manhattan prices would continue to rise 5 percent a year for the next three years.
 The pair cited figures showing an expanding base of wealth in New York City: the wealthiest 20 percent of Manhattan residents -- the ones who can afford to buy high-end apartments at current prices -- have a median income of $350,000, or 50 times the income of the bottom 20 percent. And they concluded that home prices are still catching up from the steep declines in the 1990s. 
 Last Wednesday, the developers of the new 58-story W New York-Downtown Hotel and Residences on Washington Street found that Manhattan market was alive and well. Michael Shvo, whose firm Shvo Marketing is selling the properties, invited 3,000 people who had expressed interest to show up on the opening day of the sales office for the sale of 159 one- and two-bedroom condos. (Another 64 furnished hotel-style condos will go on sale later).
 At 7 a.m., when the office opened, there was a line on the street, Mr. Shvo said. By the time the office closed at 11 p.m., two hours later than planned, he said, contracts for 72 apartments had been signed. Prices began at $2,000 a square foot, he said, or more than $1 million for a one-bedroom.

HEADLINE: Frayed Judicial Robes

 BODY:
Imagine a courtroom scene, maybe something out of ''Law & Order.'' Then ask yourself which official earns the least of all those important people sitting in front of the jury. If you guessed the judge, chances are you're right. 
 Certainly the defense lawyer, if a private attorney, makes far more in hourly fees than the person with the gavel. Some district attorneys, in New York City at least, earn more than not only the trial judge but also the chief judge. There are even nonjudicial employees in the state judiciary system who can earn as much or more than the person who is up there making the most important decisions in the entire courthouse.
 Thanks to lawmakers in Albany, New York judges have not had a pay raise for almost nine years. New York's part-time legislators have made it their business to piggyback on the state's full-time judges when it comes to salaries, refusing to approve a pay raise for the judiciary unless they get one themselves. 
 The judges are so angry that some are suing the state -- there are two lawsuits already -- for better pay. Others are demanding that Chief Judge Judith Kaye unilaterally award the judges a pay raise out of her state budget. The hitch there is that the state comptroller could refuse to cut the checks, which could mean yet another lawsuit.
 As things stand now, there are still plenty of excellent judges in New York, but their caseloads are skyrocketing at the same time their salaries are losing ground to inflation. At some point, as good judges exchange their robes for the monetary rewards of private practice, few but the rich or less qualified will want to replace them. 
 Albany will have another chance to address this judicial emergency next month, perhaps its last chance for a while, since nobody will even want to talk about pay increases during an election year. Lawmakers have said they want to return briefly in December to deal with a few remaining issues like a new horse racing agreement and a huge capital spending plan. But the most urgent item on their list should be this pay raise for judges.
 Since June, there has appeared to be the makings of an agreement on campaign finance reform and pay increases for judges and lawmakers. The agreement between legislative leaders and Gov. Eliot Spitzer would create a salary commission to award routine cost-of-living increases to judges and other public officials, including legislators. This is an important package. But the judges should not be held hostage to its success. If tempers flare again, and the deal is not consummated, Mr. Spitzer and the leaders of the Senate and the Assembly, Joseph Bruno and Sheldon Silver, should proceed with a salary increase for the judiciary anyway.
 The legislators will balk at paying judges and only judges; they have hidden their own pay increases behind judicial robes for a long time, and old habits are hard to break. But it is clear that by refusing to give extra pay to the judiciary, New York's lawmakers have created a crisis in the state courts. It is their job to solve it.

HEADLINE: Far Out: Studios Imagine Smart Cars for a World Transformed by Robots

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
FIFTY years ago, tail fins were at their most extreme: cars seemed to want to be rockets. But 50 years from now, cars will want to be robots, at least according to the design challenge at the Los Angeles auto show this year. 
 ''Robocar 2057'' is the theme of the fourth edition of an event created by Chuck Pelly, the noted designer and teacher, who said the theme was inspired by the recent film ''Transformers.'' 
 So this year, automotive design studios in the Los Angeles area competed to produce designs showing how artificial intelligence might improve the automobile and integrate it more closely with human lives. 
 As usual in this competition, practical constraints like marketability, fuel economy, safety and even high school physics are put aside in the interest of exercising designers' imaginations. These cars exist only on paper and in digital form.
 The robots in the eight concepts are closer to Transformers than to traditional humanoid bots like Robbie the Robot of the 1950s or Honda's more recent robot called Asimo, for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility.
 The robotic side of the imagined cars is made of futuristic technologies. The most common term used in the projects is nano, as in nanotech, nanotubes or nanofabrication. These cars are more Silicon Valley than San Fernando Valley. 
 In the future, space might be at a premium, which is why the imagined Volkswagen of 2057 called the SlipStream is a gleaming personal pod that resembles an upright vacuum cleaner; it flips down and sprouts fins for high-speed cruising. 
 The Mazda of the future, the MotoNari RX, named for the warrior who founded Hiroshima, the company's home city, looks like a model of a Frank Gehry building that someone has sat on. It is controlled with a skintight suit of sensors. 
 Future Audis? They will look like whatever you want them to be: Auto Union racers of the 1930s, sleek spaceships, whatever is in the library of holographic images stored in a key fob. ''Your holographic avatar'' is the slogan for the Audi Virtuea Quattro.
 The Mercedes-Benz of 2057 will look like classically shaped vehicles of the 1930s, but the SilverFlow is to be made of electronically arranged molecules that can be ''dissembled into a pool of ferromagnetic material for easy storage.'' 
 Toyota's Biomobile Mecha would run on pollution extracted from the air and has nanolaser wheels; biomimicry allows it to expand and contract to fit available space. 
 Honda and Nissan offer the most practical entries. The Honda 1 4 (meaning one to the power of four) allows for easy car-pooling by combining not just riders but sections of a car into a single unit suitable for the H.O.V. (high occupancy vehicle) lane, a matter much on the mind of Southern California commuters.
 Nissan's OneOne is a pet robot able to take the children to school and play with them as well. 
 G.M.'s offering is the OnStar Ant, a kind of minitable that comes in bunches and arranges itself in useful ways thanks to flocking and herding software. Its theme is ubiquitous mobility, a take on ubiquitous computing, a Silicon Valley buzzword. 
 Some of these cars are imagined as solar hybrids; some would be powered by hydrogen. But most of the technical descriptions sound as if they are from the science fiction author William Gibson. 
 Mazda's entry, for example, designed by Matthew Cunningham, is explained this way: ''The MotoNari RX is comprised of a 100 percent reprototypable, carbon nano-tube/shape memory alloy weave with a photovoltaic coating. This enables programmable tensiometry and fluid movement while insuring efficient energy transfer to the in-wheel electrostatic nanomotors.'' 
 Sure, but don't forget to check the oil.
 The judges of the competition include Tom Matano, formerly of Mazda and now at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco; Imre Molnar of the College for Creative Studies in Detroit; Stewart Reed from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.; and Chris Myers, an expert on robotics.
 The winner will be announced on Thursday during press previews for the auto show. The show opens to the public on Friday and runs through Nov. 25 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

HEADLINE: Two Short Fables That Revel In Freedom

BYLINE: By TERRENCE RAFFERTY

 BODY:
ALBERT LAMORISSE'S ''White Mane'' (1953) and ''The Red Balloon'' (1956) are among the world's most famous and most honored films for children. Both were prizewinners at Cannes, and ''The Red Balloon,'' which is 34 minutes long and contains about half a dozen lines of dialogue, improbably received an Oscar for its screenplay. But kids' stuff they are not.
 The stories are simple, fablelike; the heroes are boys; the subject in each case is the purity and power of a child's imagination; and the tone of both films is that of open-mouthed wonder. Yet these movies are also shot through with a very adult melancholy, an awareness that life tends not to measure up to the glorious pictures in our minds. The young are enchanted by ''White Mane'' and ''The Red Balloon.'' Grown-ups, who know too well how fragile this beauty is, are likely to cry. 
 There has recently been a long overdue surge of interest in Mr. Lamorisse's two great films, some of it sparked by the estimable Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao Hsien, whose feature-length homage, ''Flight of the Red Balloon,'' was screened at the New York Film Festival this fall. And starting Friday ''White Mane'' and ''The Red Balloon'' will be shown on a double-bill at the Film Forum in Manhattan, in superbly restored prints. ''White Mane'' also has a new English-language narration by Peter Strauss, which is a more scrupulous translation of the original French than previous versions. (The earliest, written by James Agee, is gorgeous, but -- not surprisingly -- a good deal more verbose than Mr. Lamorisse's spare text.) 
 The most striking benefit of the restorations, though, is the delicate color of ''The Red Balloon,'' which heightens the contrast between the muted loveliness of Paris streets (it always looks like first light, somehow) and the bold, stunningly incongruous red of the title object. In a less vibrant print ''The Red Balloon'' would still be touching and ingenious, but it wouldn't be half as funny.
 If you haven't seen the film since attaining the age of reason, you might have forgotten how dryly brilliant its (mostly) silent comedy is: Mr. Lamorisse times the balloon's entrances and exits from the frame with the precision of a crack farceur. 
 At the beginning of the movie a schoolboy (played by Pascal Lamorisse, the filmmaker's son) happens on a large, fortuitously untethered balloon, and, knowing a good thing when he sees one, grabs the string and claims it as his own, as if it were a stray mutt. (Or -- to cite a movie that, 25 years later, took possession of the spirit of ''The Red Balloon''-- as if it were E. T.) Pascal then discovers, to his delight, that his new toy/pet is eminently trainable. He teaches it to follow him, off string, and to wait faithfully for him when he's at school, on a bus or in one of the many other places where big balloons are not welcome. 
 The movie is essentially a series of elegant slapstick routines, in which the balloon -- which has its mischievous side -- darts or bobs or soars, as the situation requires, and gets laughs from the constant surprise of its appearances and disappearances. The sheer absurdity of giving a balloon the personality of a friendly, frisky dog is, of course, central to every one of Mr. Lamorisse's gags, and it's a conceit that could easily have become mighty tiresome. But he knows enough to keep the action brisk and the movie short, and he doesn't press his luck by treating us, as a lesser artist might, to close-ups of his small hero's happy face. Everything in ''The Red Balloon'' happens, as it should in physical comedy, in long and medium shots: no special pleading, no unseemly appeals for the viewer's approval. 
 When the film is over, you realize that although you've been entirely enveloped in little Pascal's fantasy world, you've learned next to nothing about the boy himself. His parents are not in evidence. He lives with a stout, black-clad, rather fearsome-looking old woman who may or may not be his grandmother. We're given no idea whether he's a good, bad or indifferent student, or who his friends are. The intensity of his attachment to the balloon suggests that he's a lonely, dreamy child, living in his own head, but we can't be sure; the movie gives us nothing solid to go on. 
 With such a skimpy back story the film runs the risk of abstraction, but Mr. Lamorisse's reticence has the odd, bracing effect of making everything he chooses not to show us seem deeply irrelevant. All that matters here are the balloon, the boy (whoever he is) and the steep, narrow streets of Menilmontant, where they play together.
 Just how unnecessary the particulars of the boy's ''real'' (i.e. nonballoon) life really are is emphasized, inadvertently, by Mr. Hou's ''Flight of the Red Balloon,'' which will be released theatrically in the spring. That movie's boy, named Simon (Simon Iteanu), has real life to burn, a messy one with a frazzled single mother (played by Juliette Binoche) in a cramped apartment. And when a red balloon enters this boy's life, courtesy of the young Asian film student (Song Fang) who has been hired as his nanny, the contrast between his imaginative world and the world he actually inhabits feels, with all this extra detail, too pointed; Mr. Hou manages to keep poignancy at bay, but it's touch and go.
 We don't know much, either, about the boy named Folco (Alain Emery) whose story is told in ''White Mane.'' He comes from a family of fishermen in the marshy southwestern region of France called the Camargue, where wild horses roam in packs. His household consists of a bushy-bearded, unidentified elderly gent and a little brother (Pascal Lamorisse, a toddler then). The lone important fact about Folco, as far as Mr. Lamorisse is concerned, is his relationship with White Mane, the alpha stallion of the herd, who, the narrator tells us, doesn't like men but who comes to trust this boy. In a way this 39-minute, black-and-white movie is a draft of ''The Red Balloon'': the unrulier, more disturbing story of which the later film is a charming, whimsical variation
 ''White Mane'' is no less carefully composed than its better-known successor: both pictures have the economy, the clarity of purpose and the pleasing symmetry of a sonnet. For Albert Lamorisse, who began and ended his career as a documentary filmmaker, the difference lies in the landscape. A metaphorical balloon would make no more sense (even comic sense) in the Camargue than an untamed stallion would in the streets of Paris; and although both, in their respective films, represent the freedom of the imagination and both, consequently, have enemies, the threat feels much graver in ''White Mane.'' The envious boys with slingshots who chase down Pascal's balloon are almost parodies of the fierce-looking riders of the Camargue pursuing White Mane for the worst and commonest reason -- for the awful joy of breaking a creature freer than they are.
 As Folco rides the horse, bareback, across the marshes, over the dunes and through the strange, sparse, gnarled vegetation of his native region, you sense, as in few other films, the real terrors of nature, its arbitrariness and flat indifference reflected in the very changeability of its beauty. (Compared with this, both the attractions and the dangers of the city seem like child's play.)
 It takes an extraordinary filmmaker to evoke that sort of feeling and then to cap his thrilling climactic chase with an image as ecstatic as it is disquieting, the distant sight of a boy and a horse heading out to sea. ''The Red Balloon'' ends with a similar flourish of ambiguous release, but it is, appropriately (and literally), a lighter one. 
 And Lamorisse, these movies show, really was a remarkable artist: one of the cinema's best poets and a fearless explorer of the scary and exhilarating outbacks of the imagination. He lived for 14 years after ''The Red Balloon,'' mostly making documentaries. While he was shooting what would be his last picture, ''The Lovers' Wind,'' in Tehran in 1970, his helicopter crashed; he was 48. Even he might not have been capable of imagining a more fitting end: He rose to get a clearer, freer view of the world, and fell from the sky.

Battle of the Numbers
 On Health Insurance
 To the Editor:
 In ''Beyond Those Health Care Numbers'' (Economic View, Nov. 4), N. Gregory Mankiw suggests that many people without health insurance shouldn't count toward the total, noting that 18 million of the 47 million uninsured Americans enjoy family income of more than $50,000. But families making $50,000, or even $70,000, would be hard pressed to afford health insurance that can run many thousands of dollars a year. 
 The column also notes that the share of national income devoted to health care has tripled since 1950, from 5 percent to 16 percent, but takes the position that this trend reflects improved technology and higher incomes. Income growth might account for higher health care spending in absolute terms, but it doesn't explain why Americans must spend so much more of their incomes on health care than people in other industrialized countries. 
 Karl von Schriltz 
 Washington, Nov. 5
 To the Editor:
 The column ascribes the lower life expectancies and higher child mortality rates of Americans as compared to Canadians not to our deficient health care system, but to what it calls ''broader social forces'' like obesity and homicidal violence. It seems to miss that these ''social forces'' reflect health care crises that our system has failed to address.
 Likewise, in celebrating the rising share of the national income spent on health care as a ''modern form of social progress,'' the column does not note how much of that money is spent on the inefficiencies of our system, like paying more and more people to process ever-growing mountains of paperwork that the system generates. 
 These inefficiencies do nothing to improve the delivery of health care. 
 Steven Conn
 Yellow Springs, Ohio, Nov. 4
 The writer is a professor of history at Ohio State University.
 To the Editor:
 The column correctly asserts that broad social forces have a large effect on health in a nation. But it considered only social factors like violence, accidents and obesity that tend to explain away the United States' poor health outcomes, while not considering factors like a low rate of smoking, that would tend to make the performance of America's health care system look even worse. 
 Ken Krasity
 Beverly Hills, Mich., Nov. 5
 To the Editor:
 Mr. Mankiw wrote that some people who lack insurance can afford it and that while medical costs are rising, ''Fortunately, our incomes are growing.''
 But there are people who have health insurance and can't afford it. For most retirees, incomes are not growing. The increased costs will come out of other important expenditures; not a third car or another television set.
 Robert Hammer
 Pittsboro, N.C., Nov. 4
 To the Editor:
 The column exemplifies one of the reasons we have consistently failed with health care reform. The two sides of the debate -- Republicans versus Democrats or single-payer advocates versus those who favor the marketplace -- spend all of their time fighting each other and refuting each other's statistics, rather than trying to find common ground.
 We can argue and argue over who is right, when we should be sitting down together to solve a problem.

 BODY:
THE SECOND CIVIL WAR 
 How Extreme Partisanship Has Paralyzed Washington and Polarized America. 
 By Ronald Brownstein. 
 484 pp. The Penguin Press. $27.95. 
 Few people would dispute that the politics of Washington are as polarized today as they have been in decades. The question Ronald Brownstein poses in this provocative book is whether what he calls ''extreme partisanship'' is simply a result of the tactics of recent party leaders, or whether it is an enduring product of a systemic change in the structure and behavior of the political world. Brownstein, formerly the chief political correspondent for The Los Angeles Times and now the political director of the Atlantic Media Company, gives considerable credence to both explanations. But the most important part of ''The Second Civil War'' -- and the most debatable -- is his claim that the current political climate is the logical, perhaps even inevitable, result of a structural change that stretched over a generation. 
 A half-century ago, Brownstein says, the two parties looked very different from how they appear today. The Democratic Party was a motley combination of the conservative white South; workers in the industrial North as well as African-Americans and other minorities; and cosmopolitan liberals in the major cities of the East and West Coasts. Republicans dominated the suburbs, the business world, the farm belt and traditional elites. But the constituencies of both parties were sufficiently diverse, both demographically and ideologically, to mute the differences between them. There were enough liberals in the Republican Party, and enough conservatives among the Democrats, to require continual negotiation and compromise and to permit either party to help shape policy and to be competitive in most elections. Brownstein calls this ''the Age of Bargaining,'' and while he concedes that this era helped prevent bold decisions (like confronting racial discrimination), he clearly prefers it to the fractious world that followed.
 The turbulent politics of the 1960s and '70s introduced newly ideological perspectives to the two major parties and inaugurated what Brownstein calls ''the great sorting out'' -- a movement of politicians and voters into two ideological camps, one dominated by an intensified conservatism and the other by an aggressive liberalism. By the end of the 1970s, he argues, the Republican Party was no longer a broad coalition but a party dominated by its most conservative voices; the Democratic Party had become a more consistently liberal force, and had similarly banished many of its dissenting voices. Some scholars and critics of American politics in the 1950s had called for exactly such a change, insisting that clear ideological differences would give voters a real choice and thus a greater role in the democratic process. But to Brownstein, the ''sorting out'' was a catastrophe that led directly to the meanspirited, take-no-prisoners partisanship of today.
 There is considerable truth in this story. But the transformation of American politics that he describes was the product of more extensive forces than he allows and has been, at least so far, less profound than he claims. Brownstein correctly cites the Democrats' embrace of the civil rights movement as a catalyst for partisan change -- moving the white South solidly into the Republican Party and shifting it farther to the right, while pushing the Democrats farther to the left. But he offers few other explanations for ''the great sorting out'' beyond the preferences and behavior of party leaders. A more persuasive explanation would have to include other large social changes: the enormous shift of population into the Sun Belt over the last several decades; the new immigration and the dramatic increase it created in ethnic minorities within the electorate; the escalation of economic inequality, beginning in the 1970s, which raised the expectations of the wealthy and the anxiety of lower-middle-class and working-class people (an anxiety conservatives used to gain support for lowering taxes and attacking government); the end of the cold war and the emergence of a much less stable international system; and perhaps most of all, the movement of much of the political center out of the party system altogether and into the largest single category of voters -- independents. Voters may not have changed their ideology very much. Most evidence suggests that a majority of Americans remain relatively moderate and pragmatic. But many have lost interest, and confidence, in the political system and the government, leaving the most fervent party loyalists with greatly increased influence on the choice of candidates and policies.
 Brownstein skillfully and convincingly recounts the process by which the conservative movement gained control of the Republican Party and its Congressional delegation. He is especially deft at identifying the institutional and procedural tools that the most conservative wing of the party used after 2000 both to vanquish Republican moderates and to limit the ability of the Democratic minority to participate meaningfully in the legislative process. He is less successful (and somewhat halfhearted) in making the case for a comparable ideological homogeneity among the Democrats, as becomes clear in the book's opening passage. Brownstein appropriately cites the former House Republican leader Tom DeLay's farewell speech in 2006 as a sign of his party's recent strategy. DeLay ridiculed those who complained about ''bitter, divisive partisan rancor.'' Partisanship, he stated, ''is not a symptom of democracy's weakness but of its health and its strength.'' 
 But making the same argument about a similar dogmatism and zealotry among Democrats is a considerable stretch. To make this case, Brownstein cites not an elected official (let alone a Congressional leader), but the readers of the Daily Kos, a popular left-wing/libertarian Web site that promotes what Brownstein calls ''a scorched-earth opposition to the G.O.P.'' According to him, ''DeLay and the Democratic Internet activists ... each sought to reconfigure their political party to the same specifications -- as a warrior party that would commit to opposing the other side with every conceivable means at its disposal.'' The Kos is a significant force, and some leading Democrats have attended its yearly conventions. But few party leaders share the most extreme views of Kos supporters, and even fewer embrace their ''passionate partisanship.'' Many Democrats might wish that their party leaders would emulate the aggressively partisan style of the Republican right. But it would be hard to argue that they have come even remotely close to the ideological purity of their conservative counterparts. More often, they have seemed cowed and timorous in the face of Republican discipline, and have over time themselves moved increasingly rightward; their recapture of Congress has so far appeared to have emboldened them only modestly. 
 There is no definitive answer to the question of whether the current level of polarization is the inevitable result of long-term systemic changes, or whether it is a transitory product of a particular political moment. But much of this so-called age of extreme partisanship has looked very much like Brownstein's ''Age of Bargaining.'' Ronald Reagan, the great hero of the right and a much more effective spokesman for its views than President Bush, certainly oversaw a significant shift in the ideology and policy of the Republican Party. But through much of his presidency, both he and the Congressional Republicans displayed considerable pragmatism, engaged in negotiation with their opponents and accepted many compromises. Bill Clinton, bedeviled though he was by partisan fury, was a master of compromise and negotiation -- and of co-opting and transforming the views of his adversaries. Only under George W. Bush -- through a combination of his control of both houses of Congress, his own inflexibility and the post-9/11 climate -- did extreme partisanship manage to dominate the agenda. Given the apparent failure of this project, it seems unlikely that a new president, whether Democrat or Republican, will be able to recreate the dispiriting political world of the last seven years.

RACE 
 A History Beyond Black and White. 
 By Marc Aronson. 
 Illustrated. 322 pp. Ginee Seo Books/Atheneum Books for Young Readers. $18.99. (Ages 12 and up) 
 Marc Aronson begins his complex, unusual history of race with a confession. Standing in line at a snack bar, he watches as several boys are accused of stealing money from the tip jar. He believes them guilty, he admits, because they are black.
 It's a brazen beginning. What Aronson has constructed is a genealogy of prejudice, and he never hesitates to place himself in this troubled family tree. He challenges his readers to undergo the same investigation: to connect the personal to the historical, to understand our own worst impulses. We have to be smarter, more knowledgeable, more critical about racism, Aronson tells us. Our children aren't ready for it? They have to be. They live with it and carry its awful weight to this day. 
 Aronson's history moves from the ancient Greeks to Eminem as he traces the accretion of racial thinking. The value of this book is in the connections he draws: between Jews and Ethiopians in the mind of medieval Catholics, between the persecution of Catholics in Ireland and of Africans in America. Sometimes Aronson provokes, as when he calls ancient Jews opposed to Greek influence ''fundamentalists'' and describes the Crusades as ''exactly like the jihad of modern Islamic terrorists.'' Sometimes he explicitly targets contemporary politics, as in his section on racially biased immigration restrictions in 1924. He quotes a senator voting for the measure: ''The American people want us to discriminate.'' No senator today would dare make such a statement about immigration -- but it might still be true.
 Many connections may not, however, be clear to any reader not already versed in the happenings of the last 3,000 years. Historical characters become two-page anecdotes, which both humanizes the past and provides opportunity for massive information overload. David Hume, Charles Darwin, Gilgamesh and the military tactics of the Civil War all have their place in 270 pages of text. The speed and sweep of Aronson's narrative create head-spinning moments, especially when the reach of reference extends beyond any reasonable expectation for 12-year-olds.
 But this is less problematic than what young readers will not find. Aronson writes that his history is about ''race and racism in the West,'' but he is never explicit that his focus is on prejudice in the white mind. This matters because one of the pillars of Western racism, unmentioned here, is that history belongs to whites: everyone else is either trapped in the past or merely subject to the doings of the master race.
 Aronson paraphrases Gandhi's message but is, unfortunately, not guided by it: ''The victims of racism ... must speak for themselves, rather than letting racial categories invented by men in lab coats, or lynch mobs, define them.'' Yet in ''Race'' we almost never hear a nonwhite voice until Gandhi himself comes around. 
 The author does include non-white names like Jamal, Maria and Terrell in modern fictional vignettes scattered through the book. These are attempts to inspire emotional connections with distant history. The war between the Greek city-states and ancient Persia becomes the Super Bowl of Super Bowls. A boy who transfers schools and learns new slang at each symbolizes a traveler learning different racial rules in 19th-century Europe and America. These are only somewhat helpful: they do as much to point out the gaps between levels of historical time as the similarities. A girl's responding to family stress by becoming anorexic is an extremely superficial metaphor for the purity of monks and nuns in early Christianity.
 The difficulty Aronson faces is this: How to make the history and meaning of race clear to young people, when so many adults find the subject overwhelming? It's not clear how he imagines his audience. It would take the most inquisitive young adult to seek out ''Race,'' and the most thoughtful and patient to follow the strands of its argument through.
 Children can, at least, make fearful sense of the images included throughout the book. It's tempting to use it as a slide show, a history of Western representations of race: from Roman sculptures of Africans, to 19th-century charts of racial types, to the terrible picture postcards of lynchings that document the joy humans can find in destroying those we have first dehumanized. 
 These images are by turns fascinating and brutal. I worry for young blacks, Jews and others who see themselves caricatured, but the cruelty of caricature can be a double-edged sword: it makes the twisted mind of racism visible. And one of the last images in the book is a cover of Time magazine with a computer-generated portrait of the new, mixed-race America. It's hopeful and smiling.
 Aronson's focus on prejudice leaves no room for the economic and social legacies of slavery and segregation. To understand the persistence of inequality, a reader would have to go beyond this book. But ''Race'' would be a good place to start for a young reader who has the energy and patience to take it on. The problems of today stem from the deepest roots of our civilization. That should leave us humbler, which is one thing that Aronson's history of race shows us is always necessary.

HEADLINE: When You Hit a Wall

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
ONCE she arrived in New York last summer to start a new job, Hallie Stephens, who planned to share an apartment with a roommate or two, kept encountering references to something unfamiliar: building a wall.
 ''I had never heard of building a wall in an apartment,'' she said. ''I was, like, 'Do I do this myself?' I am not that handy, so I am not sure a wall I build will even stay up.''
 No, of course she wouldn't do it herself. She would hire a company to install a temporary pressurized wall, thereby turning one room into two, as so many of her friends had already done. She could then squeeze in an extra person. It was the only way she could afford to rent in Manhattan. (Some buildings allow temporary walls and others don't.)
 Ms. Stephens, who is from the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, graduated last spring from the University of Michigan. When she began to hunt for an apartment, she stayed with three guys she knew from college, who were sharing a two-bedroom in Stuyvesant Town, the 60-year-old complex built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to house war veterans and recently sold to an investment group led by Tishman Speyer Properties. 
 A wall divided the living room, creating a third bedroom. The guys were investment bankers, ''and were making way more money'' than she and the friends she was planning to live with earned, Ms. Stephens said. (Two-bedrooms in Stuyvesant Town start at $4,025.) The wall was so nicely installed it looked like ''part of the original structure,'' she said.
 She and her two friends raised their target rent to $1,300 each, from $1,000. Ms. Stephens, 23, spent hours online hunting for an affordable two-bedroom rental that could be converted to three by adding a wall. That $1,300 figure was pushing it for her roommates, though. ''One of the girls was unemployed,'' Ms. Stephens said.
 They spent a day in Manhattan's East Village and Upper East Side. Everything seemed dirty or small. ''At the end of the day, I was sobbing on the phone to my parents,'' Ms. Stephens said.
 It was on to Brooklyn. ''Every place I looked, I looked because people had told me about it,'' Ms. Stephens said. ''It was all hearsay: So-and-so is living in this neighborhood; you should look there. I guess we were looking in Park Slope. We didn't know much about Brooklyn.'' 
 But it felt far away, and nothing there seemed worth the price. Next came Hoboken, N.J., where a friend of a friend lived. Ms. Stephens's two would-be roommates liked it so much they decided to rent a tiny two-bedroom there, for $1,225 each.
 But Ms. Stephens wanted to live in Manhattan. Besides, Hoboken would mean a tough commute to her office in East Midtown, where she is an assistant at a television production company.
 Now she was on her own, though there was the slim possibility of yet another friend joining her as a roommate in the fall. So she decided to hunt for a one-bedroom, with the idea of staying there alone until the roommate situation was solidified.
 Other friends lived in Murray Hill. So Ms. Stephens stopped into a rental building, the Laurence Towers on East 33rd Street, where a one-bedroom was available for nearly $2,800. But the rent would rise if she acquired a roommate. (The building charges $500 more a month if someone erects a temporary wall.)
 Maybe the financial district, where yet another friend lived, would be more affordable. At the Crest on Wall Street, Ms. Stephens could rent a one-bedroom for less than $2,900. There was no extra charge to add a wall.
 But the area seemed deserted at night. ''You can't even go to a Duane Reade because it is closed,'' she said, ''and I thought I might be miserable living down there, especially without a roommate.'' 
 Meanwhile, she decided to take a short-term place for most of the summer, so she could assess her next move. On the Upper East Side, she paid $1,225 for her share of a one-bedroom turned two with the by-now-familiar temporary wall.
 She became fast friends with a colleague, Holly Pakfar, who was sharing a ground-floor apartment in a brownstone on East 18th Street with two roommates. Ms. Pakfar's bedroom, for which she paid $1,125, was once part of a very large kitchen, but it had been transformed into a bedroom with the addition of a wall. (This one was permanent.)
 She was eager to move. The shower stall was ''so small I couldn't bend down to shave my legs -- I had to open the door,'' said Ms. Pakfar, 24, who graduated from the University of Southern California and is from the San Fernando Valley.
 When mice arrived, Ms. Pakfar fled to a friend's place for more than a week. Upon her return, she found mouse droppings under her pillow. ''I wanted something that felt clean,'' she said. So she was eager to join Ms. Stephens on her hunt.
 Ms. Stephens had Stuyvesant Town in the back of her mind. Now that she was certain she had a roommate, they could afford a one-bedroom. With a wall, of course.
 Ms. Pakfar wasn't sure what Stuyvesant Town was. ''I had seen it in a cab going down the F.D.R., and I always thought it was projects,'' she said. 
 The two chose a one-bedroom that was newly renovated, close to Avenue A, for $3,075. They moved in the early fall, splitting the $1,000 cost of their temporary wall. 
 Ms. Stephens pays $1,675 for the real bedroom. Ms. Pakfar pays $1,400 for her room, which was created from the living room. It is more than either intended to pay, but their parents help on occasion.
 Both are happy in their new home. ''It feels very grown up and clean,'' Ms. Stephens said. Some of her colleagues and former sorority sisters also live in Stuyvesant Town, so ''I have neighbors I know, which is nice when you are moving away from home.''
 And in comparison with friends' places, it seems big. Despite living in half a room, Ms. Pakfar actually has space to walk around.
 ''It is strange that that seems special,'' Ms. Stephens said. ''I have seen places where you have to turn sideways and squeeze along the wall to get out of the bedroom. But it is something you have to do to afford to live in the city, until you reach a certain age and have a certain income.''

HEADLINE: Frayed Judicial Robes

 BODY:
Imagine a courtroom scene, maybe something out of ''Law & Order.'' Then ask yourself which official earns the least of all those important people sitting in front of the jury. If you guessed the judge, chances are you're right. 
 Certainly the defense lawyer, if a private attorney, makes far more in hourly fees than the person with the gavel. Some district attorneys, in New York City at least, earn more than not only the trial judge but also the chief judge. There are even nonjudicial employees in the state judiciary system who can earn as much or more than the person who is up there making the most important decisions in the entire courthouse.
 Thanks to lawmakers in Albany, New York judges have not had a pay raise for almost nine years. New York's part-time legislators have made it their business to piggyback on the state's full-time judges when it comes to salaries, refusing to approve a pay raise for the judiciary unless they get one themselves. 
 The judges are so angry that some are suing the state -- there are two lawsuits already -- for better pay. Others are demanding that Chief Judge Judith Kaye unilaterally award the judges a pay raise out of her state budget. The hitch there is that the state comptroller could refuse to cut the checks, which could mean yet another lawsuit.
 As things stand now, there are still plenty of excellent judges in New York, but their caseloads are skyrocketing at the same time their salaries are losing ground to inflation. At some point, as good judges exchange their robes for the monetary rewards of private practice, few but the rich or less qualified will want to replace them. 
 Albany will have another chance to address this judicial emergency next month, perhaps its last chance for a while, since nobody will even want to talk about pay increases during an election year. Lawmakers have said they want to return briefly in December to deal with a few remaining issues like a new horse racing agreement and a huge capital spending plan. But the most urgent item on their list should be this pay raise for judges.
 Since June, there has appeared to be the makings of an agreement on campaign finance reform and pay increases for judges and lawmakers. The agreement between legislative leaders and Gov. Eliot Spitzer would create a salary commission to award routine cost-of-living increases to judges and other public officials, including legislators. This is an important package. But the judges should not be held hostage to its success. If tempers flare again, and the deal is not consummated, Mr. Spitzer and the leaders of the Senate and the Assembly, Joseph Bruno and Sheldon Silver, should proceed with a salary increase for the judiciary anyway.
 The legislators will balk at paying judges and only judges; they have hidden their own pay increases behind judicial robes for a long time, and old habits are hard to break. But it is clear that by refusing to give extra pay to the judiciary, New York's lawmakers have created a crisis in the state courts. It is their job to solve it.

HEADLINE: Royalton Shake-Up, From Top to Lobby

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
AS tourists slipped past the tall mahogany doors into the lobby of the Royalton Hotel the other evening, many appeared taken aback. The hotel's interior since 1988 -- a bold confection by the designer Philippe Starck -- had been torn out. Gone were the chair legs shaped like ram's horns. Gone was the Champagne bar that conjured up the inside of a genie's bottle. 
 Gone, too, was the glamorous crowd the hotel had attracted in its heyday. Created by the night life impresario Ian Schrager, the Royalton had once been popular both at lunchtime (when its restaurant, 44, was known as the Conde Cafe for all the magazine editors who ate there), and night (when a stylish crowd paraded on the baby-blue carpet that ran from 44th to 43rd Streets). 
 But by the late '90s, the Royalton had lost much of its luster. Earlier this year, hoping to reverse that trend, W. Edward Scheetz, then the chief executive of Morgans Hotel Group, the company founded by Mr. Schrager, ordered a new lobby. The Starck interior was gutted. A clubby interior, mostly dark metal and leather, with a two-sided gas fireplace, was built over the summer. 
 But Mr. Scheetz wasn't around to celebrate the gala reopening on Oct. 23. He had resigned from the company a month earlier, after a 23-year-old woman was found dead in his apartment in Las Vegas.
 On Aug. 29, he came home from work -- his company had recently bought the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino -- to find Michelle Lynn Hatchel, of Parker, Colo., ''stiff,'' ''cold'' and ''different funny colors,'' according to the tape of a 911 call he made. 
 An autopsy revealed that Ms. Hatchel had consumed large amounts of cocaine and oxycodone. The death was ruled an accident and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police say they have closed the case. 
 Mr. Scheetz, a 42-year-old father of two, left Morgans on Sept. 20 ''to address personal issues,'' according to a company statement. The loss of the hotel group's chief, who remains its largest private shareholder -- and which comes two years after Mr. Schrager himself departed -- raises questions about Morgans's ability to attract the well-heeled travelers it depends on, as well as investors it needs to realize its long-term goals. 
 Investors had already been wondering whether Morgans ''could succeed in garnering super-premium rates at its hotels, and at the same time expand its platform'' after Mr. Schrager's departure, said John Arabia, a hotel industry analyst, who knows Mr. Scheetz. 
 ''I think under Ed's leadership, people started getting comfortable that it could,'' said Mr. Arabia, a principal of Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, Calif. Now, he said, ''I would not be surprised if potential co-investors take a wait-and-see approach.''
 SINCE Ms. Hatchel's death was first reported in the news, a week after Mr. Scheetz's departure, embarrassing revelations have piled up. 
 For one thing, there is the 911 tape, now widely available on the Internet, on which he seems almost annoyed that Ms. Hatchel, whom he described as ''my girlfriend,'' was dead in his three-bedroom penthouse condominium on Paradise Road. On the tape Mr. Scheetz sounds reluctant to move the body to a position that would have made breathing easier; as he tells the operator, ''she's like in rigor mortis.''
 Asked whether the police were investigating how Ms. Hatchel got the drugs that killed her, a police spokesman, Jose Montoya, said: ''I don't know how it's done in other places. In Las Vegas, if the coroner rules that it's a drug overdose and the victim or suspect is dead, there's not much to do at that point.''
 That doesn't satisfy Helen Barker, Ms. Hatchel's grandmother, who said that the police should be looking into how she got the drugs. The family's determination to press for more information about Ms. Hatchel's death could further embarrass Mr. Scheetz, as well as the hotel group he used to run. The dead woman's family has hired a lawyer and a private investigator. If the police department doesn't ''do its job,'' Mrs. Barker said, they may file a civil suit against Mr. Scheetz. 
 She added that the family has never heard from Mr. Scheetz, who told the police he had known Ms. Hatchel for about two years. ''We received not one note, not one word, not 'Can I help you out in this crisis?''' Mrs. Barker said. ''Nothing.''
 Calls to Mr. Scheetz's home in Greenwich, Conn., including a message left with his wife, and to his cellphone were not returned. Brandy Bergman, who works for Sard Verbinnen, a crisis communications firm that Mr. Scheetz has retained, said that he would not comment. 
 According to Mrs. Barker and other relatives, on her last night alive Ms. Hatchel sent text messages to friends, sometimes while hiding in a closet in Mr. Scheetz's apartment. In one message, sent at 10:36 p.m. on Aug. 28 to a friend named Miko, she wrote: ''Things r really bad ed has been so mean 2 me.'' An hour later, in a message to a friend named Gina, she wrote, ''I cant belive how much coke he does all the time all day long.'' (The ''he'' is not identified, but Mrs. Barker, Ms. Hatchel's grandmother, believes it's obvious from the preceding messages that the man is Mr. Scheetz.)
 Ms. Hatchel's grandmother is speaking for the family because Kim Barker, the dead woman's mother, had a heart attack on Sept. 5, the day of her daughter's funeral. The grandmother said that the family began learning the circumstances of Ms. Hatchel's death only in October, when they received a suitcase containing Ms. Hatchel's belongings and found her cellphone buried under some jewelry. They have since placed the cellphone in a safe deposit box (though not before allowing The New York Post to photograph the outgoing text messages). 
 MRS. BARKER said that her granddaughter had spent time with Mr. Scheetz in New York in August before flying to Las Vegas with him on a private jet. Ms. Hatchel, who had dropped out of high school in Colorado at 17, had worked in a tanning salon and as the manager of a shoe store in a mall, her grandmother said, but was ''trying to find her place in the world.'' 
 Mrs. Barker said her family's goal is to hold Mr. Scheetz and Las Vegas authorities accountable. ''We'll never see our Michelle again,'' she said. ''But if what we do prevents one other lady from being treated like garbage in Las Vegas, then I've done my job in this lifetime.''
 Whatever happens, the incident is a blow to the reputation of a man who studied economics at Princeton and who was described in 1997 by Crain's New York Business as ''aggressive, but in a strait-laced kind of way.'' At the time, Mr. Scheetz, still in his 30s, ran the multibillion-dollar Apollo Partners real estate group. He left Apollo in 1997 to run his investment fund, NorthStar Capital. In 1998 NorthStar paid $255 million for 84 percent of the Morgans Hotel Group, which runs the Clift in San Francisco, the Delano in Miami Beach and other trendy properties. 
 Mr. Schrager, who famously went to jail for tax evasion in the 1980s, rebounded as a hotelier and real estate developer and renovated the dowdy Royalton in 1988, with a lobby that looked like a nightclub. It was the inspiration for boutique hotels around the world. ''The Royalton showed that hotels don't have to be generic and boring and traditional,'' said Vicente Wolf, a prominent New York interior designer.
 Since leaving Morgans in 2005, Mr. Schrager has opened the Gramercy Park Hotel, designed by the artist Julian Schnabel.
 As Mr. Schrager's successor, Mr. Scheetz installed Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France champion, as one of the company's directors. Still, Mr. Scheetz was known as ''the money guy,'' in contrast to Mr. Schrager, who was ''the visionary.'' The company went heavily into debt as a result of Mr. Scheetz's plans to nearly double the size of the chain by 2010. Morgans, Dorothy Pomerantz wrote in Forbes magazine in September, ''is operating with crazy leverage.''
 Ms. Pomerantz, who met Mr. Scheetz poolside at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino last spring, described the executive as looking ''a little pale and very out of place'' amid the Las Vegas crowd. 
 The Hard Rock, which Morgans purchased with a partner in February for $770 million, is in the process of obtaining its Nevada gaming license (in order to take over the casino operations from an outside company), and Mr. Scheetz's association with a fatal drug overdose could have damaged its prospects had he not resigned.
 Corporate officers of casinos must pass criminal background checks and prove ''that they're a person of good character, honesty and integrity,'' said Dennis Neilander, chairman of the Nevada state gaming control board. 
 Since Mr. Scheetz's departure, the company has been run by an interim chief executive, Fred Kleiser. So far there have been no major financial consequences of Mr. Scheetz's absence, although the public company paid him $7.3 million in stock at the time he left, and reported a loss of $10 million in the third quarter. ''Revenue per available room'' was up 11.5 percent in the period compared with the third quarter of 2006, Mr. Kleiser told analysts in a conference call last week. In a statement on Friday, he said: ''I do believe our customers will vote with their wallets. And indeed they have. Our customers love the Royalton. We have enhanced and restored the halo of this icon.''
 It's too soon to know if the Royalton, where rooms begin at nearly $500, can entirely regain its former glory. The hotel's restaurant, Brasserie 44 (run by John McDonald, of Lever House and Lure Fishbar, and designed by Roman & Williams in a vaguely nautical style), seems likely to be a draw -- if not quite the hot spot it was in the '90s, when it attracted the publishing and fashion elite. 
 REACHED by phone in Paris, Mr. Starck said of the new redesign, ''I think if you are lucky enough to own an icon, you shouldn't kill the icon.'' He said the new owners should have built their own hotel nearby, left his intact, and seen which one people liked better.
 On a recent Saturday night, the Royalton's lobby was about half full. Some of those perched on the leather sofas said that they preferred the new design, which they found cozy; others, like Paul Carpenter, an investment banker from London, said they missed the flair of the Starck lobby.
 But the hotel's owners, having made the decision to eliminate every vestige of that design, now appear to be hedging their bets.
 The home page of the hotel's Web site uses the word ''spectacular,'' a quotation it attributes to The New York Times. But that word appeared in 1988, in a review of Mr. Starck's creation.

HEADLINE: Is the Market Finally Waking Up?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT was a brutal week for equities, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite index lost 6.5 percent of its value in just five trading days.
 But is this a sign that the economy is in real trouble, as some investors believe? Or is this simply a knee-jerk reaction to the continuing trouble in the credit markets? 
 It's a fair question. Stocks are supposed to be a predictor of future economic trends. Until last week, the bulls were arguing that because the stock market was still near its all-time highs, the economy could not be in peril. As recently as Tuesday, the S.& P. 500 was less than 3 percent below its record close of record close of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9.
 But even back then, the market was signaling that there were problems in the economy -- only Wall Street wasn't paying much attention. 
 For instance, Gordon B. Fowler Jr., chief investment officer at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia, said that even though the overall S.& P. 500 was up for the year, ''the number of winning stocks has become narrower lately.'' This shows that ''there are pockets of strength in the market,'' he said, ''but not as much broad-based strength as there was a few years ago.'' 
 From the end of June to the end of October, the average stock in the S.& P. 500 actually fell 1.1 percent. Yet few people noticed, because the overall index advanced 3.1 percent during this stretch.
 How can that be? Remember, the index is weighted by market capitalization: the larger the company, based on its market value, the greater sway it has on the index. And in recent months, it just so happens that the largest stocks in the market have performed best. As a result, the strong showing of the index's largest stocks has been painting a rosier picture of the economy than the overall market. Which economy is the S.& P. 500 supposed to reflect?
 ''When the S.& P. was devised, it was meant to be a barometer of the domestic stock market,'' said Thomas M. McManus, chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities. But Mr. McManus argues that ''it's grown beyond that.'' 
 For example, 45 percent of the sales of the companies in the S.& P. 500 are now being generated overseas. Many of the biggest companies in the index -- the giant multinationals that have been leading the market -- derive an even larger percentage of their business outside the United States. Simply put, ''the S.& P. has become a good indicator of what's going on globally,'' Mr. Fowler said. 
 As for the domestic economy, investors are probably better off looking at the the equal-weighted S.& P. 500, which gives each stock, regardless of size, the same influence on the index. Since August, the equal-weight version -- which better reflects the performance of smaller, domestically oriented blue-chip companies -- has fallen 1.1 percent, versus a gain of 1.3 percent for the index weighted by market cap.
 Are there any other signs of potential problems for the economy?
 Investors may want to turn to the corporate profit picture. In recent weeks, analysts' forecasts for third-quarter profits have plummeted. 
 As recently as last month, the Wall Street consensus was that third-quarter earnings of the S.& P. 500 would jump 3.9 percent, versus the same quarter a year ago. But analysts are now bracing for a 2.4 percent drop in earnings, thanks in part to the ripple effects of the credit crisis. If there is a decline, it would be the first quarterly drop in S.& P. 500 earnings since the bear market of 2000.
 Even more telling is this: Wall Street is bracing for profit contraction in some of the most economically sensitive areas of the market. For example, financial-sector earnings are expected to fall 17 percent in the third quarter, versus the corresponding quarter a year ago, according to the latest survey by Thomson Financial. 
 To some people, this may not be a big surprise, given the huge write-downs that many financial firms have been reporting lately, resulting from losses on subprime mortgage-related debt. But it's not just the financials. 
 Thanks to the continuing slowdown in housing, profits in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to tumble 21 percent. And both the energy and basic-materials sectors are also expected to have a significant profit decline for the quarter, despite rising commodity prices.
 Mike Thompson, managing director of global research at Thomson Financial, says he believes that the potential slowdown in earnings ''reflects a midcycle slowdown.'' But he adds that he does not think a recession is on the horizon. 
 He notes that analysts still think corporate earnings growth will reaccelerate in the fourth quarter this year and the first quarter of 2008, though many of those estimates have been cut in recent weeks.
 But even if profits do recover modestly later in the year, a third-quarter earnings reversal would be ''a sign that the risks to the U.S. economy are much higher than they were six to nine months ago,'' said Christopher N. Orndorff, head of equities for the asset management firm Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles.
 Mr. Orndorff says he still believes that the economy is likely to avoid an official recession -- defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in the gross domestic product -- in 2008. But he adds that he wouldn't be surprised if the pending economic slowdown ''feels like a recession.''
 FOR his part, Mr. Thompson says it's still too soon for pessimism. The underlying economy isn't as bad as some investors believe, he says.
 ''We think we're going to finish the year with something like 2.7 percent economic growth,'' he added. ''That's not horrible.'' Moreover, he said, ''unemployment is under 5 percent, there's an export boom caused by the weaker dollar, and interest rates are suitably low.'' 
 But such positive developments may be cold comfort for investors who've been burned in the recent past by assuming that current economic trends are a predictor of future growth. 
 Back in the second quarter of 2000, G.D.P. was soaring at an annual rate of 6.4 percent. That was less than a year before the recession of 2001 struck. And in the first quarter of 1990, the economy was expanding at the brisk pace of 4.7 percent, just months before a recession began that July.

HEADLINE: Undoing Your Daily Damage to the Earth, for a Price

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
PATTI SARANIERO and her husband, Ben Thoron, who have three sons and live in San Diego, already recycle or compost their trash, and use compact fluorescent light bulbs. Last year, they decided to do even more to help the environment: they paid a company to help them offset some of the carbon they use.
 Ms. Saraniero logged on to the Web site of TerraPass, a retailer of offsets in San Francisco, used its online calculator to figure out the amount of carbon she needed to offset and paid the company $100 to do it. Companies like TerraPass allow consumers to invest in projects like renewable energy and reforestation in an effort to remove from the atmosphere an amount of greenhouse gas equal to that produced by their cars, airplane trips and home energy use.
 ''I'm glad we do it, but I'm also a little ambivalent about it,'' Ms. Saraniero said. ''I'm not so keen about someone making a buck off of global warming, but our options are limited at the moment. I want to drive a hybrid, but can't afford one big enough for all of us. So I use offsets.'' 
 Driven by rising concern over climate change, the consumer market for offsets has been growing significantly since late 2005. The number of offsets sold by online retailers like TerraPass, Carbonfund.org, NativeEnergy, e-BlueHorizons and many others grew more than 42 percent from 2005 to 2006, according to data published by the research firms New Carbon Finance and Ecosystem Marketplace.
 Some retailers allow buyers to choose the projects they want their offset dollars to support; others divide the money among the projects in their portfolio.
 TerraPass has sold 80,000 offsets so far this year, compared with 20,000 at this time last year. In the last 18 months, the number of people who used CarbonNeutral Company's Web site to buy offsets to counter the carbon from airplane flights increased by a multiple of 10.
 Offsets aim to provide a ton-for-ton trade of carbon or carbon-equivalents. Carbon dioxide isn't the only heat-trapping pollutant in the atmosphere, so the warming potential of other greenhouse gases is converted into carbon equivalents for the purpose of trading.
 Most vendors provide online calculators so buyers can determine their emissions, or they can just pick the national average, which is about 20 tons a year per person, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. Offset prices, set by the retailer, generally run $2.50 to $20 a ton. 
 Money spent on offsets goes to projects that will remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, avoid their production altogether or destroy them before they are released.
 Projects include those that focus on renewable energy, like wind and solar; reforestation; methane capture, which takes methane emitted from the waste of cows or landfills and turns it into electricity or destroys it; and the retiring of carbon credits.
 Carbon credits, which are bought and sold in the United States on the Chicago Climate Exchange, represent the right of companies to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases. Companies that need to increase their emissions must buy credits from those who have reduced theirs. Consumers buy those credits and retire them, preventing companies from using them to pollute.
 Erik Blachford, chief executive of TerraPass, said climate change is an ''all-hands-on-deck crisis; we need the private sector's resources and business experience to effectively engage consumers on the scale necessary to address the problem.''
 An online survey of more than 2,000 TerraPass customers in June found that 64 percent use compact fluorescent bulbs, 16 percent drive hybrid cars and half have contacted a government representative about climate change.
 Jeffrey Potter is typical. He is 38 and works for an environmental group in Madison, Wis. He and his wife, Annie, a teacher, are expecting their first child this spring. A year ago, they bought carbon offsets from the Bonneville Environmental Foundation for about $150 to offset the estimated yearly carbon emissions from their Subaru wagon. 
 ''It's an easy thing to do and it's affordable,'' Mr. Potter said, ''but it only makes sense if it's part of a broader strategy to reduce your greenhouse emissions.'' 
 Critics of carbon offsets say consumers are simply buying their way out of having to make meaningful reductions in energy consumption. ''It doesn't make sense to buy offsets for your Hummer,'' said Dale Byrk, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. It would make more sense to reduce energy consumption by not driving a Hummer in the first place, she said.
 Kevin Smith, a researcher at Carbon Trade Watch, which provides research on greenhouse gas trading, and author of a report called ''The Carbon Neutral Myth,'' said offsets ''take people's impulse to do something about climate change and commodify it.''
 ''The message is, 'Give us your money and we'll deal with the problem,' when real responses to climate change involve people being active in their communities, using political pressure and making changes themselves,'' he added.
 Another problem is a lack of objective standards to use in making purchasing decisions. ''There is no Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval in this market,'' Ms. Byrk said, ''so the onus is on the buyer to make sure they are purchasing a legitimate offset.
 Many retailers use independent verifying companies to ensure that promised carbon reductions are occurring. TerraPass, for example, uses Green-e, a nonprofit independent certification and verification program, as well as SES Inc. and First Environment, both of which are recognized as approved offset project verifiers by the Chicago Climate Exchange.
 For guidance, buyers can turn to the Web site of Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group based in New York. The site lists approved offset projects, rather than screened retailers, because offsets within a retailer's portfolio can vary in quality. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL experts say that however imperfect, offsets are an important part of the overall plan to reduce greenhouse gases. 
 ''The easy way out is to do nothing,'' said Eric Carlson, executive director of the offset retailer Carbonfund.org. ''Carbon offsets are a self-imposed tax, which gives you the financial incentive to reduce your emissions as much as economically feasible.''
 Offsets don't necessarily have to involve an either/or debate, said Ron Luhur, a carbon markets specialist at Environmental Defense. ''At Thanksgiving, for someone who has to get on the plane to see Grandma across the country, they can't escape those emissions,'' he said. ''If you want to be doing everything you can, you want to offset those -- because it's certainly better than doing nothing.''

HEADLINE: Alisha Fernandez, Carlos Miranda

 BODY:
Alisha Marie Fernandez, the daughter of Mindy A. Fernandez and Alexander Fernandez of Coral Gables, Fla., was married last evening to Carlos Armando Miranda, a son of Amparo Miranda and Raul J. Miranda of Spring, Tex. Ryan Dowell Baum, a Universal Life minister and a friend of the couple, officiated at the Westin Diplomat, a hotel in Hollywood, Fla. 
 The bride and bridegroom, both 25, met at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where she received a master's degree in gender development and globalization, and he received a master's degree in global economic history. 
 The bride is a corporate philanthropy consultant in New York with Changing Our World; she consults corporations on developing strategic community involvement programs. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. 
 Her father is an economic and financial consultant in Miami, and the managing director of AFC Group, a litigation advisory services firm in Miami. Her mother is a special-education teacher at Maritime and Science Technology Academy, a high school in Miami. 
 The bridegroom worked in fund-raising until last month at the New York Public Library, where he was an associate manager of major gifts. He graduated from New York University. 
 His father is a special projects consultant for NRG Energy, an energy provider in Princeton, N.J. 
 Ms. Fernandez and Mr. Miranda met after being set up by their grandmothers, who have been best friends since the 1950s, when they were neighbors in Holguin, Cuba. Both sets of grandparents continued their friendship after immigrating to Miami in the 1960s and the couple's fathers became childhood friends.
 Although the two had never met, their grandmothers encouraged them to do so in London when they learned they would be at the same graduate school. 
 ''Our getting together was totally coincidental, and it was amazing that our grandmothers managed to remember that each of us would be attending there,'' Ms. Fernandez said.
 At first glance, the grandchildren did not impress each other.
 ''I met him the day I hit the ground in London,'' Ms. Fernandez recalled. ''Our first conversation he was talking about his love for science fiction and I was talking about shoes. It didn't go very well.''
 They didn't see each other for the next few weeks, but crossed paths at university orientation. She told him she had a bartending job off campus. A few nights later, Mr. Miranda walked into the bar with a group of friends, including, as he put it, ''one obnoxious jerk who was following Alisha around all night, harassing her.''
 Mr. Miranda was fearful that word would get back to her grandmother, and then his. He asked if he could take Ms. Fernandez to lunch as a way of apologizing for the poor company he had kept that evening. 
 ''That second get-together went incredibly well,'' Mr. Miranda said. ''We made a tradition of getting together for lunch every Monday and things started snowballing from there.
 ''When we met again, we were a lot more acclimated and realized we had a lot more in common, especially a shared culture and a shared history -- and we just meshed.''

HEADLINE: In DNA Era, New Worries About Prejudice

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
When scientists first decoded the human genome in 2000, they were quick to portray it as proof of humankind's remarkable similarity. The DNA of any two people, they emphasized, is at least 99 percent identical.
 But new research is exploring the remaining fraction to explain differences between people of different continental origins.
 Scientists, for instance, have recently identified small changes in DNA that account for the pale skin of Europeans, the tendency of Asians to sweat less and West Africans' resistance to certain diseases.
 At the same time, genetic information is slipping out of the laboratory and into everyday life, carrying with it the inescapable message that people of different races have different DNA. Ancestry tests tell customers what percentage of their genes are from Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. The heart-disease drug BiDil is marketed exclusively to African-Americans, who seem genetically predisposed to respond to it. Jews are offered prenatal tests for genetic disorders rarely found in other ethnic groups. 
 Such developments are providing some of the first tangible benefits of the genetic revolution. Yet some social critics fear they may also be giving long-discredited racial prejudices a new potency. The notion that race is more than skin deep, they fear, could undermine principles of equal treatment and opportunity that have relied on the presumption that we are all fundamentally equal. 
 ''We are living through an era of the ascendance of biology, and we have to be very careful,'' said Henry Louis Gates Jr., director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research at Harvard University. ''We will all be walking a fine line between using biology and allowing it to be abused.'' 
 Certain superficial traits like skin pigmentation have long been presumed to be genetic. But the ability to pinpoint their DNA source makes the link between genes and race more palpable. And on mainstream blogs, in college classrooms and among the growing community of ancestry test-takers, it is prompting the question of whether more profound differences may also be attributed to DNA.
 Nonscientists are already beginning to stitch together highly speculative conclusions about the historically charged subject of race and intelligence from the new biological data. Last month, a blogger in Manhattan described a recently published study that linked several snippets of DNA to high I.Q. An online genetic database used by medical researchers, he told readers, showed that two of the snippets were found more often in Europeans and Asians than in Africans. 
 No matter that the link between I.Q. and those particular bits of DNA was unconfirmed, or that other high I.Q. snippets are more common in Africans, or that hundreds or thousands of others may also affect intelligence, or that their combined influence might be dwarfed by environmental factors. Just the existence of such genetic differences between races, proclaimed the author of the Half Sigma blog, a 40-year-old software developer, means ''the egalitarian theory,'' that all races are equal, ''is proven false.''
 Though few of the bits of human genetic code that vary between individuals have yet to be tied to physical or behavioral traits, scientists have found that roughly 10 percent of them are more common in certain continental groups and can be used to distinguish people of different races. They say that studying the differences, which arose during the tens of thousands of years that human populations evolved on separate continents after their ancestors dispersed from humanity's birthplace in East Africa, is crucial to mapping the genetic basis for disease. 
 But many geneticists, wary of fueling discrimination and worried that speaking openly about race could endanger support for their research, are loath to discuss the social implications of their findings. Still, some acknowledge that as their data and methods are extended to nonmedical traits, the field is at what one leading researcher recently called ''a very delicate time, and a dangerous time.'' 
 ''There are clear differences between people of different continental ancestries,'' said Marcus W. Feldman, a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University. ''It's not there yet for things like I.Q., but I can see it coming. And it has the potential to spark a new era of racism if we do not start explaining it better.'' 
 Dr. Feldman said any finding on intelligence was likely to be exceedingly hard to pin down. But given that some may emerge, he said he wanted to create ''ready response teams'' of geneticists to put such socially fraught discoveries in perspective. 
 The authority that DNA has earned through its use in freeing falsely convicted inmates, preventing disease and reconstructing family ties leads people to wrongly elevate genetics over other explanations for differences between groups. 
 ''I've spent the last 10 years of my life researching how much genetic variability there is between populations,'' said Dr. David Altshuler, director of the Program in Medical and Population Genetics at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. ''But living in America, it is so clear that the economic and social and educational differences have so much more influence than genes. People just somehow fixate on genetics, even if the influence is very small.'' 
 But on the Half Sigma blog and elsewhere, the conversation is already flashing forward to what might happen if genetically encoded racial differences in socially desirable -- or undesirable -- traits are identified. 
 ''If I were to believe the 'facts' in this post, what should I do?'' one reader responded on Half Sigma. ''Should I advocate discrimination against blacks because they are less smart? Should I not hire them to my company because odds are I could find a smarter white person? Stop trying to prove that one group of people are genetically inferior to your group. Just stop.'' 
 Renata McGriff, 52, a health care consultant who had been encouraging black clients to volunteer genetic information to scientists, said she and other African-Americans have lately been discussing ''opting out of genetic research until it's clear we're not going to use science to validate prejudices.'' 
 ''I don't want the children in my family to be born thinking they are less than someone else based on their DNA,'' added Ms. McGriff, of Manhattan. 
 Such discussions are among thousands that followed the geneticist James D. Watson's assertion last month that Africans are innately less intelligent than other races. Dr. Watson, a Nobel Prize winner, subsequently apologized and quit his post at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island. 
 But the incident has added to uneasiness about whether society is prepared to handle the consequences of science that may eventually reveal appreciable differences between races in the genes that influence socially important traits. 
 New genetic information, some liberal critics say, could become the latest rallying point for a conservative political camp that objects to social policies like affirmative action, as happened with ''The Bell Curve,'' the controversial 1994 book that examined the relationship between race and I.Q. 
 Yet even some self-described liberals argue that accepting that there may be genetic differences between races is important in preparing to address them politically. 
 ''Let's say the genetic data says we'll have to spend two times as much for every black child to close the achievement gap,'' said Jason Malloy, 28, an artist in Madison, Wis., who wrote a defense of Dr. Watson for the widely read science blog Gene Expression. Society, he said, would need to consider how individuals ''can be given educational and occupational opportunities that work best for their unique talents and limitations.'' 
 Others hope that the genetic data may overturn preconceived notions of racial superiority by, for example, showing that Africans are innately more intelligent than other groups. But either way, the increased outpouring of conversation on the normally taboo subject of race and genetics has prompted some to suggest that innate differences should be accepted but, at some level, ignored. 
 ''Regardless of any such genetic variation, it is our moral duty to treat all as equal before God and before the law,'' Perry Clark, 44, wrote on a New York Times blog. It is not necessary, argued Dr. Clark, a retired neonatologist in Leawood, Kan., who is white, to maintain the pretense that inborn racial differences do not exist.
 ''When was the last time a nonblack sprinter won the Olympic 100 meters?'' he asked.
 ''To say that such differences aren't real,'' Dr. Clark later said in an interview, ''is to stick your head in the sand and go blah blah blah blah blah until the band marches by.''
 Race, many sociologists and anthropologists have argued for decades, is a social invention historically used to justify prejudice and persecution. But when Samuel M. Richards gave his students at Pennsylvania State Universitygenetic ancestry tests to establish the imprecision of socially constructed racial categories, he found the exercise reinforced them instead.
 One white-skinned student, told she was 9 percent West African, went to a Kwanzaa celebration, for instance, but would not dream of going to an Asian cultural event because her DNA did not match, Dr. Richards said. Preconceived notions of race seemed all the more authentic when quantified by DNA.
 ''Before, it was, 'I'm white because I have white skin and grew up in white culture,' '' Dr. Richards said. ''Now it's, 'I really know I'm white, so white is this big neon sign hanging over my head.' It's like, oh, no, come on. That wasn't the point.''

HEADLINE: How the Western Was Won

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT. 
A. O. Scott is a film critic at The Times.

 BODY:
LIKE A GUNSLINGER standing on a dusty street in a one-horse town, facing down a posse or, if he's wearing a tin star, a gang of outlaws, the western has proved hard to kill. Officially, of course, its death has been documented again and again, with regret and, sometimes, with satisfaction. But as soon as the obsequies have been pronounced and the coffin lowered into the sandy earth, the rumble of hoofbeats sounds on the horizon, and the western rides again. In 1991, for example, the critic J. Hoberman published a thorough and persuasive essay called ''How the Western Was Lost,'' documenting the waning of a once-vigorous form. That same year, however, Kevin Costner's ''Dances With Wolves'' won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, a feat Clint Eastwood's ''Unforgiven'' would match two years later. But Hoberman surely had a point. The movie western had retreated from its position as a quintessential and vital form of American storytelling, undone by the same cultural tumult that had put paid to other manifestations of midcentury consensus. The newer westerns, the ones made since Vietnam, were either revivalist or revisionist, seeking to bury the old myths or to exhume them. 
 And yet the very content of those myths was always, to some degree, their own passing. From the beginning, the western has been saturated with nostalgia, mourning and the sorrowful reckoning of lost things and times past. The sun has been setting for as long as anyone can remember. The official death of the West, after all, was virtually synchronous with the birth of the movies. 
 In 1890, the Office of the Census announced the closing of the American frontier, and three years later, in a paper presented at the World's Fair and Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Frederick Jackson Turner of the University of Wisconsin argued that the Westward push had provided a ''safety valve'' preventing social tension and class conflict from festering in the American body politic. Over the next century (and to this day), the frontier thesis, as it came to be known, has been debated, debunked, rehabilitated and refined by critics and historians. However dubious or simplistic Turner's claims have come to seem -- American history contains plenty of class struggle if you know where to look for it -- he provided a template from which a thousand wagon-train spectacles and cowboy fables (to say nothing of Ph.D. dissertations) would be struck, a sketch of the democratic, individualistic, entrepreneurial ethos of the 19th-century frontier that would find its fullest elaboration in 20th-century Hollywood. The wagon train comes across the prairie, and a little town springs up with wooden sidewalks, hitching posts, swinging doors and plate-glass windows. The honest folk who shop at the general store and read the local newspaper are tough and self-reliant, but also vulnerable, easy prey for bandits and marauders. And then one day a stranger comes to town.
 A location scout, as it happens; his posse brings cameras and contracts. The mythology of the West and the new medium of movies were made for each other, but the marriage between them may have had, at least at first, as much to do with technological and geographical serendipity as it did with any deeper cultural affinity. As motion-picture technology developed in the last decades of the 19th century -- 1895 is accepted as the official birth date, in Paris and New Jersey, of cinema as we more or less know it -- its progenitors needed, above all, large moving objects to take pictures of. Like, say, horses and trains. Horses hold a special place in the pioneering motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge; among the first publicly projected films was the Lumiere Brothers' ''Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat.'' Mash them up -- combine the iron horse with its flesh-and-blood analogue -- and you might get something like ''The Great Train Robbery,'' directed by Edwin S. Porter, which appeared in 1903 and which is often cited as the first movie western.
 That description has been challenged by some recent scholarship. The film theorist Rick Altman, in ''Film/Genre,'' sees Porter's film not as a western but as ''a combination of travel and crime genres.'' It was only over the course of the next decade, he argues, that the word ''western'' went from ''a geographical adjective, designating a favored location for films of various types'' to ''a loosely defined film genre capitalizing on public interest in the American West.'' In the earliest days of commercial cinema, exhibitors and advertisers described their wares as ''cowboy pictures,'' ''Wild West films'' or ''westerns melodramas'' (or comedies of romances). The West represented a setting and a style rather than a theme or a set of narrative conventions. The selling point, frequently, was a vicarious journey to an actual place. Altman reproduces a 1911 ad in Moving Picture News, purchased by a Chicago-based company, promising ''real western pictures made in the land of the cowpuncher.'' 
 By then the ''western picture,'' replete with hoofs and rails, cowboys and Indians, had become a staple (and already, to some, a cliche) of the nascent film industry. It is hardly coincidental that in the intervening years the industry's center of gravity shifted toward California. The topography of greater Los Angeles, a parched and underdeveloped railroad depot at the time of the 1890 census, turned out to be ideally well suited to stories of gunslingers and cowpokes. There were -- and still are -- plenty of buttes, arroyos and dusty trails in, for instance, Griffith Park, which lies within the city limits and is a short excursion from the studio lots. In places like Burbank and Malibu, the studios built ranches and ready-made ghost towns, whose saloons and feed stores were in nearly constant use from the silent era well into the age of television.
 And, of course, the more ambitious filmmakers ranged farther, to Utah and Arizona, to Monument Valley and the high Sierras. And just as the gunfights, fisticuffs and chases on horseback fed the audience's appetite for action, so did the vistas of mountains and desert satisfy a desire for grandeur and sublimity. This was especially true in the 1950s, when the screen widened, the images shifted from black and white to color and westerns enjoyed not only popularity but a measure of prestige. But even before Technicolor and CinemaScope expanded the visual horizons of the western -- developments that, in the view of some critics, spelled the end of the genre's classical phase -- it had established itself as a powerful and adaptable kind of landscape film. 
 So adaptable, indeed, that Sergio Leone could substitute Spain for the American Southwest and put soldiers from Franco's army in the uniforms of the U.S. Cavalry when he reinvented the genre in the 1960s. By then, though, the historical romance that had provided the western with its basic narrative and thematic materials was in crisis, and the genre had entered a terminal phase of decadence, self-critique and obsolescence.
 The reasons for this are by now as encrusted in legend as the old tales of Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid. In the late 1940s and '50s -- the golden age of ''The Searchers'' and ''Rio Bravo,'' of ''Winchester 73'' and ''High Noon'' and ''Shane'' -- the western was the allegorical mirror of cold-war America. A cracked, flawed and shadowed mirror, to be sure, full of darkness and anxiety as well as gumption and optimism. In any case, it was shattered by the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, the sexual revolution, the rise of the counterculture -- all of the usual forces that supposedly put an end to American innocence.
 LOOKING BACK at those movies today, however, you notice that the rumors of their naivete were greatly exaggerated. It has become fashionable to locate political and sexual subtexts beneath their plain-spoken surfaces, but the subtexts were there from the start. And so was an ideological framework far more supple and complex than a simple celebration of conquest and domination or of rugged, square-jawed manhood.
 The archetypal western hero is a complicated figure, and the world he inhabits is a place of flux and contradiction. At the end, the stranger rides off into the wilderness, since the civilization he has helped to save holds no permanent place for him. His departure is also a promise of return, both for the star who plays him -- John Wayne, Randolph Scott, Clint Eastwood -- and, more profoundly, for the archetype he embodies, an archetype much older than the movies. This solitary, self-sufficient, often morally ambiguous figure -- a man of violence with a shadowy background and a haunted look in his eyes -- can trace his literary parentage back to Leatherstocking, the peripatetic hero of James Fenimore Cooper's novels of 18th-century frontier adventure. 
 Cooper's doughty, densely written books, whose readers nowadays are mainly graduate students in American studies, look back on a society in transition, captured at a moment when a rough, provisional way of life is giving way to something more stable, more modern. Leatherstocking is a kind of midwife of this transition from wildness to civilization, adept in the ways of both worlds but at home in neither. In the world of Cooper's books, he helps the advance of European settlement across the Alleghenies and the Mississippi, but wherever he goes, the arc of the story is more or less the same, and it always contains a note of ambivalence. Modernity may be inevitable and desirable, but it comes at a price. The wilderness will be cut down and cultivated; the original inhabitants will be dispossessed; and an element of romance will be lost.
 In the classic westerns, which take place on the other side of the Continental Divide, in the wake of the divisive agony of the Civil War, the story repeats itself again and again. The railroad is coming; the Indians are being driven off and decimated; the new sheriff is cleaning up the town; the open range is being parceled out, fenced in and sold off. The bearers of civilization and its discontents arrive in ever greater numbers: mothers and children, bankers and lawyers, senators, land speculators and movie producers. The western is thus both conservative and progressive, mourning the passing of that older, rougher, simpler society even as it acknowledges the inevitability of the new one.
 Beyond that, the best westerns use the backdrop of an unsettled, transitional but intimately familiar society -- familiar because the audience had by now been steeped in the tropes and archetypes of the West -- to pose stark and often difficult ethical questions: What is the relationship between vengeance and justice? When is violence necessary, and how should it be regulated? To whom is loyalty owed? How do you recognize a good man, or a good woman, when you see one? These questions are dramatized with speed, economy and in what seem like an infinite set of variations on a few sturdy themes. 
 AT LEAST THEY used to be. Occasionally, as in some of the films of Sam Peckinpah, Clint Eastwood's ''Unforgiven,'' Ang Lee's ''Ride With the Devil'' or Tommy Lee Jones's ''Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,'' these questions are revisited with some of the old seriousness and force. But mostly, to the extent the western survives, it has become a vehicle for sentimentality, cynicism and pastiche. Original and powerful visions may result -- consider ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' or ''Deadwood'' -- but their power often comes from their self-conscious opposition to the old models. 
 Or for a longing to retrieve them. Taken together, Hollywood's latest westerns -- ''3:10 to Yuma,'' a remake of a 1957 movie directed by Delmer Daves, and ''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,'' an adaptation of a novel by Ron Hansen -- provide an exemplary compendium of the range of styles and themes that the term ''western'' encompasses. The former is mean, fast and full of violent action, while the latter strikes a more melancholy, meditative tone (and runs for more than two and a half hours). ''Yuma'' takes place in the canonical historical and geographical space of the classic post-World War II horse operas: Arizona territory in the early 1870s, an area crawling with Civil War veterans, angry Apaches, stage-coach robbers and hard-pressed ranchers. ''Jesse James'' moves back East and forward in time, to Missouri and Kentucky -- with a narratively superfluous, cinematically essential detour into the Rocky Mountains -- in 1882. (''Yuma,'' with louder gunplay and flashier publicity, was a modest hit at the box office, while the elegiac ''Jesse James'' languished in art-house limbo, attracting fervent critical support in some quarters but not much in the way of public ardor.)
 Of course, the two movies also have a certain amount in common: guns, horses, stylized dialogue meant to evoke some notion of 19th-century speech and, at the center of each tale, a charismatic outlaw demanding (and defying) punishment. The films also share a notable detail. In each, a young man is obsessed with the principal outlaw -- Pitt's Jesse James and Crowe's Ben Wade -- whose notoriety has made him the subject of dime novels and mass-produced engravings. The young admirer diligently collects these and pores over them with proto-fanboy zeal, fantasizing about growing up to be just like his idol.
 A measure of disillusionment follows, but these collections of cheaply printed books and pictures are as significant for what they say about the movies' idea of the West as for what they reveal about the motives of particular characters. ''3:10 to Yuma'' and ''The Assassination of Jesse James'' are intensely self-conscious about the accumulated mythology of the Old West, which in their accounts began to accumulate even when the West was still old and wild. The folks who populate these stories, in other words, are to some extent aware of the significance, the legendary resonance of the stories they are living. They understand that they are living not just in the West but also in a western. And so the films become, in a way, elegies for themselves. Their sophistication manifests itself, curiously, in a will to become naive, to restore a kind of direct, innocent perspective on the West that they half-admit was a fantasy all along. 
 But the western has not so much died as fragmented: the solitary man of action remains a staple of, well, action movies; the romance of the past is projected back onto the 20th century rather than the one before; the villains and heroes come from the world of urban crime rather than the hinterland. Meanwhile, the western itself is no longer the quintessential American genre but rather a global style, feeding an endless cross-pollination of genres and motifs. In postwar Japan, the cowboy turned into a samurai, who lent some of his attitudes to Leone's spaghetti heroes. And these days, six-guns, horses and tales of honor, vengeance and righteous bloodletting flourish in places as far-flung as Poland (with Piotr Uklanski's ultraviolent ''Summer Love''), Thailand (Wisit Sasanatieng's delirious ''Tears of the Black Tiger'') and Australia (John Hillcoat's ''Proposition'').
 And yet at the same time back home, the West survives as an endlessrepository of stories and images, and the western may be reverting, curiously enough, from noun to adjective. The landscape is still there, more precious and fragile than ever, and always ready to lend its sublimity to film. The Texas borderlands of Joel and Ethan Coen's ''No Country for Old Men,'' adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel; the Wyoming of Ang Lee's ''Brokeback Mountain''; the prairies, jagged canyons and Alaskan peaks of Sean Penn's ''Into the Wild'' -- none of these films are, strictly speaking, westerns, but they are all unmistakably Western. A Western noir, a Western weepie, a Western road picture. (In this context, the fastidiously made ''Assassination of Jesse James'' and the dutifully remade ''3:10 to Yuma'' might be thought of as Western westerns.)
 This is not only because of their locations but also because there is something in those vistas, and the way human figures stand out against them, that almost effortlessly evokes the history and mythology we know from all those other, older movies. And so with the frontier a distant memory, its former territory studded with sprawl suburbs and tourist ranches, we're still scanning the horizon, waiting for that stranger to ride back into town.

HEADLINE: Two Become First-Time Council Members

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE STUART

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 THE day after Election Day, the phone kept ringing at La Paloma Sabanera, a coffee house and bookstore owned by Luis E. Cotto.
 The callers congratulated Mr. Cotto on being one of two candidates from the Working Families Party to capture two minority-party vacancies on the City Council; the other was Larry Deutsch, a pediatrician at a community health center in Willimantic. 
 Now, Mr. Cotto said, he would no longer be known as just the ''coffee-pourer.'' 
 Being elected to the council, he said, meant his opinion carried a little more weight than it did before. And even though he will not be sworn in until January, he wasted no time getting down to business. 
 Mr. Cotto, 40, dressed in khaki shorts and a ''Late Nite With Conan O'Brien'' T-shirt, said he had spoken with Mayor Eddie A. Perez on Wednesday morning -- the day after Mr. Perez's re-election -- about another Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in the city. Mr. Cotto said making the city a little more ''immigrant-friendly'' was a priority, and he said that with his newly found influence, he was able to coordinate a meeting between the police chief and Brazilian residents to discuss the raids. 
 The Working Families Party ran three candidates for City Council, the first time it had done so in the state's third-largest city. Hartford is now the largest city in the state with an elected representative from the party. Mr. Cotto and Dr. Deutsch will join six Democrats and one Republican on the nine-member council. 
 Mr. Cotto said that not being part of the two-party system had helped their campaign. ''Nobody disliked us, and a lot of people wanted to see us succeed,'' he said.
 Jon Green, the executive director of the Working Families Party in Connecticut, said that having two members on the city council would give the party a bully pulpit to be able to bring change not only at the local level, but also at the state level, where many of the changes the party is pushing for need to be made. 
 The Working Families Party, which started in the state in 2002, is dedicated to fighting for social and economic justice. While it has not elected anyone to the State Legislature, its candidates have received more than 1 percent of the vote in many statewide elections, allowing the party to endorse candidates of other parties.
 Dr. Deutsch, 62, said the party's agenda included the right to quality health care and a living wage. ''We got on the council to move these issues forward,'' he said. 
 He said regular working people were often ignored in the Democratic-controlled city, and ''we're not hesitant to advocate on their behalf.'' 
 One of their first actions as councilmen will be to elect a new council president to a two-year term. The incumbent, John Bazzano, did not seek re-election. 
 Looming over their choice are two criminal investigations involving Mr. Perez. If he were forced to leave office, the council president would become mayor. 
 Mr. Perez is being investigated by the chief state's attorney's office for hiring a city contract to remodel his home and for awarding a no-bid parking contract to a political ally. No charges have been filed in either case, and Mr. Perez has apologized for hiring the city contractor. 
 Mr. Cotto said that when he votes for council president, he would not consider the possibility that that person could become mayor, but would vote for the best person for the job.

HEADLINE: Seven Sketches, From a Skewed Eye

BYLINE: By NAOMI SIEGEL

 BODY:
Advertised as ''seven madcap comedies'' for the price of one, ''Mere Mortals'' delivers far fewer laughs than that billing might suggest. 
 An evening of short -- make that very short -- plays by David Ives, it is more a compendium of varyingly successful comic sketches than anything approaching full-blown comedy. Presented by the Two River Theater Company in Red Bank, the 90-minute production is energetically directed by KJ Sanchez and perkily acted by a talented cast. But, as strung together by Ms. Sanchez, it remains a somewhat ill-fitting necklace in which the plastic baubles outnumber the gems.
 Mr. Ives looks at the world with a refreshingly skewed eye. Things are not quite as they seem, and much gets lost in translation. A disconnect between what is, what might be and what surely never was looms large in these vignettes, several of which depend upon strained riffs on language and identity for their comic punch. 
 The first and most fluid of the sketches involves a chance encounter between a young woman (Ericka Kreutz) seated at an outdoor cafe reading Faulkner, and a young man (Glenn Peters) passing by. In the style of a quiz show, a dinging bell separates a list of questions and their several possible answers. (She: ''What college?'' He: ''Oral Roberts.'' She: ''What college?'' He: ''Just kidding. Never went. I love to party.'' She: ''What college?'' He: ''Harvard.''). The two move from being strangers to sharing their passions for early Woody Allen and Entenmann's crumb cake to discussing how many children they want. Ding!
 Segue to the next mildly amusing but overly familiar bit concerning three chimps named Kafka, Milton and Swift (Ms. Kreutz, Raymond McAnally and Ariel Shafir). Locked in a cage with typewriters, the chimps are being observed to see how long it will take them to produce ''Hamlet.'' Most of the humor here comes from the simian movements of Mr. Shafir as he shimmies and swings around the cage in defiance of his ''exploiters.''
 ''Moby Dude'' has a supercool Mr. Shafir (''Call me Ishmael, dude'') expounding on his summer reading assignment to his skeptical teacher, Mrs. Pigorsky, culminating in a two-minute, run-on synopsis of the entire tome. In ''Arabian Nights,'' a tourist shopping for last-minute souvenirs (Mr. Peters) is waylaid by Mr. McAnally playing a local tour guide/con man who interjects himself as a translator for a not-so-innocent shop girl with an agenda (Ms. Kreutz).
 The final two sketches involve a quirky variation of identity theft. The first, ''Mere Mortals,'' finds three construction workers having lunch high above the city (Jennifer Zeyl's scaffolded setting proves wonderfully versatile). A discussion of plans to go bowling turns bizarre as each man reveals the historic antecedent he carries as his own secret persona. The second, ''Degas C'est Moi,'' introduces an ordinary guy (Mr. McAnally) who wakes up determined to be Edgar Degas for a day. Unrecognized as he makes his way from the unemployment office to the local OTB parlor (Degas loved horses) to the library to the Twin Donut store, he is forced to accept the loneliness of anonymity.
 Ms. Sanchez has attempted to provide catchy entr'acte segues in the form of interludes that spoof inspirational pop music. It's hard to know whether to laugh or groan at these extended fillers. Then again, yawning might be an option.
 ''Mere Mortals'' is at Two River Theater Company, 21 Bridge Avenue, Red Bank, through Nov. 18. Information: (732) 345-1400 or www.trtc.org.

HEADLINE: For the Love Of the Game

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
For years, they have operated in the shadows of Manhattan. With names like Straddle, the Fairview, Playstation and the New York Players Club, they are remarkably well organized, but nonetheless illegal: poker clubs that attract thousands of players at all hours of the day and night.
 The players run the gamut, from cabdrivers to retired accountants, with a remarkably large contingent of young, well-paid professionals -- people who consider themselves law-abiding citizens and play only for the love of the calculated bluff or the well-played wager.
 Their numbers have grown swiftly as poker has vaulted into the spotlight of American pop culture. Texas Hold 'Em tournaments compete for prime-time TV viewers, and the image of the dimly lighted, vaguely sinister poker game has claimed a favored spot in movies. (In a current thriller, ''Michael Clayton,'' George Clooney first appears on the screen as an emotionally taut player in a back-room poker club in Chinatown.) 
 In reality, Manhattan's players are part of a secretive network of ''members,'' who can join games only after being vouched for by others. Once they are in, they make their way to small, unremarkable office buildings, passing security guards hired solely to protect the club, and enter a clean, well-lighted world of civilized, even businesslike gamesmanship, according to several players who were interviewed. Most agreed to speak only if their names were not disclosed because they did not want to attract the attention of the police.
 ''I have never seen anything like a criminal element,'' said one, a 29-year-old producer for one of Manhattan's best known broadcasting companies who has been a regular in the poker clubs for five years. ''It more closely resembles a retirement home bridge party.''
 But that was hardly the atmosphere at 11 p.m. on Nov. 2, when armed robbers in masks forced their way into a crowded club called the City Limit that had been operating for less than two weeks in a seventh-floor office, above a gym, a graphics business and a real estate office, in an unadorned building at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue. One player, Frank DeSena, a former math professor from New Jersey who was a familiar and well-liked presence on the poker club scene, was killed by an intruder's shotgun.
 There have been no arrests in the case, and the police have declined to confirm published reports that the robbers pointed a gun at the head of a security guard to gain entry, and accidentally fired the shot that killed Mr. DeSena. 
 The killing led to an obvious conclusion -- that armed criminals knew the location of at least one supposedly secret club -- and sent tremors through the closed circle of Manhattan players and club operators.
 ''A week ago, there were two or three rooms operating in Manhattan, but now there are zero,'' said Steven McLoughlin, a poker aficionado who moderates a poker discussion at twoplustwo.com and closely follows the Manhattan club scene. ''You don't know what can happen.''
 A former employee of Playstation, which was one of the largest of the Manhattan clubs until it was closed in a police raid in 2005, said the killing of Mr. DeSena was ''the kind of thing we always feared the most. People are really shaken, and this may make them think differently'' about going to the clubs.
 Nevertheless, it has attracted broad interest in a semisecret world that seems filled with contrasts: responsible adults slipping into clandestine locations like spies in the night, poker stakes of hundreds or thousands of dollars routinely won and lost in an atmosphere of warm conviviality, over pizza, and even milk and cookies, according to the players.
 Of course, the profile offered by those who were interviewed in recent days may not fit all underground poker games in the city. High-stakes games in which some players cannot afford to lose, and could be threatened with physical violence if they do not make good on their losses, have historically been part of the gambling underworld and are unlikely to have faded completely from the scene. But the players interviewed said that the Manhattan clubs they frequented for years adhered to an almost universal set of rules: no liquor or drugs are allowed, no bets are accepted on credit, and no one is allowed to play without passing muster among fellow players and being granted membership, sometimes with a fee.
 ''There are regulars who probably spend too much time in these places, and that is sad to see,'' said the broadcast producer. In his five years of experience, he said, there were about five clubs operating in Manhattan at any given time, and he had played at a total of 10, in commercial buildings on the Upper West Side, Midtown, Chelsea, the Flatiron District, the East Village and the West Village.
 ''But the overwhelming majority are not compulsive gamblers,'' he said. ''They do this as a way of blowing off steam, and that is healthier than sitting in front of the TV.''
 Under state law, the operators and employees of the clubs can be arrested, but not the players. The law makes it illegal to ''advance or profit from illegal gambling,'' even if the operators do not take a cut of the winnings. They can be guilty simply by providing rented space as a poker club.
 Police crackdowns have been periodic in New York City and across the region. On Wednesday night, officers shut down poker parlors in seven towns in Suffolk County, and seized more than $10,000 in cash.
 On May 27, 2005, police officers in Manhattan shut down two clubs: Playstation, at 4-6 West 14th Street, and the New York Players Club, at 200 West 72nd Street. Each of the clubs had more than 100 players in attendance when the police arrived, and 39 employees, including dealers, waiters and security guards, were arrested.
 But the police acknowledged at the time that they found no weapons, alcohol or drugs in the two clubs. At the New York Players Club, customers were offered valet parking. At Playstation, club waiters were serving Oreo and Chips Ahoy! cookies. The police said both clubs were incorporated businesses that followed fire codes.
 The former employee of Playstation had worked at the club for three years, was covered by employee health insurance, paid taxes and was entitled to unemployment compensation after the club closed.
 The people interviewed for this article would not say who sponsors and operates the Manhattan clubs, but insisted that there was no hint of involvement by organized crime. They said operators tended to be devoted poker players themselves, who rented office space and opened their clubs largely out of a love of the game and their friendships with other players.
 In most cases, players said, they pay the operators based on the time they spend at a table. Few, if any, of the operators claim a portion of the poker winnings. ''You sit at the table and every half-hour, or maybe every hour, a bell goes off meaning that everybody has to pay their rent,'' said the producer. A typical charge, he said, was $8 an hour.
 Despite the enthusiasm of players and their vigorous defense of the clubs, they said it remained to be seen how much of a chill would result from the recent killing. They said the sense of outrage among many players was heightened because Mr. DeSena, 55, was a popular player on the poker circuit.
 ''Frank was a poster child for the type of person they try to attract,'' Mr. McLoughlin said. ''He was a sweetheart of a man who always wanted to say hello to everybody, always wanted to shake everybody's hand.''
 ''He was a skilled player, and when he lost a hand, he would simply smile,'' Mr. McLoughlin said.
 The former employee of Playstation said the episode seemed certain to keep players away for some time to come: ''Maybe two years from now people will forget about it and come back. But I'm not a gambler myself, and who knows, maybe they'll be back sooner than that.''

HEADLINE: Industrial Strength in the Motor City

BYLINE: By HILARIE M. SHEETS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
 THE flux in Detroit's fortunes over the last century is starkly mirrored in its world-class Beaux Arts-style museum, built in the 1920s by a cultural elite flush with money and eager for a grandly scaled downtown district. 
 Much of that wealth, of course, sprang from the automobile industry, which had attracted a huge, diverse work force -- blacks and whites alike from the South, and Eastern European, Lebanese and Greek immigrants, among others -- to the city that swelled in population sixfold in the first half of the 20th century. 
 This history is embedded in Diego Rivera's renowned frescoes ''Detroit Industry'' (1932-33) at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Rivera, the Mexican muralist, considered them his best work. Commissioned by Edsel Ford, then the president of the Ford Motor Company and a prominent art patron, the Rivera murals celebrated workers as the engine of assembly-line production -- of cars as well as weapons, airplanes, chemicals and vaccines -- in a cycle of frescoes covering four walls of an interior courtyard. 
 Yet what was harmonious in the murals -- laborers of all races working in unison for the good of industry -- was far less so in reality. And over time the racial tensions in Detroit, climaxing in the riots of 1967, profoundly altered the urban landscape. So did the building of highways in the 1950s and 1960s that bisected neighborhoods and hastened the exodus of businesses and middle-class families from downtown to sprawling suburban enclaves. Detroit has never fully recovered.
 For the artist Julie Mehretu, who grew up largely in East Lansing, Mich., the Detroit Institute of Arts and other vintage downtown landmarks have the cast of magnificent relics. 
 ''For me the issues that come up with Detroit -- as this Modernist city that is in many ways abandoned or erased, all the changes it's gone through and the very different kinds of communities that have affected that -- are really interesting,'' she said in an interview at her studio in New York. 
 Today the institute is in the process of unerasing itself. On Nov. 23 it is to reopen to the public after a $158 million expansion by the architect Michael Graves. Curators are reinstalling the museum's encyclopedic collection, remolding the way the public experiences the art in the hope of attracting new visitors. 
 In tandem with the opening the museum invited Ms. Mehretu, 36, to address Detroit in some way by creating work for galleries adjacent to the Rivera frescoes. 
 She produced five new paintings, joined by seven other recent Mehretu works called ''City Sitings.'' ''Diego's murals also deal with these issues -- in a very different time -- of what Detroit was,'' Ms. Mehretu said. ''That overlap and conversation make it an exciting place to do a show.''
 Ms. Mehretu's personal history is entwined with the exhibition as well. Born in Ethiopia to an American mother and Ethiopian father who is an economic geographer, she lived the immigrant's experience when her family moved in the late 1970s to East Lansing for her father's teaching position at Michigan State University. She was 7 years old.
 ''Detroit was where we went for everything, including all those hours of waiting for my father to go through the green card process,'' Ms. Mehretu said. She remembers visiting the Detroit Institute when she was very young and trying to make sense of big Color Field paintings as well as Rivera's murals, which she found then to be very surreal and ornate. 
 ''At that time there were was nothing else going on in that area around the museum,'' she said. ''This big beautiful Beaux Arts building was on a street with abandoned stuff and homeless people. It was a really different image than going to the Art Institute in Chicago in its bustling, active context.'' 
 Ms. Mehretu simultaneously layers the personal and the universal, the local and the global, in the maplike language of her recent paintings. ''I'm really interested in the nondefinitive element of abstraction,'' she said. ''It never is a black-and-white situation.'' 
 The starting point for her new paintings in ''City Sitings'' was architectural plans of fortified cities throughout history. For the largest work, ''Black City,'' at one end of the show, Ms. Mehretu layered drawings of structures from those in early Japan and Mesopotamia to Hitler's Atlantic Wall bunkers along the French coast. 
 While she doesn't expect viewers necessarily to identify all of the elements in her paintings, they form what she calls their DNA and affect how they develop. 
 For her the fortress mentality is vital to understanding not just urban history but contemporary social problems as well. ''I was thinking of this instinctual response to being attacked, the reactionary response to immigrant labor,'' Ms. Mehretu said. ''I'm interested in looking backwards in time, and putting the United States' behavior in the world right now and the coming together of the European Union as a fortress in a context and history of behavior.'' In her paintings she also considers her ''self-ethnography'' within a communal context. ''It's also looking back at who you are as an individual,'' she said. ''You're not just this person who's from your own specific experiences, but the collective experience of what makes you who you are because of time.''
 On top of the architectural layers in ''Black City,'' as she typically does in her paintings, Ms. Mehretu drew flocks of small abbreviated marks. For her, they operate socially, as surrogates for people or communities; they move in collective trajectories toward the center and then erupt back out. 
 She continually erased and redrew, a process that left ghosts of activity and a dark haze of ruins at the center. ''I was interested in how the mark making really breaks down the fortifications, a house of cards effect,'' said Ms. Mehretu, who chose the title to suggest the bleak mood and security preparations stance of cities preoccupied by terrorism. 
 She conceded that the title also had inescapable racial connotations. ''Race always comes up in the conversation of Detroit,'' she said. Today, she noted, the Detroit area has the largest Arab population in the country and thus is a focus of surveillance. 
 Class is also a major theme. Though economic growth has eluded Detroit in recent decades, ''you still have the masses of working communities, the people that Rivera was so interested in,'' she noted. ''They are the ones keeping Detroit however vital it is as a city.''
 While the metaphoric picture of Detroit in ''Black City'' is one bookend for the show, the other end is dominated by Ms. Mehretu's three ''Stadia'' canvases from 2004, first shown at the Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh. For these she used the architecture of stadiums throughout history as the conceptual underpinning. On top of that she layered clusters of dark marks in centrifugal formations as well as brilliantly colored elements of flags from every nation. 
 She likes the resonance this takes on in Detroit, where new stadiums for the Lions football and Tigers baseball teams have stimulated an ebb and flow from the suburbs and pockets of revitalization. 
 ''I was interested in the stadium as a place for sport or entertainment and in the spectacle of nationalistic frenzy,'' she said.''But there are many other ways those stadiums were used.'' She cited examples like the national stadium in Santiago, Chile, which was used for executions after Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military coup in 1973 and the Superdome in New Orleans, a place of refuge and suffering in days after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. 
 ''This kind of container can hold us, yet it can break down very easily, like when people get smothered to death in the intensity of the crowd,'' she reflected. ''You can feel that tension, and that's part of what makes the stadium so exciting. We've always had that type of arena as part of who we are.'' 
 For Rebecca Hart, a curator at the institute, the themes of spectacle and competition in the ''Stadia'' panels reverberate with the Rivera murals. Rivera carefully studied Ford's River Rouge plant, where spectators could watch the final assembly of cars; on the south wall of his mural cycle he included a crowd in the public viewing gallery hovering over the workers. 
 ''Julie restates certain themes in Rivera's work in very contemporary terms,'' said Ms. Hart, who organized ''City Sitings'' with Kinsey Katchka, a curator at the North Carolina Museum of Art, where the show will travel next summer after a stop at the Williams College Museum of Art in Massachusetts. 
 ''Rivera says in very typical midcentury terms that we come to America and lose our ethnic identities to become Americans,'' Ms. Hart added. ''Julie states that we all come with our constituent identities, and we retain them as we work together and compete in a global arena.'' 
 As part of ''City Sitings,'' Ms. Mehretu is leading a monthlong residency program with 40 art students from Detroit public high schools. She introduced them to the work of a variety of contemporary artists, emphasizing their unique expressions, or marks. Then she assigned the students to develop art objects with marks of their own. 
 They also toured the city with Ms. Mehretu, an architectural historian and a local artist to learn about how buildings and public spaces have changed over the decades and attended a lecture on Rivera as a visionary thinker about social change. This week the students are to present their finished projects to Ms. Mehretu and see her paintings for the first time. 
 Ms. Mehretu, who worked with high school girls from East Africa in 2003 during a residency at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, said she felt strongly about encouraging students to develop their own voices and providing them with a model of a successful working artist. 
 That was something she never had growing up. ''I always wanted to be an artist, but I didn't really know how someone could make a life out it,'' she said. ''If you grew up in a big city around other artists, you could probably envision that in a different way. 
 ''The art world is so focused on these major centers, but there's a very different viewing public at the D.I.A. It's really important to me to do a show in Detroit.''

HEADLINE: A Resource for the 'Other Westchester'

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI. 
E-mail: westweek@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Valhalla 

 BODY:
 IN most ways, it was a typical groundbreaking ceremony, with local dignitaries in hard hats posing with shiny new shovels. The speeches, the posing for pictures, were all de rigueur.
 But while they were there to hail the beginning of construction of Westchester Community College's Gateway Center, designed primarily to serve the county's immigrant population, the ceremony symbolized more than a new building. It also reflects the county's rapidly changing face.
 There's no shortage of debate about immigration today, but you can't argue with the demographic facts. Hispanics make up 15.6 percent of Westchester's population. In Port Chester and Sleepy Hollow, almost half the residents are Hispanic, while in Mount Kisco and Elmsford, a quarter are. Immigrants represent one fifth or more of the residents in the cities of Yonkers, White Plains, Peekskill and New Rochelle. 
 These numbers are based on the 2000 census; they will surely rise in 2010, in the next census. They also reflect only Hispanic residents living here; people from countries outside Latin America flock to Westchester, too. Twenty-two of every 100 Westchester residents were born in another country.
 How many are documented, and how many are not? The federal, state and county governments cannot give you an accurate answer; neither can I. One thing certain is that while immigration law is federal policy, there isn't an aspect of life in this county that remains unaffected by it, including schools, hospitals, shelters and law enforcement. 
 Immigration affects the community college as much as any other local institution, if not more. The college teaches more than 4,000 students English as a second language; classrooms are overflowing, and parking lots are jammed on weekends. The college also offers English classes at many of its extension centers, including in Ossining, Port Chester, New Rochelle and Yonkers.
 The college has long had a policy of ''don't ask, don't tell'' when it comes to undocumented immigrants, said Joseph N. Hankin, president of the college. He believes the new center, which is meant to provide immigrants with a comprehensive opportunity to learn about America's language, history, economy and social make-up, is in keeping with the school's mission.
 ''There are two Westchesters,'' he said. ''There is the one homogeneously affluent stereotype, and the other is that there is a large group of individuals who are not being educated. We serve and intend to serve the other Westchester, the one where students wouldn't go on to college if it weren't for us.''
 The center's Language Institute will offer academic content, so anyone studying English can at the same time learn computer language. All the college's academic business programs will be housed at Gateway, as well as a professional development center that will serve businesses and students.
 There will be space for volunteers to help immigrants practice language skills. Services will be offered for students interested in becoming citizens or permanent residents. The center also hopes to become a clearinghouse for the many local organizations now working with immigrants.
 Isabel Villar, executive director of El Centro Hispano in White Plains, which helps immigrant families, looks forward to working with the center. ''I arrived here without any knowledge of English,'' said Ms. Villar, a native of Cuba. ''I'm grateful the college has the vision to fight for the most crucial gift anyone can give: an education.''
 Demographic trends made the project a natural, Dr. Hankin said. Not only is there a swell of immigration, but as baby boomers retire, the need for a trained workforce will expand. ''Wayne Gretzky said, 'You don't skate to where the puck is; you skate to where it's going to be,''' Dr. Hankin said.
 New York State has committed $17 million for the building, the county has pledged $14 million, and $9 million has been raised from private sources. The county executive, Andrew J. Spano, was one of the shovel-wielding dignitaries. His administration, of course, deals with the fallout from federal immigration law at nearly every level.
 ''We've got 750 people on probation who are illegal immigrants; 235 are felons,'' Mr. Spano said. ''I can't get rid of them. So what am I going to do with someone who wants to work? We're going to help. A sick kid who comes into a clinic? We're going to help. Someone who wants an education? We're going to help them. We can't solve the immigration problem, so I've chosen to help manage it.''

HEADLINE: Time to Move on a Hudson Tunnel

 BODY:
It sounds absurd, but the only passenger rail tunnel that crosses under the Hudson River to New York was built a century ago. It has two tracks, one coming and one going, shared by two very busy railroads, Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. Capacity is limited, delays are frequent. Something clearly must be done to supplement what is, after all, an essential lifeline to the nation's largest city. 
 Redundancy is key: a major breakdown in that tunnel could deal a blow not only to many thousands of commuters and other passengers but the regional economy as a whole.
 Fortunately, this oversight is on its way to being corrected. Even as it takes on a host of other projects, the Port Authority has been pushing a second two-track tunnel, called the ''Access to the Region's Core,'' or ARC. The project was championed by Gov. Jon Corzine when he was in the United States Senate, and has the support of Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
 The project will require about $8 billion, roughly half of which has been secured, with $2 billion coming from the Port Authority. Creative financing, including borrowing from New Jersey federal highway aid that had been targeted for congestion relief, has yielded another $1 billion..
 This is all money well spent. Now Congress needs to do its part by finding and committing the remaining funds. The tunnel is an extremely sound investment. And the need could not be more urgent.
 If the plan goes forward, rail passenger capacity would double. New Jersey travelers would get a one-seat ride to Midtown Manhattan, instead of having to transfer, as many now do. Commuting times would be reduced. .
 New York is among the nation's most vibrant areas, a veritable cash cow for regional governments, but its economy will not continue to grow as long as its transportation infrastructure stays where it is. The limits on passenger rail hit hardest where growth has been fastest, west of the Hudson, where population is expected to increase 72 percent in the next quarter century.
 Getting across the Hudson frustrates nearly everyone. Ask the poor soul who has tried to come across from the Garden State through the Lincoln or Holland Tunnels, or over the George Washington Bridge, especially at rush hours. But the ARC could help there, too. Transit officials estimate that as many as 35,000 cars may come off the road as motorists choose the train. If true, that could reduce congestion and vehicle emissions.
 Critics complain that the tunnel will be at capacity from the minute it opens. That is probably true, which is all the more reason to push for a timely completion, now projected at 2016. The tunnel alone cannot fix the problems of moving in and out of the city, but it can help.

HEADLINE: Taint by Association

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
HENRY BLODGET, an author and former stock analyst, is a gifted writer whose work has appeared in The Times four times in the past two and a half years, most recently last month in a special business news section, DealBook.
 Blodget is also a man with a past. In 2003, he was permanently barred from the securities industry and fined $4 million for issuing fraudulent and misleading research reports on Internet stocks, violating federal laws.
 When, a little more than two years later, he wrote an Op-Ed article for The Times about the dot-com bubble, some readers objected. But Joe Nocera, a Times business columnist, came to Blodget's defense. ''I think it's time to give the guy a break,'' he said. What could be more American, he asked, than falling flat on your face and then reinventing yourself for the better? 
 Byron Calame, who was then the public editor, said he thought The Times had erred by identifying Blodget only as ''a former Wall Street analyst'' who ''writes frequently for Slate.'' It wasn't enough, Calame said, for Blodget to make a parenthetical aside in the article to ''an unfortunate theory of mine -- one that, along with some e-mails that caught the notice of the Securities and Exchange Commission, helped my Wall Street career go the way of eToys.''
 Calame's admonition went unheeded, because the next time Blodget appeared on the Op-Ed page, last December, defending huge bonuses at Goldman Sachs, he was still ''a former stock analyst'' and now ''the author of the forthcoming 'Wall Street Self-Defense Manual.''' Neither he nor The Times alluded to the rest of his history.
 In Blodget's latest article, the paper identified him as the author of his book and ''chief executive of Silicon Alley Insider,'' a blog. And Blodget was back to a parenthetical disclaimer: ''In 2003, regulators alleged that my bullishness stemmed from conflicts of interest and threw me out of the industry.''
 Andrew Ross Sorkin, the editor of DealBook, said he asked Blodget to write a comparison of the dot-com bubble to today's troubled stock market after chatting with him at a party and later discussing with colleagues whether it would be appropriate. Having lived through the market's dot-com collapse, Blodget ''has a pretty interesting perspective about the current environment,'' Sorkin said, adding that Blodget's blog is well read and taken seriously in the financial community.
 I think there are two questions here. One is whether The Times properly identifies Blodget when he writes for the paper. I don't think so. His name was big in financial news at one time, but many readers do not know him.
 The bigger question is whether The Times should be publishing him at all. Like Nocera, I believe in second chances, and Blodget seems to be doing fine establishing a new career. But why would The Times give a former analyst who lied to investors a platform to write about financial markets? If he wanted to write about how investors can spot phony reports by analysts, that would be one thing. But each time the newspaper uses Blodget as it has, it is conferring greater expert status on him.
 These deals work two ways. The Times's luster may help Blodget. But some of his taint rubs off on The Times.
 Rules for 'Questions'
 Sharp-eyed readers of The Times Magazine will note a small but important change in the standing feature ''Questions For,'' in which authors, political figures, entertainers and other interesting people answer provocative questions posed by Deborah Solomon.
 Last Sunday, a new tagline made its first appearance, under an interview with John Bolton, the former American ambassador to the United Nations. It said, ''Interview conducted, condensed and edited by Deborah Solomon.'' That's a signal, said Craig Whitney, the assistant managing editor in charge of maintaining Times standards, that ''Questions For'' is ''a little different from a straight news transcript.''
 Previously, the column was so different from a transcript that several subjects complained that their published interviews were distorted. They said some of their answers were preceded by questions they were not asked or that answers were not matched with the questions that elicited them.
 Whitney has now issued guidelines for ''Questions For'' and similar features, affirming what should have been longstanding practice.
 Q. and A. interviews can be ''drastically condensed,'' without indicating where words were left out. But every word in an answer has to be what was actually said, and, in condensing, the speaker's intent has to be preserved. Factual errors can be fixed. If someone says she met her husband in Poughkeepsie and it was really Kuala Lumpur, the correct fact can be substituted.
 The question preceding an answer has to be the one that prompted that answer, although context, such as a date or a title, can be inserted, even if it wasn't spoken. Several questions cannot be combined into one; questions can't be materially altered or otherwise distorted. But as long as they move together, questions and answers can be rearranged for narrative flow.
 Finally, you may recall that a tape of one disputed interview could not be found. Now, Solomon's interviews will be digitally recorded and preserved.
 A Disappointing Decision
 In August, I wrote about the unintended consequences of a Times business strategy to drive articles in its archive to the top of Internet search engine results. People continue to complain that long-buried information that is wrong, incomplete or just embarrassing is getting undue prominence because The Times wants its articles to be first when something is Googled.
 Whitney and the other top editors of The Times met recently to discuss the complaints. They agreed to only one change: If The Times wrote that someone was accused of a crime but never reported the outcome, a note will be put in the archive if there was an acquittal or the charges were dropped, as long as the person has documentary evidence. (As before, errors in the archive will be corrected, though not, as one reader requested recently, a date in an article from 1883.)
 I think the change is good but not enough. Editors are determined not to remove material from the archive, in effect sanitizing history, and I agree with that. But I think other steps could be taken. For one, the software that pushes material higher in Web searches can be used selectively, so that it doesn't affect some articles.
 Bill Keller, the executive editor, said he found that option ''a little creepy. It's going to exist, but we're going to hide it?'' That, he said, ''seems contrary to the vision of journalism.'' But I'm not sure what journalistic value is served by highlighting forever the nine-year-old arrest of a 22-year-old for possession of marijuana, as The Times does.
 I think The Times hasn't heard the last of this issue.
 Clarification
 I wasn't clear enough in last week's column about the steps The Times is taking to allow reader comment on articles on its Web site. New software has the capacity to allow comment on all articles, although editors are using it sparingly at first. Previously, The Times used old software occasionally to enable comments on a few articles but could not widely expand its use.

HEADLINE: Climbing Some Steps On the Pay Ladder

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED. 
E-mail: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE New York City government is helping Andre Franks and Makida Hall rise from the bottom rungs of the job ladder. And Mr. Franks and Ms. Hall are helping the city become more sure-footed in providing such aid.
 Mr. Franks, 23, of Manhattan, and Ms. Hall, 20, of the Bronx, are among 100 people enrolled in a pilot program begun by the Bloomberg administration in August to assess methods to help low-earning New Yorkers increase their wages, develop savings habits and plan for career advancement. 
 The program is aimed at expanding the free assistance that the city has been offering at its half-dozen employment aid sites, called Workforce1 Career Centers. That aid generally involves job counseling, training and placement services for the unemployed and for people facing layoffs or the closing of their companies; it is available without regard to an individual's economic status. 
 By contrast, the pilot effort seeks to help people who are securely employed but whose earnings are low, city officials say. Such people may be employed full time for little pay, which was Mr. Franks's situation, or may have part-time jobs because they could not find full-time work, Ms. Hall's former situation.
 Because the program, called EarnMore, is intended to help people obtain and retain higher-paying jobs, it offers assistance of longer duration than what is normally provided at the city's job centers, an administration official said.
 ''Our Workforce1 Career Centers focus on placing New Yorkers in jobs and follow up after six months to find out whether they are still employed,'' said Robert W. Walsh, the commissioner of the Department of Small Business Services, which oversees the centers. The EarnMore program, however, will work with its participants for two years, he said, so that it ''helps them build their skills, work toward promotions, grow their assets and access other government programs.''
 The program is open to city residents who have worked steadily for at least six months in full-time or part-time jobs paying no more than $14 an hour. Mr. Walsh's aides said they considered that figure appropriate for accommodating as many people as possible who have low weekly wages from part-time employment. 
 The pilot program aims to enroll up to 500 people by early spring. Information about applying is available through the city's 311 information line. 
 The program, run for the city by Seedco, a nonprofit organization, is part of an attempt by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to find new ways to reduce poverty. Information has not yet been compiled on how many of the 100 enrolled so far have moved into higher-paying work.
 Ms. Hall is among those who have. She first went to the Workforce1 center in Harlem early this year, hoping that it would help her find a full-time job. She had found work as a nanny, but that generally involved only 10 to 15 hours a week at $10 an hour.
 ''I attended a career workshop at the center and filled out job applications, but didn't get called,'' she said. ''I felt down because I thought I was getting nowhere.'' Then, early last month, while still in her part-time nanny job, she enrolled in EarnMore.
 The program referred her for full-time work preparing sandwiches and beverages at a Manhattan outlet of the Cosi restaurant chain, where she earns $9 an hour for a 40-hour week. 
 Her counselor -- or coach, in the program's language -- ''always calls, and I have to report back to him'' on job-related matters, she said.
 MR. FRANKS obtained a full-time job 15 months ago through the same Workforce1 center. It involved stocking shelves, making deliveries and operating the cash register at a Duane Reade drugstore in Manhattan. But it paid barely above the minimum wage. 
 Two months ago, while still holding that job, he enrolled in EarnMore. ''My coach showed me how the system works and gave me advice on how to approach management and move up in the company,'' Mr. Franks recalled.
 As a result of that advice, he said, he applied for training to become an assistant store manager, which pays $13 an hour, nearly double his current salary. He has completed the training and is awaiting the promotion, he said last week. 
 EarnMore, he said, ''opened my eyes to what I want to do in my job and in my life.''

HEADLINE: As Stagehands Strike, Shows Don't Go On

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Kate Hammer, C.J. Hughes and Mathew R. Warren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Most of Broadway was dark yesterday as stagehands went on strike over new work rules that producers have imposed or have been pushing during months of contentious negotiations.
 The stagehands took their picket signs to the wet sidewalks about 10 a.m. after a meeting of Local One, their union, at the Westin New York hotel on West 43rd Street.
 Twenty-seven Broadway shows, including ''Wicked,'' ''Jersey Boys'' and ''The Lion King,'' were shuttered, starting with ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical,'' which was to raise its curtain at 11 a.m. Eight shows playing in theaters that have separate contracts with the union remained open.
 The work stoppage not only crippled a $939 million industry, but also slowed the Midtown universe: the bars, the restaurants, the hotels, the souvenir stores and the pedicabs that serve the people who buy Broadway tickets -- more than 12 million of which were sold last year. 
 Yesterday's matinee traffic of tourists and theatergoers was thrown off balance, with busloads of students sitting unhappily outside ''The Color Purple,'' and nervous restaurant workers contemplating a night with no dinner rush. 
 ''Customers may show up, but they will be grumpy and won't tip well,'' said Laura Cosentino, as she stood on West 46th Street handing out menus for Rachel's, a theater district restaurant.
 The eight Broadway productions still running are ''Cymbeline,'' ''Mary Poppins,'' ''Mauritius,'' ''Pygmalion,'' ''The Ritz,'' ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,'' ''Xanadu'' and ''Young Frankenstein.'' 
 This is the second strike on Broadway in less than five years. The four-day musicians' walkout in 2003 was the first in almost three decades. But this is the first time Local One, a 121-year-old union, has called a strike on Broadway.
 The producers and the union last met on Thursday, the second of three negotiating sessions requested by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the parent union of Local One. 
 In a statement, Thomas C. Short, the president of the parent union, said the talks had been making progress when he left on Thursday afternoon.
 ''I am dismayed that just hours after my departure the employers made a 180-degree turn and began bargaining in a regressive manner,'' Mr. Short said in the statement. ''This action demonstrates a clear lack of will on the employers' part to reach an agreement.''
 Charlotte St. Martin, the executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade group representing the Broadway theaters, disputed that account. ''There was good dialogue between both of us,'' she said, ''but in effect their last and final offer budged very little.''
 But, she added, ''when we gave them our last offer we were ready, willing and able to negotiate the next day.'' She said the league was never notified about the strike.
 Yesterday morning, neither Local One nor its parent union had issued a comment, and outside of the union, seemingly no one was entirely sure a strike was going to happen. A long line of hopeful theatergoers had formed at the TKTS discount ticket booth, which was still listing available shows while the union was meeting.
 But at 10 a.m., stagehands took to the picket lines and started handing out fliers that read in part, ''Cuts in our jobs and wages will never result in a cut in ticket prices to benefit the public, but only an increase in the profits for producers.''
 Many members of the other Broadway unions, including Actors' Equity Association and Local 802, the musicians' union, hit the sidewalks in support of Local One; a tuba player and a trombonist played ''Solidarity Forever'' in front of the darkened Ambassador Theater.
 In a statement issued yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who provided an independent mediator during the 2003 musicians' strike, said that he had spoken to both the theater owners and the stagehands.
 ''While this is a private labor matter, the economic impact is very public and will be felt far beyond the theaters closed today,'' he said, adding that ''the city continues to stand ready to help in any way we can.'' 
 The 2003 strike, which lasted four days, cost the city about $7 million a day, city tourism officials said at the time.
 Yesterday, disappointed theatergoers were left facing darkened houses and the prospect of coming up with other options after their Broadway plans fell through. 
 Modify that. ''I would say a little bit more than disappointed,'' said Beverly Krein, 63, a Curves trainer from Fargo, N.D., who had come to New York with her daughter and granddaughter to see ''Mamma Mia!''
 The League of American Theaters and Producers has announced refunds for tickets to shows that are not performing. Producers and press agents involved with Off Broadway shows and the still-running Broadway shows have been eagerly reminding theatergoers that they are open for business, and ticket sellers to those shows are doing a brisk business among the bewildered crowds.
 A scalper, who was selling tickets to ''Mary Poppins'' outside the TKTS booth saw an opportunity in the discord. ''Fewer tickets means higher prices,'' said the man, who declined to give his name. ''I wish every day were like this.'' 
 The dispute has largely been over the rules in the contract that govern how many stagehands must be called for work, how long they work, and what kind of tasks they can perform. League members say the current rules invariably result in groups of stagehands on the clock with nothing to do.
 This year the league, an organization typically weakened by its natural divisions between producers and the theater owners to whom they pay rent, has been determined to gain more flexibility in those rules. 
 Union officials have said they are open to changes as long as the new rules come with benefits of equal value in return. The league has proposed a package of raises, but James J. Claffey Jr., the Local One president, has said there is no way to determine the amount of stagehand work that will be lost under the looser rules that the producers are proposing. About a quarter of the 2,200 active members of Local One, who build scenery, maintain props and install and operate lighting and sound equipment, work on Broadway.
 Stagehands fall into four wage categories. The highest-paid, like head carpenters and electricians, currently earn a minimum of $1,600 a week on a running show; stagehands in the lowest-paid category make a minimum of around $1,225. With overtime, additional work assignments and certain premium payments, wages can end up being quite a bit higher. 
 The league initially set a Sept. 30 deadline for the talks, which began before the stagehands' contract expired at the end of July. At that point, there was talk that the league might lock out the stagehands if a deal had not been reached.
 But the producers budged on the deadline for a few days, and a tense October followed, during which offers were exchanged and rejected, and the league imposed some of the proposed rules. After the union members authorized a strike on Oct. 21, Local One's parent union requested last week's sessions with the league.
 The local was given the authority to strike by Mr. Short on Thursday night. But the decision to actually go through with it caught producers by surprise when the rumors began to swirl on Friday night, given past remarks by Local One that it would not blindside Broadway with a strike. Mr. Claffey was even seen at that night's opening of ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas.'' It was up to the parent union, however, to advise the local as to when the strike was to begin.
 The league, with a $20 million emergency fund, and the union, with a $4.1 million fund, have made preparations for a work stoppage, though no one knows how long it will last. A long strike could be fatal to shows that have stars on short contracts or little in the way of advance sales.
 As the producers and the stagehands put into motion plans they have developed for months, plenty of others around Midtown had to make adjustments on the fly.
 ''I was just talking to somebody who had a ticket to 'Mamma Mia!''' said Jimmy G. Azbite, a concierge at the Michelangelo Hotel on West 51st Street. ''I'm changing her dinner reservation from 5:30 to 7:30.'' 
 Short-term fixes do not solve the long-term problem, though. ''Tell me,'' Mr. Azbite said, ''how long is this going to last?''

HEADLINE: Option ARMs: A Sequel?

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AT the epicenter of the mortgage earthquake was a lineup of exotic loans with newfangled payment terms. These were frequently offered to borrowers with poor credit who failed to understand the loans' terms and often could not keep up with the payments. While these types of loans have largely disappeared from the landscape, some industry leaders expect them to return soon enough. 
 ''We do this all the time,'' said Stephen Habetz, the chief executive of Threshold Mortgage, a brokerage in Westport, Conn. ''You can go back 10, 12 years and see the same headlines, where we roll out these products when the market heats up. And it'll happen again.''
 One signature product of the subprime mortgage sector was the pay-option ARM, an adjustable-rate mortgage that allowed borrowers to choose the size of their monthly payments, at least in the short term.
 This type of loan is similar to a line of credit, but with a twist. If, after five years, so much unpaid interest accumulated that the total owed reached 115 or 125 percent of the original amount, borrowers had to repay the principal and interest at an increased rate over the ensuing 25 years.
 That meant borrowers with a $180,000 loan could have seen their monthly payments jump from a minimum of $630 in the first year to $1,306 in Year 6, assuming a steady interest rate of 6.4 percent. 
 Still, the option ARM was an ideal loan for some buyers, lending industry executives said. Some workers in the financial industry, for instance, might go months with relatively modest paychecks but then enjoy big bonuses at year's end. Such borrowers could catch up quickly on principal payments that they had ignored for months.
 Now, option ARMs have virtually disappeared, industry executives said, as investors who bought loans from lenders have fled from such products. But that may change once the mortgage market starts to rebound, said Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of finance at Columbia University.
 Unlike many mortgage industry executives like Mr. Habetz who believe option ARMs are poorly suited to subprime borrowers, Professor Piskorski believes lenders should make the product available to borrowers with poor credit in the future.
 ''The option ARM is a very valuable product that can benefit borrowers, especially the very risky ones, who need added flexibility,'' he said.
 Lenders often said that subprime borrowers who were susceptible to sharply fluctuating health-care expenses or seasonal employment were too risky for conventional mortgages. But option ARMs allowed both subprime lenders and borrowers to manage that risk, Professor Piskorski said.
 Mortgage executives say they have no reliable way to track how many subprime borrowers took out option ARMs. Even Professor Piskorski agrees that the loans were offered too freely to borrowers with bad credit. ''For these to work,'' he said, ''the borrower must be rational and plan for the bad times while times are good.''
 When option ARMs reappear, Professor Piskorski contends, both lenders and subprime borrowers should be wiser about the product. 
 But James Kragenbring, an analyst at Advantus, an investment company in St. Paul, hopes that option ARMs are never again offered to subprime borrowers.
 ''You become a subprime borrower because of a lack of financial discipline,'' he said. ''This doesn't seem to me an appropriate product for a borrower whose ability to manage credit is not apparent.''

HEADLINE: Veterans' Rolls Decline Here As Fewer Enlist and More Move

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
For much of the 20th century, New York sent its share of residents off to war, and today, in many of the state's working-class neighborhoods and towns, the armed forces are as revered as ever. 
 But as New York's veterans march up Fifth Avenue and numerous local Main Streets today, they will barely resemble the crowds around them. Because their ranks have been so depleted by death, relocation and retirement elsewhere, and have not been fully replenished with enlistments, veterans now constitute a smaller share of New York's population than they do in any other state. 
 ''They're either passing away or going to Florida,'' said George P. Basher, director of the New York State Division of Veterans' Affairs.
 Since 2000, according to the latest census figures, the proportion of New Yorkers who are veterans has dipped below 10 percent, possibly for the first time since early in the 20th century: Only 7.4 percent of adult New Yorkers have served in the military. New Jersey was the second-lowest, at 8 percent, and Connecticut was seventh, at 9.7 percent. 
 In contrast, the proportion of veterans in Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Maine, Virginia and Washington is roughly twice as high as in New York. 
 Robert Foster, 61, who served in Vietnam and is the commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Westchester, said he planned to visit wounded and ill veterans in hospitals today, to ''thank the guys who aren't as lucky as us.''
 But the vast pool of aging veterans, those who served in World War II and Korea, is shrinking, said Mr. Foster, who is a school custodian and also runs a television repair shop -- ''the kind of business,'' he said, ''that's dying out, like the veterans are.''
 The overall number of veterans has been shrinking nationally, too, but the decline is faster in New York and the Northeast, which has the highest proportion of living World War II veterans but the smallest share of those who served during Vietnam and the Persian Gulf war. 
 The Pentagon estimates that New Yorkers account for a little more than 4 percent of the more than two million active-duty and reserve troops serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, just below the state's share of the nation's population. 
 Nationally, the military has had a tough time recruiting, but recruiters in the Northeast especially have been hampered by a number of factors. They include a relatively robust economy and opportunities for public higher education; disqualification because applicants are high school dropouts or have criminal records; an antiwar legacy dating back to the Vietnam era; and opposition to the latest war in Iraq.
 In the 2007 fiscal year, 20 percent fewer New Yorkers enlisted in the Army than in 2000. Nearly 50 percent fewer enlisted in the Army Reserve. 
 ''Enlistments as a percent of military-age population are low in New York, and if you don't produce soldiers, you don't produce veterans,'' said David R. Segal, director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland.
 In Hampton, Va., which is flanked by major military installations, more than 27 percent of the adult civilians are veterans. In New York City, 4 percent are. 
 The shrinking population of veterans and the closing of bases may shape New Yorkers' attitudes toward the military and national defense; polls generally show that New York is more antiwar than the rest of the nation. And coupled with low enlistments, Professor Segal said, ''I suspect that they make the military an invisible institution to most New Yorkers.''
 Mr. Basher, the director of the state veterans division, said that as another consequence of the decline, ''the influence of the military and veterans in general has been diminished by a great degree.'' 
 Veterans successfully lobbied to prevent the closing of two federal Veterans Affairs hospitals in the state, including one in Manhattan, several years ago. But, Mr. Basher said, ''as far as substantive programs for veterans go, there's not a lot going on.''
 Because of its sheer size, New York, the third-largest state, still has about 1.1 million veterans, ranking fourth in the United States. No other metropolitan area has more veterans than greater New York. And no county in the country has more veterans per square mile -- about 3,000 -- than Manhattan. 
 But in the 1990s alone, the number of veterans in New York declined by 20 percent, more than in any other state. New Jersey and Connecticut ranked second and third in declines, with losses of more than 17 percent. 
 During the same period, the number of veterans ballooned by 21 percent in Arizona and 31 percent in Nevada, reflecting both their surging populations and their attraction as retirement meccas. By 2000, North Carolina had bumped New Jersey from the list of 10 states with the most veterans.
 Each year, some 10,000 veterans leave New York to work or retire elsewhere, about the same number of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who return to the state annually from active duty. But about 40,000 or so New York veterans die every year. Those who survive and remain in the state are the oldest veterans in the nation. 
 In New York City, fully half the veterans are older than 65. In San Diego, fewer than one-third are.
 The American Legion still has about 900 posts in New York, but about 20 close every year because their membership has shrunk.
 New York can still boast of a rich military history. New Yorkers accounted for nearly one of every six soldiers in the Union Army during the Civil War. Nearly 10 percent of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I came from New York, then the largest state. 
 The battleships that began and ended World War II-- the Arizona, which sank at Pearl Harbor, and the Missouri, on which Japan surrendered -- were built at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. More Medals of Honor have been awarded to New Yorkers than to residents of any other state.
 ''Once upon a time, New York City was a military place,'' said Elihu Rose, who teaches military history at New York University. ''The Brooklyn Navy Yard, Governors Island, Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island, Fort Totten in Queens, Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn; there was even Fort Slocum in New Rochelle. All are gone now, except the tiny post at Fort Hamilton, which is purely administrative.'' 
 The only major military installation left is Fort Drum, upstate.

HEADLINE: As It Rises, Russia Stirs Baltic Fears

BYLINE: By ADAM B. ELLICK

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania 

 BODY:
 EVEN as Jonas Kronkaitis, now retired as Lithuania's top general, admires the transformation of this once drab Soviet city into a proud member of the New Europe, a worry eats at him: Russian power is rapidly returning to the Baltics, only this time the weapons are oil and money, not tanks. 
 General Kronkaitis has a unique perspective. He fled Lithuania to America as a boy in 1944, and served nearly 30 years in the United States Army before returning to command his newly independent country's military in the 1990's. He engineered its entry into NATO in 2004, thinking this would help cement security for the tiny Baltic nation. Now he says his hopeful view was wrong. 
 The signs of Russia's resurgent influence are everywhere in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia: in Kremlin-financed media; in the financing of local politicians and economic development; in a growing assertiveness, encouraged by Moscow, among the third of the Baltic population that is of Russian heritage; in the Kremlin's manipulation of its energy supplies as a bludgeon. 
 These tactics -- especially the use of Russian cash -- have evoked stress in the Baltics that was unthinkable even five years ago.
 ''What we are afraid of is the very huge money that comes from Russia that can be used to corrupt our officials,'' General Kronkaitis said in an interview. ''And I'm talking about very large money. Money can then be used to control our government. Then Lithuania, in a very subtle way, over many years perhaps, becomes dominated and loses its independence.''
 ''Over many years'' may be an understatement, Baltic nationalists say. In 2004, Lithuania's president was impeached for alleged connections to Russia's secret service and big business. 
 It all seems part of a strategy by President Vladimir Putin to revive Russian power in much of Eastern Europe. 
 For the Balts, any move that angers Russia runs huge risks. Last month, for example, the Estonian state prosecutor charged four ethnic Russians with organizing riots in April to protest the government's move of a statue of a Soviet soldier from the capital to a suburb as the anniversary of victory in World War II neared. The Russian-language press had egged on the protesters. 
 ''There is reason to believe that financial support and advice to organize mass disorders was also received from the Russian Federation,'' the prosecutor said. After the riots, hackers briefly paralyzed Estonia's government and banks, and Estonia said the cyberattacks were traced to Kremlin addresses. 
 The tensions over the riots come as the Baltic countries are trying to challenge Russia's energy monopoly. All three are resisting an ambitious Russian-German plan to build a pipeline under the Baltic Sea that would send gas directly from Russia to Western Europe -- bypassing the Baltics and cutting them out of transit fees and access to the flow. Estonia has led this opposition, with a challenge on environmental grounds. Many Balts find it disheartening that the former German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, sits on the board of the joint venture, in which Russians hold a 51 percent interest. 
 Gazprom, the Russian oil giant, already controls more than 35 percent of Baltic gas companies. Latvia has been cut off from an old Russian oil pipeline since 2003 and Lithuania since 2006, forcing them to import more expensive oil by ship. The Russians blame pipeline problems, but Latvians and Lithuanians don't believe that; Estonia was shut off for several weeks after the spring riots. 
 Any Baltic defiance of Russian pressure is made more emotional by their shared and bitter history. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began the 20th century under Russia's czars but gained independence after World War I. 
 Then, after the Hitler-Stalin nonaggression pact in 1939, Soviet troops swept in and Stalin deported hundreds of thousands of Balts to die in Siberian gulags. When Hitler's troops marched through in turn, many Balts saw the Germans as liberators -- and significant numbers collaborated with the Nazis to annihilate the region's Jews. 
 After the war came an influx of Russian workers whose presence would, in time, be cited by the Soviets to claim that these states should never again get independence. For its part, the Putin government has campaigned for ethnic Russians to insist on attaining a stronger voice by accepting Baltic citizenship.
 ''In the Baltics, history is a ghost that still walks the streets in a very active way,'' said Daina Eglitis of George Washington University. ''It's not just past, it's present. But people have different readings on it.'' 
 One example is a Vilnius tourist attraction, the torture chambers of the old K.G.B. headquarters, which had been Gestapo headquarters. It is now the Museum of Genocide Victims, but ''genocide'' applies only to what Russians did to Balts -- not to what Nazis and their local collaborators did to Jews.
 The museum all but ignores the Baltic people's role in the Holocaust, an omission that angers not only Jews, but also Russians, who view the Soviets as liberators and are now reasserting control over the historical record. For example, a new pan-Baltic Russian-language television station, financed by the Kremlin, often features documentaries that praise the Soviet Union.
 About one-third of Lithuania's television stations are already in Russian. ''Russians buy our politicians, they buy our press, and they buy our minds -- I think that's all,'' Indre Makaraityte, editor of Revival, an independent Lithuanian newspaper, said sarcastically. 
 She organized a demonstration in May to support Estonia against the ethnic Russians' protests and show solidarity with the West. But she says she was disheartened when European and American leaders took a week to condemn Russia after the riots. 
 ''We became members of NATO and E.U. expecting we would be defended immediately,'' she said. ''There's a fear of Russia, and a fear that we are again alone, not defended by our Western partners. They are too naive in evaluating Russia.''

HEADLINE: Of Human Bondage

 BODY:
According to the State Department, human traffickers are believed to smuggle as many as 18,000 people into this country every year, mostly for the sex industry, and nearly all of them women and children. The victims in that shadow work force obviously operate beyond the oversight and protection of government. So, too, do domestic workers. 
 A report on domestic workers by Human Rights Watch, available at hrw.org, said that about half of the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide were women, and that evidence of abuses was widespread. 
 But standard labor protections frequently do not apply to domestic workers, and agencies that recruit workers unscrupulously, luring them into servitude with steep debt and false promises, often do so with impunity.
 The suburbs of Manhattan are not immune to this epidemic -- withness the heartbreaking stories told in a pair of trials in federal courtrooms in Lower Manhattan and Central Islip, on Long Island. At the first trial, witnesses told of abuses they suffered in what federal agents say was an international prostitution ring, a sophisticated enterprise that smuggled Asian women into the country and forced them to work at massage parlors and spas up and down the East Coast.
 The other trial involved accusations on a much smaller scale -- behind the walls of a private home on Long Island, where a pair of domestic servants from Indonesia say they were treated as slaves and subjected to horrific punishments by the wealthy couple who employed them.
 Closing arguments in the prostitution trial ended last week, the same week that federal prosecutors got to the heart of the Long Island case against Varsha Sabhnani and her husband, Mahender Sabhnani -- hours of testimony from a 51-year-old woman who said she had been repeatedly and viciously attacked by Mrs. Sabhnani. She said she was beaten, starved, scalded, cut with a knife and fingernails, and forced to eat chili peppers and vomit.
 The defendants in each trial deny wrongdoing. The Sabhnanis say their accusers have concocted elaborate stories to avoid being sent home. The trials have no direct connection, and a jury will decide the outcome in both. But each concerns what law-enforcement officials and advocacy groups say is a worldwide problem: the wholesale trafficking and abuse of an immense, silenced population of women. The crisis is hidden behind the walls of brothels and of private homes, they say, with its victims too frightened and helpless to escape or to speak up for themselves. Uprooted by poverty and economic turmoil, largely unprotected by their governments, these women depend on the mercy of the merciless.
 New York State finally passed an antitrafficking law this year that turned these modern forms of slavery into felonies and offered victims emergency housing and health care and other services.
 But more needs to be done to remove the most difficult obstacles to unearthing and prosecuting these crimes. The authorities need to find ways to unwrap the shroud of silence and ignorance, the fear and shame that keep abused immigrant women from seeking protection. The Long Island case arose not through a law-enforcement investigation, after all, but when one of the women -- frightened, half-naked, multiply scarred and speaking no English -- appeared outside a Dunkin' Donuts and was aided by the alert kindness of a store manager.

HEADLINE: There's No Superhero In the Wings

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
LAST week's ugly action in the stock market was caused in large part by fear about how badly banks will be hit by loan and securities losses. Uncertainty is ever the investor's foe, and until we get some clarity on what banks' holdings are truly worth, market gyrations will be a fact of life.
 Major banks have written down about $40 billion in troubled loans so far this year. That number will certainly rise. 
 You know it will really be time to worry, however, when top regulatory officials start referring to the banks' problems as ''contained.'' That was how they described the subprime mortgage mess, remember, even as it became the thing that devoured homeowners in Cleveland, Las Vegas and much of Florida. 
 Here is the problem with the financial sector's ills: Even though we don't know what toxicity lurks in these companies' books, we do know that the sector plays an enormous role in the United States economy. Indeed, because of that growing role, a financial services downturn is likely to have graver economic consequences than ever before. 
 As Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust, noted recently, profits from the financial sector now account for 31 percent of total United States corporate earnings -- up from 20 percent in 1990 and 8 percent back in 1950. Profits from this country's financial engineers now far exceed those generated by mechanical engineers. 
 But we still can't tally the losses for which these engineering geniuses are responsible. ''No one knows how big the challenges in the financial sector are,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''What I do know is that we have never had a more highly leveraged economy than we have today. We have never had a more highly leveraged household sector and we have never had a more highly leveraged housing sector than we have today.''
 While consumer spending has provided a major propellant to the economy in recent years, troubling signs that the consumer may finally be dropping rather than shopping have cropped up. Chain-store sales have been weak for two months in a row, and shares of major retailers fell on Friday on concerns about weaker consumer spending. The University of Michigan said last week that consumer confidence had fallen to its lowest point in two years. 
 Mr. Kasriel's point about the economic impact of a damaged financial services sector is this: If you think corporate spending will replace flagging consumer spending as a driver for the economy, think again. 
 Yes, balance sheets throughout most of corporate America are relatively healthy, but company profit growth is slowing. Earnings from the nonfinancial sector, accounting for half of corporate profits, have been contracting, beginning at the end of 2006 and extending through the second quarter this year, the most recent figures available. It appears that overall profits among the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell in the third quarter, compared with the same period last year. Soon, profits in the financial arena will come under siege. 
 ''Business capital spending was not booming when corporate profit growth and household demand were strong,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''So why would it be expected to continue to grow when profit growth and household demand growth are slowing?'' 
 Here is another data point to support his view: Corporations still have a good bit of production capacity that they have not tapped. The capacity utilization rate of 82.2 percent in August is well below the peak of 85 percent seen in recent booms. It is unlikely that companies will spend capital to increase production capacity if existing facilities are not being fully used. 
 And household spending, Mr. Kasriel points out, is the dominant force behind increases in capital spending. With households possibly retrenching, corporations are not likely to increase their capital expenditures. 
 While the banks are well capitalized because they have made so much money during the lending boom, their profits are vulnerable. One reason for this, as recently noted in this space, is that banks are underreserved for losses. To bolster those reserves, managers will have to dip into profits.
 ''A lot of the underlying assets held by financial institutions around the world today are likely to get worse before they get better,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''The problem is, this is not going to stay just in housing. There has been a significant amount of noninvestment-grade debt issued during this cycle, and if the general economy slows down or moves into a recession, there are going to be problems in servicing this debt because profits are going to decline.''
 So, here's the $64 trillion question: Is a recession coming? Mr. Kasriel says he has not yet called for one in his economic forecast. But he says an indicator that he finds highly reliable in predicting economic downturns is pointing to that result. 
 His indicator has two elements, and both must be negative for a recession to be in the air. First is the spread between the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and that of the federal funds rate. The second is the change in the monetary base, which is a combination of bank reserves and circulating currency. 
 ''Every recession since 1970 has been preceded by this combination,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''Over the first three quarters of this year, this combination has existed. At least qualitatively, it is sending a signal that we are on the eve of a recession.''

HEADLINE: When the Producer Came to Town

BYLINE: By PHILIP WEISS. 
Philip Weiss, who has written on many subjects for the magazine, is the author of ''American Taboo: A Murder in the Peace Corps.''

 BODY:
ON ONE OF THOSE DRY SUNNY DAYS that make the West majestic, a couple hundred film lovers gathered in a park in Telluride, Colo., deep in the San Juan Mountains, to hear independent filmmakers talk about making movies. 
 Julian Schnabel read quotations from the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. Todd Haynes related the story of his successful courtship of Bob Dylan for his movie ''I'm Not There.'' Wayne Wang, a longtime director, told of his years in the Hollywood studio mills. ''They have these things called pacing paths,'' he said. ''They go in and literally take out everything that has nothing to do with the story or characters or even any breathing room.'' 
 Wang's statement prompted the one true celebrity on the panel to lean into the microphone. ''I wanted to share one thought with Wayne and anyone else who wants to make a movie,'' Sean Penn said. ''When it comes to Hollywood studios, they understand money very well. When they want to cut that frame or one scene or pace something up more than you'd like it to be, you make a very brief call and remind them that a bullet costs just a quarter. Then you hang up.'' 
 The audience roared, and I turned to a tall man with long brown hair and gray sideburns, who was standing about as far as you could get from the stage. ''Did he ever say that to you?'' I asked him. A quiet, thoughtful Minnesotan, William Pohlad was a producer on Penn's latest film, ''Into the Wild.'' He gave a small shake of the head. 
 Penn says as much himself. ''Everything changed when this Medici came into my life,'' he told me after a screening of ''Into the Wild'' in New York a month earlier. ''He's the first producer I've ever worked with where I am the one to bring up the money issues.'' 
 Pohlad, the 51-year-old son of one of the richest men in America, looked like a prince in his long black designer jacket, white shirt out at the waist and pointy lace-up boots. In the last three years, he has made a name for himself in Hollywood with his production company, River Road Entertainment, and his willingness to back daring pictures. His breakthrough project began when he read a script on an airplane and told his wife he had finally found a film he was interested in financing. Many others had turned down ''Brokeback Mountain'' as too risky. But for Pohlad, it fit exactly what he wanted to do: support an ambitious, emotional, challenging film. ''He cash-flowed the entire movie and never took a bank loan, and it went well over 10 million,'' says Rick Hess, an agent at Creative Artists who served as Pohlad's cicerone when he first came to Hollywood. ''I credit him with being tasteful and shrewd. He's gone to places other people wouldn't go.'' (Pohlad declines to discuss budgets, but he says he and Universal, which released the film, shared production costs.) 
 Pohlad is among a small group of fabulously wealthy individuals that have come from other businesses to Hollywood in the last few years. They have produced sophisticated yet commercially viable films that probably would not have been made were it left up to the studios. ''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' ''Crash,'' ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' ''Syriana,'' ''Brokeback Mountain,'' ''Little Miss Sunshine'' -- all these films were generated by a cottage industry of independent production companies like Pohlad's River Road, usually in collaboration with a specialty division of the studio system. Among these producers is Jeff Skoll, who made a fortune with eBay and founded a company called Participant Productions to make socially progressive films (''An Inconvenient Truth'' was his). Sidney Kimmel made his fortune in the garment industry and has backed urban, edgy dramas like ''Talk to Me'' and ''Alpha Dog.'' Bob Yari came out of California real estate; he has financed ''The Hoax,'' ''The Illusionist'' and the Oscar-winning ''Crash.''
 Todd Wagner, one of the founders of Broadcast.com, describes these films as ''tweener movies,'' ones that are between low-budget and major studio productions and are ''made frankly for adults.'' Wagner himself joined with Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and formed a film-production company called 2929 Productions. Their breakout venture was ''Good Night, and Good Luck.'' ''The $10-to-40-million tweener movies need love and attention,'' he says.
 Wagner, Pohlad and the rest have gained a beachhead in Hollywood because the movie business has grown and the studio business has shifted somewhat from a production model to a distribution model. The major studios are increasingly devoted to huge ''tent-pole'' pictures. Tent poles are artistically conservative -- ''Spider-Man 3,'' ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' -- and typically cost upward of $80 million to make. A flood of outside capital, often from hedge funds seeking higher returns than they can get in conventional markets, has generated production entities, which have bought into slates of big-budget films.
 ''For the studios, it's drunk time in Vegas because the hedge money is flowing in,'' Wagner says. ''There used to be a couple of tent poles a year. Now, it's crazy. I understand why they do it. It's the biggest margin and the highest and best use of people. If I ran a studio, I'd do the same thing. It best leverages the infrastructure, and they are really good at that. Spray and pray. Spend, spend, spend. They have got a lot of bodies sitting around.''
 Rick Hess of Creative Artists Agency explains it a little differently: ''As the studios become bought and subsumed into conglomerates -- which all of them have except M.G.M. -- there's been downward pressure from the corporate parent to offload production costs. It is not just a luxury but a necessity to seek outside capital.''
 Studios still want to do daring movies, however, for a simple reason: prestige. In the last three years the awards ceremonies have been dominated by movies made for under $30 million. ''Actors and directors and writers and producers want to make them,'' says Laura Bickford, a producer who has worked with Pohlad. ''They have a potential award audience.'' All the studios have specialty units for this purpose, like Paramount Vantage, Sony Pictures Classics and Focus Features at Universal, which did ''Brokeback Mountain.'' Very few of these films pay back their initial investments and the financial results can be ugly. So the major studios have turned to outside capital, in the form of people like Pohlad. Insiders say a typical deal calls for an outsider to pay production costs and the studio to pay for p-and-a (prints and advertising) and distribution. The independent producers often reduce their risk by selling foreign-distribution rights at international film fairs. 
 Investors like Pohlad want to make money on the movies, but unlike hedge-fund investors, returns aren't the primary draw. ''Our goal is to be the leading provider of entertainment that inspires and compels social change,'' says Ricky Strauss, the president of Jeff Skoll's Participant Productions. ''We all work together. One of the great things is that we have projects with Sidney Kimmel, projects with River Road. It feels like these partnerships are a wave of the future, where like-minded creative enthusiasts help bring enlightened product to the screen.''
 Laura Bickford says that she was unable to sell a studio on two pet projects, the 2000 hit ''Traffic'' and ''Che,'' a biopic of the revolutionary that she is now shooting across Latin America. Outside capital made both movies possible. ''The under-30,'' she said, referring to films under $30 million, ''is having a renaissance.'' 
 HOLLYWOOD PEOPLE describe Bill Pohlad as a throwback, and when I first met him at a bar-cafe in Minneapolis I understood why. He measures his words and is polite and wry without ever being ingratiating. He says, with something of the naive air of the Little Prince, that he likes his relationships to grow ''organically.'' When I said he was an even-tempered sort, he agreed, adding, ''But many even-tempered people may not be that way deep down.''
 Pohlad's angst would seem to come from his relationship with his charismatic father. Carl Pohlad, now 92, is a self-made man who grew up poor in Iowa during the Depression and through toughness and creativity built a fortune in the banking and later the bottling business. The owner of the Minnesota Twins, Pohlad is listed by Forbes magazine as the fourth-richest owner in sports, at $3.1 billion. Pohlad Sr. was not immune to glamour. As a young man, he knew Tom Mix and Bing Crosby, and as he amassed wealth, Hollywood kept beckoning him to invest. But Carl Pohlad knew better. It was a good way to lose a lot of money in a hurry, and he passed on this lesson to his dashing youngest son.
 Bill Pohlad went to his father's college, Gonzaga, in Spokane, Wash., and fell in love with Formula 1 racing for a while. Then, like his two older brothers, he went to work for the family business out of a sense of duty, doing marketing for Marquette Bancshares. It was the closest you could get to the media business and still call yourself a banker, he says. ''Clearly, my dad came from a certain background and a certain time and built what he built from nothing,'' Pohlad says. ''He never had an opportunity to mess around with how he was feeling, 'Do I want to do this,' or, 'Is this going to be fulfilling.' So it's a little harder for a son to come along and want to be in the film business.''
 The boy grew up as a movie lover, but when he said he wanted to go into the industry itself, his father warned him that Hollywood was ''a crazy business.'' The father had good reasons to admonish his son. Prominent men, from Joseph Kennedy to Howard Hughes, had been drawn like moths to the klieg lights and imagined that having made out in businesses elsewhere they could do the same in Hollywood. ''The movie business has been a siren call to unstable high-net-worth egomaniacs to lose a lot of their capital,'' says James Schamus, the chief executive of Universal's Focus Features. ''There is a tendency to treat people who come in with it as appendages with a checkbook.''
 At first Bill Pohlad tried to get into the industry from the Midwest. In the early 1990s, he started a production company in Minneapolis. He developed a local theatrical production into a feature movie called ''Old Explorers,'' with James Whitmore and Jose Ferrer. It was a bitter experience. The movie was shown for a time on television, but he lost his family's and friends' money. Afterward, he made documentaries and industrial films, including in-flight programming for Northwest Airlines. 
 Then eight years ago, something clicked. ''I changed overnight,'' he says. He was being immature as a businessman. If he wanted to be in the film industry, he realized, he should go to Hollywood. His two older brothers, who also work for family businesses, encouraged him.
 Pohlad is very deliberate. It took him a few years to make his first deal. In 2003, he agreed to go into a partnership with Universal. Rick Hess, the agent who helped Pohlad make his way by getting him three projects that ended up turning a profit (''Brokeback,'' ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and a Madonna documentary), says the Minnesotan's aristocratic soft-spokenness has been an asset in Hollywood. ''Very classy,'' Hess says. ''I met him and immediately his sincerity, his taste and his commitment led me to think he wasn't a flash in the pan.''
 POHLAD SAYS THAT HE HAS NEVER been good at networking, that he's best one on one. That is one reason he recently hired a new president for River Road in Los Angeles -- to do the schmoozing. ''My relationship with Sean is more personal,'' he says, referring to Penn. ''It's a business relationship but it is a more direct connection than a strictly business thing. It is about trust and mutual respect. In business, you have to act like that's the case, trust and mutual respect, when it's not. I've never liked that.''
 The lush production values of ''Into the Wild'' reflect Pohlad's willingness to trust Penn. The movie was set to be filmed in one state, Utah, but as Penn got into the material he wanted to use more of the locations that the real Chris McCandless, whose story is told in the movie, had visited. The ambitious filming locations didn't swell the budget much, though they had a ''reasonably sizable impact,'' Pohlad told me. Rumors put the film's cost at $30 million. Pohlad says that that's not accurate but that it was ''somewhere in that neighborhood.'' 
 Pohlad speaks of the film's artistic flourishes with awe. In one scene, the loner McCandless, played by Emile Hirsch, meets a wizened folk artist who has built a sprawling adobe spectacle called Salvation Mountain near the Salton Sea in the California desert. The artist, Leonard Knight, is not an actor; he's the real thing. ''I've never seen anything in a movie like that,'' Pohlad said. ''Like reality woven into this dramatic film. It is just so weird. That guy is so genuine, he doesn't seem to notice the camera.'' 
 Some studios might have wanted to lose that scene, but a studio couldn't tell Pohlad what to do ''because I have skin in the game.'' Pohlad winced at the crude Hollywoodism. ''That's the expression,'' he said. ''Skin in the game means a financial stake.''
 The term is embarrassing to Pohlad because he comes to Hollywood not principally as a businessman but as an art lover. And yet Hollywood relates to him as a money guy. Laura Bickford, for instance, describes Pohlad as a ''financier.''
 Who is a producer? That question has become a sore point for some of the new arrivals. Bob Yari financed ''Crash'' but did not get a producer credit on the Oscar ballot, and when the film won for best picture in 2006, he sued the Producers Guild of America and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to get the credit. Yari lost the suit. In defending the guild's position, Marshall Herskovitz, now its president, told The New York Times that a producer is ''the driving force behind the film from the beginning all the way to the end,'' i.e., not someone who merely bankrolls a project others have sweated blood over.
 Todd Wagner, of 2929, says you can't win with Hollywood: ''I don't think that Hollywood's ever going to change. You're dancing with elephants; you've got to be light on your feet.'' People are drawn to L.A. by glamour, fame and sex, and that creates a lousy environment for business. Wagner, a kinetic, driven man with reddish hair and blue eyes that flash with humor and temper, got into the business after making a fortune in high tech because he wanted to do something that didn't feel like work. The day I met him in New York, he had come back from Europe, where he was checking out World War I battlefields for a film, and he had just announced a project with Joaquin Phoenix called ''Two Lovers.'' He is trying to be a producer in the full sense but still live in Dallas.
 ''Skin in the game doesn't really mean anything,'' Wagner said, and he whipped out a piece of paper to explain. In a typical co-financing deal, he says, an independent like himself or Pohlad will supply the high-risk venture capital, buying the script, remaking it, then green-lighting a production and shooting it. The studio money shows up when everything's done: marketing and distribution. 
 ''But who gets paid first?'' he says. In any other business, the high-risk investor gets paid back first, or if the business fails, is paid the highest percentage of the leavings. In Hollywood the studios get paid back first, for their distribution piece and the p-and-a. ''In no other business is that the case,'' he said, almost gleefully. ''You're sitting behind all this other money.'' And this backward ''broken'' economy, he says, is why stars and studio executives are overpaid and movies cost so much. 
 ''I don't think Bill Pohlad was happy with how Universal treated him on 'Brokeback,' '' Wagner threw in. ''But you should ask him.''
 The unflappable Pohlad suggests that Wagner is the one who is unhappy over his own fortunes. ''Certainly the studios have a way of operating that can be frustrating in the least and downright unfavorable to partners at worst,'' he says. ''Todd has had a more difficult experience than we have. To have films up for best picture'' -- ''Good Night, and Good Luck'' -- ''and he doesn't make any money, that doesn't seem right to me. Our relationship with Universal has been great.'' He says ''Brokeback'' has grossed $200 million worldwide in theaters, though he declines to say how much of that he's seen. 
 Whatever their frustrations, these investors vow that they're not going away. According to Wagner, Hollywood saw him and Cuban, the Mavericks' owner, as just two nobodies from Texas, but after almost 10 films, their company is well established. Now he's building his own distribution system, which he will use if he can't get the right price from Hollywood studios. Sidney Kimmel has been making movies for more than 20 years and has formed a new international company that is building a film library.
 But the studio system is still the main game in town. Bickford may have fought the studios' indifference to produce ''Traffic'' and ''Che,'' but she acknowledges their power over independent film. ''All films need the studios' expertise in marketing and distribution,'' she says.
 Pohlad is respectful of the studio system, describing it as huge and inflexible, but necessary. ''I don't want to reinvent the industry, but push for an evolution in the way the studios see so-called outside financiers -- what I prefer to call 'partnerships with producers who bring more to the table,' '' he said. ''But I don't have any illusions. . . . There's a fair chance that in a few years we could be bitter and walk away grumbling.'' 
 AFTER TELLURIDE, Pohlad and Penn went to the Toronto International Film Festival, and on to Europe. A few years into his Hollywood education, Pohlad is more confident about his role. On ''Into the Wild,'' he was involved with Penn's creative decisions, almost always supportively. However, he is careful not to overstate his importance, and doesn't claim to have the kind of relationship that James Schamus has with the director Ang Lee -- ''sort of Ang Lee's muse,'' Pohlad said. Which may explain Pohlad's emotional distance from Lee's most recent film, ''Lust, Caution,'' on which he is a producer. Early on Ang Lee showed him cuts of the film that included a graphic sexual scene late in the movie. Pohlad raised an eyebrow about the decision. ''I wasn't bothered, honestly, by the NC-17 nature of it,'' he says. ''I wanted to make sure it wasn't seen as gratuitous. I mean, 'Last Tango in Paris,' that's what the film was about. I questioned having it in the one section.'' But it was a fleeting question; ''you don't try to second-guess the filmmaker,'' he says.
 Released three weeks after Telluride, ''Into the Wild'' received mixed reviews. Critics praised the film's cinematic beauty and some of the performances but questioned Penn's approach. Was Chris McCandless a romantic figure, as Penn suggested, or a deluded and hostile adolescent? The question had come up at Telluride and Penn had been defiant, extolling the young man's all-out commitment to adventure. 
 When I asked Pohlad about Penn's choices as a director, Pohlad got his back up. ''If you don't have a strong vision,'' he said, ''you're going to get really screwed up. He wasn't willing to give up, which is great. You don't want someone who is wavering.''
 The producer was talking to me from Rome, where he and Penn were attending the Rome International Film Festival. Throughout the film tour, Pohlad was taking his time reading scripts and considering his next project. ''I'm not very good at volume,'' he said. Currently he is in a partnership with Skoll's Participant to put out ''Chicago 10,'' a documentary about the 1968 Democratic convention, and to produce a documentary about the food industry. In late October, Pohlad announced a deal to make a film with the legendary director Terrence Malick. Pohlad was at a loss to describe it, other than to say it was both ''intimate and epic'' and Penn would play a supporting role. Pohlad met Malick on ''Che,'' a movie he later withdrew from, and had heard about ''Tree of Life,'' as the movie is being called, then. It sounded ''out there'' and ''crazy,'' but he read the script and immediately loved it. ''Terry's an amazing guy,'' he said. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ''If anyone has the muscle to bring 'Life' to the screen, it's River Road.''
 Between his globe-trotting trips, Pohlad tries to make it back to Minnesota, where he has regular lunches with his two brothers. He was in his car one day when a realization hit him: ''Growing up in Minnesota, getting into this not that many years ago, it's surreal. When I started and wasn't making progress, all these things seemed like pie in the sky. Then to be driving through Minneapolis and have two films at two big screens in the city -- wow. Who would have thought this would be happening? Who would have ever thought that?''

HEADLINE: It's Time to Act Like Grown-Ups

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NOW for a few thoughts on the credit crisis and the need to prepare for retirement.
 First, the credit mess. Here is a simple truth: As we know, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Bear Stearns and other financial entities have taken immense charges on their holdings of bundles of subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations and loans made in connection with mergers and acquisitions and for general commercial purposes. 
 But these deals did not just come out of the blue. Someone sold these debt instruments to these huge banks and investment banks. The someone might have been a borrower who was not qualified, or another player in the financial field like a hedge fund or a mortgage originator. 
 If the buyers are now realizing that these instruments are worth tens of billions less than they paid, someone else must have booked a roughly corresponding gain. Now, it's true that the seller might not have realized that he had the gain. He might have sold at what he thought was fair value at the time. It may be that only when the credit correction started was the asset in question marked down to problem levels. 
 But even if there were no intent and even if the loss were not foreseeable at the time, someone is sitting pretty. There are gainers somewhere, and it sure looks as if some home borrowers are in that group. Obviously, with hindsight, we can see that the lenders' risk premium in fees and interest rates should have been even higher than it was. 
 It's an ill wind that blows no one any good.
 Second, much has been made of the failure of officers and directors to notice that something was amiss at these big banks. Why didn't the directors ask the chiefs, ''Gee, how can you continue to earn a far higher rate of return on debt than the market rate? How are you defying gravity this way? Can it last?''
 Why were the questions not asked?
 Possibly because the directors might have been chosen with an eye toward political correctness instead of an eye toward what they knew about finance and accounting. I was staggered when I read about the backgrounds of the Merrill directors. It is nice to have leaders of colleges and universities on boards (as Merrill does) but wouldn't it have been better to look for accounting expertise? Was the idea to conform to P.C. principles and not have anyone asking tough questions? What about fiduciary duty?
 On the other hand, maybe I am wrong. Long, long ago, when I was a lad at Parkside Elementary School in Silver Spring, Md., we would take an annual bus trip to Annapolis, the state capital. We would sit in the chairs of judges, state legislators and even the governor, and pretend that we were high honchos in government. But we weren't. We were little kids.
 Later, when I worked for Mr. Nixon and Mr. Ford, I was sometimes allowed to sit in on Cabinet meetings and other high-level sit-downs. It was just like kids' day at Annapolis. We were at the chairs of Jefferson and Lincoln and the seats had the names of immense government departments. But we were still just ordinary working stiffs trying to do work vastly beyond our ability -- namely, governing a great continental nation. We were basically kids trying to do grown-ups' work.
 Now, I have worked on Wall Street, in Hollywood and at big newspapers, and it's always the same. There are very few geniuses out there. There are some fancy titles and immense responsibilities and, on Wall Street and in Hollywood, some giant paychecks. But there are few really smart, capable, perspicacious people (and I am certainly not one).
 Next, when I saw that Citi had taken a bath in collateralized debt obligations and subprime, and saw that Robert E. Rubin had been on the board in a major position and had failed to stop the train wreck, I was staggered. And now he has been named chairman. He couldn't protect Citi's stockholders, and now he's in charge? And let's remember, he was Treasury secretary when we had the first part of one of the worst bubbles in stock market history. What on earth are the Citi directors thinking?
 ANYWAY, back to credit. The problem with credit has been the always dubious promise of magically high returns without unacceptable risks. It is insane greed that leads people to toss aside arithmetic and basic theory and just go for the green stuff up to the elbows. It happened with tech stocks, Drexel junk bonds, savings and loans and real estate (over and over). And it will happen again.
 What is to be done? If you are a normal working stiff and you want to retire eventually, you have to keep investing. You cannot put your savings under your mattress. You have to diversify, be patient, make sure you aren't caught up in fads and make sure you have ultracapable people working for you -- Warren E. Buffett comes to mind. And keep diversifying: foreign and domestic, large- and small-cap, emerging and developed. You have to have some guaranteed income that cannot dry up before you die -- annuities, bought with an eye on fees -- and you have to be patient as can be.
 Human beings, even at the very top of Wall Street, can be just like greedy children. (In fact, maybe that's why they wind up on Wall Street.) They can get into trouble over and over again with their greed and infantilism. You have to stay on the edges of their world. Make sure that any one sector is just a part of your investment future, and you'll be all right.
 But it certainly hurts to spend day after day, as I did this fall, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center -- where the incredibly brave wounded soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan learn about walking and eating without their natural legs and arms -- and to realize that the America for which they're fighting is led in so many arenas, especially the money one, by such weak, disappointing specimens. 
 It's high time that the America for which soldiers sacrifice so much is run on a moral standard more like theirs. And this is without even talking about Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery, where fresh graves are dug every week and the fresh tears keep the ground damp. They deserve better.

HEADLINE: Death of a Spy Satellite Program

BYLINE: By PHILIP TAUBMAN

 BODY:
By May 2002, the government's effort to build a technologically audacious new generation of spy satellites was foundering.
 The contractor building the satellites, Boeing, was still giving Washington reassuring progress reports. But the program was threatening to outstrip its $5 billion budget, and pivotal parts of the design seemed increasingly unworkable. Peter B. Teets, the new head of the nation's spy satellite agency, appointed a panel of experts to examine the secret project, telling them, according to one member, ''Find out what's going on, find the terrible truth I suspect is out there.''
 The panel reported that the project, called Future Imagery Architecture, was far behind schedule and would most likely cost $2 billion to $3 billion more than planned, according to records from the satellite agency, the National Reconnaissance Office. 
 Even so, the experts recommended pressing on. Just months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and with the new satellites promising improved, more frequent images of foreign threats like terrorist training camps, nuclear weapons plants and enemy military maneuvers, they advised Mr. Teets to seek an infusion of $700 million. 
 It took two more years, several more review panels and billions more dollars before the government finally killed the project -- perhaps the most spectacular and expensive failure in the 50-year history of American spy satellite projects. The story behind that failure has remained largely hidden, like much of the workings of the nation's intelligence establishment. 
 But an investigation by The New York Times found that the collapse of the project, at a loss of at least $4 billion, was all but inevitable -- the result of a troubled partnership between a government seeking to maintain the supremacy of its intelligence technology, but on a constrained budget, and a contractor all too willing to make promises it ultimately could not keep. 
 ''The train wreck was predetermined on Day 1,'' said A. Thomas Young, a former aerospace executive who led a panel that examined the project.
 The Future Imagery project is one of several satellite programs to break down in recent years, leaving the United States with outdated imaging technology. But perhaps more striking is that the multiple failures that led to the program's demise reveal weaknesses in the government's ability to manage complex contracts at a time when military and intelligence contracting is soaring. 
 The Times's examination found that the satellite agency put the Future Imagery contract out for bid in 1998 despite an internal assessment that questioned whether its lofty technological goals were attainable given the tight budget and schedule. 
 Boeing had never built the kind of spy satellites the government was seeking. Yet when Boeing said it could live within the stringent spending caps imposed by Congress and the satellite agency, the government accepted the company's optimistic projections, a Panglossian compact that set the stage for many of the travails that followed. Despite its relative inexperience, Boeing was given responsibility for monitoring its own work, under a new government policy of shifting control of big military projects to contractors. At the same time, the satellite agency, hobbled by budget cuts and the loss of seasoned staff members, lacked the expertise to make sound engineering evaluations of its own.
 The satellites were loaded with intelligence collection requirements, as numerous intelligence and military services competed to influence their design. Boeing's initial design for the optical system that was the heart of one of the two new satellite systems was so elaborate that optical engineers working on the project said it could not be built. Engineers constructing a radar-imaging unit at the core of the other satellite could not initially produce the unusually strong radar signal that was planned.
 A torrent of defective parts, like gyroscopes and electric cables, repeatedly stalled work. Even an elementary rule of spacecraft construction -- never use tin because it deforms in space and can short-circuit electronic components -- was violated by parts suppliers.
 By the time the project, known by its initials, F.I.A., was killed in September 2005 -- a year after the first satellite was originally to have been delivered -- cost estimates ran as high as $18 billion. 
 ''The F.I.A. contract was technically flawed and unexecutable the day it was signed,'' said Robert J. Hermann, who ran the National Reconnaissance Office from 1979 to 1981 and in 1996 led the panel that first recommended creation of a new satellite system. ''Some top official should have thrown his badge on the table and screamed, 'We can't do this system at this price.' No one did.''
 Boeing's point man on the job was Ed Nowinski, an engineer who had become a top government spy satellite expert during 28 years at the Central Intelligence Agency. ''It was a perfect storm,'' Mr. Nowinski said ruefully. But he acknowledged that Boeing frequently provided the government with positive reports on the troubled project. 
 ''Look, we did report problems,'' Mr. Nowinski said, ''but it was certainly in my best interests to be very optimistic about what we could do.''
 Boeing, which fired Mr. Nowinski as the project fell apart, declined to comment. A spokeswoman, Diana Ball, said Boeing could not discuss classified programs.
 The Times's examination was based on interviews with more than 30 government and industry officials involved with the project, many discussing it publicly for the first time. Some agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they not be identified because many aspects of the project remained classified. They said they were willing to talk because they hoped an airing of its history would help prevent similar misadventures in the future. 
 Asked about the recent problems with F.I.A. and other satellite programs, Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said, ''It's fair to say we have lost double-digit billions on satellite programs that weren't effectively managed by the government.'' 
 This year, a stealth satellite program was killed by Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence. Also, a new generation of infrared satellites for detecting missile launches has barely survived cost overruns and technical setbacks. 
 Taken together, these episodes represent a stark reversal for a satellite program born in the most perilous years of the cold war, when American technology answered the call of national defense by taking spying into space. 
 Today, space technology has lost its luster for young engineers, who are drawn increasingly to companies like Google and Apple. Defense experts say the entire acquisition system for space-based imagery technologies is in danger of breaking down. And the nation, at least for now, has been left without advanced new systems to replace a dwindling number of reconnaissance satellites first designed in the 1970s and updated in the 1990s. 
 Even though reconnaissance satellites are less useful in spying on terrorist groups than on more traditional threats like foreign military forces, they remain integral to intelligence and military operations, including monitoring nuclear and missile installations in Iran and North Korea. They are also critical to Pentagon mapmaking and the targeting of precision-guided weapons like cruise missiles. 
 ''There is not a gap in the coverage we are providing, but our constellation is fragile,'' said Alden V. Munson Jr., deputy director of national intelligence for acquisition. 
 Since the F.I.A. debacle, the National Reconnaissance Office has banned Boeing from bidding on new spy satellite contracts. But all the news was not bad for Boeing. The company received a $430 million kill fee for the optical satellite system. And, despite the ban, the radar-imaging satellite remained in Boeing's hands. 
 Response to Soviet Threat
 The first generation of photo reconnaissance satellites was developed in the waning months of the Eisenhower administration, in a frantic effort to measure the Soviet threat.
 The satellite system, code-named Corona, was the product of an inspired partnership of government, science and industry. The Central Intelligence Agency set broad goals and then let the Lockheed Corporation, with help from the Air Force, figure out how to build the satellites, get them into orbit and return the film canisters to earth without burning up as they plunged through the atmosphere. 
 In the mid-1970s, the same partnership developed systems that electronically captured and transmitted pictures moments after they were recorded. These electro-optical satellites were among the first devices to use the technology now common in digital cameras.
 They were followed in the 1980s by radar-imaging satellites, which can see though clouds and operate in darkness, bouncing radar signals off the earth to plot terrain and paint images of objects on the ground. 
 By the 1990s, though, the threats to national security -- and the world of satellite intelligence -- were undergoing convulsive change. 
 Familiar targets like Soviet air bases and missile factories were being supplanted by the more varied and elusive threats of the post-cold-war world. At the same time, the armed services, eager for increased tactical intelligence after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, were demanding satellites that could stream battlefield data instantly to commanders around the globe. 
 In 1996, a commission created by the director of central intelligence recommended building a fleet of light, small, relatively inexpensive satellites that, according to a declassified version of the panel's report, could together be at least as effective as the Lockheed behemoths then in orbit. (They cost about $1 billion apiece, weighed 30,000 pounds and were the size of a bus.) 
 Having more satellites in orbit, the theory went, would increase ''revisit time,'' the number of times a day satellites pass above target sites. That would help combat increasing efforts to camouflage such sites. 
 Lighter satellites would require cheaper and less powerful rockets than the Titan IV's then in use, which could cost $450 million per launching. The panel also envisioned saving money and time by taking advantage of technologies and parts developed by commercial satellite companies.
 But as the concept took shape, several powerful forces were bearing down, turning the satellite procurement system to quicksand, military experts said.
 One was the new policy, cousin to the Clinton administration's effort to downsize government, of transferring control of big military projects to contractors, on the theory that they could best manage engineering work and control costs. 
 Another factor was a decline of American expertise in systems engineering, the science and art of managing complex engineering projects to weigh risks, gauge feasibility, test components and ensure that the pieces come together smoothly. 
 Finally, troubled by the free-spending habits of the satellite agency, Congress demanded rigid spending guidelines for the satellite project. 
 The first concerns about the project's formula -- high-concept technology on a fast schedule with a tightly managed budget -- came from the satellite agency itself. 
 In early 1997, as the project began to move from conceptual thinking to concrete planning, the agency's acquisition board, which reviewed programs at an early stage, questioned the feasibility of the new approach, given the expected $5 billion budget cap for its first five years. As Dennis D. Fitzgerald, the agency's principal deputy director from August 2001 until last April, recalled, the board's review ''had the most reds and yellows'' -- agency parlance for cautionary notes -- he had ever seen. 
 Even so, in January 1997, the agency invited military companies to a classified briefing about the project now called Future Imagery Architecture.
 A Company Trying to Diversify
 Albert D. Wheelon, who founded the Directorate of Science and Technology at the C.I.A. in 1963 and played a leading role in the early development of spy satellites, said in an interview, ''Writing winning proposals is different from building winning hardware.''
 That could be an apt epitaph for Boeing's handling of F.I.A. 
 Boeing, famous for making airplanes, had never built an electro-optical or radar-imaging spy satellite. But with the European Airbus consortium threatening its commercial airliner business, the company was trying to diversify. 
 By contrast, the other invited bidder, Lockheed, saw the contract almost as an entitlement, military and government officials said. 
 Lockheed all but owned the imagery-satellite franchise. Over four decades, as the company built successive generations of satellites, the government had, in effect, invested more than $30 billion in its operations. What is more, Lockheed had recently acquired the traditional builder of radar-imagining satellites, Martin Marietta (and with it a new name, Lockheed Martin).
 ''Lockheed believed it had this program in the bag,'' said Leslie Lewis, a military analyst who reviewed the project for a Rand Corporation study. 
 As Boeing mobilized, Ed Nowinski seemed the perfect man to pursue the prize. 
 Mr. Nowinski, 63, was familiar with the concept of smaller satellites from his years at the C.I.A. An electrical engineer, he had joined the agency in 1967 and worked on the first electro-optical systems. Eventually, he became head of the agency's satellite development programs and of imagery operations at the National Reconnaissance Office and received several medals for distinguished service. 
 Former co-workers describe Mr. Nowinski as a fine engineer and an easy colleague, an unassuming man who took pride in working on secret projects that enhanced American security. They also said he could be insufficiently demanding, a potential weakness for someone running a multibillion-dollar project. Mr. Nowinski did not contest the description in an interview. 
 His government career had ended abruptly in October 1995, when the C.I.A. fired him for using a government car for personal travel. Mr. Nowinski said he was trying to make the most efficient use of his time when he was swamped with work and had to travel frequently between his home and several government offices in the Washington area.
 In 1998, a former C.I.A. colleague, Robert J. Kohler, invited Mr. Nowinski to help Boeing put together its satellite proposal. He was soon living in a rented apartment near the Boeing defense systems offices in Seal Beach, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week on Team 377, the company's secret planning group. 
 ''I never imagined they would recompete the business,'' Mr. Nowinski said. ''When Lockheed didn't call, Bob and I figured we'd go with the underdog.''
 Mr. Kohler recalled that Team 377 requested $100 million just to draft the proposal; he said Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's president at the time, gave his approval the next day. Before long, more than 300 engineers and other specialists were at work in Seal Beach. 
 If they looked like underdogs, they had history on their side. Mr. Fitzgerald, the reconnaissance office's former deputy director, said the government had traditionally found it hard to resist new bidders on space programs, with their allure of new ideas and lower costs. Indeed, of 18 government space programs re-opened for competitive bidding between 1977 and 2002, all but two ended up changing hands, he said. 
 Mr. Fitzgerald explained the dynamic this way: ''You as the incumbent are probably going to write a realistic proposal because you know what's involved and propose pretty much what you've been doing, since it has been successful. Your competitor, out of ignorance or guile, is going to write probably a more imaginative, creative proposal for which there is almost no backing.''
 He added, ''It's a little like a divorce, and running off with another woman.''
 The leaders of Team 377 realized that the best hope of impressing the satellite agency was to design a system that was cheaper and better -- more technologically daring -- than anything Lockheed might propose. Having worked closely with Lockheed while at the C.I.A., Mr. Kohler said: ''I knew what Lockheed Martin was going to do. We would do things 180 degrees differently.''
 Multiple Design Challenges
 Designing and building a precision-pointing, high-resolution electro-optical satellite -- roughly the equivalent of the Hubble Space Telescope -- requires melding many engineering disciplines. 
 The satellite must withstand the explosive force of being rocketed into orbit, then operate flawlessly for years in the unforgiving environment of space.
 To position itself for picture taking, it requires delicately tuned attitude control and propulsion systems. 
 The electro-optical system presented an especially formidable challenge. The large, heavy satellites of the past had been effective at limiting the movement and vibrations that might mar picture taking, just as a tripod can eliminate blurred images with hand-held cameras. 
 ''If you vibrate, you're looking at Jupiter,'' one satellite expert said.
 Boeing, in effect, sought to replace the tripod with a system that would automatically adjust the image to compensate for any vibration, much as a camcorder does, but on a far grander, more exacting scale. 
 The team also wanted an optical system that could take wide-angle images, showing large areas on the ground, as well as tightly focused, detailed pictures of small objects. The goal, to use an oversimplified analogy, was a revolutionary zoom lens. 
 As for the radar-imaging satellite, Boeing designed a relatively simple system with one major exception: to improve image quality, it would produce a far stronger radar signal than any previous satellite had.
 Pulling off such complex new technology typically requires extensive testing and work on multiple solutions to especially difficult problems. There is no margin for error -- once in orbit, a broken satellite cannot be easily fixed.
 Yet the budget for F.I.A. was limited and not very elastic, unlike those for many earlier projects.
 ''Some programs are slightly underfunded, some are significantly underfunded,'' said Mr. Young, chairman of one of the panels that examined the project and a former Martin Marietta executive. ''F.I.A. was grossly underfunded.''
 Congress had set a cap of $5 billion for the first five years, with spending limited to $1 billion a year. (It also budgeted $5 billion more for the life of the project, including multiple satellites.) While the prime contractor could seek additional financing for unanticipated costs, the contract would discourage overruns or delays with financial penalties.
 Also, the satellite agency, under pressure from Congress to control costs, would no longer have a reserve fund. ''From 1961 to 1995, the N.R.O. had never delivered a program that I'm aware of on cost or on schedule,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said, adding, ''But we always had this margin that would allow us to buy our way out of problems.''
 To underscore the importance of the budget cap, the agency changed its system for scoring contract bids. Previously, price had rarely accounted for more than 25 percent of a company's score. Now it would account for 50 percent.
 As Boeing was putting the finishing touches on its proposal, Mr. Kohler said he warned the company that a $5 billion bid was unrealistic.
 ''I did a simple calculation,'' he recalled. ''I took what it had cost to build a comparably complex system before, figured in inflation, and realized the project would cost $4 billion more than the government had planned and Boeing was proposing.
 ''I said, '''We can't submit that bid.'''
 Mr. Nowinski rejects the idea that the bid was off base. ''We were very meticulous in putting together the proposal,'' he said. Still, he acknowledged, ''It's true there was little if any margin to work with.''
 Mr. Fitzgerald compared the bidding to liar's poker, a game based on the serial numbers on dollar bills that relies heavily on bluffing and gamesmanship.
 ''There's a lot of money on the table, and no wants to say that they can't do it,'' he said. The ethic, he added, is ''win the program at any cost and sort it out later. Correct the government's sins and my sins with overruns.''
 This time around, that would prove impossible. 
 Winning Bid Is Announced
 The National Reconnaissance Office announced its decision on Sept. 3, 1999, after studying the bids for nearly a year. The top brass at Seal Beach gathered in shirt sleeves at 9 a.m. in the office of Roger Roberts, head of Boeing's satellite operations. Over the speakerphone, an agency official read a brief statement awarding both satellites to Boeing. 
 ''The room was momentarily silent,'' Mr. Nowinski recalled. ''We hadn't really expected to win the whole project. We figured we'd be lucky to get the radar system. I was stunned.''
 They threw open the door and informed a crowd of colleagues waiting in the outer office. The room erupted in cheers.
 The final decision had been made by Keith R. Hall, who became the satellite agency's director in 1997 after serving as a senior intelligence official and deputy staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
 Mr. Hall, now a vice president of the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, recalled in an interview that though both bids claimed to fall within the spending cap, an agency evaluation team had calculated that only Boeing's actually would. Its plan was also deemed the more technologically innovative.
 Even a former Lockheed Martin executive vice president, Albert E. Smith, acknowledged that ''Boeing wrote a better, cheaper proposal than we did.'' 
 The upshot, Mr. Hall said, was that there was really ''no choice in the source selection.'' He added that he considered the Boeing proposal executable, if moderately risky. 
 The award announcement had barely been completed, though, when dissenting grenades started landing at the satellite agency.
 Lockheed Martin, infuriated by the decision, filed a protest, which froze the project for several months as the agency reviewed its decision. 
 Eventually, Lockheed Martin withdrew its protest. Dennis R. Boxx, the company's senior vice president for corporate communications, said he could not comment on classified projects. But government and industry officials said the company stood down after the agency awarded it a consolation prize, a relatively small piece of the project.
 Within a few months, two cost-estimating groups, one operated by the Pentagon, the other by the office that coordinates work among intelligence agencies, determined that the Boeing plan would bust the budget caps.
 By then, Mr. Hall said, it was too late to reopen the bidding. 
 Nor did the cheering last long at Seal Beach. As Boeing moved from writing its proposal to building the hardware, assembling a work force of thousands, outside engineers questioned the photo satellite's intricate optical system. 
 ''There were a lot of bright young people involved in developing the concept, but they hadn't been involved in manufacturing sophisticated optical systems,'' said one military industry executive familiar with the project. ''It soon became clear the system could not be built.''
 The design was eventually supplanted by a more conventional approach, partly to accommodate added intelligence collection requirements from Washington, Mr. Nowinski said. 
 Expectations about relying on the commercial satellite industry for parts and know-how proved wrong, since those companies curtailed production and laid off experienced technicians after the dot-com collapse.
 Soon, defective parts began showing up in critical components, forcing costly delays at Boeing and some subcontractors. 
 'The No. 1 problem that killed us on this project was substandard parts,'' Mr. Nowinski said. 
 One of the electro-optical satellite's most important components -- a set of oversize gyroscopes that help adjust the spacecraft's attitude for precision picture-taking -- was flawed, said engineers involved in the project. The problem was traced to a subcontractor that had changed its manufacturing process for a crucial part, inadvertently producing a subtle but disabling alteration in the metallic structure that went undetected until Boeing discovered it, three years into the project. 
 Several kinds of integrated circuits for the electro-optical satellite also proved defective. Even rudimentary parts like electric cabling were unfit for use, several engineers said. Customized wiring did not conform to the orders and in some cases was contaminated by dirt.
 As for the sister satellite, Mr. Nowinski said, ''We thought the radar system would be a piece of cake.''
 But the plans were impeded by unexpected difficulties in increasing the strength of the radar signals that would be bounced off the earth. The problem, among other things, involved a vacuum-tube device called a traveling wave tube assembly. Perhaps most surprising was the appearance of parts containing tin, forbidden because it tends to sprout tiny irregularities, known as ''tin whiskers,'' in space. One military industry executive said he was astounded when, several years into the project, he got a form letter from Boeing telling suppliers not to use tin.
 ''That told me there had been a total breakdown in discipline and systems engineering on the project,'' he said, ''and that the company was operating on cruise control.''
 Signs of a Project in Trouble
 The tight schedule called for the radar-imaging satellite to be delivered in 2004 and its sister spacecraft the next year. Three years before that first deadline, government and industry officials say, it was becoming clear that the project was in trouble. 
 As costs escalated, Boeing cut back on testing and efforts to work several potential solutions to difficult technical problems. If a component failed, Boeing, lacking a backup approach, had to return to square one, forcing new delays. 
 Yet the company hesitated to report setbacks and ask for additional financing. 
 ''When you've got a flawed program, or a flawed contract, you really have an obligation to go the customer and tell them,'' Mr. Young said. ''Boeing wasn't doing that.''
 The reason, according to an internal reconnaissance office post-mortem, was the budget cap, and the steep financial penalties for exceeding it. ''The cost of an overrun was so ruinous that the strongest incentive it provided to the contractor was to prove they were on cost,'' the post-mortem found. 
 It did not help that the government ordered two major and several minor design changes that added $1 billion to cost projections. The changes, government and industry officials said, were intended to give the electro-optical satellite the flexibility to perform additional functions. 
 It was against this backdrop that Mr. Teets, the satellite agency's new director, formed the review group in May 2002 that recommended pressing on and seeking new financing. 
 The next year, the government ordered up another look at the project, as part of a broader examination of failing military space programs. The study, led by Mr. Young, reported that F.I.A. was ''significantly underfunded and technically flawed'' and ''was not executable.''
 By this time, the government had approved an additional $3.6 billion. Still, rather than recommending cancellation, the Young panel said the program could be salvaged with even more financing and changes in the program and schedule.
 In an interview, Mr. Young said the panel genuinely thought the project could be saved. Several members, though, said the group should have called for ending the program but stopped short because of its powerful supporters in Congress and the Bush administration. Among the most influential was Representative Jane Harman, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, whose Southern California district includes the Boeing complex where the satellites were being assembled. 
 The death sentence for F.I.A. was finally written in 2005. Another review board pronounced the program deeply flawed and said propping it up would require another $5 billion -- raising the ante to $18 billion -- and five more years. And even with that life support, Mr. Fitzgerald recalled, the panel was not confident that Boeing could come through. 
 That September, the director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, killed the electro-optical program on the recommendation of the reconnaissance office's new director, Donald M. Kerr. Lockheed was engaged to reopen its production line and build an updated model of its old photo satellite. 
 Government officials say the delivery date for that model has slipped to 2009. Late last year, a Lockheed satellite carrying experimental imagery equipment failed to communicate with ground controllers after reaching orbit, rendering it useless. 
 Boeing calculated that its revenue losses from the cancellation would total about $1.7 billion for 2005 and 2006, less than 2 percent of forecast revenues. Having kept the radar-satellite contract, the company is expected to deliver the first one in 2008 or early 2009, at least four years behind the original schedule. 
 The Search for Lessons
 The satellite agency and military experts are still sifting through the wreckage, looking for lessons -- beyond the budget issues -- that would prevent a similar meltdown in the future.
 In an interview in September, Mr. Kerr, who last month became principal deputy director of national intelligence, said a pivotal factor was selecting a company with no experience building imagery spy satellites, especially when contractors were being given greater responsibility for monitoring their own work. Boeing, he said, was ''in a way exquisitely unprepared to exercise judgment in certain areas because it wasn't within their own experience.''
 The satellite office's oversight is faulted, too. Jimmie D. Hill, a former deputy director, said transferring management authority to military contractors was a morale killer for officers who worked on Air Force satellite projects, many of whom had been recruited to be midlevel managers at the National Reconnaissance Office.
 ''Most of the best and the brightest young captains and majors said, 'To hell with it, there's nothing for me to do here, I'm going to go do something that's interesting,''' Mr. Hill said. ''And so you have a void in capability right now.'' 
 There is wide agreement among military experts that F.I.A. sunk under a surfeit of data demands and technological risks. 
 ''There's a good rule on projects like this,'' said Representative Heather A. Wilson, a New Mexico Republican on the Intelligence Committee. ''Aim for only one miracle per program.'' 
 The government has taken remedial steps. While still at the satellite agency, Mr. Kerr said he was working to attract and keep experienced engineers and to improve cost-estimating and systems-engineering expertise. At his invitation, Virginia Tech University is offering a master's program in engineering management at agency headquarters outside Washington.
 Mr. Munson, the deputy national intelligence director for acquisition, said competitive bidding for space programs would be initiated only among companies deemed qualified. And the intelligence office has formed an independent cost-estimating group to review project proposals and set budgets. ''We are not going to start programs we can't afford,'' he said.
 Keith Hall, the man who chose Boeing to build F.I.A., said the cost caps distorted the entire enterprise. 
 ''If I had to do it over again, I should have decided at the time the cost cap was levied that we would just keep building what we had been building,'' he said, referring to the Lockheed satellites. ''I shouldn't have allowed it to go forward.'' 
 In the dying days of F.I.A., Boeing fired Ed Nowinski. He returned to his retirement home in Florida, where he keeps a hand in the space business as a consultant.
 He blames himself for some of the tribulations.
 ''You know, I might have been exactly the wrong guy for this project,'' he said. ''After 25 to 30 years in the government, I think too much like a government guy. I was too sympathetic to the government, tried too hard to make their jobs easier.''
 He also faults himself for failing to assemble a stronger team at Boeing. ''I should have been more brutal with the government and with my people,'' he said. 
 Mr. Nowinski remains convinced that with adequate time and money, Boeing could have built the electro-optical satellite. ''We had solved most of the problems,'' he said. 
 But, he added, ''When they say, 'We're turning the lights out, the game is over,' you might as well go home.''

LENGTH: 557 words

HEADLINE: The Dollar In Free Fall/Nov. 4-10

 BODY:
THE NEWS The dollar sank to a new low against the euro and to its lowest level in decades against the Canadian dollar and British pound.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The drop followed reports midweek that China might reduce the percentage of its $1.4 trillion in foreign currency reserves held in dollars and put it into other currencies to get a better return. Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, didn't help matters when he warned that the economy would slow noticeably. But the dollar could have fallen even more if he had signaled that the Fed might lower interest rates again, since such cuts have helped to weaken the dollar, which tends to fall when interest rates decline.
 THE NEWS The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, warned that the sharp decline in the value of the dollar could lead to an ''economic war.'' 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Sarkozy raised his concerns in a speech before a joint meeting of Congress. After expressing his love of the American dream and admiration for American values, he complained that the Bush administration had stood by as the dollar sank, undermining Europe's competitiveness. The world's leading exponent of free trade, he said, ''should be the first to promote fair exchange rates.'' He added: ''If we're not careful, monetary disarray could morph into economic war. We would all be its victims.'' 
 THE NEWS The United States trade deficit fell to its lowest level in 28 months as the falling dollar pushed American exports to an all-time high.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Economists had been forecasting that the deficit would rise; in fact, it dipped by 0.6 percent in September from August to $56.5 billion, the narrowest imbalance since May 2005. The decline in the dollar has made American goods cheaper and more competitive in foreign markets. Sales of American-made cars, computers and farm products were all up in September as exports jumped 1.1 percent to a record $140.1 billion. But some economists said surging oil prices might widen the trade deficit in coming months.
 THE NEWS The falling dollar has made foreign travel for American tourists much more expensive, but a bargain for visitors to the United States.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The number of American visitors to Britain has dropped significantly, according to The Independent in London, and a tourism official in Ireland said he expected to see only half the number of Americans this year than he had originally anticipated. But foreign visitors are flocking to the United States. ''We've seen a huge increase in Canadians, and an increase in European visitors,'' said Cathy Keefe, a Travel Industry Association spokeswoman. ''A lot of it is that its too much of a bargain to pass up.''
 THE NEWS The rapper Jay-Z is seen in his new video flashing 500-euro bills, and the supermodel Gisele Bundchen reportedly asked be paid in euros, not dollars.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Are euros the new bling? Jay-Z's video speaks for itself; Ms. Bundchen's manager later denied the report. But it was enough to send Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ''Mad Money,'' over the edge. He said the rapper and the model shared blame for last week's market plunge. It was tongue in cheek, he later told The Boston Herald, but added: ''When things have gotten to the point that even people like Gisele and Jay-Z realize the dollar is too weak, things have gotten out of control.''

HEADLINE: Credit Crisis Keeps Weighing on Stocks

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market declined sharply last week, and technology stocks, which had bolstered the market for weeks, fell into a swoon. 
 The toll of the months-long credit crunch mounted, as financial companies, including Wachovia, Morgan Stanley and the American International Group, took new write-downs. 
 Congressional testimony by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, contributed to the gloom. Mr. Bernanke said that the economy was slowing, but that rising oil prices were stoking inflation -- seeming to suggest that the Fed would not lower interest rates again soon. 
 Shares of Qualcomm, Apple, Google and Oracle all had deep losses. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 552.36 points, or 4.1 percent, to close at 13,042.74. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 55.95 points, or 3.7 percent, to close at 1,453.70. The Nasdaq composite index declined 182.44 points, or 6.5 percent, to close at 2,627.94.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.21 percent from 4.32 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: Perhaps Too Many Acts In the Corporate Tent

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
AS two of America's biggest companies, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, scramble to find a leader and hundreds of thousands of employees wonder who their next boss will be, management gurus are quietly asking another question: are these companies simply too big or too complex for any one person to run?
 The abrupt resignations of E. Stanley O'Neal at Merrill Lynch and Charles O. Prince III at Citi in recent weeks, following more than $15 billion in combined losses at their companies, has done more than expose how unprepared Wall Street was for a market meltdown; it has also revealed just how difficult it has become to manage these behemoths. 
 ''Across the board, people are wondering if their companies are too big and unwieldy and unfocused,'' says Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for executive programs at the School of Management at Yale. On Wall Street, he adds, size creates special dangers. ''Staying on top of risk in such a sprawling business is hard.''
 Roy Smith, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and now a professor of finance at New York University, points to the very different experiences of Citigroup and his former employer during the recent subprime crisis. 
 Goldman's losses, he notes, were a fraction of those of Citigroup, even though both companies were active in the same businesses. ''Maybe it's because Goldman has 30,000 employees while Citi has 10 times that many,'' he says. ''Therefore, they are able to be more focused on the more limited number of things they do.''
 It's not only financial companies that are facing questions. One day after Mr. Prince quit, Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of another company that was the product of megamergers, Time Warner, announced that he, too, would retire at the end of the year.
 Time Warner's stock price is the same as it was five years ago when Mr. Parsons succeeded Gerald M. Levin, who presided over the megadeal with AOL that's widely considered to be among the biggest -- and most disastrous -- mergers ever. Mr. Parsons will remain chairman, however.
 Throughout his tenure, Mr. Parsons has struggled to offer a convincing rationale for businesses as diverse as publishing, cable television and film production to be under one roof. And Citigroup operates in more than 100 countries, employs roughly 370,000 workers and offers services ranging from credit cards (120 million accounts in the United States alone) to banking, mortgages and asset management. 
 ''The concept of Citigroup and Time Warner as unified companies is questionable,'' says William W. George, the former chief executive of Medtronic, a medical device maker, who teaches at Harvard Business School. ''Maybe what was put together is simply too broad.''
 Of course, just as fashion styles come and go, so has the favored model for the American corporation. In the 1960s and 1970s, conglomerates like ITT and Gulf + Western were all the rage. But in the 1980s, investors began to complain about poor performance and an obvious lack of synergy (Gulf + Western owned everything from sugar plantations to movie studios), and the conglomerates were broken up.
 By the late 1990s and the early part of this decade, it seemed like the conglomerate was making a reappearance. Now in the wake of the departure of Mr. Parsons, Mr. Prince and Mr. O'Neal, the question of whether size matters in corporate America is up for debate again. ''We're at an inflection point,'' says Mr. Sonnenfeld. ''If the economy weakens, it might be more likely these giants will be broken up.''
 It is unclear whether the model of a supersize company will be shelved, but executives will certainly want to re-examine one of primary rationales behind it -- diversification. The theory, at least, was that losses in one area would be offset by gains in another. That safety net clearly didn't work for Citigroup. 
 Whatever happens, it's clear that investors are losing their patience with chief executives who can't deliver. A study of 2,500 top global companies by Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm, found that annual turnover among chief executives increased by 59 percent between 1995 and 2006. Over the same period, according to the survey, involuntary exits from the corner office soared. One in eight departures was involuntary in 1995; by 2006, the ratio was nearly one in three.
 One explanation for that trend, says Steven Wheeler, a senior vice president at Booz Allen, is not necessarily size but complexity. ''The ability to run and make changes in one division doesn't translate into the ability to do that in another and as C.E.O. you're responsible for the whole business,'' he says.
 Other experts insist the problem isn't size or complexity, but the skill of the individual chief executive and his or her top team. And that's what was lacking at Merrill and Citigroup, according to Noel M. Tichy, a leading management authority at the University of Michigan and co-author of the new book ''Judgment: How Winning Leaders Make Great Calls.''
 Big companies, he says, are especially vulnerable if they don't take the time to train and develop future chief executives. ''What you're seeing is broken leadership pipelines,'' he says. ''Merrill and Citi never invested in their pipelines.''
 As for complexity, Mr. Tichy argues that General Electric has prospered despite having a stable of businesses as varied as jet engines, commercial finance and light bulbs. In part, he says, that's because Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive, spends 25 days each year on succession planning and cultivating future G.E. leaders.
 ''G.E. is far more complex than either Merrill or Citigroup,'' he says. ''Don't tell me the problem is that they're too big or too complex. The key variable is talent.''

HEADLINE: A Bad Mood May Turn Worse

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WHEN traders are nervous, danger lurks in every economic report. Two potentially perilous pieces of data this week are snapshots of October inflation.
 Wholesale and retail prices have been moving ahead at yearly rates well above 2 percent, believed to be the Federal Reserve's unofficial target, and the overall trend for last month is thought to have been an acceleration. 
 A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates that two indicators of wholesale prices to be released on Wednesday, the broad Producer Price Index and the core index, which excludes volatile food and energy items, rose by 0.3 percent last month.
 The core Consumer Price Index, to be announced the next day, is predicted to have increased by 0.2 percent, with the broader index up 0.3 percent. That would push the year-over-year growth rate in the more inclusive C.P.I. to about 3.5 percent from 2.8 percent.
 Anything close to the consensus projection is likely to be taken badly on Wall Street, cautioned P. Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at the fund manager TIAA-CREF. If the annual rate tops 3 percent, ''the markets will really react negatively,'' he said. Selling may occur even if the rate holds at 2.8 percent, he added.
 A sell-off would result not only from bad numbers, Mr. Hammond said, but also from a pervasive bad mood among investors.
 ''Everybody's nervous,'' he said. ''The big picture here is that we've gone from a period where every piece of information was shrugged off or interpreted positively, to one where information is shrugged off if it's positive or else interpreted negatively.''
 Another sign of collective angst is the succession of violent swings in stock prices in recent weeks, Mr. Hammond said. An index of stock market volatility known as the VIX has risen to the mid-20s from record-low levels of around 10 at the start of the year. A Merrill Lynch index of volatility in Treasury bond prices has also gone up, he noted.
 Those indicators of nervousness make him nervous.
 ''The issue is, if we see a lot of volatility, historically that has been accompanied by a greater likelihood of down markets,'' he warned.
 DATA WATCH Retail sales for October are scheduled to be announced at the same time as producer prices. The Bloomberg poll anticipates a 0.2 percent increase after a 0.6 percent climb in September.
 Two indicators of recent economic activity in the Northeast are expected to show weakness. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey in New York is forecast to show a sharp drop, to a November reading of 18.5 from 28.8 last month. And a decline to 5.0 from 6.8 is foreseen in the business outlook survey compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Both reports are due on Thursday.

HEADLINE: In the Bond Market, a Bleak Prognosis for Iraq

BYLINE: By AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. He is advising the campaign of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois for the Democratic presidential nomination. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S surge of troops in Iraq has done little to resolve the political debate over the Iraq war. But global financial markets have been monitoring the war for months, and with remarkable consistency, they have concluded that the long-term prospects for a stable Iraq are very bleak.
 That is the picture that emerges from a study by Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, titled, ''Is the 'Surge' Working? Some New Facts,'' which has been circulating as a working paper in academic circles. 
 Professor Greenstone started by reviewing basic statistics on the Iraqi economy and on the battle for security within Iraq since February. This data provided a murky view, at best.
 He found that civilian deaths in Iraq had fallen substantially in recent months. At the same time, though, he found little change in the rate of American and Iraqi military fatalities, while the recruitment of members of the new Iraqi security forces declined sharply. On the industrial side, crude oil production fell as much as 20 percent, but there was evidence of a slight improvement in the availability of electricity.
 Sifting through these facts was time-consuming, but it provided little real guidance on the state of affairs in Iraq. 
 It wasn't until Professor Greenstone began examining the financial markets' pricing of Iraqi government debt that he had his eureka moment. It was immediately clear that the bond market -- which, historically, has often been an early indicator of the demise of a political system -- was pessimistic about the Iraqi government's chances for survival.
 First, some background on the Iraqi bonds. After the United States helped Iraq renegotiate its leftover debt from the Saddam Hussein era, the Iraqi government issued about $3 billion of new bonds in January 2006. These dollar-denominated bonds pay 2.9 percent twice a year and mature in 2028, paying the face value of $100. 
 To say the least, the market for these bonds is not robust: as of last week, a bond with a face value of $100 was trading at around $60. Professor Greenstone calculated that, from the markets' standpoint, the implied default risk over the life of the bond was about 80 percent.
 The important point is that anyone who owns one of these Iraqi bonds has to decide each day whether the Iraqi government is likely to be functional enough to make its debt payments, or will default along the way. All else being equal, if the surge policy is effective, it ought to be raising the market price of these bonds.
 Bondholders ''aren't politically motivated,'' Professor Greenstone said. ''They don't have to rationalize their previous statements or justify their votes from years past. All they care about is whether there will be a functioning Iraq in the future such that they will receive their payments.'' At a certain price, most securities will find a buyer, and there are still buyers for Iraqi bonds. But the price they are willing to pay is very low.
 Of course, it's worth asking whether bond traders know anything more about Iraq than the pundits do. It's impossible to say with certainty, but the collective wisdom of financial markets has proved remarkably adept at evaluating events and predicting the future, even the turning points of war. 
 During the American Civil War, for example, when Confederate forces lost at Gettysburg, Confederate cotton bonds traded in England dropped by about 14 percent. During World War II, German government bonds fell 7 percent when the Russians started their counterattack at Stalingrad in 1942, and French government bonds rose 16 percent after the Allied invasion at Normandy in 1944. Many such examples of the prescience of financial markets have been documented by economic historians. 
 Comparing the yields on Iraqi bonds from the start of the surge in February to late August, Professor Greenstone calculated that the bondholders implicitly raised the chances of an Iraqi bond default by 40 percent. Over that period, Iraqi bond prices fell about 14 percent -- as much as the Confederate cotton bonds fell after the battle of Gettysburg. 
 Professor Greenstone is quick to acknowledge that the bond evidence does not necessarily imply anything about the surge as a military tactic. The American troop buildup might be giving the Iraqi government a reprieve, but over the long term, most bondholders seem to have concluded, it's a lost cause. 
 In an interview, Professor Greenstone used a medical analogy to describe the possibility that the surge might be defined as successful, but would still result in the demise of the Iraqi government. ''It might be a heart surgery that failed so the patient is dying,'' he said, ''or a heart surgery that succeeded but during the operation they found a deadly liver cancer so the patient is dying. Either way, though, the guy is dying.''
 HE also knows that the late-summer turmoil in global bond markets because of the subprime housing problems and the ensuing credit crisis could complicate his analysis. But he points to two important pieces of evidence suggesting that the overall problems in the credit markets did not cause the Iraqi bond meltdown. 
 First, the Iraqi bonds were already falling before the subprime crisis began, and at no point did they ever rise above their pre-surge levels. So even if you do not attribute the entire 40 percent increase in the chance of default to the surge, there is certainly no evidence that it reduced the odds. 
 Second, and more important, while the bond-market turmoil affected all kinds of debt, the plunge in the value of Iraqi bonds has been much worse. Professor Greenstone's data shows that Iraqi bonds have fallen not just in comparison with safe United States Treasuries but also when compared with those of nearby Qatar, and with a broad range of risky emerging-market bonds.
 In the market, people vote with their money, and the vote is not going well for the new Iraq. Politicians in the United States may be divided over whether the surge has raised the chances of political reconciliation in Iraq. But the bond market has already made its message clear: don't bet on it.

HEADLINE: Dollar Gets a Snub From the Catwalk

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
As if the weakening dollar didn't have enough problems last week -- new lows against the euro, speculation that the Chinese might shift their huge reserves away from the currency and fears that the American economy is slowing -- it turns out that there may be an even bigger worry. 
 The supermodel Gisele Bundchen may no longer consider dollars fashionable. Ms. Bundchen, who once dated Leonardo DiCaprio and modeled for Victoria's Secret, now wants to be paid in euros, according to a report on Monday from Bloomberg News. 
 Her United States manager, Anne Nelson, quickly told CNBC that the report was false, but the story was enough to prompt an editorial in The Wall Street Journal and many more Web hits than currency fluctuations normally produce. 
 Whatever the truth, there's no denying that the dollar's descent has not been pretty for foreigners exporting their goods and services to the United States, even if they are supermodels. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
 COLA CAMARADERIE Despite their heated rivalry, Pepsi paid its respects to Coke at the Asia Society's annual dinner in Manhattan last week, which honored E. Neville Isdell, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, for advancing Asian-American relations.
 In his remarks, Mr. Isdell said he wanted to ''recognize that tonight our competitor, Pepsi-Cola, has taken a table.''
 ''I want to thank them for doing that, because we fight in the marketplace every day, but what we try to do together is to build better and more successful societies,'' he added.
 What he did not mention was that Indra K. Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo, is a member of the society's board and was born and raised in India. PepsiCo bought a $25,000 table at the dinner held at the Waldorf-Astoria. JANE L. LEVERE
 PARTING WAYS A gala at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last week to note the 25th season of its Next Wave Festival was a swan song of sorts for the Altria Group, which is expected to stop funding more than 200 arts groups in New York City because of a corporate reorganization and a move of its headquarters to Richmond, Va.
 Altria has been the main sponsor of the festival, which showcases international contemporary performing arts groups, since it began in 1983, donating $8.6 million. The Brooklyn Academy is one of five New York arts groups that received the most money from Altria. The event honored both Altria and Hamish Maxwell, a retired chairman of the Philip Morris Companies, which was renamed Altria in 2003. 
 Asked who could replace Altria as the angel to the arts, Mr. Maxwell answered, ''people who made a lot of money in a very short period of time and who are looking for something useful in society to do with some of it. They won't notice it.'' JANE L. LEVERETEAM INTACT Retiring executives get all sorts of post-employment perquisites, but rarely do they get to take other employees with them when they leave. Jackson W. Moore, who is retiring as executive chairman of the Regions Financial Corporation, has worked out just that sort of arrangement with his secretary, Jesse Boyd.
 Regions, a bank based in Birmingham, Ala., has agreed to pay for Mr. Moore and his family, as well as Ms. Boyd, to move to Memphis. The company will set up an office there for Mr. Moore and Ms. Boyd for a year, according to a retirement agreement that the company filed with regulators last week. That office will have similarities to one Mr. Moore had there before a merger took him to Birmingham. 
 Mr. Moore has already collected $25 million from his retirement plan and $10 million in severance from another merger last year. But when Regions stops providing him the Memphis office, he will be able to keep a computer, printer and fax machine, according to the deal. PATRICK McGEEHAN
 OOPS, YOUR MAJESTY Even titans of the universe can commit faux pas, as Howard Stringer, chairman and chief executive of the Sony Corporation, acknowledged last week.
 Speaking at the 92nd Street Y in New York, he described his experience being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. 
 Mr. Stringer said he knelt before the queen in Buckingham Palace and that she touched each of his shoulders with a sword. Then he said he made a mistake by turning around instead of walking backward, bowing and turning away. ''I realized as I turned around, I'd turned my back on the queen, so I just kept going. I did a complete 360 degrees,'' he said. ''So I'm back in front of the queen and she's looking slightly puzzled, and I could see the queen's equerries rolling their eyes.''
 Despite this, Mr. Stringer called the experience ''perfectly charming.'' However, he added, ''You don't get any money for it or anything like that.'' JANE L. LEVERE

HEADLINE: Fighting a Disease of Logistics, He Means Business

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
WHEN Lance Laifer, a hedge fund manager in New Jersey and former Internet entrepreneur, started researching malaria two and a half years ago, a prominent professor with a medical background told him that doctors were not drawn to malaria research because it was a disease of logistics. ''Doctors don't do logistics,'' Mr. Laifer recalls that he said. ''Business does logistics.''
 So started Mr. Laifer's journey to make malaria -- a treatable and preventable disease that kills 3,000 children a day in Africa -- a screaming priority for hedge funds, businesses, governments and individuals. 
 ''One of the lessons from the Holocaust was not to allow preventable deaths,'' Mr. Laifer says. ''We can stomach this because it doesn't happen to our neighbors, to our kids.'' 
 Mr. Laifer, 43, is neither the most successful fund-raiser for malaria control nor its highest-profile advocate. (Lately that would be a tossup among Ashley Judd the singer, David Beckham the soccer star and George W. Bush, the president of the United States.) 
 But through Hedge Funds Vs. Malaria, an advocacy group he founded before malaria became an ''it'' charity, Mr. Laifer has used innovative ideas to sound the alarm and set up programs to treat it or start to prevent it. He has also raised more than $1 million to combat the disease. 
 ''Lance single-handedly made investors in New York aware of malaria,'' said Ken Shubin Stein, a managing director at Spencer Capital Management, a New York hedge fund. ''He made us realize we could do something about it.''
 Mr. Laifer has inspired people to fast against malaria and to dunk basketballs around the world, using any net available. He recently began a Facebook campaign called ''One Million Faces Against Malaria,'' trying to show what one million people look like, since at least that many people die every year of malaria. He has also worked with doctors and economists to build health clinics in Africa, create 11 malaria-free zones and develop programs to train child soldiers to become child doctors.
 Awareness has been raised. Malaria No More, a nongovernmental organization focused on educating the private sector, estimates that financing for the fight against malaria is up 300 percent in the last three years, to $2 billion. 
 This offers scant comfort to Mr. Laifer. ''We've raised a lot of attention, but there's the same amount of death,'' he said. ''How can you feel good about that? Any day that someone dies of a mosquito bite is a tragedy of epic proportions.''
 Last year, he and Rob Mather, chief executive of Against Malaria, a British charity, started Madness Against Malaria, a riff on March Madness, the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, to harness the excitement that people feel about their sports team and put it toward rescuing dying children. ''You don't have the same excitement about saving lives,'' Mr. Laifer said. 
 For the inaugural Madness Against Malaria, 168 teams registered (anyone can; teams included sixth-grade students in Philadelphia and hedge fund managers like Whitney Tilson), and the 64 that raised the most money qualified to compete in March 2007. For six weeks, teams faced off against each other online to see who could raise more money for bed nets; the winners advanced to the next round, just like the bracketed N.C.A.A. competition. 
 In the end, more than $104,000 was generated to buy approximately 20,000 insecticide-treated bed nets, a highly effective tool in preventing malaria. Next year's Madness Against Malaria is already under way.
 Mr. Laifer became interested in malaria while watching an interview with Jeffrey Sachs, the Columbia economist, on the ''Charlie Rose'' program. He was stunned to learn that malaria kills 1 million to 3 million people a year; at a minimum, equal to seven jumbo jets filled with mostly women and children a day. 
 Malaria is a perfect business problem: urgent and solvable. Mr. Sachs estimates that it will cost $3 billion a year to eradicate malaria, the equivalent of two days of Pentagon's spending, or $3 for every person in the high-income world. That would cover the cost of medicine ($1 per treatment dose) and the bed nets ($5 per net with each protecting at least two people for three to five years). Africa loses $12 billion a year in productivity to malaria. 
 Although he started a malaria advocacy group, Mr. Laifer decided not to set up his own registered charity. Instead, he has focused his efforts on other nonprofits. In a world where grant dollars are limited, this open-source approach stands out. ''Lance doesn't really care where you are ideologically,'' said Richard Tren, a director of Africa Fighting Malaria, a policy and advocacy group. (Mr. Laifer sits on the board.) ''He works with left of center or right or libertarian, if you are doing bed nets or spraying or just treatment. He's just interested in your results.'' 
 While Mr. Laifer is intensely frustrated by the lack of urgency and ''professionalism'' he sees in the donor community, he understands it. ''We'll take risks that career people can't take and fill in the gaps all together,'' he said. ''We're all one team against the mosquitoes.'' 
 There are strong differences among many groups. For example, Malaria No More charges $10 a net compared with the $5 Mr. Laifer believes it costs. (Nongovernmental organizations like Unicef deliver the nets they donate; Malaria No More includes the cost of distribution and education.) 
 But because Malaria No More delivers the nets and generates awareness, Mr. Laifer supports it, too. Of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a prominent supporter of both malaria control and vaccine, he says: ''I hope by the time they have a vaccine there is no one in the world with malaria.''
 To get there, he wants people and business to make this a long-term priority. He notes that Americans spend $40 billion a year on pet supplies and that there are more Little League coaches in New Jersey than malaria volunteers worldwide. 
 Hedge fund managers, an impassioned and results-oriented species, are one channel. So are businesses. Mr. Laifer wants to see who will own the idea of wiping out malaria: FedEx, the ultimate logistics company? Google, with tentacles in nearly every corner of the planet? 
 ''The blessing of malaria is that it's easy to attack logistically -- it's not about the science,'' Mr. Laifer said. ''It's about: do you have the willpower to save three million lives every year?''

HEADLINE: To Tax or Not to Tax? Cities Ask the Billion-Dollar Question

BYLINE: By TERRY SCHWADRON

 BODY:
DESPITE a long tradition of waiving taxes for charitable nonprofit groups, communities are feeling more pressure to eliminate property-tax exemptions.
 The thinking at federal and local levels has always been that these charitable groups are doing social good, enriching lives culturally or offering services to those in need. 
 ''It's been a covenant with officials that in return for doing good, nonprofits should be exempted from various taxes,'' said Audrey R. Alvarado, the executive director for the National Council on Nonprofit Associations in Washington. ''It is a covenant that comes with privileges in taxes in return for contributing to the community.'' 
 But as communities struggle over diminishing revenue, whispers to eliminate tax breaks have grown louder. Court decisions have supported revocation of exemptions in Illinois and Michigan, among other states. In cities like Boston and Colorado Springs, nonprofits are paying fees for reliance on city services instead of property taxes. 
 Even though museums, hospitals, universities and other nonprofit entities provide quantifiable benefits, cities and towns are finding that property-tax exemptions are costing their communities millions of dollars. ''Continuing battles over nonprofit property tax exemptions have added further to nonprofit uncertainties in many locales,'' according to ''The State of Nonprofit America,'' a 2006 book edited by Lester M. Salamon. 
 No one has documented the cost of exemptions around the country; there are an estimated 837,000 charitable nonprofits in the United States, besides foundations and religious groups. A full analysis would have to include the cost of exemptions from government property, economic zones and religious or veterans groups. Property taxes vary by locality, so the value of exemptions or their percentage of budget is hard to determine accurately. 
 Last year, The Chronicle of Philanthropy surveyed 23 cities to try to determine which nonprofits that seek public support -- excluding foundations, government and religious groups -- receive property-tax exemptions. Such exemptions accounted for more than $1.5 billion a year, with more than half that amount forgiven in New York City and Boston. 
 On average, total property-tax exemptions to charities was about 1.2 percent of city budgets, according to the survey, and about 0.6 percent of property tax assessments, which represent the value of buildings and land on tax rolls. Putting those numbers in perspective, the cost of exemptions to government property in the New York metropolitan area is about three times the impact of exemptions to the city's 15,000 charitable nonprofits. 
 In terms of value, the biggest exemptions after New York and Boston were in Los Angeles, Washington, Houston and Philadelphia. By percentage, the biggest impacts were reported in Denver, Baltimore, San Diego and Memphis. 
 Most property-tax exemptions for nonprofit groups go to hospitals and universities, according to studies. The thought is that hospitals provide services to the poor, a positive community trade-off for the loss of property taxes. But debate is heating up over whether hospitals merit exemptions. A state court in Illinois upheld a local board's revocation of exemptions last year for an Urbana hospital, citing its billing practices as evidence that the hospital should not continue receiving the tax benefit. The hospital later changed its billing policies, and it now pays property taxes. 
 Other hospital cases have attracted interest from members of Congress, including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who said in a statement: ''Nonprofit hospitals receive billions in tax breaks at the federal, state and local level. The public has a right to expect significant, measurable benefits in return.'' 
 In Washington, state officials recommended review of hospital property-tax exemptions worth an estimated $47 million on arguments that the hospitals need to provide more charitable care. In Michigan, the Supreme Court there decided that a medical group operating in a designated health professional shortage area was not entitled to a property-tax exemption as a charitable entity; the courts found that providing free or minimal-cost service was not the group's primary goal. 
 In Schaumburg, Ill., and Phoenix, commercial hospitals are saying they should also be exempt from property taxes because they handle charity cases.
 The Chronicle's survey highlighted several well-known properties beyond hospitals that receive big property-tax breaks. These include the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, exempted from $18.4 million in property tax; the Chrysler Building in New York, owned by the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art college, an exemption worth $17.5 million; and in Philadelphia, the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, exempted from $5 million in annual property tax.
 As a result, more charities and cities are making deals for payments in lieu of property taxes. A government group in Boston, which relies on property taxes for revenue more than most cities, is studying alternatives to tax exemptions. It has discussed policies that might distinguish between university properties used for academics and other uses, for example. Some of the larger charities in Boston pay more than $11 million to the city in return for services like trash collection or municipal emergency services.

HEADLINE: Win Fabulous Prizes, All in the Name of Innovation

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
THE quests are monumental: end global warming; build a private spaceship; cure diseases; develop a car that can go 100 miles on a gallon of gas. 
 But the prizes are also monumental: millions and millions of dollars. 
 Such extreme public interest projects have been taken up by foundations, most prominently the X Prize Foundation, an 11-year-old group in Santa Monica, Calif., that rewards innovation on an entirely new scale. 
 ''The world faces difficult problems -- bigger than government, business and nonprofits can handle,'' said Tom Vander Ark, president of the X Prize Foundation. The foundation encourages entrepreneurship, he said, and ''competitions can create and reshape markets.''
 In 1996, the foundation offered a $10 million prize, called the Ansari X, for someone to invent a private passenger rocket ship able to fly nearly 70 miles up and back again. A team led by the aerospace engineer Burt Rutan, and paid for with more than $20 million from Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, collected the $10 million in 2004. 
 The X Prize Foundation is not alone in its ambitious ventures: Google.org, the nearly two-year-old philanthropic arm of Google, has kicked off a $10 million competition to inspire production of plug-in hybrid vehicles so energy efficient they can sell excess electricity back to the utility. 
 The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Wachovia Foundation and the Opportunity Finance Network are collaborating on a five-year, $41.75 million program to draw philanthropies and businesses closer together. Grants, low-interest loans and awards will go to local institutions that provide credit and financial services to poor communities.
 And the Rockefeller Foundation has a partnership with InnoCentive, a company that uses the Web to match scientists and technicians from 175 countries with Fortune 500 companies. Companies needing expertise pay fees for the service, but the partnership allows organizations that work on education and poverty to use its business- and technology-savvy network at no cost. 
 ''It's a new kind of grant-making,'' said Jonathan Greenblatt, an entrepreneur who sold his company, Ethos Water, to Starbucks and became a senior adviser to the X Prize Foundation. ''It's a mode that encourages experimentation rather than prescribing solutions. It sets the stage for innovation and dynamism that the grantor can't anticipate.''
 Grant programs traditionally finance services and try to influence government policy, not market forces. In most cases, they award modest amounts, develop long-term relationships with grantees and aim to avoid risk. 
 ''Foundations see their role as understanding what the problems are out there, what the solutions are, and what they can do to test the solutions,'' said Mike Burns, a partner in Brody Weiser Burns, a consulting firm in Branford, Conn., that advises nonprofit groups. ''It's very hands off. This is a new breed. They borrow from venture capitalism: they invest the money and have a say in what the outcome is.'' 
 Consultants and others in the foundation world say that the trend toward market-based philanthropy, which started in the 1990s in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, owes much of its momentum to the X Prize. 
 In September, three years after the awarding of the Ansari X Prize, the X Prize Foundation announced a $30 million prize, financed by Google and called the Google Lunar X Prize, for a rover that can land on the moon, travel 550 yards and send high-resolution video and other data back to earth. An Automotive X Prize, still in the works, will go to whoever produces a car that can get 100 miles a gallon. For the $10 million Archon X Prize for Genomics, announced in 2006, applicants aim to speed up human genome sequencing. 
 The foundation, sustained by donors, said in September that it would come up with 12 additional prizes of $20 million or more each in the next seven years. That money will go to thinkers who can alleviate global warming, improve education, cure disease and reduce poverty.
 If the foundation succeeds in raising and distributing the money for these competitions, it will establish some sort of record, prize experts say. But its approach has raised questions in the nonprofit and foundation worlds.
 ''These prizes tend to attract those people who have resources to begin with,'' said Mr. Burns, the consultant, referring to space exploration contests and the like. ''It doesn't serve everyone, nor does it solve social ills. I'm not as excited about these prizes that seem to be nothing more than the pursuit of awards for capitalist happiness.''
 Cash prizes to induce innovation are not new. Peter Diamandis, the 46-year-old aeronautical engineer and physician who founded the X Prize Foundation, said he was inspired by the $25,000 aviation prize offered in 1919 by a New York hotelier, Raymond Orteig, to the first person to fly nonstop from New York to Paris. The prize went, of course, to Charles Lindbergh, whose grandson, Erik Lindbergh, is on the X Prize Foundation board. 
 In the same spirit, ''We asked ourselves, how do we demonstrate the technology and stimulate market interest?'' said Dan Reicher, director of climate and energy initiatives at Google.org. ''How do we advance the technology around plug-ins? The usual way is to quietly go about looking at investment opportunities, make investments and have some impact. We decided to take a different route, a public request for investment proposals. We wanted to look beyond the usual players, bring attention to a critical area and catalyze competition and innovation.''
 Google.org's contest has sparked interest and controversy. ''It's Google -- O.K., they are really cool,'' said Rachel Mosher-Williams, project director of the nonprofit sector and philanthropy program at the Aspen Institute in Washington. ''But they could just be developing a business sector. And is that the right use of philanthropic dollars?'' 
 Supporters of the concept include Thomas A. Kalil, the special assistant to the chancellor for science and technology at the University of California at Berkeley, and the author of a study on prize competitions. ''Prizes are not substitutes for grants,'' he said. ''But under certain circumstances, they work very well.'' 
 Well enough that mainstream foundations like the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City, Mo., and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J., are collaborating with the X Prize Foundation in creating its new prizes. 
 The X Prize Foundation announced the new competitions at the Clinton Global Initiative, a conference organized by former President Bill Clinton and held in September in New York. 
 ''Think of this,'' Mr. Clinton said at the time. ''Twelve prizes in areas designed to break barriers to human health, have children live longer, solve all these education problems and do it in the most cost-effective way. This is the most amazing idea to me, trying to unleash entrepreneurship in the public interest.''

HEADLINE: Living Paycheck to Paycheck Was Already a Way of Life

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Bradford Winters, a screenwriter who lives and works in New York, came home very animated after walking the picket line last Monday, the first day of the Writers Guild of America's strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. 
 ''It was actually pretty upbeat,'' he said as he sat in his third floor walk-up in Brooklyn. ''There was music, I saw people I knew and there was a spirit in the air.'' 
 But he said that on Monday night, when he read that the studio's chief negotiator believed that the strike could last nine months, he gulped long and hard. 
 Between the superstar writer-producers who earn millions (the so-called show runners) and the bitter hanger on-er who sold a spec script eight years ago lies a vast swath of working writers like Mr. Winters who earn a decent but not spectacular living by making people laugh or cry. 
 That not-so-silent majority argues that the DVD residuals and share of digital revenues they are seeking could play a critical role in smoothing out the bumps and providing a kind of R&D money to finance that next wonderful thing.
 Mr. Winters, who is 36, drew his last paycheck in February when the show he was working on, ''Six Degrees,'' was canceled by ABC. He has been writing television for 10 years, so he knows that dry spells are part of the racket. His wife, Tracy, is trained as an immigration lawyer, but she is not working as she has her hands happily full with Ruby, 3, and Penelope, 21 months old. 
 The three were on their way out last Friday night because Ruby had cooked up some caper that involved taking lemons to a guy named Fred across the street. It sounded like the beginning of a nice bit of television dramedy, which, for the time being, is the only one being written at the Winters's household.
 Before he was married four years ago, Mr. Winters had a great run writing for ''Oz,'' the prison drama on HBO produced by the Levinson/Fontana Company. ''Oz'' was a hit in cable terms. It ran six seasons, and has since enjoyed a second life on DVD. But since the show ended, the gigs have come and gone for Mr. Winters. Other than a couple of random residual checks that ran in the low hundreds, his compensation ended when the show ended. 
 ''There is this myth that is being perpetuated about the greedy, rich writer who just wants more,'' he said, the apartment otherwise quiet now that his family had stepped out. ''I am not saying that writing television is not a lucrative business. It can be for those who are good at it and hit it big. But for a lot of us, it is very hit or miss. You ride the edge of the knife. A show gets picked up, it gets canceled, and then you are back looking for your next job.''
 He added: ''I have been extremely fortunate in working with Tom Fontana. I've been able to make a living working with really smart people.'' Before the strike, he was developing a pilot for the Levinson/Fontana Company, and one of the company's shows had been picked up, but those efforts are at full stop.
 Having done most of his work in cable, residual payments have never played a meaningful economic role in his career. Before cable exploded, the producers had made the now familiar argument that no one would make any money there, so the residuals are tiny. 
 ''I think it is a specious argument for the producers to say that they don't know if there will be profits in digital media,'' he said, taking a sip of water at the table below an overhanging loft in the apartment. ''It was the same argument that was used when DVDs and cable became part of the business, and time has proven that both of those were very lucrative businesses. If the studios don't make money on new media, we don't make money.''
 This is showbiz, after all, an often corrupt and occasionally lucrative business where everybody gets to dip a beak in. And the writers, after all, are only looking for single percentages of the huge mound of suet created by the big hits. In the current round of negotiations, producers are arguing that writers rank with craft services in terms of rights to that lucrative aftermarket. 
 ''Now that I am at a standstill, I have to face the question of what we as a family are doing and how we are going to do into the future,'' Mr. Winters said. ''I have to look into other avenues of putting bread on the table.''
 The writer's effort to be dealt a share of any digital business seems like the right issue at precisely the wrong time. Both platforms and nightstands are lousy with content, and every consumer is also a potential producer. With user-assisted robots like Google and YouTube searching and dealing all manner of media, who needs writers? 
 Producers and networks are not feeling the heat because consequences, if there are any, will mostly come in the form of next year's upfronts. In the meantime, they can make do with what is already in the can and fill up the rest of the time with retread reality like the comeback of ''American Gladiator.''
 ''We are not the ones who are going to lose our houses,'' one producer told Entertainment Weekly.
 Mr. Winters and his family are not about to become homeless, but his rent in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn is pretty steep. A graduate in creative writing and English literature from Stanford, he is also a poet, a craft not likely to see DVD residuals any time soon. 
 He fell into writing television after his brothers, who are both actors, introduced him to Mr. Fontana. He loves the work. ''To have your work go into living rooms and reach millions is a thrill that you never get tired of,'' he said. And he is thankful that he has been able to remain in New York and work, even though most of the industry lives and works in Los Angeles. 
 Less than a week into the strike, he has watched all the fiery rhetoric emanating from both sides and fears a settlement is a long way off. People can crack wise about writers holding out tin cups, but with the producers dug in and consumers with many other choices, he is genuinely worried.
 ''Part of the reason that people have so much content on their DVRs and TiVos is that there has been so much really good writing,'' he added. ''Now people will be able to go back and see all that great television they missed.''
 Mr. Winters said he would be among them, catching up with the first season of ''Friday Night Lights.'' He's looking forward to it, but he'd rather be writing television than watching it.

HEADLINE: Study: Foreign Students Added to Economy

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
While foreign students at American colleges and universities are most often singled out for their scientific and cultural contributions, their growing numbers help make them an increasingly important economic force as well, according to a new report from the Institute of International Education. 
 In the 2006-7 school year, the report found, international students' net contribution to the United States economy was nearly $14.5 billion -- up a billion dollars from the previous year, the largest annual increase to date. 
 ''These are foreign people buying an American product, and the Department of Commerce says international education is our fifth-largest service export, bigger than medical services,'' said Allan E. Goodman, president of the institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes international study. ''It's a huge factor in a lot of cities, including New York, where international students contribute about $1.5 billion, more than the Yankees, the Mets, the Rangers, the Knicks and the Giants combined.''
 The number of foreign students in American institutions of higher education, from community college to graduate school, increased 3 percent over the previous school year, to 582,984, the report found. This followed three years of declines, and brought the total back to almost exactly the number of students that came to the United States for the 2001-2 year, just before the 9/11 attacks.
 Those enrolling in the United States for the first time surged 10 percent last year, a statistic considered important because those students are likely to study in the United States for several years.
 Over all, foreign students spent more than $20 billion in 2006-7, about half on tuition and fees and half on living expenses. The report estimated that $14.5 billion came from the students' home countries, mostly from personal and family sources. According to the report, which was largely financed by the State Department and is being officially released on Tuesday, fewer than a third got their primary financing from United States sources. 
 The economic contributions grew so quickly last year because of tuition increases, Dr. Goodman said, and because more foreign students were in expensive certificate programs that offer few scholarships. 
 The economic impact of the international students was provided by Nafsa: Association of International Educators, based on the institute's international student data, and made part of the report, Open Doors 2007. 
 For several years, India and China have sent the most students here, together accounting for more than a quarter of last year's international students. Most experts expect the numbers to continue to grow. ''Next to water, the biggest shortage in the world today is probably higher education,'' said Dr. Goodman, adding that only the United States could absorb the demand. 
 Saudi Arabia sent more than twice as many students here in 2006-7 as it did the previous year; the number of Japanese students declined 9 percent.
 The University of Southern California and Columbia University had the most foreign students last year, with New York University in third place.
 Graduate students are half the international enrollment, but in the last six years, community college students have generally been the fastest-growing segment.

HEADLINE: All They Are Saying Is Give Happiness a Chance

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The framers of the Constitution evidently believed that happiness could be achieved, putting its pursuit up there alongside the unalienable rights to life and liberty. Though governments since then have seen life and liberty as deserving of vigorous protection, for all the public policies aimed at increasing economic growth, people have been left to sort out their happiness. 
 This is an unfortunate omission. Despite all the wealth we have accumulated -- increased life expectancy, central heating, plasma TVs and venti-white-chocolate-mocha Frappuccinos -- true happiness has lagged our prosperity. As Bobby Kennedy said in a speech at the University of Kansas in March 1968, the nation's gross national product measures everything ''except that which makes life worthwhile.'' 
 The era of laissez-faire happiness might be coming to an end. Some prominent economists and psychologists are looking into ways to measure happiness to draw it into the public policy realm. Thirty years from now, reducing unhappiness could become another target of policy, like cutting poverty.
 ''This is another outcome that we should be concerned about,'' said Alan Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton who is working to develop a measure of happiness that could be used with other economic indicators. ''Just like G.D.P.'' 
 It might be a bit of a political challenge to define happiness as a legitimate policy objective. Imagine the Republican outrage when the umpteenth tax cut didn't do the trick. Democrats would likely slam the effort as regressive, distracting from efforts to improve the lot of the less fortunate by more conventional measures -- like income.
 Happiness is clearly real, related to objective measures of well-being. Happier people have lower blood pressure and get fewer colds. But using it to guide policy could be tricky. Not least because we don't quite understand why it behaves the way it does. Men are unhappiest at almost 50, and women at just after 45. Paraplegics are not unhappier than healthy people. People who live with teenagers are the unhappiest of all. 
 Happiness seems fairly cheap to manipulate. In one experiment, subjects were asked to answer a questionnaire about personal satisfaction after Xeroxing a sheet of paper. Those who found a dime lying on the Xerox machine reported substantially higher satisfaction with their lives.
 Most disconcerting, happiness seems to have little relation to economic achievement, which we have historically understood as the driver of well-being. A notorious study in 1974 found that despite some 30 years worth of stellar economic growth, Americans were no happier than they were at the end of World War II. A more recent study found that life satisfaction in China declined between 1994 and 2007, a period in which average real incomes grew by 250 percent.
 Happiness, it appears, adapts. It's true that the rich are happier, on average, than the poor. But while money boosts happiness, the effect doesn't last. We just become envious of a new, richer set of people than before. Satisfaction soon settles back to its prior level, as we adapt to changed circumstances and set our expectations to a higher level. 
 Despite happiness' apparently Sisyphean nature, there may be ways to increase satisfaction over the long term. While the extra happiness derived from a raise or a winning lottery ticket might be fleeting, studies have found that the happiness people derive from free time or social interaction is less susceptible to comparisons with other people around them. Nonmonetary rewards -- like more vacations, or more time with friends or family -- are likely to produce more lasting changes in satisfaction.
 This swings the door wide open for government intervention. On a small scale, congestion taxes to encourage people to carpool would reduce the distress of the solo morning commute, which apparently drives people nuts. 
 More broadly, if the object of public policy is to maximize society's well-being, more attention should be placed on fostering social interactions and less on accumulating wealth. If growing incomes are not increasing happiness, perhaps we should tax incomes more to force us to devote less time and energy to the endeavor and focus instead on the more satisfying pursuit of leisure. 
 One thing seems certain, lining up every policy incentive to strive for higher and higher incomes is just going to make us all miserable. Happiness is one of the things that money just can't buy.

HEADLINE: New Way of Counting Radio Listeners May Cut Ad Income

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The test of a new method for measuring radio audience in New York showed big ratings declines for stations appealing to blacks and Hispanics last week, causing considerable consternation among station owners and programmers. 
 Arbitron, which measures ratings for the radio industry, has been testing a new electronic measurement tool that monitors exposure to radio stations throughout the day. The results of the so-called personal people meter in New York followed the pattern set by two earlier tests, in Houston and Philadelphia, in which stations appealing to minorities also fell. 
 The results also seem to echo a decline in ratings for minority television programs when Nielsen Media Research switched its measurement system in 2004. The change led to an intense lobbying effort by networks and some black leaders to postpone the widespread introduction of the new ratings system.
 In Arbitron's New York test, WPAT 93.1, a Spanish-language adult contemporary station, was ranked No. 7 in Arbitron's summer ratings but fell to No. 19 in October's personal people meter test among 25- to 54-year-olds. Sister station WSKQ 97.9 dropped from No. 4 to No. 7.
 ''No format changes were made. This is the same music, the same on-air personalities, and yet we've seen severe shifts in reported listening,'' Frank Flores, the general manager of the WSKQ and WPAT, said.
 Other stations with high proportions of minority listeners were similarly affected. The urban adult contemporary station WBLS 107.5 dropped from No. 1 to No. 12. The urban contemporary station WRKS 98.7 fell from No. 3 to No. 9. 
 Previously, Arbitron had used paper diaries from sample listeners to determine ratings that were used to set prices for advertising. Under pressure to provide more detailed and accurate data, Arbitron has gradually swapped human memory for computer technology, in the form of pocket-size devices that detect radio frequencies to automatically determine which station is on.
 Because advertisers purchase radio time by the ratings point, declines in reported listening could have serious effects on radio stations' incomes.
 Vinny Brown, the program director for WBLS, said people meters were ''not a friend to ethnically designed radio stations. If we get hit with 30 or 40 percent loss of revenue, it will be difficult for us to remain in operation.'' 
 The test data won't be used to set advertising rates until early next year. Still, the drastic ratings changes raised red flags about people meter methodology, and Arbitron agreed on Friday to have an independent board review the system in New York.
 Tom Mocarsky, a senior vice president at Arbitron, said the declines at individual stations are a side effect of more precise measurements. Another interpretation is that a greater number of people are listening to more stations. According to diaries, the average African-American person in New York listens to radio 13.7 times a month. According to the people meters, the average number of listening occasions rises to 20.4.
 ''Your total time with radio is being divided among more stations and more occasions,'' Mr. Mocarsky said. As a result, he said, each radio station's share becomes smaller. 
 Mr. Mocarsky said Arbitron seeks a representative sample of each local market, with specific benchmarks for ethnic groups, genders and ages. He said the sample difficulties are most prominent not among races, but among age groups.

HEADLINE: All They Are Saying Is Give Happiness a Chance

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The framers of the Declaration of Independence evidently believed that happiness could be achieved, putting its pursuit up there alongside the unalienable rights to life and liberty. Though governments since then have seen life and liberty as deserving of vigorous protection, for all the public policies aimed at increasing economic growth, people have been left to sort out their happiness.
This is an unfortunate omission. Despite all the wealth we have accumulated -- increased life expectancy, central heating, plasma TVs and venti-white-chocolate-mocha Frappuccinos -- true happiness has lagged our prosperity. As Bobby Kennedy said in a speech at the University of Kansas in March 1968, the nation's gross national product measures everything ''except that which makes life worthwhile.'' 
 The era of laissez-faire happiness might be coming to an end. Some prominent economists and psychologists are looking into ways to measure happiness to draw it into the public policy realm. Thirty years from now, reducing unhappiness could become another target of policy, like cutting poverty.
 ''This is another outcome that we should be concerned about,'' said Alan Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton who is working to develop a measure of happiness that could be used with other economic indicators. ''Just like G.D.P.'' 
 It might be a bit of a political challenge to define happiness as a legitimate policy objective. Imagine the Republican outrage when the umpteenth tax cut didn't do the trick. Democrats would likely slam the effort as regressive, distracting from efforts to improve the lot of the less fortunate by more conventional measures -- like income.
 Happiness is clearly real, related to objective measures of well-being. Happier people have lower blood pressure and get fewer colds. But using it to guide policy could be tricky. Not least because we don't quite understand why it behaves the way it does. Men are unhappiest at almost 50, and women at just after 45. Paraplegics are not unhappier than healthy people. People who live with teenagers are the unhappiest of all. 
 Happiness seems fairly cheap to manipulate. In one experiment, subjects were asked to answer a questionnaire about personal satisfaction after Xeroxing a sheet of paper. Those who found a dime lying on the Xerox machine reported substantially higher satisfaction with their lives.
 Most disconcerting, happiness seems to have little relation to economic achievement, which we have historically understood as the driver of well-being. A notorious study in 1974 found that despite some 30 years worth of stellar economic growth, Americans were no happier than they were at the end of World War II. A more recent study found that life satisfaction in China declined between 1994 and 2007, a period in which average real incomes grew by 250 percent.
 Happiness, it appears, adapts. It's true that the rich are happier, on average, than the poor. But while money boosts happiness, the effect doesn't last. We just become envious of a new, richer set of people than before. Satisfaction soon settles back to its prior level, as we adapt to changed circumstances and set our expectations to a higher level. 
 Despite happiness' apparently Sisyphean nature, there may be ways to increase satisfaction over the long term. While the extra happiness derived from a raise or a winning lottery ticket might be fleeting, studies have found that the happiness people derive from free time or social interaction is less susceptible to comparisons with other people around them. Nonmonetary rewards -- like more vacations, or more time with friends or family -- are likely to produce more lasting changes in satisfaction.

If growing incomes are not increasing happiness, perhaps we should tax incomes more to force us to devote less time and energy to the endeavor and focus instead on the more satisfying pursuit of leisure.

HEADLINE: Bring the Real World Home

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
In the gym at the NATO base in Kabul, U.S. soldiers hit the treadmills every morning and gaze at TV screens broadcasting Al Jazeera's English news channel. When Osama bin Laden makes news, as he did recently with a statement about Iraq, America's finest work out beneath the solemn gaze of their most wanted enemy.
 This sounds like a scene from Donald Rumsfeld's private hell. The former secretary of defense dismissed Al Jazeera as a ''mouthpiece of Al Qaeda.'' He once called the network, which is based in and owned by Qatar, ''vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable.'' 
 In an indication of what the Bush administration thinks of Al Jazeera journalism (and habeas corpus), it has locked up one of the network's cameramen, Sami al-Hajj, in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years without charging him.
 The choice of viewing at the NATO gym is a lot wiser than Rumsfeld's choice of words or the terrible treatment of Hajj. America, and not just its front-line soldiers, needs to watch Al Jazeera to understand how the world has changed. Any other course amounts to self-destructive blindness.
 The first change that must be grasped is America's diminished ability to influence people. Global access to information now amounts to an immense a la carte menu. Networks escape control. To hundreds of millions of people accessing information for the first time, from central China to Kenya's Rift Valley, the United States can easily look exclusive and less relevant to their future.
 The second essential change is the erosion of American power. Samantha Power, the author and Harvard professor, calls this ''the core fact of recent years.''
 America's hard power -- its military -- is compromised by intractable counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its economy is strained; witness the ever feebler dollar. Its soft power -- the resonance of the American idea -- has been hurt by a loss of legitimacy (Hajj languishing) and by incompetence (Iraq).
 The third essential change is the solidification of anti-Americanism as a political idea. Jihadist Islamism is the most violent expression of this, but its agents benefit from swimming in a sea of less murderous resentments.
 In response to all this, America can say to heck with an ungrateful world. It can mutter about third, even fourth, world wars. Therein lies a downward spiral. Or it can try to grasp the new, multinetworked world as it is.
 To this world Al Jazeera English offers a useful primer. The network can be tendentious -- bin Laden's face up there for several minutes -- in stomach-turning ways. But, over all, its striving for balanced reporting from a distinct perspective seems genuine.
 A year after its launch, it reaches 100 million households worldwide. Its focus is on ''reporting from the political south to the political north,'' as Nigel Parsons, its managing director, put it. The world it presents, more from the impact than the launch point of U.S. missiles, is one that must be understood.
 Yet, the network has been sidelined in the United States. Representative Jim Moran, a Democrat from Virginia, told me: ''There's definitely an attitude here that these guys are the enemy. But in the Mideast, Asia and Europe they have a credibility the U.S. desperately needs.''
 Moran met recently with Al Jazeera English executives seeking to extend the service's Lilliputian reach here. Right now, you can watch it in Toledo, Ohio, through Buckeye Cablesystem, which reaches 147,000 homes.
 Or, if you're in Burlington, Vt., a municipal cable service offers the network to about 1,000 homes. Washington Cable, in the capital, reaches half that. Better options are YouTube or GlobeCast satellite distribution.
 These are slim pickings. Al Jazeera English is far more accessible in Israel. Allan Block, the chairman of Block Communications, which owns Buckeye, told me: ''It's a good channel. Sir David Frost and David Marash are not terrorists. The attempt to blackball it is neo-McCarthyism.''
 Block, like other cable providers, got protest letters from Accuracy in Media, a conservative watchdog. Cliff Kincaid, its editor, cites the case of Tayseer Allouni, a former Afghanistan correspondent jailed in Spain for Al Qaeda links. This is evidence, he suggests, that ''cable providers shouldn't give them access.''
 Most cable companies have bowed to the pressure while denying politics influenced their decisions. ''It just comes down to channel capacity and other programming options,'' Jenni Moyer, a Comcast spokeswoman, told me. 
 Nonsense, says Representative Moran, blaming ''political winds plus a risk-averse corporate structure.''
 These political winds hurt America. Counterinsurgency has been called armed social science. To win, you must understand the world you're in.
 Comparative courses in how Al Jazeera, CNN, the BBC and U.S. networks portray the Iraq war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be taught in all U.S. high schools and colleges. Al Jazeera English should be widely available.

HEADLINE: How Long Should Gifts Just Grow?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
AS nonprofit institutions have seen donations and investments grow spectacularly in recent years, the urge to keep the money rolling in is being supplemented by a new pressure: make it flow out faster.
 Politicians, consultants, watchdog groups and even some philanthropists say that foundations, universities, museums and other charitable institutions often spend only what they must while their coffers expand, partly because of double-digit returns on investments. These ''spend it sooner'' proponents say that the minimum that private foundations are required to give -- 5 percent of their assets each year -- has in many cases become the maximum. To really attack social problems, they say, foundations and other nonprofits need to open their spigots much wider.
 ''There are certain dynamics that take over in terms of behavior, and one of those forces is usually the drive to perpetuate institutions,'' said Warren E. Buffett, who is giving more than $30 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with the stipulation that it be spent promptly. ''That dynamic -- though undoubtedly subconscious -- sometimes takes precedence over considering what might be best for society.'' 
 Foundations, universities and other nonprofit institutions say they need to watch their spending to safeguard their nest eggs, because there is no guarantee that the enormous growth will continue. If they spend their assets by giving out more money, they contend, the results could be catastrophic in an economic downturn.
 ''We're here to ensure the long-term health and function of Grinnell College,'' said Russell Osgood, its president, explaining why the university, with just 1,500 students, maintains a $1 billion-plus endowment. ''That's our sole objective.''
 Some foundations, however, are heeding critics' voices and starting to increase the outward flow of cash. That, in turn, has created new problems, as foundations have often discovered they can't give out the money fast enough. 
 ''I'm working harder now than I did when I was running two Fortune 500 companies,'' said Eli Broad, the billionaire founder of the Broad Foundations, which finance projects in education, arts and medical research. Mr. Broad and many of the newer, wealthier donors intend to distribute the money they have committed by their death or within a set time thereafter.
 Nonprofit institutions had nearly $2.5 trillion in assets by the end of 2005, more than double the amount a decade earlier, says the National Center on Charitable Statistics. Hospitals, groups like the American Cancer Society, medical research institutions and others have the biggest slice, with more than $825 billion in assets in 2005. Educational institutions claimed close to $600 billion in assets that year, while foundations held more than $460 billion.
 The accumulation has caught the eye of Congress, which has held hearings to examine why college tuition was increasing faster than the rate of inflation when so many institutions sit on billions of dollars. It also wants to look at whether donations are benefiting a broad enough range of organizations or primarily those that are already wealthy.
 ''The point of giving is to help the community and those in need and not to help a charity build an even bigger bankroll,'' Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and Democrat of Montana, and Charles E. Grassley, the committee's ranking member and Republican of Iowa, wrote in a letter to the Internal Revenue Service this year. Mr. Grassley and others have broached the idea that colleges be subject to the same kind of minimum spending requirement that applies to private foundations.
 Critics point out that the tax deductions for the gifts that have spurred the growth in assets are taken almost immediately by donors, but the benefits of those donations may not come for years. 
 Among the new foundations that are committed to spending down all their assets is the Atlantic Philanthropies, which is built on the fortune of Charles Feeney, a founder of a chain of duty-free shops. At the end of last year, Mr. Feeney had given away about $4 billion. He still has roughly $4 billion in Atlantic that must be spent over the next nine years.
 ''A hanging concentrates the mind,'' said Gara LaMarche, Atlantic's president and chief executive. ''When you know you're no longer going to live forever, you focus more urgently so that after you're gone, you leave behind some enduring changes and enable the organizations you've supported to achieve sustainability.'' 
 The challenge lies in the fact that the assets, which stood at $3.2 billion at the end of last year, keep increasing. ''In real terms, it has gone down, but in nominal terms, we are at about where we started,'' said Philip Coates, Atlantic's chief investment officer. 
 The Gates Foundation, which aims to exhaust its $33 billion endowment within 50 years of the last of its founders' deaths, must give away about $1.5 billion a year to maintain compliance with the federal payout requirement. That is a big challenge, but in 2009, the foundation will have to dole out more than twice that amount, thanks to a first installment from Mr. Buffett's gift. He stipulated that any money he gives to the foundation must be spent within a year, bringing the annual payout to $3 billion to $4 billion -- more than the assets of all but a few foundations.
 ''A challenge, no question about it -- but what a problem to have,'' said Patty Stonesifer, the foundation's president. ''I had two thoughts when I first heard about it: 'Wow!' and 'Holy cow! How are we going to get this done?' '' 
 Program officers at the Rockefeller Foundation were surprised when the Gates Foundation announced last fall -- instead of early this year, as planned -- that the two had formed a $150 million partnership to advance African agriculture. They assumed, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity, that Gates needed to get its $100 million out the door to meet its payout requirements.
 Ms. Stonesifer noted, however, that in the last few years the Gates Foundation has given away more than is required, partly because it has identified and, in some cases, helped build outlets capable of taking on bigger amounts of money, like the GAVI Alliance for immunization programs; the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and the United Negro College Fund. 
 ''Having those commitments means you never have to rush,'' Ms. Stonesifer said. ''Those folks are always going to need the money.'' 
 The foundation has allocated money toward 22 long-term goals. For instance, it has already put $1 billion into what Ms. Stonesifer calls an envelope to address malaria, but more money can be added if the foundation sees progress in a particular cause. Thus, the $600 million for improving African agriculture has been increased.
 Part of the problem that Gates and other foundations struggle with is finding organizations that can handle a lot of money. One reason that universities, hospitals and museums attract so much donated money is that the contributors are confident the gifts will be managed and used properly, although the accumulation of assets at these institutions suggests that some of the confidence is misplaced.
 ''Productive use of assets is an issue,'' said Nancy Roob, president and chief executive of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation. In 2000, Edna McConnell Clark radically overhauled its practices, cutting the number of grants and working closely with current recipients to strengthen their management to ensure that they can use large amounts of money. 
 ''The critical issue is ensuring they're in a good position to say to investors, here's the road map for how your dollars are going to be spent,'' Ms. Roob said.
 Approaching the problem this way requires more effort by foundations and donors than simply writing a check and waiting for reports. Edna McConnell Clark's staff serves as sort of a consulting team, back office and black couch for the groups it supports, a role that not all foundations and donors are willing to take on.
 ''One of the great lines from our experience was when we were sitting with a donor who said, 'I know how to give $100 million to my Ivy League university, but I don't know how to give $100 million to help kids in the city,' '' recalled H. Peter Karoff, founder of the Philanthropic Initiative, a strategic planning and consulting firm. ''We told him he would have to hire 20 people to do that well, and he wrote his check to the Ivy League school. Many of these huge gifts are what I call default gifts.''
 The attention devoted to the wealth of universities, hospitals and museums has created envy among less rich nonprofits, many of which are establishing their own endowments. These reserves are considered necessary cushions against the vagaries of fund-raising. 
 ''It's a mix of things,'' said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, executive director of Safe Spaces, a small social services organization in New York City that hopes to build a reserve. She said that government money does not cover the cost of services that Safe Spaces provides to the city. ''We need to pay our staff better,'' she added, ''but government contracts don't allow it, and foundation grants are getting more erratic.''
 Several of the charities that received roughly $34 million each when H. Guy DiStefano, a millionaire, died last summer, are creating reserves. ''It provides the security of knowing that if, for some reason, the economy went into a dive and fund-raising suffered, we could survive it and not have to cut back programs,'' said Marie Belew Wheatley, chief executive of the American Humane Association, a beneficiary of Mr. DiStefano's estate. 
 The association will spend about $2 million on programs, and some of the money is going to a new research center aimed at improving record-keeping on child protective services. The rest of the DiStefano gift, about $30 million, will go into reserves. 
 The BBB Wise Giving Alliance recommends that a charity maintain no more than three times its annual budget in net unrestricted assets -- assets other than real property and with no strings attached. It lists 15 such charities of the more than 1,000 that it rates that do not meet that standard. Two of them are considering adopting the standard, and two have not responded to its requests for information.
 ''Charities do need a minimum level of reserves,'' said H. Art Taylor, the alliance's president and chief executive. ''That's just prudent business practice.''
 Universities that have many times their annual budgets in their endowments make the same argument.
 Grinnell College's decision to raise tuition this year helped incite the current Congressional scrutiny of college endowments. ''I was quite shocked when, in my own state of Iowa, Grinnell College recently announced a 12.6 percent increase,'' Senator Grassley said at a hearing in September. 
 Mr. Osgood, Grinnell's president, said that 85 to 90 percent of students receive financial aid worth about $23 million, compared with revenue from tuition and fees of about $22 million. 
 He said that those who were critical of college endowments fail to realize their impact. ''Society at large benefits from those monies being invested in our economy,'' Mr. Osgood said. ''The United States has a problem with its rate of savings, and one of the few bright spots are colleges and universities, which are two of the largest contributors to the national rate of savings. Anyone thinking about reducing endowments should think long and hard about what that might do to the overall ability to generate jobs and fund good ideas.''
 But Senator Grassley said that high tuitions charged by well-off institutions might be partly responsible for the low savings rates. ''Creating jobs and investing in corporate America are fine, but a college's first priority should be educating students,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''You wonder if education gets lost in the shuffle when building a huge, untouchable endowment seems to be the most important goal.''
 While universities fight suggestions that Congress push for a payout rate, experts say there is anecdotal evidence that more donors favor spend-down policies. ''You shouldn't be determining the scale of your philanthropic efforts based on some minimum set by Congress,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''Why in the world would the tax law provide the exact percentage of resources each year that makes the most sense in terms of carrying out a foundation's mission? Yet if this law said 3 percent was the minimum required payout, I'm sure many foundations would quickly adjust their spending downwards.''
 The spending requirements of Mr. Buffett's gift to the Gates Foundation appears to have stirred new thinking about perpetuity and asset accumulation. A report called ''Beyond Five Percent: The New Foundation Payout Menu,'' which was partly underwritten by a group led by Mr. Feeney's daughter, Diane Feeney, describes how about a dozen foundations decided to spend down or spend more than the required amount. The Aspen Institute and the Urban Institute are doing their own research on the issue.
 ''I think a lot of new donors are trying to be strategic about their giving, and depending on their strategy, perpetuity doesn't always make sense,'' said Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which does research and consulting for major foundations and donors. ''If one of the issues you care about is global warming and you see it as an imminent threat, a 5 percent annual payout rate just isn't logical.''

HEADLINE: California Zeros In on the Intractable

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 THE wildfires that ravaged communities from Malibu to San Diego last month set off an outpouring of charity from corporate California: the Walt Disney Company and Hewlett-Packard quickly pledged $2 million each, and other local companies promised hundreds of thousands more.
 But the avalanche of aid for disaster victims in the wealthy Southern California suburbs could divert attention from what has been a major transformation of the philanthropic landscape in the region, one that can be glimpsed in the ways charitable groups are tackling the most persistent problems of everyday life: poverty, health, housing, education, immigration and what could be simply called urban livability.
 The big art institutions and universities continue to prove they can more than fend for themselves. In the last few years, David Geffen gave $200 million to the medical school at the University of California, Los Angeles, Eli Broad $60 million to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and George Lucas $175 million to the University of Southern California's film school. 
 The most intractable social problems, by contrast, require much more than a good architect or hiring a new dean, and they seldom attract donations that reach six digits, let alone eight or nine. 
 So it was a radical departure when the United Way of Greater Los Angeles -- which had long followed a pattern of spreading its $60 million or so in annual largess in all directions -- announced this year that it would narrow its focus and devote its discretionary giving only to programs that fight poverty.
 For the first time, United Way required its affiliates to compete for grants, and the result was a drastic shake-up. Of 200 longtime beneficiary agencies, 90 were dropped, and 50 new recipients were selected. United Way also set 10-year goals, including raising the high school graduation rate to at least 75 percent and putting 10,000 adults through training programs and into jobs with good pay and career growth. 
 Elise Buik, who took over in 2005 as president of the long-struggling Los Angeles United Way, the nation's 10th largest, said poverty had become a ''dirty word'' and a ''liberal issue'' because of the region's geographic fragmentation and lack of a dominant urban center. 
 ''When you have to walk over homeless people on the way to the subway, it's going to enter your psyche,'' she said. ''But here, we don't touch and see it.''
 She added: ''As we started to raise these issues, people were shocked, and they did care. Our job has been to try to broker this into a quality-of-life issue. What people are waking up to is, if we have a 50 percent dropout rate, that's going to affect business and your quality of life.'' 
 Making matters more challenging for United Way, historically reliant on workplace campaigns, has been the loss of some corporate headquarters. ''Bank of America's in Charlotte now,'' Ms. Buik said. ''Times Mirror's in Chicago.''
 Targeted campaigns, measurable results and competitiveness have become the bywords for big philanthropies and small nonprofit groups alike, including the $3.5 billion California Endowment, which has handed out $1.8 billion in grants. In April 2006, the endowment -- created 10 years earlier, when Blue Cross of California became a for-profit company -- opened a $62 million downtown headquarters. 
 Now, the endowment is grappling with how to focus its efforts to fulfill its mission: building healthy communities and ensuring that the state's estimated 800,000 uninsured children get health care.
 ''We've funded thousands of organizations, a lot of people have benefited, but what do we want to hang our hat on in 5 or 10 years?'' said Paul Hernandez, a spokesman for the California Endowment.
 The much smaller Liberty Hill Foundation might point the way, he said. The foundation, a self-described progressive underwriter of grass-roots community-organizing efforts, has as its motto, ''Change, not charity.'' Mr. Hernandez said, ''That's the kind of credo we want to subscribe to, too.''
 The California Endowment's impact is already being felt; it helped to end soda sales in the Los Angeles schools, a move later repeated at the state level. It is also helping the City Project, a fledgling nonprofit organization working to broaden access to parks and open space for inner-city residents and, more recently, to fight childhood obesity by guaranteeing that city students get enough physical education.
 That long-term goals are still being set by so many of the region's philanthropies should be expected; more than two-thirds of California's foundations have been formed since 1990. But even the California Community Foundation, founded in 1915, only recently made a splash in affordable housing, setting up a land trust to build homes to sell to low-income families. (It has built 80, begun work on 220 more and set plans for an additional 350.) 
 The region's nonprofit sector mirrors its geography, said Paul Vandeventer, president of Community Partners, a Los Angeles incubator for community groups. 
 ''Philanthropy tends to be by virtue of who I know, not where I go,'' he said. ''We're so broad and spread out, there isn't deep interconnectedness. It's more like the Internet, with more nodes than hubs and spokes. If I straddle many networks, my philanthropy will be spread and varied.''
 It also might be invisible: the available data on philanthropy doesn't include the remittances from immigrants to their home countries, which often exceed the total United States foreign aid to those nations, said Sushma Raman, president of Southern California Grantmakers. That should not be surprising since, for example, the Guatemalan and Salvadoran populations of Los Angeles are second only to those of Guatemala City and San Salvador.
 Immigrant workers, as it happens, are among the chief interests of the Liberty Hill Foundation, which focuses heavily on economic issues. In recent years, its beneficiaries have helped win an increase in the minimum wage at the state level and helped grocery workers in Koreatown negotiate with merchants for a ''living wage'' of $8.50 an hour. 
 Other aid recipients include organizers of a rally in May calling for changes to immigration law, at which the police turned on both demonstrators and journalists.
 One industry that never fails to generate big charitable dollars is Hollywood, a perennial source of some of the biggest individual gifts but also a thrumming machine that, judging from the red-carpet photos in the trade papers, seems to raise several million dollars every few days for one pet charity or another. 
 The big movie studios all have full-time philanthropy officers weighing an endless supply of gala invitations, usually in chunks of $5,000 to $50,000 a table.
 On Oct. 23, for example, the Fulfillment Fund, which provides poor city students with high school tutoring and college scholarships, raised $2.7 million in honor of Marc Shmuger, the chairman of Universal Pictures, at a gala where Jamie Foxx sang and Seth Rogen cracked jokes. The big Hollywood event has become ''The Night Before,'' Jeffrey Katzenberg's benefit on the eve of the Oscars that helps the Motion Picture and Television Fund, which serves people in the entertainment industry in need. 
 Other favored causes include juvenile diabetes and cancer research, the Environmental Media Association and the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.
 In Hollywood and elsewhere, recent years have seen a marked rise in donor-advised or donor-designated funds. ''People in general, and particularlyin L.A., don't want to give their money to someone else to give away for them, they want to be involved in it,'' said James M. Ferris, an expert on philanthropy at the University of Southern California. 
 That has hurt United Way in the past; about half of its $60 million in annual giving is now earmarked by donors, leaving little for less popular but worthy causes. But Ms. Buik, the group's president, said she hoped givers would begin to embrace the campaign against poverty.
 ''When you get clear about what you stand for,'' she said, ''it attracts people.''

HEADLINE: A New York Honor, Centuries Old and Gold-Plated

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Keep your eye out. Fats Domino could show up anywhere in New York at any moment. He now has the ''freedom of the city.'' And an official, five-and-three-quarters-inch-long gold-plated pewter key to prove it.
 To honor Mr. Domino's fund-raising efforts on behalf of the struggling musicians of New Orleans, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented him with a key to New York City on Thursday night, following a municipal custom going back 305 years. (The key was presented at the Pink Elephant club in Chelsea, a municipal custom going back only to Thursday night.) 
 Mr. Bloomberg may be better known for his advocacy of the latest technology than his fondness for historical pomp, but he has managed to hand out 28 keys so far in his mayoralty; not a bad clip compared with his immediate predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had presented 32 keys by this point in his second term.
 ''Even as times change and technology advances, the key to the city symbolizes how New York City's gates will always remain open,'' said Matthew Kelly, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg.
 The key itself has not changed markedly for more than three decades, judging from a collection at City Hall that includes examples from the administrations of Abraham D. Beame (1974-77), Edward I. Koch (1978-89) and Mr. Giuliani (1994-2001). Records show that Mayor David N. Dinkins (1990-93) presented only two keys -- to Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Mikhail S. Gorbachev of Russia -- which may explain the lack of a spare.
 All the keys since the mid-1970s have been identical in size and nearly identical in style. They resemble large skeleton keys, with the city seal set into a three-lobed handle, encircled by enamel rings of orange and blue. The mayor's name is on the shaft. But Mr. Bloomberg's key has different notches. Its end is blunt rather than rounded. At five ounces, it is slightly lighter than earlier versions.
 Ashburns Engravers of 90 John Street, six blocks from City Hall, makes the keys. They cost $100 each. A supply is always kept on hand in the mayor's office. They are presented in black velour-covered boxes with a small plate on top saying, ''Facsimile of key made in 1812 for the door of City Hall, New York.''
 In fact, a jumbo skeleton key about nine inches long and bearing notches similar to the mayoral key is still used to unlock the rear door of City Hall.
 During medieval times, admission to cities was hampered by legal constraints and physical barriers. The English custom of presenting the freedom of the city to distinguished outsiders -- and residents as well -- has persisted ever since as an honorary gesture.
 Viscount Edward Cornbury, an 18th-century provincial governor of New York who is best known today for the unshakable but dubious legend that he was a transvestite, was the first to receive ''A Freedom of this Citty'' from the mayor and common council, on June 27, 1702.
 According to the city's Commission for the United Nations Consular Corps and Protocol, it became customary by the mid-1800s to give a key to honored guests as a symbol of the city's intention that the recipient would be free to come and go at will.
 In 1966, for reasons of economy, Mayor John V. Lindsay began giving out prints of City Hall instead of keys. That practice was short-lived.
 During the city's fiscal crisis in 1976, Mayor Beame handed over a key to the mayor of New Orleans, saying that New York did not need it anymore: ''We've got no more money in the vault.''
 Almost half the keys presented by Mr. Bloomberg have gone to the mayors of other cities and towns, six of them in Puerto Rico. Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees has also received a key from Mayor Bloomberg, as have the Dalai Lama and Mr. Mandela (his second). Mr. Giuliani was far more sports-oriented in conferring keys, many of which went to members of the New York Yankees.
 Mr. Koch recalled in an interview last week that the accolades could go both ways. When he bestowed a key on Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris in 1978, Mr. Koch received a medal of the French Legion of Honor. Then, in 1984, he gave President Francois Mitterrand of France a key to the city, at which time Mr. Mitterrand elevated Mr. Koch's rank in the legion and gave him another medal.
 ''So,'' Mr. Koch said, speaking almost as if he were still in office, ''I can't wait to meet Sarkozy.''

HEADLINE: For U.S. Exporters in Cuba, Business Trumps Politics

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: HAVANA, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
A trade fair in Communist Cuba is perhaps the last place you would expect to find a Republican governor from the American heartland. Yet last week, Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska was here to sign a deal to export $11 million worth of his state's wheat to the island. 
 Asked the obvious question about whether longstanding American trade sanctions should be lifted, Governor Heineman ducked and weaved like a professional boxer. ''Well, I try not to get into that, because that's up to the president and the Congress, but I will say expanding trade relationships is good for Nebraska and altogether good for America,'' he said. 
 Just weeks after President Bush delivered an address calling on the world to isolate Cuba, officials from Minnesota, Alabama and Ohio -- and more than 100 American businesses -- were working the giant Havana International Fair, trying to secure part of the $1.6 billion the Cuban government spends each year to import sugar, wheat, livestock, poultry and beans, among other staples.
 Those business interests clash with the Bush administration's anti-Castro policies, as well as the need of both Democrats and Republicans to court Cuban exiles in Florida, a crucial voting bloc. So while some trade with Cuba is allowed, it is fraught with restrictions. A 1992 law, for instance, denies ships access to American ports for six months after they have docked in Cuba, making shipping tricky, to say the least. 
 Several Americans here said they were frustrated that the sanctions have proved more a source of irritation for those who want to do business with Cuba than a crippling blow to Fidel Castro. 
 ''They are doing everything they can to make it difficult,'' said Ralph Kaehler, a Minnesota farmer who sells cattle feed in Cuba. ''It's unfortunate.''
 American businesspeople and state officials have been coming to the fair for six years, ever since Congress gave in to pressure from the agriculture lobby in late 2000, during the waning days of the Clinton administration, and lifted a four-decade ban on selling food to Cuba. 
 Since then, the number of farm states and agribusinesses who want a piece of the Cuban market has been growing, despite the Bush administration's steady tightening of sanctions. For farm states, the need for jobs has trumped cold-war politics. 
 ''It's helped our economy,'' said Ron Sparks, the Alabama agriculture commissioner, as he talked with people near the booth for the Mobile Port Authority. ''It's helped our farmers. I don't talk national policy.''
 Now in its 25th year, the annual trade fair drew more than 1,000 companies from 53 countries to a sprawling fairground known as Expocuba just outside Havana.
 The atmosphere was festive, with more than a dozen restaurants where people drank Havana Club rum and puffed on Cuba's famous cigars, a treat several Americans appeared to enjoy. The five-day fair, which ended Saturday, also attracted hundreds of ordinary Cubans. 
 Aside from state officials, the American delegation included several shipping companies and large agricultural outfits like Pilgrim's Pride, Cargill and Purdue. Their sales representatives worked in the booths all day before returning to the Hotel Nacional, an art deco landmark, and then heading out to enjoy the Havana night life.
 Some Americans at the fair predicted that Cuba's market would open up more after Fidel Castro gave up power permanently, and they said they wanted to get a head start on deal making. Many envision a return to the prerevolution days when the United States was Cuba's biggest trading partner, as wheat and durable goods flowed south while sugar, tobacco and rum flowed north.
 But financial and travel restrictions have never been tighter, as the Bush administration has quietly stepped up the prohibition of tourism to and from Cuba and invented new ways to squeeze the island financially. It has also increased efforts to fine international banks that handle transactions in dollars for the Cuban government as well as companies that do business in both Cuba and the United States.
 American farmers complain that Washington has also tried to find ways to hinder agricultural sales to the island. Since the ban was lifted in 2000, an exception to the general trade embargo against Cuba, sales from American farmers to the island have risen to about $500 million a year, Cuban officials say.
 But the Bush administration has required the purchases to be made in cash and, since 2004, that the payment must be received before shipment. The system has created immense logistical headaches for American shippers and food exporters. Loads of grain and poultry end up waiting for days on a dock until proof of payment arrives, shippers said. 
 ''There are lot of delays in loading because of that,'' said Eric T. Junker, the owner of Americana Marine Services, which ships grain to the island.
 President Bush and other supporters of the sanctions maintain that every dollar that enters Cuba helps support a despotic regime. In his speech on Oct. 24, Mr. Bush asked Congress to maintain the embargo and said the transfer of power from Fidel Castro, who has been ill, to his brother Raul, amounted to ''exchanging one dictator for another.'' He called for elections after Fidel Castro's death.
 Cuban officials argue the embargo hurts American farmers more than it does the government here. But they also acknowledge the American attempts to punish foreign companies for doing business here have hurt them in dozens of small ways, from limiting their ability to buy to certain medicines to making it impossible to get spare parts for scientific equipment. 
 ''The blockade makes doing business here insecure,'' said Pedro Alvarez Borrego, the chairman of Alimport, the government-owned company that imports food. 
 The biggest blow, however, has been to tourism. The minister for tourism, Manuel Madero, said that before Mr. Bush took office, about 80,000 Americans visited Cuba every year, usually going through Mexico or another country. He declined to give a number for the current year, but said it had been reduced to trickle.
 Luis M. Morejon, who operates a small tour company, said he used to arrange tours for at least 30 Americans a year in the late 1990s. ''Now this whole year I haven't had one,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dollar Policy: Don't Ask, Don't Tell

 BODY:
When asked about the administration's policy on the dollar, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. dutifully says a strong dollar is in the nation's interest and that markets should determine currency exchange rates. 
 But these days, the stated desire for a strong dollar is on a collision course with the stated belief in market-determined exchange rates. Almost daily, the market is pushing the dollar to record lows against the euro and to fresh lows against other currencies, including the Canadian dollar, the pound and the yen. A near-term cause of the slide is the rising risk of recession in America. A deeper reason is that currency markets punish deeply indebted nations by pummeling their currencies. 
 So Mr. Paulson's pat answer raises a more fundamental question: What, if anything, would the administration be willing -- or able -- to do if the dollar slid to unacceptable lows?
 The dollar's value is connected to Americans' standard of living. In the United States, the quality of one's economic life is determined largely by purchasing power. A weaker dollar could cut into purchasing power by raising the cost of imports for which, increasingly, there are no domestic substitutes. The dollar's decline is already contributing to higher oil prices. For a variety of reasons, higher oil prices also tend to translate into higher food prices. The cost of oil and food are not counted when measuring ''core inflation.'' But the more they cost, the less Americans can afford of everything else. 
 A weaker dollar could also pressure consumers by driving up interest rates. If broad dollar-driven inflation threatened to take hold, the Federal Reserve would surely raise interest rates. But even in the absence of that, the buildup of debt during the Bush years virtually condemns the nation to borrowing for many years to come. An ongoing need to borrow in the face of a weakening dollar would push up interest rates, because creditors demand a higher return to invest in a depreciating currency. 
 A sharp decline in the currency would mean a sharp decline in living standards. A slower decline in the dollar would mean a slower decline in standards. The first would be a calamity. But the second is also unacceptable.
 True, a weaker dollar boosts American exports and attracts foreign shoppers, but you can't build a strong American economy on a declining dollar.

HEADLINE: Behind the Screenwriters' Strike: A Bigger Slice of a Half-Eaten Pie

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
As Hollywood digs in for a second week of a strike, the screenwriters might want to send a few angry picketers over to Will Smith's place. Or Steven Spielberg's.
 And maybe the studio executives should think about joining them on the line. As it turns out, the pot of money that the producers and writers are fighting over may have already been pocketed by the entertainment industry's biggest talent. 
 That is the conclusion of a surprisingly bleak new assessment of financial dynamics in the movie industry titled ''Do Movies Make Money?'' The researchers' answer: not any more. 
 The report, prepared by the research company Global Media Intelligence in association with its partner Merrill Lynch, concludes that much of the income -- past and future -- that studios and writers have been fighting about has already gone to the biggest stars, directors and producers in the form of ballooning participation deals. A participation is a share in the gross revenue, not the profit, of a movie. 
 Through the twists and turns of contemporary deal-making, major studios in theory give away as much as 25 percent of a film's receipts under such arrangements. The actual take is lower, because of certain adjustments. (This is Hollywood, after all.) But a Hanks, Cruise or Carrey whose movie brings $600 million back to the studio from all sources might easily wind up with a $20 million salary, and an additional $50 million on the back end, while an A-list director and producer could take in tens of millions more.
 Industrywide, the tab for participation arrangements piled up to $3 billion or more last year, by the research company's reckoning, helping push the business of making films, which was somewhat profitable a few years ago, into a loss.
 Roger R. Smith, a former film executive who worked more than six months on the report, said the effect of participations is huge, because ''they can easily be paid out on money-losing pictures.'' 
 For the study, Mr. Smith and his team examined all films distributed in recent years by the six major studios, plus DreamWorks, which was independent before its acquisition by Paramount Pictures. It included movies from the primary studio operations, along with the bigger movies from specialty film units like Warner Independent Pictures. And not all of the films are completely owned by the studios, as some have equity investors.
 The study estimated that all such releases last year would yield a combined loss of $1.9 billion after collecting the revenue from an entire first cycle of sales to domestic theaters, foreign theaters, home video, pay television and every other source of income. 
 Total sales for last year's slate, the company figures, will ultimately be about $23.7 billion, down about 4.6 percent from 2004. Total costs, meanwhile, rose to $25.6 billion, up 13.2 percent. 
 As he began working up the numbers last spring, Mr. Smith, who is the executive editor and motion picture analyst for Global Media Intelligence, a unit of the London-based Screen Digest, anticipated a harsh response from the studio owners. But with writers on the warpath for a larger share of what they see as expanding corporate profits, Mr. Smith said he was now braced for skepticism from the labor side. 
 In fact, neither side should be cheered by figures that describe an industry that has increasingly doled out its wealth to star performers and filmmakers, at the expense of almost everyone else.
 (The workings of the theatrical movie business contrast sharply with the economics of television. There, superstar writer-producers like John Wells of ''E. R.'' or Marc Cherry of ''Desperate Housewives'' are among those who get the biggest take.) 
 Part of the bad news for the film industry came from a sharp decline in foreign DVD sales. Those dropped 15.5 percent in the period, while domestic DVD sales fell at half that rate. 
 But the real killer was the growth in participations. Their precise amount is difficult to reckon, because deals vary and details are seldom disclosed publicly. But Global Media noted that at Disney -- unusual in that its financial reports break out annual outlays for participations and residuals -- the figure had grown at a compound annual rate of 37.6 percent for the last five years, to $554 million. If the other companies are spending at a similar rate, said the researchers, they are paying out shares worth $3 billion, while piling up an almost $2 billion loss on their new films.
 A relatively small part of that goes to the guilds in the form of residuals, the contractual payments that writers get when their work reappears in various media -- and which the writers are insisting be increased for media of the future. 
 According to a report from the Writers Guild of America West, which represents the lion's share of Hollywood writers, movie residuals were just $121.3 million in 2006, a mere drop in the $3 billion bucket.
 A big star, by contrast, can easily make $70 million or more from a single hit, if he or she enjoys a so-called first dollar gross deal.
 There is a marketplace justice to such arrangements. Unlike the much-derided ''net profit'' deals granted weaker players -- those points seldom get paid, because there is always some studio charge in the way -- gross participations give valuable talent a real share of the action.
 ''Profit participations are negotiated between a willing buyer and a willing seller,'' said Steven Blume, chief operating officer of Content Partners, a Los Angeles company that buys participations in return for cash. The terms, he noted, can change with every movie, making them more flexible than residuals, which become locked into long-term master contracts with the guilds.
 But, from the studio point of view, this sort of payment is a bit like having a mortgage that doesn't amortize. ''These participations are paid in perpetuity,'' Mr. Blume said.
 And therein lie new problems for studios that may have gotten too comfortable with such payouts in the last decade or so. 
 According to Global Media Intelligence, studios a few years ago could count on rising DVD sales to lift their properties into profitability in a five-year first trip through the marketplace. Then, fully paid for, the movies would provide a smaller but near-endless stream of income from library sales over the decades.
 Now, however, those same releases are joining the library with multibillion-dollar losses in tow -- and they continue to be weighed down by gross participations that never stop.
 Even Disney's strong corporate performance in the last year does not necessarily bode well. The company's studio unit, which was profitable for the year, had essentially flat revenue, at about $7.5 billion. Despite a huge hit in ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,'' much profit, company executives said, came from the mining of its library with clever ploys like the ''Little Mermaid'' Platinum Release DVD, which sold nine million units without the burden of star participations.
 Once it is understood that the biggest stars and directors can rake in dollars even from money-losing movies, it becomes easier to understand why companies dug in their heels when asked to make richer residual payments on media of the future than they offered on home video of the past. These would trigger higher payments to other guilds, and would probably create pressure from lawyers and agents in search of still fatter participation deals for their star clients.
 It is also not hard to see why the situation is especially galling for movie writers, who typically do not share in the most lucrative gross deals. When it comes to finding more money, some of the stars and filmmakers who have joined them on the picket lines may be able to say where it could come from.

 Re ''In Portland, Cultivating a Culture of Two Wheels'' (news article, Nov. 5): 
As a poor college student who can't afford a car (and definitely not gas), I rely heavily on my bike. 
 As mass transit in my hometown of Chicago suffers from construction, as traffic continues unabated, and as gas prices remain astronomical, biking should be the best way to get around. But wherever I go, biking is unnecessarily difficult. Bikes are prohibited on sidewalks, yet bike lanes are scarce. I'm putting my life in the hands of sleep-deprived, distracted drivers every time I bike in the street.
 Portland is moving forward. It is reaping the economic and environmental benefits of embracing cycling. The rest of us are still waiting to merge onto the expressway.

HEADLINE: Letters: When Reagan Spoke of States' Rights

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
David Brooks (''History and Calumny,'' column, Nov. 9) takes unnamed liberal commentators to task for willfully misrepresenting as evidence of the G.O.P.'s racist platform Ronald Reagan's 1980 speech in Philadelphia, Miss., in which Mr. Reagan uttered the now famous -- or should we say ''infamous'' -- claim ''I believe in states' rights.'' 
 However sincere Mr. Reagan may have been in his approach to the economic problems of black America, there can be no doubt that ''states' rights'' is a racist doctrine, and one that the G.O.P. continues to embrace. 
 With all the major G.O.P. presidential hopefuls clinging both to Ronald Reagan's legacy and the old Southern strategy of Richard M. Nixon, the issue is as real and cogent today as when Mr. Reagan and the nascent neoconservative sect of the G.O.P. tried to woo black voters by repackaging racism as ''states' rights.''
 Cynically, the righteously indignant advocates of states' rights today try to turn the discussion away from the fundamental question of civil rights into a cheap accusation of calumny. As the Marx Brothers said, ''Who you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?'' 
 Craig Hanoch Highland Park, N.J. Nov. 9, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The truth is more complicated than David Brooks's version. If the Nashoba County Fair had been the unique example of Ronald Reagan's saying the shameful thing , it might be excusable. But there was also the Bitburg, Germany, visit, where he spoke at a Nazi SS burial ground.
 To use the phrase ''states' rights'' at the site where civil rights workers were martyred is more than a careless slip. It was blasphemy. It was profoundly unpatriotic. It belittled the sacrifices not only of the Philadelphia Three but of those called by Lincoln our honored dead. 
 It was a dishonorable act. It cannot be excused by staff incompetence. 
 Sam Abrams Rochester, Nov. 9, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks is correct. This country has been too critical of the Republicans' Southern strategy. We, as a nation, really need to back off the Republican Party in general and Ronald Reagan's legacy in particular. While, as Mr. Brooks says, it's obviously true that race played a role in the G.O.P.'s ascent, we can't assume that there was a master conspiracy to play on the alleged Klan-like prejudices of American voters. 
 All you need is five minutes' worth of research to establish the truth of this. Go to your favorite search engine and type in the name Lee Atwater and the words ''Southern strategy.'' This should clear up any lingering doubts you may have over Ronald Reagan and the Southern strategy. 
 Tracy Brooking Kennesaw, Ga., Nov. 9, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Contrary to what David Brooks says, the ''slur'' that Ronald Reagan began his 1980 campaign by resurrecting the segregationist refrain of ''states' rights'' is no slur at all. Mr. Brooks himself admits that Mr. Reagan's use of the term was ''callous, at least'' and that Mr. Reagan missed an opportunity to profess his support for civil rights. 
 Mr. Reagan failed to do so for a good reason, however: he had opposed every federal civil rights law to come down the pike since 1964. Ronald Reagan was obviously extending, not rejecting, the Goldwater/Nixon ''Southern strategy.''
 Doug Rossinow St. Paul, Nov. 9, 2007 The writer is an associate professor of history, Metropolitan State University. 
 To the Editor:
 It wasn't Ronald Reagan's going to Philadelphia, Miss., that exposed the Republican racism, nor was it his speaking of states' rights. It was doing the two things together that made the symbolism clear. It would be kinder to say that the Republicans ''just didn't get it'' when they allowed the event to occur, but then I would have to say that David Brooks still doesn't get it.
 Bernice Sisson Chester, Pa., Nov. 9, 2007 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 13, 2007

 CORRECTION:
 A letter from Rochester yesterday about Ronald Reagan and states' rights misspelled the name of the German city where he spoke at an SS burial ground. It is Bitburg, not Bitberg.

HEADLINE: Luis Herrera Campins, Venezuela Leader, 82

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Luis Herrera Campins, a former president whose years in office were marked by bountiful oil riches and a painful economic bust when oil prices plunged in the early 1980s, died here on Friday. He was 82. 
 Mr. Herrera Campins had multiple health problems, including a kidney infection and Alzheimer's disease, the Caracas daily newspaper El Universal said. 
 When his term began in 1979, he inherited a country with South America's highest per capita income and a decades-old democracy in a region of military dictatorships. But a spending spree by his predecessor, Carlos Andres Perez, who had nationalized the oil industry, left ballooning foreign debt. 
 A founder of the moderately conservative Copei party, Mr. Herrera Campins pledged to control extravagant expenditures. However, a surge in oil prices soon allowed him to finance ambitious projects, like Caracas's Metro and the opulent Teresa Carreno Theater, which in addition to staging musical and theatrical performances is now used by President Hugo Chavez for fiery policy speeches. 
 Moved in part by territorial claims, Mr. Herrera Campins developed a muscular foreign policy. He signed an agreement with Mexico in 1980 to jointly provide Central American and Caribbean countries with a steady flow of oil, a precursor of Mr. Chavez's wide-reaching oil diplomacy in the developing world. 
 And in 1982 he sided with Argentina in its war with Britain over the Falklands, adroitly exploiting anti-British and anti-American sentiment to boost his flagging popularity. His support for Argentina came while he was asserting Venezuela's longstanding claim to more than half of neighboring Guyana, a former British colony. 
 Mr. Herrera Campins took to politics as a law student in the 1950s, organizing a strike against the dictatorship of Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez. He became a provincial lawyer and journalist. Imprisoned for several months, he went into exile in Spain and Germany, where he wrote influential essays and columns for Venezuelan newspapers and magazines. 
 He returned to Venezuela after General Perez Jimenez's fall in 1958 and was elected to congress. 
 Born to a family of modest means in the interior plains, he was rarely seen in public without a dark suit and a black tie, cutting a drab figure in a country known for its flash in the booming 1970s, when it was dubbed ''Saudi Venezuela.'' 
 That boom came to a definitive end in 1983, when low oil prices forced Mr. Herrera Campins to sharply devalue the currency, the bolivar. It was the start of a long economic slide that has been halted only in recent years by record oil revenues. After his term ended in 1984, he drifted somewhat into obscurity. 
 Retiring to his modest house here, he made headlines when gunmen stole his car in 2001. Afterward, he could be seen on foot wearing old clothes and carrying his own groceries. Information on Mr. Herrera Campins's survivors was not available.
 He was considered an exception in Venezuela's recent political history: a leader who clearly had not allowed himself or his family to grow rich while in office. 
 ''In an era of opulence and revolutionary hypocrisy, Luis Herrera Campins died in austerity,'' Simon Alberto Consalvi, a columnist, wrote in the Caracas newspaper El Nacional. He said that penury, in a nation again going through an oil boom with corruption and conspicuous consumption, was ''the best recognition one can make of a president.''

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. MARTIN. 
Kevin J. Martin is the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 IN many towns and cities, the newspaper is an endangered species. At least 300 daily papers have stopped publishing over the past 30 years. Those newspapers that have survived are struggling financially. Newspaper circulation has declined steadily for more than 10 years. Average daily circulation is down 2.6 percent in the last six months alone. 
 Newspapers have also been hurt by significant cuts in advertising revenue, which accounts for at least 75 percent of their revenue. Their share of the advertising market has fallen every year for the past decade, while online advertising has increased greatly. 
 At the heart of all of these facts and figures is the undeniable reality that the media marketplace has changed considerably over the last three decades. In 1975, cable television served fewer than 15 percent of television households. Satellite TV did not exist. Today, by contrast, fewer than 15 percent of homes do not subscribe to cable or satellite television. And the Internet as we know it today did not even exist in 1975. Now, nearly one-third of all Americans regularly receive news through the Internet. 
 If we don't act to improve the health of the newspaper industry, we will see newspapers wither and die. Without newspapers, we would be less informed about our communities and have fewer outlets for the expression of independent thinking and a diversity of viewpoints. The challenge is to restore the viability of newspapers while preserving the core values of a diversity of voices and a commitment to localism in the media marketplace. 
 Eighteen months ago, the Federal Communications Commission began a review, ordered by Congress and the courts, of its media ownership rules. After six public hearings, 10 economic studies and hundreds of thousands of comments, the commission should move forward. The commission should modify only one of the four rules under review -- the one that bars ownership of both a newspaper and a broadcast TV or radio station in a single market. And the rule should be modified only for the largest markets. 
 A company that owns a newspaper in one of the 20 largest cities in the country should be permitted to purchase a broadcast TV or radio station in the same market. But a newspaper should be prohibited from buying one of the top four TV stations in its community. In addition, each part of the combined entity would need to maintain its editorial independence. 
 Beyond giving newspapers in large markets the chance to buy one local TV or radio station, no other ownership rule would be altered. Other companies would not be allowed to own any more radio or television stations, either in a single market or nationally, than they already do. 
 This relatively minor loosening of the ban on cross-ownership of newspapers and TV stations in markets where there are many voices and sufficient competition to allow for new entrants would help strike a balance between ensuring the quality of local news while guarding against too much concentration. 
 The cross-ownership rule is the only media ownership rule that has never been modified since its inception in the mid-1970s. For the last decade, F.C.C. chairmen -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- have said this rule needs to be revised. 
 The ban on newspapers owning a broadcast station in their local markets may end up hurting the quality of news and the commitment of news organizations to their local communities. Newspapers in financial difficulty often have little choice but to scale back news gathering to cut costs. Allowing cross-ownership may help to forestall the erosion in local news coverage by enabling companies that own both newspapers and broadcast stations to share some costs. 
 Since 2003, when the courts told the commission to change its media ownership rules, the news media industry has operated in a climate of uncertainty. Many newspapers and broadcast stations are operating under waivers of the ban on cross-ownership. The F.C.C. needs to address these issues in a coherent and consistent fashion rather than considering them case by case, making policy by waiver.
 I confess that in my public role, I feel that the press is not on my side. But it is for this very reason that I believe this controversial step is worth taking. In their role as watchdog and informer of the citizenry, newspapers are crucial to our democracy. 
 A colleague on the commission, Michael Copps, for whom I have the utmost respect, has argued that our very democracy is at stake in the decisions we make regarding media ownership. I do not disagree. But if we believe that newspaper journalism plays a unique role in the functioning of our democracy, then we cannot turn a blind eye to the financial condition in which these companies find themselves.

Tasha Solomon opened the grimy plastic blinds of her first floor-apartment in the Millard E. Terrell Homes, a housing project hard by the Passaic River.
 She need not have bothered.
 Although the river is only 100 yards from her apartment, Ms. Solomon, a 25-year-old mother of two, cannot see it from her window. Her view is a wall of rusty shipping containers that rises more than four stories, taller than any of the 12 buildings in the rundown housing complex.
 ''Is there a river over there?'' she asked one recent afternoon. 
 Like drugs and gangs and poverty, the containers have simply become another unavoidable fact of life here, residents say. 
 For decades the project, operated by the Newark Housing Authority, has been flanked by storage depots where thousands of corrugated, trailer-size containers -- a byproduct of the brisk commerce at the port in Newark and Elizabeth -- sit stacked one atop the other in the barren cityscape. 
 There used to be some daylight. 
 An expanse of concrete between Ms. Solomon's building and the murky river once served as the complex's recreation area. Older residents recall mother-daughter kickball tournaments, dance contests, and summer evenings spent watching the lights from downtown shimmer in the distance. 
 ''This is where we used to let it all hang out,'' said Valerie Hall, who moved to the project in the mid-1960s and is one of the few who remember life before the containers. ''When you'd look at those lights, it was like you could go downtown, and all you had to do was stand here.'' 
 But about 15 years ago the housing authority, a troubled agency that barely avoided a takeover by the federal government in 2005, leased the gritty three-acre recreation area to a private container storage company. What once was a baseball field is now an expanse littered with shards of glass. And a patch of open space that allowed residents to look out on the river now provides a view of ripped and rusted cargo containers. 
 Keith Kinard was appointed executive director of the housing authority 16 months ago after a federal investigation called the agency ''absolutely dysfunctional'' for much of its 70-year history.
 Initially, a spokesman for Mr. Kinard said there was no record of a lease or rent payments to allow containers to be stored on the premises, but two weeks later he said the agency had discovered an agreement in perpetuity in 1993 with the container storage company, Palmer Industries. 
 The agreement allowed Palmer, which had stored containers on each side of the housing project, to let them spill over onto the baseball field for $650 a month, linking its properties together with rows of containers. Now Mr. Kinard says he intends to have the containers removed, although other problems must be addressed first. ''I want them off my property,'' he insisted. 
 But residents are not ready to break out the barbecue grills just yet. 
 ''The city won't do anything about them,'' said Claire Johnson, 80 years old, who said the containers had been there for as long as she could remember. ''They don't care. Besides, they get a lot of money to park them there.'' 
 While the few dozen containers on agency property are only a tiny fraction of the more than 27,000 that tower over this hardscrabble section of Newark, they were enough to seal residents off from the river.
 Today, waist-high weeds stab upward through the concrete, and the homeless who make this neighborhood their home string clotheslines between broken container doors.
 One man, known by friends in the project as Florida, was found dead last month, the police said, locked inside a container in the depot alongside the homes. The death is still under investigation. High up in the stacks, a container overflowed with trash, evidence of someone's precarious third-story dwelling. 
 Reaching the complex requires trekking through some of the most dense and polluted industrial corridors of urban America. Every several minutes, the roar of jets taking off from nearby Newark Liberty International Airport drowns out any hope of conversation. The rancid smell of garbage -- perhaps from the Newark incinerator a mile away -- permeates the air at the slightest gust of wind. 
 Just down the road is a dioxin-tainted Superfund site, where about a million gallons of Agent Orange was produced during the Vietnam War. 
 But with a price tag of $25 million to bring the deteriorated buildings -- two of which have broken heating systems -- along with their mildewed hallways and 1940s-era electrical system, up to safety and sanitation standards -- $8 million more than the housing agency's maintenance budget for the entire city -- containers are not high on Mr. Kinard's list of priorities. 
 ''I've got homeless people squatting inside the apartments themselves,'' he said. ''If containers were my worst problem, this job would be a walk in the park.'' 
 Last month, Mr. Kinard said, he asked the agency's legal department to find a way to terminate the agreement with Columbia Container Services, which took over Palmer's storage depots in 2003. He said negotiations would begin in the coming weeks. Two directors of Columbia Container, John Armstrong and Bruce A. Fenimore, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. 
 One tenant, a 20-year-old bank teller, who declined to give his name for fear of being associated with the project, said he gave up looking out his window years ago. ''It's an asbestos river anyway,'' he said.
 For Mayor Cory A. Booker, the plight of Terrell Homes is yet another test in the effort to revitalize this long-struggling city. As Newark begins to explore ways to develop its waterfront for recreational and residential uses, officials have to figure out what to do with thousands of containers that land at Port Newark-Elizabeth -- the third largest port in the United States -- and line long swaths of the Passaic.
 ''The city can't come to us and ask for jobs with the port and then say it wants to take the land these businesses are located in and turn it into parks or condominiums,'' said Randy Brown, a spokesman for the New York Shipping Association, which represents Newark's three storage depots.
 The port and the network of trucks, warehouses, and storage lots that service it account for about 300,000 jobs, Mr. Brown said, one of the largest sources of employment in New Jersey.
 He said a vast majority of containers stayed in the region for only 12 days before being shipped out on barges. The abandoned ones sit in the depots until they are repurchased, increasingly for scrap metal, Mr. Brown said, although he acknowledged that the industry did not keep track of the number of derelict containers stacked along the river.
 But officials say the city, which recently began work on a public park along the waterfront from Newark Penn Station to the edge of the storage depots -- including the Terrell Homes -- is determined to find out just how many there are. Joel Sonkin, counsel to the deputy mayor for economic development, said the city had enlisted researchers from Rutgers and the New Jersey Institute of Technology to investigate the question. 
 For now, residents of the Terrell Homes remain in their walled city. Older women chat away the afternoon, and teenage boys in bandannas cluster around the cars in the benchless complex, their voices smothered by the drone of planes. Children dare one another to scale the fence that separates them from the container-choked lot.
 ''It looks like some kind of scrap yard or recycling plant,'' said Denise Suver, 46. ''This is a place for people to live, not a garbage dump.''

HEADLINE: After Fires, Homeowners Feel an Insurance Pinch

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Daniel and Doris Okonsky, whose custom-built 6,500-square-foot house was destroyed in the recent wildfires in Southern California, have been poring over receipts and family photos to estimate the damage.
 But like many of the 14,000 homeowners who suffered losses, the Okonskys are discovering that the insurance on their hilltop home in San Diego County might not be enough to rebuild it.
 ''I have about $1.5 million coverage for dwelling only,'' Mr. Okonsky said, or the equivalent of about $230 per square foot of construction. ''For custom-home construction I am getting prices like $350 up to $500 per square foot.'' 
 As Californians recover from another season of devastating wildfires, one of the biggest obstacles is a painfully familiar one. As many as 40 percent of homeowners statewide lack enough insurance to cover their home-replacement costs, according to the California Department of Insurance, and most realize the problem only when it is too late.
 After past disasters, California state officials tried to raise homeowners' awareness of their coverage limits by requiring policies to be written clearly and with disclaimers about what is not covered. But several national studies suggest that many homeowners tend to underestimate risk and do not understand that their policies do not guarantee replacement of their homes.
 ''Most Americans still think that full coverage means full coverage, but insurance companies know otherwise,'' said Douglas Heller, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, an advocacy organization.
 Guaranteed home-replacement policies have become increasingly rare in California since the 1990s, when a series of catastrophic earthquakes and wildfires sent insurers' profits plummeting. Most California policies have limits on construction, although some include inflation riders or extension policies to create buffers beyond the estimated replacement price.
 An analysis by The San Diego Union-Tribune of 2,137 houses that were destroyed in unincorporated areas of San Diego County in the last big wildfires, in 2003, found that only 46 percent had been rebuilt by late last year. In many cases, policyholders said they had not resolved their insurance claims or received enough money to replace their homes, The Union-Tribune reported.
 Insurance industry officials say many homeowners contribute to the problem of insufficient coverage. In seeking to keep premiums low, the officials said, homeowners often do not inform their insurers about renovations, opt out of adequate coverage or fail to update their policies.
 Some public opinion surveys back up that notion. A Mason-Dixon poll on attitudes about flood insurance in coastal areas, for example, suggested that many homeowners often opted out of recommended disaster coverage and only rarely reviewed their policies.
 Half of the homeowners polled in flood zones, according to the poll released in May, incorrectly believed that standard residential insurance policies covered flood damage and a third of homeowners had not reviewed their policies in more than three years. 
 A separate study by the RAND Corporation, a research group, concluded that only about half of homeowners living in high-risk flood zones throughout the nation had flood insurance policies.
 Robert P. Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, said, ''The principal cause of underinsurance is the failure to report improvements to the home to the insurance company, and it's a common problem.''
 But John Garamendi, the California lieutenant governor who served two terms as the state's insurance commissioner, has placed much of the blame on the insurance companies. At a news conference earlier this year, Mr. Garamendi said that ''lack of clarity in the language'' of policies was a main reason that homeowners had insufficient insurance. He also said that, in some cases, insurance agents and insurance companies ''were giving bad information to the consumers.'' 
 But Mr. Hartwig disagreed. ''That is a figment of John Garamendi's political imagination,'' he said. ''Garamendi doesn't seem to remember that he's not the insurance commissioner any more. There's no evidence of that. There's no report from any state agency that suggests that's the case.''
 Jim Wells, president of Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, a firm that estimates construction costs for many large insurers, said insurance companies had improved the models they used to estimate replacement costs. But many of the companies, Mr. Wells said, did not take the next step and contact homeowners who held policies written with older, less accurate information.
 ''Sometimes the insurance companies believe their agents have that responsibility,'' Mr. Wells said. ''Sometimes it is an expense they're not ready to bear even though it pays for itself in higher premiums. Sometimes it's just not the way they did business in the past, and sometimes they think it's the policyholders' responsibility and not theirs.''
 In the meantime, the cost of rebuilding a house keeps going up.
 The Census Bureau estimates that residential construction costs in the Western states were 35 percent higher in 2006 than in 2003. Much of that increase was caused by growing international demand for materials like copper, steel and concrete, and high gasoline prices, industry experts said.
 Bob Rivinius, president of the California Building Industry Association, said the housing construction slump that has followed the subprime mortgage crisis might help keep prices in check. Still, Mr. Rivinius said, construction prices are likely to remain relatively high because of California's fast-growing population and slow-growing housing stock.
 Mick Pattinson, president of Barratt American Inc., a privately held, $250 million-a-year residential building firm based in Carlsbad, Calif., said that average construction prices in the state ranged from $130 to $200 per square foot. Palatial custom-built houses like many lost on bluff-tops in the Rancho Bernardo neighborhood of San Diego and neighboring Poway could cost as much as $400 to $500 a square foot, industry experts said.
 John and Madeleine Bera, a recently retired couple whose house was among 14 that burned down on their block in Rancho Bernardo, were nearing the end of their 30-year mortgage and had plans to spend time sightseeing along the East Coast.
 Instead, the Beras, both in their 70s, have been taxing their memories trying to recall the stained-glass windows they collected, each piece of imported furniture, and rare, first-edition books so that they can better negotiate with their insurance company.
 ''This isn't what we planned on doing with our retirement,'' Mr. Bera said.

HEADLINE: Public Works: When 'Big Government' Plays Its Role

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

 BODY:
At the dedication of the Triborough Bridge in 1936, Franklin Roosevelt made an impassioned case for public works. There was a time when no one complained, he said, ''that our schoolhouses were badly ventilated and lighted'' or that ''there were no playgrounds for children in crowded tenement areas.'' But times had changed. ''People are demanding up-to-date government in place of antiquated government,'' he declared, ''just as they are requiring and demanding Triborough Bridges in place of ancient ferries.''
 The Triborough was built by Roosevelt's Public Works Administration, or P.W.A., one of his ''alphabet soup'' agencies. The New Deal public works programs are mainly remembered for giving jobs to victims of the Great Depression, but as Robert D. Leighninger Jr. argues in his recent book ''Long-Range Public Investment: The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal,'' they also transformed the American landscape and greatly improved the nation. 
 The story of the 1930s public works programs is timely again, because much of America is falling apart. The deadly collapse of a Minnesota highway bridge in August shined a light on the poor state of the nation's bridges, many thousands of which are ''structurally deficient'' by federal standards. Georgia's failure to build enough reservoirs has contributed to a water crisis that could cripple metropolitan Atlanta. We should be thinking today about replicating some of the successes of the Depression-era programs. 
 The P.W.A., the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps were primarily undertaken to put people to work at a time when the unemployment rate approached 25 percent, and to restart a woeful economy. Forward-looking officials like Harry Hopkins, the relief administrator, and Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins argued, however, that public works should be directed to socially useful programs.
 Not all of it was. But the vast majority were enormously valuable. Great institutions were built, including the Bay Bridge, the Hoover Dam and Washington's National Airport -- now named for Ronald Reagan, Mr. Leighninger notes, even though it is ''a product of the type of 'big government' program that he spent most of his political career opposing.'' The New Deal programs also built thousands of important buildings, many beautiful, including the Alameda County Courthouse in Oakland, the University of Texas Tower and a reconstructed French Market in New Orleans. 
 Some projects were high-profile -- notably the great hydroelectric dams and the presidential retreat at Camp David -- but many more focused on the unglamorous mechanics of modern living, like water mains, pump stations, and sewage treatment plants. The W.P.A. alone built 78,000 bridges and viaducts and improved 46,000 more. It constructed 572,000 miles of rural roads and 67,000 miles of urban streets. It also built or improved 39,000 schools, 2,500 hospitals and 12,800 playgrounds.
 The Civilian Conservation Corps, Roosevelt's favorite, sent hundreds of thousands of young people into the countryside. They landscaped, and made accessible, sites like the battlefields at Gettysburg and Appomattox, and cleared the way for Virginia's Skyline Drive. Most of their time was spent on tree planting, flood control, soil erosion efforts and fire prevention.
 The New Deal public works programs have largely faded into history. Most people who use their handiwork, like the millions who travel over the Triborough or visit San Antonio's River Walk, are unaware of how they came to be built. People rarely think about viaducts or sewage lines.
 It is a legacy, though, that is worth recalling. There is a reason we are reading about bridges collapsing, water systems being overburdened and other system failures -- like the 2003 blackout, which left 50 million people in the Northeast and Canada without power. Physical capital investment as a percentage of gross domestic product, the measure of how much the nation is investing in itself, is dismally low today by historic standards -- and the $600 billion-plus being directed to the Iraq War is not helping. 
 Investing in the nation's buildings, transportation and overall mechanics has often been viewed as a Democratic issue, but that may be changing. With Georgia's water supply drying up, Representative John Linder, a Republican who has made a career of bashing Washington, is calling for a national commission on water resources. And after the Minnesota bridge collapse, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to establish a national commission on infrastructure.
 The nation is unlikely to embark on public works programs like those launched during the Great Depression, unless there is another economic crisis of that scale. But Roosevelt's basic idea -- that the government should employ idle hands to upgrade the nation -- should never have gone out of fashion. The next president will need to confront the nation's disrepair. It should be an issue in the campaign right now.

HEADLINE: Voter Anger May Free Up Energy Bills

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Congress saw it coming. Earlier this year, lawmakers warned of an impending energy crisis as they debated wide-ranging legislation to improve automotive efficiency, reward energy conservation and spur development of alternative power sources. 
 When the Senate passed an energy bill in June, crude oil was trading near $65 a barrel, the highest price in a quarter-century. When the House acted six weeks later on markedly different legislation, oil had passed $70.
 Then nothing happened. Oil prices continued to climb while members of Congress bickered among themselves and sniped at the White House.
 Lately, the price of crude oil has flirted with $100 -- it settled Monday at $94.62, down $1.70 -- and some analysts have projected $4-a-gallon gasoline by spring. Lawmakers may finally be preparing to act, most likely on a less ambitious set of energy-saving measures than those passed by either house this summer. 
 Leaders in both houses predicted action on a scaled-down package of energy measures before Congress breaks for Christmas, including some form of higher fuel-efficiency requirements for cars and trucks and incentives for alternative fuels. 
 To be sure, none of these would have an immediate effect on gasoline prices at the pump. The price of oil is determined in global markets, and Congress can do little about it. But with gasoline and heating oil prices near record levels, lawmakers going home for the holidays to face the electorate want to be able to say that they have taken steps that will eventually help.
 ''There's a general perception outside of Washington that we haven't done near what we could to move the country to a more acceptable energy mix,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. ''Congress has been slow to act, and the administration has been slow to act, and the public is way ahead of us on these issues.''
 The frustration over a lack of a coherent national energy policy is bipartisan. The senior Republican on the Energy Committee, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, expressed similar dismay at Washington's seeming paralysis.
 ''It's incredible,'' Mr. Domenici said. ''You would expect us to be much more excited about these high prices, that we'd have a committee working day and night on the problem of oil dependence.'' Instead, he said, the nation has done little since the oil crises of the 1970's, with the exception of a hard-fought 2005 energy bill, which, he contends, has been applied less than effectively by the Bush administration.
 John C. Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, also expressed unhappiness at the government's inability to act on energy matters, though from a different perspective. ''It's very ironic the way this legislation is playing out,'' he said. ''Everyone agrees that we're in a very tight energy situation, so why are they writing legislation to make it even tighter?''
 The reasons government has not acted are many, and they are as much a matter of perception as they are economic and political. The current run-up in oil prices, while rapid by historical standards, has not been matched by a quick spike in the direct cost to consumers, since gasoline increases can sometimes trail increases in the price of crude oil by months. The American economy has, so far, weathered the increase without badly damaging effects.
 The politics of energy are difficult as well, with lawmakers divided not just by party and ideology, but by region. And unilateral moves by the United States will have only limited effect in a global market where the demand for energy, according to many projections, will rise faster than production.
 ''There's not one single reason for the increase in oil prices and there is not one single solution,'' said Karen Harbert, assistant secretary for policy at the Energy Department.
 ''We need to diversify our sources of energy beyond just hydrocarbons and accelerate the development of alternative fuels,'' she added. ''And of course we have to increase efficiency -- of appliances, industries, homes and cars.''
 Energy measures passed by one house or the other in the summer would seek to do all those things if signed into law. They include mandates for the production of huge new quantities of alternative fuels like ethanol, biodiesel and those made from excess plant material; a requirement that electric utilities produce 15 percent of their power from wind, water or solar energy by 2020; and tax credits and loan guarantees for greener buildings, nuclear power and more efficient home appliances.
 But these measures would do nothing to lower prices in the short run, and some of them could result in higher energy prices by making utilities rely on renewable sources like wind or solar power that are more costly than coal and natural gas.
 Advocates of a stronger federal energy policy maintain, though, that such steps could eventually alleviate some price pressure by lowering the demand for oil in the United States, by far the world's largest user. And some of the measures would lower the quantities of greenhouse gases the country produces.
 The hard part is to find a way to accomplish these measures and pay for them that is acceptable to majorities in both houses of Congress. And some of what lawmakers are pushing, including the repeal of billions of dollars in tax incentives for the oil and gas industries, has drawn a veto threat from President Bush. He has also vowed to veto any bill that contains penalties for price gouging by oil companies or that, in his view, discourages new oil exploration and production.
 Environmental advocates express frustration that despite rising fuel prices and a cascade of dire reports on global climate change, policy makers have not taken decisive action.
 ''Clearly, these record high oil prices should be a final wake-up call that we need a new energy policy in this country,'' said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, ''and lead us to make sure the next president has significant policies in place and has campaigned on those promises to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.'' 
 Experts and members of both major parties agree that the single most effective way to address the problem of American oil imports and consumption is to improve the efficiency of cars and light trucks, which use roughly 70 percent of all oil burned here.
 But the question of how much to improve auto mileage and how fast is a deeply divisive issue, pitting Republicans against Democrats and those who have automobile plants in their districts against those who do not.
 Democratic leaders in the House and Senate hope to enact the auto and light truck fuel-efficiency measure included in the Senate bill, requiring a fleet average of 35 miles a gallon by 2020. Auto companies, the United Automobile Workers union and influential lawmakers from carmaking states oppose it, preferring a weaker measure pending in the House.
 One difficulty is that the costs of compliance with new fuel economy standards will be felt fairly quickly, both by the automakers and the millions of drivers who buy their products every year. The savings are felt in small increments over many years.
 That, indeed, is the quandary for those who advocate tough new mileage standards as well as those pushing for sweeping climate-change legislation. Many of the costs are short term, while the benefits are somewhere over the horizon.
 ''Even if they put together a perfect bill,'' said Brian P. Malnak, a lobbyist for Shell Oil and a former top Republican aide to the Senate Energy Committee, ''the results won't be felt in the next election cycle, or even in the careers of some of the members.''

HEADLINE: In Farm Belt, Ethanol Plants Hit Resistance

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: SPARTA, Wis. 

 BODY:
When plans were announced for a new ethanol distillery on the outskirts of this city of 9,000, residents complained that it would mar the view from the municipal golf course. They worried that its emissions would taint the milk-based products made at nearby Century Foods International, one of the community's biggest employers. They even argued over whether the plant would reek like burned molasses or blackened popcorn or fermenting beer.
 The T-shirts opponents printed up told the story: ''Good idea. Bad location.''
 For years, the arrival of an ethanol distillery in agricultural America was greeted mainly with delight, a ticket to the future in places plagued by economic uncertainty. But in the nation's middle, the engine of ethanol country, the glow is dimming. 
 In Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and even Iowa, the nation's largest corn and ethanol producer, this next-generation fuel finds itself facing the oldest of hurdles: opposition from residents who love the idea of an ethanol distillery so long as it is someplace else. 
 ''What they are trying to sell we aren't buying,'' said Deb Moore, who owns a sandwich shop and soda fountain here.
 The disputes have left some proposed plants waiting, mired in lawsuits; a few have given up.
 ''There is a campaign of sorts that is seeking to slow and preferably to stop the growth of the ethanol industry,'' said Matt Hartwig, a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group based in Washington. ''We have to get through a barrage of mud pies to get our message out.''
 These are not the better-known philosophical opponents to ethanol, those who question the efficiency of corn-based ethanol as an energy source, blame ethanol for rising food prices, or disagree with the federal subsidies that have long held up the industry.
 These people are farmers. Or they know a farmer. Or their grandfather was a farmer and, as in so many farm families, ethanol has meant new hope for the fading towns built on corn fields. The biggest complaints are cousins of the gripes brought about by proposed paper mills, landfills, prisons and the like: an increase in noise, traffic, odor, emissions and demand on the water system.
 ''No, no, no, we're not against ethanol production whatsoever,'' said Lonnie Nation, who lives near New Castle, Ind., where he and others have posted signs, filed a lawsuit and were going door to door this month to stop a new plant. ''But if you put it where they want to, you're going to be squeezing all our homes between an ethanol plant and a prison. What will that do to home values?''
 Some experts say the local protests reflect a new anti-ethanol mood spurred by a slow but steady drumbeat of negative attention on the industry. Across the Midwest, questions about ethanol have been raised by environmental advocates, livestock owners have complained about soaring prices for corn feed and farmers have fretted about how expensive some farmland has become.
 ''That wonderful aura that the ethanol plants had may be wearing off a little,'' said Wallace E. Tyner, an agricultural economist at Purdue University.
 Industry advocates play down the size of the opposition and suggest the increase in objections to new plants is simply a factor of math; 131 plants are now operating and more than 70 others are under construction, and the vast bulk of them are in the Midwest.
 That is a marked increase from less than three years ago, when Congress enacted an energy law that included a national mandate for the increased use of renewable fuel in gasoline, setting off the ethanol rush. In January 2005, more than a quarter century after the commercial ethanol industry got started, just 81 plants were functioning.
 ''The fights are rare, and sometimes it's just 11 people in a town of 5,000 or 6,000,'' said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group. In Iowa, which has more ethanol distilleries than any other state, residents near Grinnell filed a lawsuit to try to stop a company from building an ethanol plant. ''There are some people who would rather see their town dry up and blow away than change the status quo,'' Mr. Shaw said.
 The local strife coincides with what is already a moment of tumult for the ethanol industry. In recent months, an enormous supply of ethanol has glutted the market, sinking its price and sending a chill through the ethanol boom. 
 At least three proposed plants have halted construction recently, industry officials said, including one in Reynolds, Ind. Only two years ago, Mitch Daniels, the Indiana governor, had held up the town as a symbol of the shift to renewable energy sources and nicknamed it BioTown U.S.A. 
 In October, the owners of at least one long-running plant -- one that opened in 1983 in Grafton, N.D., and made 10.5 million gallons a year -- announced it would shut down for now, thanks to market forces. 
 Experts debate whether the current ethanol glut is the start of the end to the rush to corn-based ethanol or merely a temporary correction as transportation lines are developed from the Midwest to bigger markets on the coasts. Either way, residents' complaints about proposed plants have only added to the cascade of bad news for ethanol.
 ''It's like the dot-com industry,'' said Anne Yoder, who is pressing to stop plans for an ethanol plant outside Topeka, Kan., and describes herself ''not at all'' as an activist but as ''an ordinary soccer mom.'' 
 ''When ethanol first came along there was so much promise,'' she said. ''Maybe that's starting to trickle off.''
 This spring, when Ms. Yoder first began going door to door to her neighbors to describe her worries about a proposed facility, she expected to be dismissed by the many farmers in her rural county, who presumably would benefit from having a plant nearby to sell their corn. 
 ''But I was shocked by what I heard,'' she said. ''They don't want it here either. Farmers have been in the business for hundreds of years and what they told me is that they don't have a limitless supply of water to produce more corn anyway. This isn't as pretty a picture as everyone wants to make it out to be.''
 Ms. Yoder, who said she now spent several hours a day on this battle and has helped to gather more than 500 names on a petition, has exchanged e-mail messages with the organizers of communities in other states fighting ethanol plants.
 A loose network of opponents is growing. In June, officials from Portsmouth, Va., toured three ethanol plants in Wisconsin, meeting with neighbors and noting observations about odors (''like beer but with a metal smell mixed in,'' for instance, residents in Wisconsin cautioned the Virginia officials).
 ''We just swap information and talk about what tactics they took that worked,'' Ms. Yoder said. 
 Still uncertain is how much these protests will affect the industry. 
 In Sparta, city officials were the ones who initially sought out Coulee Area Renewable Energy to consider moving here, said Michael B. Van Sicklen, a lawyer for the ethanol makers. The plans were sailing along through annexation and zoning proceedings for months, he said.
 Then complaints emerged from leaders at Century Foods International, which sits not far from the proposed plant. Residents signed petitions. They demanded meetings. They filed lawsuits. 
 In October, the ethanol makers and Century Foods International announced they had reached a deal -- one so tentative, confidential and in flux that representatives on both sides declined to talk to about it. No one on either side would say where an ethanol plant might go now, only that it would not be here, in view of the golf course.

HEADLINE: A Health Plan For Wal-Mart: Less Stinginess

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and REED ABELSON

 BODY:
For much of the last decade, the retailing behemoth Wal-Mart Stores has been associated with stingy health care as much as low prices. 
 Across the country, politicians and labor groups derided the company's health plans for their high expense and bare-bones coverage. Two states, California and Maryland, even passed laws demanding, in effect, that the company spend more on employee health benefits. 
 ''We want this giant to behave itself,'' one Maryland legislator, Anne Healey, said at the time.
 The giant, it turns out, was listening. All the criticism was hurting its reputation and its ability to expand. So now, after spending two years seeking advice from everyone from Bill Clinton to executives at Starbucks, Wal-Mart is overhauling its health plans. 
 The company, according to data available for the first time, is offering better coverage to a greater number of workers. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest private employer, provides insurance to 100,000 more workers than it did just three years ago -- and it is now easier for many to sign up for health care at Wal-Mart than at its rival, Target, whose reputation glows in comparison. 
 Wal-Mart has hardly become a standard-bearer for corporate America: it still insures fewer than half its 1.4 million employees in the United States. 
 But the changes in its policies have accomplished what once seemed impossible. Many of its most ardent critics have put down their pitchforks. Andrew L. Stern, whose Service Employees International Union set up an advocacy group to attack Wal-Mart three years ago, now concedes that ''there is clearly a focus on covering more people.''
 Given Wal-Mart's unparalleled track record of sharply cutting prices and wringing out inefficiencies, its focus on providing more affordable health care also holds significant promise in taming what has become a runaway expense for the nation. 
 In one sign of its success so far, the company has pushed down the price of 2,400 generic prescription drugs to $4 a month for employees, starting next year, a program that it offers, in more limited form, to its customers. 
 Now, the chain is even considering weight-loss clinics in its 4,000 stores and is toying with the idea of selling health insurance, hoping to finally bring coverage within reach of most Americans. 
 The company's turnabout demonstrates the power of public pressure to change even the biggest corporations like Wal-Mart, which has based its business strategy on low costs at all costs. 
 What Wal-Mart discovered is that the chorus of critics it had long ignored or blithely rebutted had a point. ''We were spending a lot of energy, and we weren't making any headway,'' said H. Lee Scott Jr., the company's chief executive, who once traveled the country defending the retailer's practices. ''Retrospectively now I say, yes, that plan needed to be improved.''
 For a company whose mantra is to pinch every penny, the improvements have not come without a struggle. For decades, tens of thousands of its employees were never eligible for coverage, and what was offered was too costly for a work force whose average wages amounted to roughly $20,000 a year. 
 The cheapest plan for a family cost about $1,500 a year in premiums and required workers to pay $3,000 in medical bills before Wal-Mart began paying any of their expenses. Even fewer could afford the more than $10,000 in bills they could end up responsible for under the plan. 
 By 2000, as Wal-Mart became the largest retailer in the country, its health insurance drew heightened scrutiny. Labor groups like the United Food and Commercial Workers, which has members in grocery chains that compete with Wal-Mart, called attention to the company's meager coverage. The evidence was compelling: Wal-Mart workers routinely showed up in large numbers on state Medicaid rolls from Georgia to Washington.
 Encouraged by the passage of the California law in 2003, dozens of states considered bills requiring Wal-Mart to spend more on employee health benefits. None of the laws remain on the books.
 In the fall of 2005, Wal-Mart made its first stab at responding to its critics, introducing a health plan with premiums as low as $11 a month.
 But even that attempt was undercut when, a few days later, The New York Times disclosed a company memorandum proposing ways to reduce health care spending by hiring more part-time workers and discouraging unhealthy people from working at Wal-Mart. One suggestion would have required cashiers to gather carts as exercise. 
 A combination of embarrassment, political necessity and internal pressure led to changes inside Wal-Mart's headquarters. Among those weighing in was Bill Clinton, a close Wal-Mart observer from his days as governor of Arkansas; he urged Mr. Scott to look beyond the motives of his critics and focus on making the company a better employer. 
 In April 2006, Mr. Scott replaced M. Susan Chambers, the author of the health care memo, with a high-profile colleague, Linda M. Dillman, who ran the formidable information technology division. Ms. Dillman said the assignment gave her pause. ''Is this a good thing or a bad thing,'' she recalled asking herself. ''Did I make somebody mad?''
 But she said Mr. Scott emphasized how important her task was, telling her, ''We need you to go make a difference in health care.''
 Ms. Dillman began by surveying Wal-Mart's workers, researching the health plans at the nation's most progressive employers and reaching out to top health policy experts.
 The new advisers did not mince words. ''You can do better by your employees,'' Mark D. Smith, chief executive of the powerful California Healthcare Foundation, told Wal-Mart executives at one meeting.
 But in wide-ranging conversations with federal officials like Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and executives like Michael J. Critelli, the executive chairman of Pitney Bowes, best known for making postage meters but also a leader in employee health care, Wal-Mart's executives began revising how they thought about benefits. 
 Wal-Mart ''went through an evolution that we went through 17 or 18 years ago,'' Mr. Critelli said. Pitney Bowes had tried to shift more health costs onto employees, only to find that after a certain point, ''it gets dysfunctional,'' he said. 
 He and others persuaded Ms. Dillman to think of health benefits as an investment in the work force rather than as a cost.
 If workers ''are healthy, they will do a better job at work, they'll be more productive, they'll be happier, nicer to our customers,'' Ms. Dillman said, all of which results in less absenteeism and turnover, a longstanding problem in retailing. Mr. Scott, meanwhile, met with several state governors, including Kathleen Sebelius in Kansas, a Democrat.
 Mr. Scott ''sees this as a collaborative effort,'' Ms. Sebelius said. ''We're delighted to have him at the table.''
 Wal-Mart also engaged in an all-out effort to win over its critics. Executives sought out policy analysts like Len Nichols, a health economist at the New America Foundation, which supports universal coverage, asking him, among other questions, ''What would the liberals say?''
 ''They just bombarded me with paperwork,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of the advocacy group Families USA, who receives frequent e-mail messages from the company about its changes. 
 And in a truce that would have been inconceivable several years ago, Mr. Scott held private conversations in late 2006 with Mr. Stern, the powerful union president, that culminated in a public agreement this year to seek universal health coverage. 
 ''I will assume good intentions, though the details will help decide if that is true,'' Mr. Stern said. These developments were only possible because Wal-Mart began to improve its health plans. 
 Last year, it cut the waiting time for part-timers to become eligible for coverage, from two years to one. Nearly half of Wal-Mart's part-time workers are now eligible, compared with just 30 percent in 2003, according to internal company data. The number of part-timers enrolled in company plans has more than doubled, to about 11 percent. 
 For 2008, all employees can choose from an array of plans, which the company hopes will allow even more workers to find one that suits their needs. Individual deductibles range from $350 to $2,000, and employees can choose plans with health care ''credits'' to use for routine care. Those credits are largely paid for through higher premiums.
 The company eliminated onerous fees like $150 monthly for covering a spouse and cut out separate deductibles, like an additional $1,000 for a hospital stay.
 A family can pay as little as $250 a year in premiums if it is willing to have a $4,000 deductible and be responsible for as much as $10,000 in medical bills, roughly the same plan that cost them $1,500 a few years ago. 
 Better coverage costs more: a plan where the family pays a $700 deductible and is responsible only for up to $4,000 in medical bills costs nearly $7,000 a year.
 Several critics contend that the company's low-wage workers still cannot afford a plan offering significant coverage. ''It's optics -- it looks pretty,'' said Charles Rader, who negotiates benefits for the United Food and Commercial Workers. 
 And Wal-Mart's insurance still pales in comparison to that offered by Costco, considered the gold standard in retailing because an employee pays just a few hundred dollars a year for generous individual coverage. But Wal-Mart is catching up to retailers like Home Depot and has in some ways surpassed Target, which makes part-timers wait two years to qualify for coverage. 
 Wal-Mart, which earned $11 billion last year, has not abandoned a corporate philosophy that demands low costs to ensure low prices. It contributes a fixed amount to cover an employee, so workers make up the cost of better coverage. ''If Wal-Mart goes out of business because of health care, we won't have accomplished anything in terms of helping people,'' Ms. Dillman said.
 The company hopes to save everybody money by promoting healthy living for workers. This year, it introduced a 24-hour telephone medical hot line operated by nurses from the Mayo Clinic and a program that encourages exercise and smoking cessation. 
 Jan Bennett, who works at a Wal-Mart in Broomfield, Colo., weighed 280 pounds and suffered from diabetes before enrolling in a test program last year. With peer pressure as motivator, Ms. Bennett, 50, cut out fried foods and carbohydrates. 
 She said she lost 76 pounds and no longer needs to take at least one $30-a-month diabetes drug. ''I have the support system of everyone in my store,'' Ms. Bennett said.
 Overall enrollment in Wal-Mart's health plans has inched upward, from 44 percent of its total work force in 2004 to 48 percent in 2007. Of the remaining workers, the vast majority receive health coverage through another source. As the sign-up period for next year's plans ends, enrollment for Wal-Mart plans continues to rise steadily, Ms. Dillman said.
 Among the converts is Katrina Wagner, who works in Tulsa, Okla. She did not sign up last year, assuming that as a healthy 20-year-old, she did not need insurance. But she found herself staying away from doctors to avoid the $150 to $200 expense. 
 This year, after store managers bombarded workers with information, Ms. Wagner chose a plan costing about $500 a year with a $350 deductible. ''It's very affordable for me,'' she said. 
 Ultimately, Wal-Mart may have an even bigger effect as it bring its legendary cost-cutting skills to the broader health industry, selling anything from wheelchairs to health insurance for much lower prices.
 ''If you really turned Wal-Mart loose and had Wal-Mart against the health care providers,'' Mr. Nichols, the health economist, said, ''it would be a fair fight.''

HEADLINE: The Character Factor

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

DATELINE: Rochester, N.H. 

 BODY:
 About six months ago, I was having lunch with a political consultant and we were having a smart-alecky conversation about the presidential race. All of sudden, my friend interrupted the flow of gossip and said: ''You know, there's really only one great man running for president this year, and that's McCain.''
 The comment cut through the way we pundits normally talk about presidential candidates. We tend to view them like products and base our verdicts on their market share at the moment. We don't so much evaluate their character; we analyze how effectively they are manipulating their image to appeal to voters, and in this way we buy into the artificiality of modern campaigning. 
 My friend's remark pierced all that, and it had the added weight of truth.
 Eight years ago, it was fashionable for us media types to wax rapturously about McCain. That vogue has passed, but I'm afraid my views are unchanged. I have seen McCain when his campaign was imploding, and now again when he's rising in the polls. I have seen him shooting craps and negotiating in the Senate. I have seen him leading delegations like a statesman and bickering with his old Hanoi Hilton prison-mate Bud Day like a crotchety old lady. 
 And I can tell you there is nobody in politics remotely like him.
 The first thing that still strikes one about McCain is his energy. In his book, ''The Nightingale's Song,'' Robert Timberg runs through primal force metaphors to describe the young McCain. ''Being on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck,'' Timberg wrote.
 Prison in Vietnam gave him self-respect and a cause greater than himself, but it didn't diminish his dynamism. His office in the Senate isn't tucked away in a tranquil corner of his suite; it's right in the vortex, and it's always empty because he's walking around. Campaigning last weekend in New Hampshire, he was his old restless self, never alone, craving contact, conversation and fun. 
 Timberg wrote that McCain fought against the system at the Naval Academy as if it were some hostile organism, ''as if any compromise meant surrendering a part of himself that he might never retrieve.'' 
 The years and the Senate have smoothed some of his rebelliousness, but he still fights a daily battle against the soul-destroying forms of modern politics.
 If you cover him for a day, you'd better bring 2,500 questions because in the hours he spends with journalists, you will run through all of them. Last Saturday, we talked about Pervez Musharraf's asceticism and Ted Williams's hitting philosophy, the Korean War and Hispanic voting patterns.
 He analyzed the debates he won and the times he was wooden. He talked about his failures as a fund-raiser and said he'd like to pick a running mate with formal economics training because he's weak in that area. He won't tell you everything, but there will never be a moment as the hours stretch by when you feel that he is spinning you, lying to himself or insulting your intelligence.
 Telling the truth is a skill. Those who don't do it habitually lose the ability, but McCain is well-practiced and has the capacity to face unpleasant truths. While other conservatives failed to see how corporations were insinuating themselves into their movement, McCain went after Boeing contracts. While others failed to see the rising tide of corruption around them, McCain led the charge against Jack Abramoff. While others ignored the spending binge, McCain was among the fiscal hawks. 
 There have been occasions when McCain compromised his principles for political gain, but he was so bad at it that it always backfired. More often, he is driven by an ancient sense of honor, which is different from fame and consists of the desire to be worthy of the esteem of posterity. 
 Other Republicans used to accuse him of kissing up to the news media. But when the Iraq war was at its worst, and other candidates were hiding in the grass waiting to see how things would turn out, McCain championed the surge, which the major Republican candidates now celebrate. 
 He did it knowing that it would cost him his media-darling status and probably the presidency. But for years he had hated the way the war was being fought. And when the opportunity to change it came, the only honorable course was to try. 
 And now he pushes ahead, building momentum, but desperately needing a miracle win in New Hampshire. Everyone will make their own political choices, and you might plausibly argue that the qualities John McCain possesses are not the ones the country now requires. But character is destiny, and you will never persuade me that he is not among the finest of men. 
 That human point seemed worth remembering, even amid the layers of campaign pretense.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Health Care Excuses'' (column, Nov. 9):
 What Paul Krugman writes about the excuses made by opponents of national health care is true. Moreover, the polls demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of Americans reject such excuses. We do not have a national health plan, not because Americans need further convincing, but rather because our Congressional representatives refuse to go mano a mano with the health insurance industry. 
 Viewing health care reform as a threat to profits, that industry's powerful lobby has blocked such legislation with political machinations, including campaign contributions that have been accepted by virtually every presidential candidate. The ''realistic'' health care plans that such candidates propose would merely preserve insurance industry profits, compromising the nation's health to accommodate that industry's money and political clout. 
 To achieve national health care, we need to make our case, not to the American people, who are already convinced, but rather to the politicians, who continue to deny the people's will because they are afraid of, or in bed with, the insurance industry. 
 Rita C. Tobin Chappaqua, N.Y., Nov. 9, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I live across the river from Windsor, Ontario, and for several years I've asked every Canadian I've met whether he or she would trade their health care system for ours. I have yet to get a ''yes'' answer to that question. And, as someone who is covered by Medicare, I completely agree with Paul Krugman's comment that Americans like the program very much.
 So it seems to me that since we already have a national, single-payer system called Medicare that works quite well, the most logical approach to health care reform would be to extend this system in gradual increments to the rest of the population, starting with the most vulnerable of our citizens -- children, the long-term unemployed and so forth -- until everyone is covered by the program. Am I missing something?
 Ralph Deeds Birmingham, Mich., Nov. 9, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman and others can heap as much praise as they want on the health care systems in Europe and elsewhere abroad. But the fact remains that if forced to choose between a European doctor and an American doctor, I would bet the house that most if not all Americans would choose their fellow patriots in lab coats. This point always seems to be omitted by those who make comparisons between the systems. 
 The quality of the doctor will always trump in importance the quality of the system. 
 Joshua P. Rosenstock New York, Nov. 9, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman describes many reasons we should refute those who state that universal health care is not a wise choice for this country. I have no disagreement with his view. But as a physician who has many colleagues working in other systems, I am aware of other obstacles that must be considered in reworking our system.
 First, all of the other systems have some form of rationing. This may come about in ways that are subtle and may not affect the larger statistics to which Mr. Krugman refers. 
 Second, the issues of malpractice liability that exist in this country do not burden other systems. Fear of malpractice certainly adds cost to care, as tests and treatments are ordered that may be of little or no value to the patient. Moreover, the cost of malpractice insurance is borne by all of us as a pass-through.
 Until we are willing to accept rationing of care at some level, and some level of tort reform, it may be difficult to provide universal health coverage in the United States. 
 Mark P. Solomon, M.D. Bala Cynwyd, Pa., Nov. 10, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 Paul Krugman writes, ''Diseases that are associated with obesity and other lifestyle-related problems play, at most, a minor role in high U.S. health care costs.''
 In fact, chronic diseases like coronary heart disease, diabetes and obesity account for more than 50 percent of health care costs in the United States and most of the world. Studies show that approximately 95 percent of these chronic diseases are preventable or even reversible just by making comprehensive lifestyle changes. 
 In contrast, more than $30 billion was spent last year on coronary angioplasties and stents despite evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that they do not prolong life or prevent heart attacks in stable patients. Newer technologies like coated stents may actually increase the risk of a heart attack or a stroke. 
 If we are to make universal coverage available and affordable, then significant resources need to be devoted to teaching people to make comprehensive lifestyle changes, not just to drugs and surgery. 
 Dean Ornish, M.D. Sausalito, Calif., Nov. 9, 2007 The writer is founder and president, Preventive Medicine Research Institute.
 To the Editor:
 President Bush's claim that those without insurance can ''just go to an emergency room'' for care displays a cold-hearted ignorance of the economic realities of health care. 
 It is true that most emergency rooms will provide urgent care without regard to ability to pay. This does not mean, however, that they will provide free care. It simply means that after the patient is treated, he will be billed, regardless of his ability to pay. His account will be turned over to collection agencies, regardless of his ability to pay. He may be driven into bankruptcy, where our new bankruptcy policies will fail to protect him from medical expenses. 
 But we should relax. After all, he was able to obtain treatment, even without insurance. 
 Maureen Hoffman Palo Alto, Calif., Nov. 9, 2007 The writer is a registered nurse.
 To the Editor:
 In reading Paul Krugman's latest column about the failings of the American health care system, I am moved to ask why the political right in this country is not actively pursuing health care reform. Surely, pro-business politicians should be in favor of transforming a system that mires businesses in complications and expense and that moreover serves as a block to entrepreneurship by offering a savage disincentive to anyone who would leave a stable job to form a new company.
 Rational, well-run health care should be promoted as the most pro-business, capitalist policy, and yet the right sees any move in this direction as socialized medicine and creeping Communism. Should we perhaps sense a vein of hypocrisy?

HEADLINE: Ministers Want Stronger Chinese Currency

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
European finance ministers meeting in Brussels urged China to let its currency strengthen so Europe's economy no longer bears the brunt of the slide in the United States dollar. The officials are stepping up complaints two weeks before a delegation led by Luxembourg's finance minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, arrives in Beijing to make the case for exchange-rate revaluation.

HEADLINE: Blackstone, Deal Maker, Posts Drop In Earnings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The Blackstone Group yesterday reported third-quarter earnings that were lower than in the period a year earlier, as troubles in the credit market shook up its real estate business.
 Analysts and investors have sought signs of how private equity has fared in the wake of turmoil in the credit markets this summer. As Blackstone is the biggest publicly traded private equity firm in the United States, its earnings can be seen as a measure of the buyout industry's health.
 But Blackstone's financial disclosures are more complex than most. Under generally accepted accounting principles, it reported a net loss of $113.2 million for the three months that ended Sept. 30, or 44 cents a common unit. In the period a year earlier, it earned $372.5 million in net income. 
 Much of this quarter's loss stems from $802.6 million in noncash charges related to stock awards given to executives as part of its initial public offering in June. The firm expects to make those payments for several years.
 Under a standard known as economic net income after taxes, which excludes income taxes, noncash compensation charges and the amortization of intangible assets, Blackstone reported $234 million in profit, down slightly from $239.1 million for the period a year earlier. That is equivalent to about 21 cents a common unit.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 30 cents a unit.
 Blackstone reported $526.7 million in revenue for the quarter, a 14 percent increase over last year. But its real estate division suffered a 44 percent drop from last year, earning $109.1 million.
 In an interview yesterday, Joan Solotar, Blackstone's senior managing director for public markets, attributed the unit's loss to fewer deal-related fees and troubles in the credit market. That turmoil has led to a decline in the values of real estate transactions during the quarter, which the firm uses to determine the values of its own holdings.
 In the last year, Blackstone's real estate business has made up a healthy chunk of the firm's profits through deals like the $39 billion buyout of Equity Office Properties Trust and the $26 billion purchase of Hilton Hotels. The Hilton deal closed last month, meaning that its transaction fees will apply to Blackstone's fourth quarter.
 The firm's private equity business reported $227.3 million in revenue for the quarter, up 42 percent from last year because of higher fees.
 Though the absence of cheap debt has ruled out the huge deals of the past year, Blackstone is pursuing smaller investments, according to Hamilton E. James, the firm's president and chief operating officer. Those include noncontrolling stakes in companies, often in countries like China and India, and they rely on less debt.
 ''We're not a one-trick pony,'' he said in a conference call with analysts.
 Those investments, however, provide less of the fee revenue that comes from larger buyouts.
 Blackstone's hedge fund unit reported $124.9 million in revenue, up 88 percent on growth in assets under management and strong performance. 
 Though he said that subprime mortgages were a ''black hole scarier than anyone thought,'' Mr. James said the company might soon see an investing opportunity in the risky loans. Blackstone is in the process of starting several new funds, including some specializing in buying debt, he said.
 Blackstone's financial advisory division earned $84.3 million, an increase of 60 percent.
 Mr. James said that because of federal budget deficits, businesses could soon face higher tax rates. But he said that legislation in Congress specifically singling out private equity firms lacked consensus and that the company would continue its lobbying.
 ''Our goal is to make sure we're consistently and fairly treated,'' he said.
 Shares in Blackstone closed yesterday at $22.26, down 8.3 percent. The stock has fallen 28 percent from the initial offering price of $31.

HEADLINE: Choppy Economy Posing Test for Disney

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Since becoming chief executive of the Walt Disney Company two years ago, Robert A. Iger has dazzled Wall Street by delivering soaring profits and moving aggressively to fix trouble spots.
 But now, for the first time under Mr. Iger's watch, Disney is sailing into some choppy waters. Two of the company's four growth engines -- theme parks and consumer products -- turn on the health of the economy, which indicators suggest is slowing. Striking television and movie writers threaten advertising income at ABC, which Disney owns.
 Hollywood's union problems also afflict Disney's film studio, which faces life without a new installment of its money machine, ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' and could be dealing with delays on big-screen franchise films like ''High School Musical 3.'' 
 How Mr. Iger navigates these and other challenges will either solidify or puncture his emerging reputation as a blockbuster chief executive, analysts say. ''Bob has done a spectacular job so far, but this is a test,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, the chief media analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''The easy growth is over.''
 Disney's recent success poses a conundrum. When a company delivers five consecutive years of double-digit growth in operating income, as Disney has done, anything less looks disappointing to Wall Street. Mr. Iger became chief executive in October 2005 after a period in which the Magic Kingdom was rocked by a shareholder revolt -- which toppled his predecessor, Michael D. Eisner -- and trouble in its core animation business.
 Despite the turmoil in the boardroom, Disney continued to perform, with most of its leading business units recently delivering record results. But a $35.5 billion company like Disney can grow only so fast -- especially with Mr. Iger preaching discipline when it comes to acquisitions.
 ''How much growth is there left in Disney? It's uncertain,'' said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
 Disney disagrees.
 ''Our strong portfolio of franchises has delivered recent growth, and we expect will deliver growth for the years to come,'' Mr. Iger said.
 He added that Disney's ability to score hits across its various business units ''allows us to reduce risk and to manage through economic cycles with a higher degree of certainty than our peers.'' As a policy, Disney does not offer earnings guidance.
 Investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach.
 Disney's stock, after soaring over 20 percent in early 2006 because of Mr. Iger's deal-making and corporate reshaping, has stalled of late. Shares of Disney, battered by overall market weakness in addition to concerns about 2008, fell 72 cents, to $32.02 on Monday, about flat from a year earlier.
 In comparison, the Dow Jones industrial average -- and Disney is one of the 30 Dow stocks -- has risen about 7 percent in the last year.
 ''One thing that I would like the market to appreciate more is the difference between Disney and other media companies,'' Thomas O. Staggs, the company's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. ''We don't just say that as a sound bite. Our brands and our ability to leverage them really set us apart.''
 In the company's quarterly conference call with analysts last week, Mr. Iger underlined the array of growth initiatives that Disney has in place. Indeed, the company is spending heavily -- capital expenditures will increase by up to $350 million in 2008 -- to position itself to deliver the kind of profit and revenue upticks that keep Wall Street happy.
 Among Disney's building projects is a $1 billion overhaul of its long-struggling California Adventure theme park in Southern California. (''Let's face it, we had a problem,'' Mr. Iger said.) Disney is also building two new cruise ships and a luxury resort in Hawaii. On the digital front, the company expects to plow about $175 million into video game development in 2008.
 As for the writers' strike, Mr. Iger said worries were premature.
 ''We actually think the network is well prepared,'' he said, noting that ''Lost'' (which has a stockpile of original episodes, thanks to its being kept off the air this fall) and an array of reality shows, including one from Oprah Winfrey called ''The Big Give,'' are sitting on ABC's bench.
 Mr. Staggs said the strike would not affect the film studio until 2009, if at all. Because movie scripts are finished well in advance -- and because studios have been stockpiling scripts -- a walkout would have to last more than four months to start cutting into movie production.
 Analysts have mixed opinions on the impact of the economy on Disney, particularly the parks and resorts unit, which delivers more than 20 percent of the company's annual operating profit.
 In the worst case -- a recession -- Mr. Nathanson estimates that operating profit at Disney's theme parks in the United States could decline as much as 30 percent. On the opposite end, Anthony Noto, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note last week, ''We continue to believe theme parks may be a source of growth upside.''
 Why the split? The fortunes of Disneyland and Disney World have traditionally been tied to consumer confidence and other economic factors, like gas prices and fluctuations in the value of the dollar. Some investors continue to hold that view.
 But in recent decades, as both parks have expanded in an effort to persuade vacationers to stay longer, a new school of thought says that the business might not be as tightly linked to the economy as it once was. Disney is rolling out new attractions at both destinations in the coming months and stepping up efforts to get foreign visitors to take advantage of favorable exchange rates.
 Moreover, modern consumers love their credit cards.
 ''People tend not to let anything get in the way of their Disney vacations,'' Mr. Staggs said. ''Our occupancies are higher at the hotels and spending is higher. Thus far, the business remains really solid.''

HEADLINE: Lawyer's Long Fight for Democracy Puts Him in Familiar Place: Jail

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Twenty-five years ago, when President Reagan treated Pakistan's dictator, Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, to a White House state dinner, a promising young lawyer out of Cambridge University languished in jail. He had protested too loudly, and too often, about the lack of democracy in his country.
 Now grayer and at the peak of his profession, the lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan, 63, sits in a Pakistani jail once again, reduced to seeing family visitors for 20 minutes a day, and accepting bags of fruit and bedding for some basic comfort.
 His crime is the same: making too much noise about democracy under the nose of a military ruler whom Washington has deemed indispensable to its strategic and security interests in the region, where the Taliban and Al Qaeda thrive. 
 On Saturday, as President Bush both pushed Pakistan's current leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to lift his de facto martial law, and praised him as a friend of the United States, Mr. Ahsan was ending his first week in a solitary cell, this time for leading the lawyers' movement that has become the symbol of resistance against the Musharraf government.
 Mr. Ahsan's detention at once reflects how much has changed in Pakistan in a quarter century, and how much has stayed the same. The lawyers' movement he leads, which emerged only this year, is part of a budding civil society here, separate and untainted by the military. 
 At the same time, many of the old ways persist, like the dominance of the Pakistani military in the nation's politics, encouraged, many here say, by decades of support from the United States. 
 For Mr. Ahsan's family in particular, there are eerie and disturbing parallels between the days when the United States armed General Zia with billions of dollars to fight a proxy war against the Soviets in Afghanistan and today, when the Bush administration has bankrolled General Musharraf with an estimated $10 billion to fight terrorism.
 On both occasions, they contend, America's realpolitik interests trumped the interests of democratic rule for Pakistanis. ''Both my parents were in jail when Reagan welcomed Zia to the White House with a 21-gun salute,'' said Ali Ahsan, the son of Mr. Ahsan, and also a lawyer. ''Now Musharraf is the current White House's blue-eyed boy.''
 The younger Mr. Ahsan said he found it hard to believe that ''essentially the same play is being re-enacted.''
 ''I thought by this age we would be beyond it,'' he said.
 Of course, history never repeats itself in precisely the same way, and in each iteration of military rule here the generals have reigned over a somewhat different Pakistan. Likewise the American policy has varied, too. 
 The independent television stations with acerbic news coverage, which General Musharraf has now taken off the air with his emergency decree, did not even exist a decade ago. The buoyant stock market and commercial markets of Karachi have likewise changed the statist economy.
 While President Reagan made few concessions for American support of right-wing dictators in pursuit of the larger aims of the cold war, Mr. Bush today is in the far more delicate position of having made promotion of democracy, especially in the Islamic world, the announced centerpiece of his foreign policy. 
 Not least among the historical turnabouts, the mujahedeen that President Reagan supported against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan are the distant echo of the Islamic radicals the United States fights in the region today.
 In the view of some here, the grand schemes of the political and military leaders in both nations have played out at great personal cost to Pakistanis like Mr. Ahsan. His wife, Bushra, who was under house arrest during General Zia's rule for protesting in favor of women's rights, said she used to remind American diplomats in the 1980s that ''your military aid to Pakistan is hostile to the people of Pakistan.''
 Similarly, she said, the $10 billion that Washington has given the Pakistani military -- much of it spent on weapons systems unrelated to the fight against Al Qaeda -- would have been better spent on building up the civilian institutions that have atrophied under eight years of military rule. 
 General Musharraf's de facto martial law is doing still deeper damage, she and others say. When the general introduced martial law nine days ago, Mr. Ahsan was the first to be picked up, marched out of his office by the police as he finished a news conference condemning the new emergency decree that dismissed the Supreme Court, scrapped the Constitution and banned independent television stations and protests.
 ''This country is in a deep, deep crisis; this cannot stand,'' were among his last words before disappearing into a police car.
 Since Mr. Ahsan's arrest, thousands of lawyers have been arrested, many of them senior members of the bar who represented the biggest challenge to the government, according to lawyers who are keeping track.
 In Punjab alone, 1,374 lawyers were arrested across the province on Nov. 5, according to the provincial home secretary. Many remain in jail, and other lawyers were still being arrested, members of bar associations said.
 Pakistani lawyers galvanized opposition to General Musharraf after he suspended the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, in the spring.
 An accomplished orator, a bit of a showman and a member of the Pakistan Senate, Mr. Ahsan quickly emerged as the judge's champion. He drove his four-wheel-drive vehicle around Pakistan's back country, strategizing with the judge in the passenger seat, as they moved from campaign stop to campaign stop challenging General Musharraf.
 Mr. Ahsan has won many court cases, some for clients with less than spectacular reputations, and some for more noble causes, including the reinstatement of Mr. Chaudhry in July.
 That victory set him on the path of irreconcilable differences with the Musharraf government, which saw the chief justice as its main enemy, and Mr. Ahsan as his chief promoter.
 Mr. Ahsan's colleagues say they admire his instinct for combat in and out of the court.
 When the nominating papers for General Musharraf's re-election as president were submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan in September, a melee broke out between police officers and angry lawyers. An officer hit Mr. Ahsan in the chest with a brick, and Mr. Ahsan responded, grabbing his assailant by the neck, said Feisal Naqvi, a lawyer in Lahore and a colleague.
 Mr. Naqvi said he wished Mr. Ahsan ''were out here with us telling us what to do.''
 ''He is irreplaceable,'' Mr. Naqvi said. ''He can fight on every level.''
 Even without Mr. Ahsan's guiding hand, the lawyers have set down basic principles to try to cripple the judiciary as a way of undermining the emergency decree.
 One effort is to dissuade judges dismissed from the bench under the emergency decree from taking a new oath under martial law.
 Lawyers opposed to the decree are also urging other lawyers not to be flattered by offers from the government to become judges.
 For the moment, the Supreme Court and the four provincial High Courts have so many vacancies that they cannot operate.
 When Mr. Ahsan's sister-in-law, Nighat Asad, emerged Monday afternoon from the Central Jail in Rawalpindi, the garrison city adjacent to the capital, she described Mr. Ahsan as ''fine.'' 
 ''We don't ask too many questions,'' she said.
 Then she and her two sisters, dressed in soft silks and scarves that contrasted with the hard iron jail fence and dusty jailyard, drove off to prepare for another visit in the coming days.
 During his stints in jail in the 1980s and 1990s, Mr. Ahsan wrote ''The Indus Saga and the Making of Pakistan,'' a book that looked at Pakistan in a different way: not as a state created specifically for Muslims, but as a state with a long specific historical and ethnic tradition.
 In the foreword, he wrote: ''No one who has not experienced life on the wrong side of prison walls can understand this commitment, indeed a yearning, for a better, more liberal, more tolerant society in Pakistan. My only prayer is that never again in this land should prison seem to be the only honorable option for political activists or for anyone else for that matter.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Up 0.6%, Damping Fears of Recession

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Japan's economy grew more than expected in the third quarter, as exports and capital spending helped avert a recession, and quieted some concerns about the economy. 
 Financial markets, focusing more on the global economic outlook and recent tumbles in American stock markets, showed limited initial reaction to the stronger-than-expected 0.6 percent quarterly growth in Japan's economy, the world's second largest.
The G.D.P. figures, issued a few hours before the Bank of Japan announces its latest interest rate decision, topped a consensus market forecast of a 0.4 percent expansion, despite a sharp fall in housing investment.
 The rebound in growth means that Japan avoided a recession, which is often defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, after the economy shrank 0.4 percent in April-June.
 ''The data showed the economy bounced back from negative growth in April-June, and prices are seen rising gradually,'' said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at the Norinchukin Research Institute.
 Japan's economy grew 2.6 percent annualized, compared with annualized growth of 3.9 percent in the United States in the same quarter. 
 Private housing investment tumbled 7.8 percent, the biggest drop in more than 10 years. This mostly reflected tighter Japanese building rules rather than the subprime mortgage troubles in the United States.
 But the weak construction was offset by strong exports and private-capital spending. Capital spending rose 1.7 percent, while external demand -- exports minus imports -- pushed up growth by four-tenths of a percentage point.
 Personal consumption, which accounts for some 55 percent of the economy, rose 0.3 percent in the quarter, weighed down by sluggishness in wages.

HEADLINE: Study Compares States' Math and Science Scores With Other Countries'

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
American students even in low-performing states like Alabama do better on math and science tests than students in most foreign countries, including Italy and Norway, according to a new study released yesterday. That's the good news.
 The bad news is that students in Singapore and several other Asian countries significantly outperform American students, even those in high-achieving states like Massachusetts, the study found. 
 ''In this case, the bad news trumps the good because our Asian economic competitors are winning the race to prepare students in math and science,'' said the study's author, Gary W. Phillips, chief scientist at the American Institutes of Research, a nonprofit independent scientific research firm.
 The study equated standardized test scores of eighth-grade students in each of the 50 states with those of their peers in 45 countries. Experts said it was the first such effort to link standardized test scores, state by state, with scores from other nations.
 Gage Kingsbury, a director at the Northwest Evaluation Association, a group in Oregon that carries out testing in 1,500 school districts, praised the study's methodology but said ''a flock of difficulties'' made it hazardous to compare test results from one country to another and from one state to another. ''Kids don't start school at the same age in different countries,'' he said. ''Not all kids are in school in grade eight, and the percentage differs from country to country.'' 
 Because of such differences, Dr. Kingsbury said, it would be a mistake to infer too much about the relative rigor of the educational systems across the states and nations in the study based merely on test score differences.
 The scores for students in the United States came from tests administered by the federal Department of Education in most states in 2005 and 2007. For foreign students, the scores came from math and science tests administered worldwide in 2003, as part of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, known as the Timss.
 Concern that science and math achievement was not keeping pace with the nation's economic competitors had been building even before the most recent Timss survey, in which the highest-performing nations were Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. American students lagged far behind those nations, but earned scores that were comparable to peers in European nations like Slovakia and Estonia, and were well above countries like Egypt, Chile and Saudi Arabia.
 The Timss survey gives each country a metric by which to compare its educational attainment with other nations'. The nationwide American test, known as the National Assessments of Educational Progress, allows policy makers in each state to compare their students' results with those in other states. 
 The new study used statistical linking to compare scores on the national assessment, state by state, with other nations' scores on the Timss. Dr. Phillips, who from 1999 to 2002 led the agency of the Department of Education that administers the national assessment, likened the methodology to what economists do when they convert international currencies into dollars to compare poverty levels across various countries, for instance.
 On the most recent national assessment, the highest-performing state in math was Massachusetts, and in science, North Dakota. The new study shows that average math achievement in Massachusetts was lower than in the leading Asian nations and in Belgium, but higher than in 40 other countries, including Australia, Russia, England and Israel.
 Mississippi was the lowest-performing state in both math and science. In math, Mississippi students' achievement was comparable to those of peers in Bulgaria and Moldova, and in science, to those in Norway and Romania.
 In math, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York students were roughly equivalent with each other and with their peers in Australia, the Netherlands and Hungary.
 The study's contribution is the high-level perspective it offers on the nation's education system, a bit the way a satellite image highlights the nation's topography, said Thomas Toch, a co-director of Education Sector, an independent policy group.
 ''It shows we're not doing as badly as some say,'' Mr. Toch said. ''We're in the top half of the table, and a number of states are outperforming the majority of the nations in the study. But our performance in math and science lags behind that of the front-running Asian nations.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Cut Jet Pollution Is Approved In Europe

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and JAMES KANTER; Matthew L. Wald reported from Washington and James Kanter from Paris.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The European Union voted Tuesday to impose quotas on the emission of carbon dioxide by airlines, setting up a fight with the United States, which argues against unilateral actions on aviation, a relatively small but rapidly growing source of global warming gases. 
 The European Parliament gave preliminary approval to a global warming control plan that would require, beginning in 2011, that airlines flying to and from Europe offset some of their emissions by buying carbon dioxide allowances on the open market. 
 A result would be increased pressure on airlines to do more to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases from burning jet fuel. Europe has imposed similar emissions limits on other industries for several years in search of steep reductions in its greenhouse gas production. 
 The cost of this proposal to the airlines is hard to estimate, because the price of carbon allowances has varied widely, as has the value of the currency in which they are denominated, the euro. The goal would be to reduce future emissions to 90 percent of the average given off in recent years, or to offset any excess above that limit.
 The backers of the plan said they hoped other countries would emulate the European approach.
 ''We want a worldwide system as soon as possible,'' said Peter Liese, a German member of the Parliament who helped to guide the legislation through the assembly, which met in Strasbourg, France. ''There must be an end to the status quo that nothing is done in the aviation sector and which has predominated for many years now.'' 
 Airline emissions were not part of the Kyoto Protocol's targets for reducing each nation's output of greenhouse gases. Limits on airlines were left to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency. This year, in anticipation of the European action, that organization passed a resolution emphasizing that it would be in charge of carbon reduction agreements, but it has not acted.
 Carl Burleson, the director of the office of environment and energy at the Federal Aviation Administration, said after the European vote, ''This doesn't go along with what the world community agreed to, which is that you should undertake this on the basis of mutual agreement.'' 
 To reduce the region's emissions of carbon dioxide, which come mostly from burning fossil fuels, Europe has established a trading arrangement. Companies that face high costs for reducing their emissions can purchase credits from other companies that can cut emissions as less cost. The price of credits fluctuates.
 The United States has never joined in the Kyoto agreement, although Congress is debating regulations on carbon emissions. 
 Some American environmentalists hailed the European action. ''It's a big step forward to include airlines,'' said Rafe Pomerance, president of the Climate Policy Center, an environmental advocacy group. He helped negotiate the Kyoto agreement during the Clinton administration.
 The European Union plans to begin by putting internal flights under its existing carbon control plan. 
 The airlines have been stressing technology as a way to cut emissions per flight. For example, the jumbo Airbus A380 is supposed to burn 17 percent less fuel per seat than a Boeing 747-400, and the Boeing 787, which is supposed to begin test flights next year, is supposed to burn 30 percent less fuel than average planes. 
 The Federal Aviation Administration argues that improvements in air traffic control will reduce emissions per flight, by letting airplanes fly on more direct routes and at altitudes that are more efficient for their engines But experts also say the improvements will allow more traffic, driving total emissions higher. 
 On average, studies have found, a traveler making a typical trip in a plane accounts for roughly the same greenhouse gas emissions as one traveling alone by car -- although much depends on the details of any particular trip.
 At a conference last month in Washington on global aircraft emissions, Shigenori Hiraoka, a researcher at the Japan International Transport Institute, pointed out that transportation emissions were 14 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in 2004, but that aviation was just 6 percent of those emissions. That puts emissions from aviation in the range of 1 percent of all emissions. ''Aviation's share is still small,'' he said. ''Why bother?'' 
 The answer, he said, was that aviation is galloping ahead, with growth of about 4.4 percent a year, overwhelming the fuel economy gains of about 1.3 percent a year. 
 While American carriers resist being brought into Europe's control system, European airlines oppose it, too. Last week Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, said in a speech at the International Aviation Club in Washington, ''We need a mechanism that will allow us to continue to meet the rising demand for air travel until more fundamental technological breakthroughs are made.''

HEADLINE: For Olympics, China's Marketers Are Showing Their Pride

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THERE are those who consider the Summer Olympics a quadrennial exercise in hyperbolic marketing, a five-ring circus of commercialism interrupted occasionally for televised glimpses of muscular youth doing something with batons or volleyballs.
 Still, the coming Games in Beijing, now less than nine months away, promise to be an important moment for Madison Avenue, if not for furthering understanding among nations. The billions of dollars that will be spent on Olympics-related advertising -- directly by sponsors, and indirectly by marketers seeking to bask in the reflected glow -- could smooth the bumpy ride the advertising industry is now enduring.
 With fears that the tumult in the American economy may lead marketers to cut budgets for next year, the Olympic campaigns could make the forecasts of growth in global ad spending in 2008 come true. 
 For instance, a prediction in June by the Universal McCann media agency saw a 5.5 percent increase in worldwide ad spending next year compared with 2007.
 Industry executives are also excited about the choice of location for the Summer Games (even if some political activists are not). They look forward to the Olympics' shining a brighter spotlight on China as the country's consumer economy becomes increasingly powerful.
 The recent Global Entertainment and Media Outlook report from PricewaterhouseCoopers is forecasting that ad spending in China in six major media will increase to $22.5 billion in 2011, from $13 billion this year.
 The ardent embrace of the Olympics by the Chinese government -- and, by extension, its citizens -- also promises to raise the profile of the campaigns surrounding the Games.
 For instance, the Olympic torch relay, scheduled to begin in March, is planned as the longest ever. The sponsors are a Chinese company, the Lenovo Group, along with Coca-Cola and Samsung.
 The Chinese ''are very proud of the fact they're hosting the Olympics,'' said Susan Towers, managing director at Chandelier, an agency that has offices in Hong Kong, London and New York and that hopes to open in Beijing or Shanghai next year.
 ''The national pride is being expressed as 'We can do anything,''' she added.
 As a result, the competition among agencies for work from Chinese advertisers is taking on Olympian overtones. JWT, part of the WPP Group, is to announce today that it has landed five assignments to create campaigns in China to appear during the Summer Olympics, two of them after reviews that involved other agencies.
 Three of the assignments for JWT are from Olympic sponsors: Lenovo, the computer maker, which is a top-tier sponsor though the International Olympic Committee; China Unicom, a mobile phone network, which is a national sponsor; and another national sponsor, the Yili Group, which is China's biggest dairy.
 The remaining two assignments are from Chinese companies that are not official Olympic sponsors but will run campaigns in the country during the Games. If consumers who see the ads somehow come to think of the companies as official sponsors, well, as someone once said, all is fair in love and advertising.
 One of those two assignments is from Anta Sports Products, which sells athletic footwear and apparel. The other is from Lilang, a maker of men's wear like suits. Anta, Lenovo and Yili were JWT clients before the assignments were made. 
 For the Chinese, the Summer Olympics ''is way more than just an extravaganza of sporting spirit,'' Tom Doctoroff, chief executive at JWT Greater China and the Northeast Asia area director for the agency, said in a telephone interview.
 It signals to them ''the emergence of China, standing next to the United States and assuming its rightful place as a center of gravity,'' he added.
 Mr. Doctoroff, who is based in Shanghai, said he had not detected ''one iota of cynicism'' among the Chinese about the arrival of the Olympics. He compared that with the negative attitudes of many Westerners whose cities are playing -- or hoping to play -- host to the Summer or Winter Games.
 He ruefully recalled ''my brother, who got all New York not behind him.'' The reference was to Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development in New York City, whose bid to land the 2012 Summer Games lost to London's.
 ''That type of feeling -- 'It's a waste,' 'We don't need the Olympics' -- it's not there'' in China, Tom Doctoroff said.
 As a result, he predicted that an Olympics ''has never come as close to harnessing the emotions of a country as this one will.''
 That means the stakes will be extraordinarily high for advertisers, official or otherwise, who pay for campaigns to appear during the Summer Games -- as well as for the agencies that will create those campaigns.
 ''The good ones will be devoured and celebrated by the entire nation,'' Mr. Doctoroff said of the ads.
 ''The bad ones, the ones that make China look bad, feel bad about itself, will engender hostility,'' he added.
 Mr. Doctoroff praised the preliminary Olympics campaigns now appearing in China for two official sponsors that are not JWT clients.
 One, Coca-Cola, ''has a promising platform,'' he said, that celebrates ''refreshment, physical and spiritual.'' The other, Johnson & Johnson, is centered on ''the spirit of winning,'' he added, ''infused with the warmth of J.& J.''
 As the JWT work for Lenovo and Yili gets under way, Mr. Doctoroff said, the challenge the agency faces creatively is ''to marry the product characteristics with the spirit of the Olympics in a way that makes the brands bigger and bolder.''
 For Lenovo, which is supplying computers and other equipment to the Beijing organizers, there is an additional challenge, he added, which is to reflect ''a responsibility to help ensure the successful management of the Games.''
 The work for Lilang, also being developed, will express the idea that ''in China, business is a competitive sport,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''so having your eye on the prize is as relevant in business as in an athletic competition.''
 JWT's work for Anta has already started to appear. The ads feature Olympic athletes like Wang Hao, a table tennis player, but do not include Olympic logos, because the company is not an official sponsor.
 ''The brand vision is 'Forge yourself,''' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''that from sweat, talent and hard work, glory emerges.''
 It is a vision statement that could come as readily from advertising executives as from muscular youth with batons or volleyballs.

HEADLINE: Mentally Ill In Serbia Are Abused, Report Says

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
A 21-year-old man with Down syndrome tied to a metal crib for 11 years. Children, naked from the waist down, left to eat and defecate in their beds. A 7-year-old girl with fluid in her brain left untreated ''because she will die anyway.''
 These are some of the allegations of abuse at Serbian state mental institutions and orphanages described in a report to be released Wednesday by Mental Disability Rights International, a group based in Washington that spent four years investigating the treatment of some of the 17,200 children and adults with disabilities in institutions in Serbia. 
 In the report, which is expected to be read closely by European Union officials who are assessing Serbia's readiness to join the 27-member bloc, researchers concluded that ''filthy conditions, contagious diseases, lack of medical care and rehabilitation and a failure to provide oversight renders placement in a Serbian institution life-threatening.'' European Union officials said that such reports would be a basis for their assessments of a country's record in upholding human rights, and of its readiness to enter the union. 
 The institutions investigated include the Kolevka, or Institution for Children and Youth, in Subotica; the Institute for Mentally Ill People, in Curug; the Institution for Children and Youth, in Kulina; the Special Institute for Children and Youth, in Stamnica; and psychiatric hospitals in Vrsac and Kovin, east of Belgrade.
 Eric Rosenthal, executive director of the rights group, said the use of physical restraints on children for years at a time was the most extreme he had seen during 14 years as a disability rights advocate. He said there were no enforceable laws in Serbia regulating the use of such restraints.
 ''This is the most horrifying abuse I have seen on powerless children, who are tied to beds and unable to move,'' he said. ''This constitutes a clear case of torture.''
 Vladimir Pesic, a Serbian government official dealing with disability issues, declined to comment, saying he had not seen the report.
 Last week, the European Union gave pro-Western forces in Serbia a lift by supporting a deal that would accelerate Serbia's joining the union by cementing closer economic and political ties. But the allegations of abuses could add to the hurdles Belgrade faces, which include its failure to arrest and turn over war crimes suspects indicted in The Hague and the uncertain future of the breakaway province of Kosovo.
 Mr. Rosenthal said the extent of the abuse at mental institutions in Serbia was particularly egregious, given that countries had spent tens of millions of euros to help rebuild institutions in Serbia after the 1999 NATO-led war against the country, when it was led by Slobodan Milosevic.
 ''The mental institutions have been newly rebuilt with the help of the West, so the abuse is happening in clean, new buildings built with foreign money,'' he said. ''This tragedy could have been prevented.''
 Laurie Ahern, an investigator who toured the Serbian mental institutions with a registered nurse, said she was most alarmed by the case of a man with Down syndrome, who was tied to his bed at Stamnica, an institution southeast of Belgrade.
 When Ms. Ahern asked a nurse how long it had been since the patient had left the bed, the nurse replied, ''Eleven years,'' she said.
 ''There were rows upon rows of young people with Down syndrome,'' Ms. Ahern said. ''These children are mobile and can move around. But they are being left in metal coffins to lie there until the day they die.''

HEADLINE: Where Savage Parasites Rot a Nation From Within

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
GOMORRAH 
 A Personal Journey Into the Violent International Empire of Naples' Organized Crime System 
 By Roberto Saviano 
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux. 301 pages. $25. 
 In the United States organized crime has entered a Tony Soprano twilight, as small-time bosses carve up ever-smaller wedges of a shrinking pie. In Italy, by contrast, all systems are go. In shipping, fashion and construction, to name just three booming businesses, the mob holds sway, often acting through, rather than despite, local government. All told, according to a recent report by an Italian small-business association, mob-related activity accounts for the single largest sector of the Italian economy. 
 Roberto Saviano, a young Italian journalist, counts the cost in ''Gomorrah,'' his savage indictment of the Neapolitan crime organization known as the Camorra. Although less well known than the Mafia, its Sicilian counterpart, the Camorra has held the economy of southern Italy in a tight grip for more than a century. With time it has adapted and modernized, spreading from Naples to outlying towns, while adding financial services and real estate to its expanding portfolio. 
 ''Never in the economy of a region has there been such a widespread, crushing presence of criminality as in Campania in the last 10 years,'' Mr. Saviano writes. 
 The garment sweatshops of Secondigliano, a small town on the outskirts of Naples, provide Mr. Saviano with a case study. Day and night, highly skilled workers turn out low-cost counterfeits that compare favorably in quality with the originals from the big fashion houses. The factories are bankrolled by the Camorra, which lends money at low rates. Factory workers get their mortgages through the Camorra. Once completed, the clothes often find their way to boutiques owned by the Camorra all over Europe, many in Camorra-owned shopping malls. 
 The Camorra has come a long way since the days of cigarette smuggling. But despite the corporate face, it relies on age-old techniques of intimidation and violence, which Mr. Saviano describes in gruesome detail. When Cammoristi want to send a message, they do a thorough job. Enforcers make their point with one victim by sawing his head off with a metal grinder and blowing it up. The notorious Pasquale Barra, better known as the Animal, set new standards some years back when he ripped a target's heart out with his bare hands and then bit into it. 
 Mr. Saviano, whose hometown, Casal di Principe, lies in the heart of Camorra territory, comes up with a total of 3,600 bodies since 1979, the year he was born. 
 Objective, analytic journalism is foreign to Mr. Saviano. The subject at hand is too personal, and in any case he takes a fiery, romantic view of the reporter's mission. ''I believe that the way to truly understand, to get to the bottom of things, is to smell the hot breath of reality, to touch the nitty-gritty,'' he writes. 
 This passion for close-up, eyewitness reporting leads him to take small-time jobs in Camorra businesses, to show up whenever the police turn up a dead body and to mingle in the open-air drug market in Secondigliano, where fresh batches of heroin are tested on addict volunteers. If they drop dead, the batch is too potent. 
 The up-close style and the floridly noir prose make for vivid scenes. When he's concentrating properly, Mr. Saviano also exposes the nuts and bolts of Camorra operations, complete with names and precise figures. His account of the drug trade, which the Camorra has shrewdly expanded to serve the casual, middle-class customer, is a model of muckraking journalism. 
 So are the chapters on the construction industry and the Camorra's sinister trade in illegal waste dumping, much of it toxic. All over Italy highly trained experts in law and the environment make the rounds of Italian businesses, offering to ship everything from dead bodies to printer toner to illegal dumping sites in the south. This is worth billions of dollars a year. 
 From time to time Mr. Saviano takes flight on his own prose and, drunk with indignation, loses touch with the nitty-gritty. His chapter on the port of Naples, where Chinese entrepreneurs now control the illegal offloading of containers, makes for colorful reading, but Mr. Saviano neglects to explain how the Camorra fits in. Often names and killings speed by in a blur, devoid of context. Mr. Saviano never does explain the Camorra's structure adequately.
 Granted, it is a bewildering mess. The sheer scope of the Camorra's businesses numbs even Mr. Saviano, who confesses to despair. Everything, he writes, seems to belong to the mob: ''land, buffalos, farms, quarries, garages, dairies, hotels and restaurants.'' 
 A small flicker of hope burns in a chapter devoted to Don Peppino Diana, a crusading priest who denounces the Camorra from his pulpit in Casal di Principe, organizes protest marches and sets up community programs to siphon support for the Camorra.
 ''He decided to take an interest in the dynamics of power and not merely its corollary suffering,'' Mr. Saviano writes. ''He didn't want merely to clean the wound but to understand the mechanisms of the metastasis, to prevent the cancer from spreading, to block the source of whatever was turning his home into a gold mine of capital with an abundance of cadavers.'' 
 On March 19, 1994, the name day of his patron saint, Don Peppino was approached in his church by armed men who shot him in the head at close range. He died instantly. Mr. Saviano, for his part, has been forced to live in hiding under police protection since his book was published last year in Italy.

HEADLINE: Paying to Hear the Complaints

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO

 BODY:
Through focus groups, surveys and random interviews, big businesses have been tapping the wisdom of their customers in some form for years. Now new Web-based services are making it easier for smaller businesses to compile important customer information, too.
 The new entities -- companies like PowerReviews, Bazaarvoice and RelevantMind -- all offer inexpensive feedback methods that can be used to incorporate valuable customer intelligence into their daily operations. 
 ''For firms that don't have the resources to get this data on their own, these services are fantastic,'' said Sarah Rotman Epps, an e-business analyst for Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''They level the playing field so smaller merchants can gather the same information as larger ones.'' 
 Using online customer reviews in company decision-making was pioneered in the late 1990s by Amazon.com and eBay. More recently, service providers like the Communispace Corporation have improved the strategy by adding features to categorize feedback that could be helpful to business owners down the road. 
 The latest services offer more innovations. PowerReviews, which is based in Millbrae, Calif., tabulates customer feedback that it compiles into a report for its subscribing vendors on which marketing strategies work best.
 Bazaarvoice, in Austin, Tex., sells software that tracks digital conversations about a particular product across the Internet. 
 The newest kid on the block is RelevantMind, which began operations last month and mines forums in niche categories (road bikes, cooking, snowboarding, among others) on the Internet for customer conversations. Aaron Mann, the chief executive, said that the service enables vendors to see which products get the most attention -- for better or for worse.
 ''People in these niches are very passionate about their gear, and sometimes the opinions can get pretty raw,'' Mr. Mann said in a phone interview from the company's Berkeley, Calif., headquarters. ''On the Internet, at least from a small business's perspective, the unfiltered conversations tend to be the most informative.''
 Customers also benefit from the new services. 
 Earlier this summer, for instance, when NetShops, an online retailer in Omaha, received complaints about customers who had trouble assembling a particular Adirondack chair, the PowerReviews service notified the company immediately. 
 After reading the negative posts, Jay Gordman, the retailer's director of e-commerce, had employees try to assemble a chair themselves. When the employees discovered that some holes in the chair had been drilled incorrectly, Mr. Gordman demanded a new supply from the manufacturer.
 ''In the long run, we probably would have discovered the problem eventually through returns,'' said Mr. Gordman. ''This way, we were able to deal with it a lot faster, improving the customer experience much more quickly.''
 The benefits of these services trickle down to manufacturers, too. Rex Creekmur, director of marketing at Rugs Direct, an online rug retailer in Winchester, Va., said that when feedback from the Bazaarvoice service indicated customers were lukewarm about a product, he notified manufacturers so they could tweak a product in development accordingly.
 ''Manufacturers need to know if there's a problem so they can take measures to correct it,'' Mr. Creekmur wrote in a recent e-mail. ''The last thing anybody wants is an unhappy customer who is saying nasty things about a product.''
 As the use of feedback services becomes more prevalent among small businesses, some companies are starting to develop their own solutions, hiring programmers to tap the wisdom of crowds.
 Backcountry.com, an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer in Park City, Utah, for instance, introduced its own feedback service earlier this year, and within months, customer comments about a product prompted the vendor to drop a leaky hydration system from a popular manufacturer. 
 ''We've always said that customer response dictates what we buy and sell,'' said John Bresee, Backcountry.com's president. ''It doesn't matter what we're using to collect that information; if we're carrying a product that our customers don't like, I want to know about it so I can act.''
 Both Mr. Bresee and Mr. Gordman warned that it was important to maintain perspective when mining customers for business intelligence, and essential to remember that negative reviews are not definitive.
 Lauren Freedman, president of the E-Tailing Group, a market research firm in Chicago, added that customer service is about dealing with exceptions, and that some customers -- no matter what they buy or where they buy it -- will never be happy.
 ''As a small-business owner, when you see one or two negative comments, it could be nothing,'' she said. ''It's when you see five or more that it's time to act.''

HEADLINE: Near Seattle, Tribal Casinos Lead to Even Bigger Bets

BYLINE: By LINDA BAKER

DATELINE: TULALIP INDIAN RESERVATION, Wash. 

 BODY:
For many American Indian tribes, a watershed moment occurs when they open a casino, which provides a stream of steady income. For the Tulalip tribes, a group of several tribes on this reservation about 35 miles north of Seattle, the casino was also a springboard for new real estate ventures -- which in turn are helping to transform a rural area into one of Washington state's fastest-growing suburbs.
 The economic engine is Quil Ceda Village, a commercial area within the reservation, where the tribes built a 225,000-square-foot casino in 2003.
 The village also has a Home Depot, a Wal-Mart and more than a dozen other stores, banks and restaurants. In 2005, the tribes added Seattle Premium Outlets, a 500,000-square-foot open-air mall. A 2,300-seat amphitheater, used for performances, opened in August 2006. 
 ''The vision is diversification,'' said John McCoy, a tribal member and the general manager of Quil Ceda Village.
 Hospitality and retail properties are just the beginning, said Mr. McCoy, who is also a state representative. About 1,000 of the 2,000 acres that the tribes have set aside for Quil Ceda have yet to be developed, and Mr. McCoy said he had been fielding inquiries from companies that supply Boeing and from technology companies about erecting industrial buildings. The reservation itself is 22,000 acres.
 The tribes are currently working on the $130 million 12-story Tulalip Hotel, which is to open next July. It will include 30,000 square feet of conference space, meant for weddings and corporate meetings; a day spa; $1 million in tribal art; and themed suites like a ''high tech'' suite featuring a 70-inch plasma TV and Xbox 360, PlayStation and Nintendo Wii game systems.
 There are other economic development models among Indian reservations around the country, Mr. McCoy said. ''We can do what we're doing because of location, location, location,'' he said. 
 Located 100 miles from Vancouver, British Columbia, next to a busy stretch of Interstate 5, Quil Ceda Village is in Snohomish County, the 15th fastest growing county among the nation's 100 most populated counties, according to Census Bureau figures released last spring. From 2000 to 2006, the county grew by 11 percent, to 669,887 people from 606,024. Population growth was a factor in the recent decision to create a branch campus of the University of Washington in the county.
 The Tulalips are helping to fuel the boom, said Matt Smith, vice president of the Economic Development Council of Snohomish County. The tribes' 1,000-acre industrial property is the largest undeveloped parcel under single ownership in the county, said Mr. Smith, who has spread the word to manufacturing and distribution companies. Referring to the Tulalips, he said, ''They can afford to be selective.'' 
 Quil Ceda Village attracts about 20,000 daily visitors and brought in about $30 million in taxes last year, most of it in sales taxes, according to the Washington State Department of Revenue.
 The traffic streaming to and from Quil Ceda is undoubtedly part of the reason that the city of Marysville, which is across the Interstate from the reservation, has opened 800,000 square feet of retail space in the last 12 months, said Caldie Rogers, executive director of the Marysville-Tulalip Chamber of Commerce, which says that it is the only chamber in the country that is in a partnership with a sovereign nation. 
 There is no income tax in the state, and sales tax is a primary revenue source for cities, Ms. Rogers said.
 In 1992, the Tulalips built their first casino, which is on the reservation but not part of Quil Ceda Village. ''The casino created the revenue stream that allowed us to meet important needs of membership and earmark funds for development,'' said Glen Gobin, a member of the board for the tribes. A second casino, at Quil Ceda Village, followed.
 Mr. McCoy declined to specify the casinos' revenue but said the tribes had invested more than $70 million in gambling profits on roads, water, sewerage and other services at Quil Ceda. 
 For many years, the interest rates charged to Indian tribes by lending institutions were very high, said Jonathan B. Taylor, president of the Taylor Policy Group and an affiliate of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development. Gambling has provided tribes with an internal financing source and a predictable cash flow, he said. 
 Construction of the Tulalip Hotel is being financed by a $200 million syndicated loan led by Wells Fargo. The loan also covers a tribal administration building, which will be completed next year.
 Plans to add a second hotel tower are under way, and a recreational vehicle park and office building are part of the vision, Mr. McCoy said. 
 So far, the tribes have granted ground leases to most of the developers at Quil Ceda to build the stores, but a goal is to build and manage more noncasino properties itself in the future, said Mel Sheldon, chairman of the tribes' board. ''When we start building to spec, we will get more money,'' he said.
 The Tulalips have also called for bids to construct a bio-gas plant, estimated at about $2 million. This plant would convert methane gas from cow manure into electricity, some of which the tribes would sell to a larger utility. Production is expected to begin in 2009.
 Other tribes, like the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians near Phoenix, are also developing large business parks, but such development is not a widespread phenomenon, Mr. Taylor said. ''You have to have interstate traffic and metropolitan proximity to be as successful as Quil Ceda,'' he said. 
 Michele Rothstein, a spokeswoman for the Chelsea Property Group, which manages the outlet mall, said the center attracts busloads of shoppers from Vancouver and Seattle.
 ''This area is booming,'' said Jon Rickert, owner of Bob's Burger and Brew, which opened in Quil Ceda Village last year. ''With the hotel going in, business is only going to get better.''
 There are some regrets, like the prominence of big-box stores. ''Hindsight being what it is, we probably wouldn't have made the decision to put a Home Depot and Wal-Mart at the front end of the resort,'' said Brett Magnan, vice president of Tulalip Hotel Operations. The tribes are planning to add several high-end restaurants and other ''destination pieces'' to support the hotel, he said. 
 Diversification is intended to improve the social and economic well-being of people on the reservation, Mr. McCoy said, adding that Quil Ceda had helped to reduce the unemployment rate on the reservation from 65 percent in 1995 to about 10 percent today. Countywide, the rate is 4.5 percent. Mr. Sheldon said, ''We still have a lot of catching up to do.''

HEADLINE: Send the State Department to War

BYLINE: By MAX BOOT. 
Max Boot is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ''War Made New: Weapons, Warriors and the Making of the Modern World.''

DATELINE: Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
 THE State Department has announced that it will force 50 foreign service officers to go to Iraq, whether they want to or not. This is the biggest use of ''directed assignments'' since the Vietnam War, and it represents a long-overdue response to complaints that diplomats aren't pulling their weight in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 However welcome, this is only a baby step toward a larger objective: to reorient the department and the government as a whole for the global war on Islamic terrorism. Yes, this is a war, but it's a very different war from conventional conflicts like World War II or the Civil War. It is, in essence, a global counterinsurgency, and few counterinsurgencies have ever been won by force alone. 
 While maintaining military power remains important, even more crucial goals are aiding moderate Muslims, countering enemy propaganda, promoting economic growth, flexing our political and diplomatic muscles to achieve vital objectives peacefully, gathering intelligence, promoting international cooperation, and building the rule of law in ungoverned lands. 
 The government developed expertise in many of these areas during the cold war, but those skills were lost as budgets were slashed and jobs eliminated during the ''peace dividend'' decade of the 1990s. Because civilian capacity has been so anemic, an undue burden has fallen on the military -- something that soldiers understandably resent.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recognizes the problem and has tried to reorient the State Department. She has, among other steps, moved diplomats out of Western Europe and into the developing world, set up a ''war room'' where Arabic-speaking diplomats can address the Middle Eastern press, and fostered a clumsily named Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization to plan for nation-building assignments.
 Such efforts, however, are unlikely to succeed because they run counter to centuries of State Department tradition that emphasizes liaison work with established governments rather than creating governments from scratch or communicating with foreign citizens over the heads of their leaders. 
 Modern management theory holds that small, tightly focused organizations are likely to be more effective than large conglomerates that try to do a million different things. If we apply that insight to the State Department, it would make sense to undo some ruinous consolidations that occurred after the cold war, when the United States Agency for International Development was placed within the State Department's sphere of influence and the United States Information Agency was folded into the department outright. No wonder our capacities in nation-building and strategic communications have withered -- their practitioners are second-class citizens behind traditional foreign service officers. 
 The information and development agencies should be made independent again, and their resources expanded. The Agency for International Development, in particular, has seen a precipitous decline in personnel. In the 1960s, it had 1,900 officers in South Vietnam alone. Today it has only 1,200 to cover the entire world, forcing it to rely mainly on contractors. If we expand its ranks, it could become our lead nation-building agency, sort of a global FEMA, marshaling the kind of resources that have been lacking in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 To buttress the growing corps of government reconstruction experts, we should have civilian reservists on call who could be summoned by the Agency for International Development in an emergency like military reservists. They could bring expertise in municipal administration, sewage treatment, banking, electricity generation, and countless other disciplines needed to rebuild a war-torn country. President Bush endorsed this notion in his last State of the Union address, but too little has been done to turn it into reality. 
 One of the most important shortages we have faced in Iraq and Afghanistan is in experienced police officers who can train local counterparts. Much of the job has fallen on the military police, whose troops are too few in number, and on civilian contractors, who are of uneven quality. We need to fill the vacuum by creating a federal constabulary force -- a uniformed counterpart to the F.B.I. that, like the Italian carabinieri, could be deployed abroad. 
 Its efforts could be supplemented by municipal policemen if we pass a law allowing the federal government to call up local police officers without loss of pay or seniority and to compensate hometown police departments for their absence. Along with these police officers, we need a deployable corps of lawyers, judges and prison guards who could set up functioning legal and penal systems abroad.
 Even with increased participation from civilian branches of government, the armed forces will still have a major role to play in what President Bush calls the ''Long War.'' But not necessarily a kinetic role. If we can train and advise foreign militaries, they can fight our battles for us. This model was demonstrated as long ago as the 1950s when Edward Lansdale and other advisers helped the Philippines put down a Marxist uprising, and has been repeated more recently in Somalia and the Phillipines. 
 Yet, important as it is, the United States military has not put enough emphasis on training and promoting experts in foreign military assistance. Such duty has traditionally been seen as a hindrance to promotion, which has made it tough to attract the best officers.
 Lt. Col. John Nagl, a counterinsurgency expert, has suggested setting up an ''adviser corps'' of 20,000 soldiers. His idea would make advisory service not a career detour but a career in itself, equal, at least in theory, to infantry, armor and other traditional specialties. Some advisers, in turn, could be deployed as part of the ''country team'' at American embassies -- something that happened routinely in the 1950s and '60s but has since fallen into disuse.
 Along with pushing advisory expertise, the armed forces also need to promote linguistic and cultural knowledge. Such skills are to be found primarily in Foreign Area Officers, but that is another career field whose practitioners are traditionally expected to commit career suicide. The military needs to increase the ranks of Foreign Area Officers and to provide more rewards for their much-needed service. We will have a hard time prevailing in today's war as long as fewer than one-half of 1 percent of all service members have any grasp of Arabic.
 Even while expanding governmental capacity, we also need to improve coordination among various branches of government, and between the government and nongovernmental and international organizations. That type of unified action has been in short supply in Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to nonstop complaints about how broken the ''interagency'' process has become. 
 James R. Locher, a former Congressional aide who helped draft the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act that brought greater coordination among the different branches of the military, is now leading a nonpartisan consortium of Washington policy and research groups that is trying to devise legislation to enhance the ''unity of effort'' among different branches of the government. Ideas under consideration include forcing civilian bureaucrats to serve a ''joint tour'' in a different agency and creating regional diplomatic coordinators who would marshal civilian agencies in the same way that the Pentagon's Central Command and Pacific Command coordinate military units abroad. A partial prototype of this concept may be tested with the Defense Department's new Africa Command, which is going to have a larger civilian component than the other combat commands.
 Mr. Locher's goal is to write a bill that would update the legendary National Security Act of 1947, which created the bureaucratic instruments (the C.I.A., Defense Department, National Security Council and the like) used to win the cold war. He hopes to have legislation ready in time for a new president in 2009. That's an ambitious objective, but it's one worth striving for if we're going to adjust to the post-9/11 era of American foreign policy.
 Some will no doubt object that to build up these capacities will encourage reckless ''imperialism'' or ''militarism.'' But improving our abilities in nation-building, strategic communications, security advising and related disciplines will actually lessen the chances that we will need to mount a major military intervention such as the one in Iraq. Our goal should be not just to deal with the aftermath of wars (Phase IV, in military parlance) but to solve problems before they grow into full-blown wars. In other words, to win Phase Zero.

HEADLINE: Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda

BYLINE: THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Two dates 

 BODY:
two numbers. Read them and weep for what could have, and should have, been. On Sept. 11, 2001, the OPEC basket oil price was $25.50 a barrel. On Nov. 13, 2007, the OPEC basket price was around $90 a barrel.
 In the wake of 9/11, some of us pleaded for a ''patriot tax'' on gasoline of $1 or more a gallon to diminish the transfers of wealth we were making to the very countries who were indirectly financing the ideologies of intolerance that were killing Americans and in order to spur innovation in energy efficiency by U.S. manufacturers. 
 But no, George Bush and Dick Cheney had a better idea. And the Democrats went along for the ride. They were all going to let the market work and not let our government shape that market -- like OPEC does.
 You'd think that one person, just one, running for Congress or the Senate would take a flier and say: ''Oh, what the heck. I'm going to lose anyway. Why not tell the truth? I'll support a gasoline tax.''
 Not one. Everyone just runs away from the ''T-word'' and watches our wealth run away to Russia, Venezuela and Iran.
 I can't believe that someone could not win the following debate:
 REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE: ''My Democratic opponent, true to form, wants to raise your taxes. Yes, now he wants to raise your taxes at the gasoline pump by $1 a gallon. Another tax-and-spend liberal who wants to get into your pocket.''
 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE: ''Yes, my opponent is right. I do favor a gasoline tax phased in over 12 months. But let's get one thing straight: My opponent and I are both for a tax. I just prefer that my taxes go to the U.S. Treasury, and he's ready to see his go to the Russian, Venezuelan, Saudi and Iranian treasuries. His tax finances people who hate us. Mine would offset some of our payroll taxes, pay down our deficit, strengthen our dollar, stimulate energy efficiency and shore up Social Security. It's called win-win-win-win-win for America. My opponent's strategy is sit back, let the market work and watch America lose-lose-lose-lose-lose.'' If you can't win that debate, you don't belong in politics.
 ''Think about it,'' says Phil Verleger, an energy economist. ''We could have replaced the current payroll tax with a gasoline tax. Middle-class consumers would have seen increased take-home pay of between six and nine percent, even though they would have had to pay more at the pump. A stronger foundation for future economic growth would have been laid by keeping more oil revenue home, and we might not now be facing a recession.'' 
 As a higher gas tax discouraged oil consumption, the Harvard University economist and former Bush adviser N. Gregory Mankiw has argued: ''the price of oil would fall in world markets. As a result, the price of gas to [U.S.] consumers would rise by less than the increase in the tax. Some of the tax would in effect be paid by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.''
 But U.S. consumers would have known that, with a higher gasoline tax locked in for good, pump prices would never be going back to the old days, adds Mr. Verleger, so they would have a much stronger incentive to switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles and Detroit would have had to make more hybrids to survive. This would have put Detroit five years ahead of where it is now. ''It's called the America wins program,'' said Mr. Verleger, ''instead of the petro-states win program.''
 We simply cannot go on being as dumb as we wanna be. If you hate the war in Iraq, then you want a gasoline tax so you can argue that we can pull out of there without remaining dependent on an even more unstable region. If you want to see us negotiate with Iran, not bomb it, you want a gasoline tax that will give us some real leverage by helping to reduce the income of the ayatollahs. 
 If you're a conservative and you believed that the Iraq war was necessary to drive reform in the Middle East, but the war has failed to do that and we need ''Plan B'' for the same objective, you want a gasoline tax that will reduce the flow of wealth to petrolist leaders who will never change if all they have to do is drill well holes rather than educate and empower their people.
 If you want to see America thrive by becoming the most energy productive economy in the world -- a title that now belongs to Japan, which doesn't have a drop of oil in its soil -- you want a gasoline tax, which will only spur U.S. innovation in energy efficiency.
 President Bush squandered a historic opportunity to put America on a radically different energy course after 9/11. But considering how few Democrats or Republicans are ready to tell the people the truth on this issue, maybe we have the president we deserve. I refuse to believe that, but I'm starting to doubt myself.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Officer Admits Guilt In Seeking Hezbollah Files

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
A Lebanese-born C.I.A. officer who had previously worked as an F.B.I. agent pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges that she illegally sought classified information from government computers about the radical Islamic group Hezbollah. 
 The plea agreement by the defendant, Nada Nadim Prouty, appeared to expose grave flaws in the methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct background checks on its investigators.
 Ms. Prouty, 37, who also confessed that she had fraudulently obtained American citizenship, faces up to 16 years in prison. 
 Court papers do not specifically say why Ms. Prouty sought information about Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group that is based in southern Lebanon, from the F.B.I.'s computer case files in June 2003, the month she left the bureau to join the C.I.A. 
 There is no accusation in the documents that she passed information on to Hezbollah or any other extremist group. 
 The plea agreement noted, however, that Ms. Prouty's sister and her brother-in-law attended a fund-raising event in Lebanon in August 2002 at which the keynote speaker was Sheikh Muhammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. Sheikh Fadlallah has been designated by the United States government as a terrorist leader. 
 The plea agreement said that in 2003 Ms. Prouty specifically went searching for computerized case files maintained by the F.B.I.'s Detroit field office in an investigation that centered on Hezbollah although she ''was not assigned to work on Hezbollah cases as part of her F.B.I. duties and she was not authorized by her supervisor, the case agent assigned to the case, or anybody else to access information about the investigation in question.''
 The C.I.A. would not describe Ms. Prouty's duties at the agency, apart from describing her as a ''midlevel'' employee, nor would it say if she traveled abroad as part of her duties or had been considered undercover. 
 Government officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the investigation with reporters, said Ms. Prouty was an ''operations'' officer at the C.I.A., meaning she was involved in some way in basic espionage work, not as an analyst or translator. 
 As part of the plea agreement, she agreed to resign from the C.I.A. and give up any claim to American citizenship.
 ''It is fitting that she now stands to lose both her citizenship and her liberty,'' Kenneth L. Wainstein, assistant attorney general, said in announcing the guilty plea, which was entered in Federal District Court in Detroit.
 Mr. Wainstein, who runs the Justice Department's national security division, said Ms. Prouty ''engaged in a pattern of deceit to secure U.S. citizenship, to gain employment in the intelligence community and to obtain and exploit her access to sensitive counterterrorism intelligence.''
 She pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal conspiracy, which has a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine; unauthorized computer access, which has a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine, and naturalization fraud, which has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
 In her plea agreement, Ms. Prouty, who lived mostly recently in Vienna, Va., close to the C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va, acknowledged that her crimes began shortly after she entered the United States from Lebanon in June 1989 on a one-year student visa. 
 She acknowledged that after overstaying her visa, she had illegally offered money to an unemployed American man to marry her in 1990, which allowed her to remain in the United States as his wife, although the couple never lived together.
 She then submitted a series of false and forged documents to obtain American citizenship, which she was granted in 1994. She obtained a divorce the next year and worked in a series of jobs, including as a waitress and hostess in a chain of Middle Eastern restaurants in the Detroit area owned by her brother-in-law.
 In 1997, she was hired as a special agent of the F.B.I., which has been under pressure for years to hire more agents and other employees who speak Arabic for terrorism investigations. She was assigned to the bureau's Washington field office, given a security clearance and placed in ''an extraterritorial squad investigating crimes against U.S. persons overseas,'' the Justice Department said in a statement to reporters. 
 Ms. Prouty acknowledged two sets of illegal computer searches at the F.B.I. The first, in September 2002, involved case files that contained her name, her sister's name or her brother-in-law's name. The second, in June 2003, involved files from a national-security investigation of Hezbollah that was being conducted in Detroit, which has one of the nation's largest Arabic-speaking communities.
 The court papers say Ms. Prouty's crimes first became known to the F.B.I. in December 2005 and have been under investigation for nearly two years. The documents suggest that she came under scrutiny as part of an investigation of her brother-in-law, Talal Khalil Chahine, in a scheme to funnel millions of dollars from his restaurant to people in Lebanon. Mr. Chahine is a fugitive from tax evasion charges filed in Michigan.

HEADLINE: China's Consumer Prices Climb Despite Controls

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Consumer prices unexpectedly surged again last month in China despite price controls on a wide range of industries, and this month holds the prospect of even higher inflation.
 For years, flat or falling prices for Chinese goods helped restrain inflation in the United States. But now rising costs for American imports from China are complicating the task of the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been cutting interest rates to help weak housing and credit markets in the United States, but has been wary that low rates might permit inflation to creep back into the economy.
 Prices were 6.5 percent higher in October than a year earlier, accelerating from 6.2 percent in September, China's statistical agency announced on Tuesday. The October inflation rate matched an increase of 6.5 percent in August, China's highest inflation rate in nearly 11 years. 
 Rising prices are an especially dangerous problem for China, where public acceptance of one-party rule depends to a considerable extent on ever-rising prosperity. With food prices increasing the fastest -- they were up 17.6 percent in October from a year earlier -- many poor and working-class families are struggling to make ends meet.
 Just this past Saturday in Chongqing, people began lining up before dawn when a Carrefour store offered a discount on large jugs of cooking oil, an essential for a lot of Chinese cooking. When the doors opened, a stampede ensued, killing 3 people and injuring 31. China's commerce ministry responded on Monday by ordering a ban on limited-time sales promotions.
 China's leaders are clearly concerned. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited the needy in a district of Beijing on Monday and promised to stabilize prices, according to the official news agency Xinhua.
 ''Prices have been on the rise these days, and I'm aware that even a one-yuan increase in prices will affect people's lives,'' said Mr. Wen, referring to a sum of Chinese currency equal to about 13 cents.
 Inflation accelerated in October even though the government issued a ban on Sept. 19 on all price increases for a long list of regulated industries, from airlines to electric utilities to energy companies. The main culprit in October was rising food prices, while nonfood prices climbed just 1.1 percent.
 But prices will probably go considerably higher in November. The price controls prevented refiners from passing on high world crude oil prices in October, so many refiners cut back their output of gasoline and diesel, resulting in long lines at service stations. The government quickly gave in, announcing an increase of nearly 10 percent in the regulated price of gasoline and diesel that took effect on Nov. 1.
 Truckers at a rest stop here in Guangzhou in southeastern China said that the price increase had not been enough to erase the shortages and that they were still being forced to wait hours to buy as little as five gallons of diesel.
 Not only energy prices may be higher in November. Mr. Wen also urged employers on Monday to be more generous in giving raises to employees and to be especially careful to follow minimum wage laws. If his appeals are heeded, that could push up manufacturing wages and prices.
 At a market early this afternoon in Shenzhen in southeastern China, clerks and customers complained about rising prices for everything from pork to Chinese cabbage -- although egg prices had fallen slightly in the last month. But prices remain low in dollar terms, with some vegetables selling for as little as 12 cents a pound.
 That low price in dollar terms is a result of a very low exchange rate for China's currency, known as the yuan or the renminbi. China's central bank has been buying foreign currency, mainly dollars, at a pace of $1 billion a day so as to slow the rise of its currency. 
 American companies buying from China face a double blow: not only are prices rising in terms of China's currency but China has also quietly begun allowing the yuan to rise at a faster pace against the dollar. The annualized pace of appreciation of the yuan has climbed to 6 percent in the last week.
 This will make it a little cheaper in yuan terms for Chinese companies to import raw materials, which tend to be priced in dollars. But it is still slower than many members of Congress have sought.
 China's competitiveness has not diminished yet, either. On Monday, China posted another record monthly trade surplus: $27 billion in October.
 China now exports more to the European Union than to the United States, and exports to Europe have been growing strongly. The yuan has actually been losing value against the euro because China has set the appreciation rate of the yuan in terms of the dollar, which has been falling steeply.
 Many manufacturers, as well as retailers of manufactured goods, have not yet raised prices, hoping to hold on to market share even as China's production capacity keeps growing.
 Pan Xishen, a business development manager at Tayohya, a home decoration chain with 370 franchised stores across China, said the company had resisted raising prices even though raw material costs had climbed 5 to 8 percent in the last year.
 ''It's reducing the margin'' of profits, he said on Tuesday at the Global Sources Franchising China trade show here. ''We're controlling the price to the consumer.''

HEADLINE: Manhattan: Suing To Get Police Data

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The New York Civil Liberties Union filed suit yesterday to have the police make public a database of information that officers have recorded on more than 800,000 stops of civilians since the beginning of 2006. The lawsuit, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, comes after requests for the database by both the civil rights group and the City Council were denied. Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the group expected the data to confirm its contention that stop-and-frisk operations have been improperly used and that they employ racial profiling. The police have turned over the database to the Rand Corporation, a private nonprofit research group, to determine if there are flaws in police procedures. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, at a news conference yesterday, said that the results of the Rand analysis were expected soon, but that he did not believe the data contained evidence of racial profiling.

HEADLINE: Taking A Whack At Making A Car

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 IAN A. BRUCE presses an Italian-made alligator-skin boot onto the accelerator of his three-wheel thrill machine and careens around a corner. The agile metal box tilts precariously to one side, leaving Mr. Bruce nearly horizontal to the ground.
 ''The experience is like driving a jet fighter,'' he shouts over the engine. ''It's truly a new kind of vehicle.''
 The machine, which has one wheel in front and two in back, is a hybrid of a motorcycle and a car, and it underscores a trend: vehicles of the future are as unorthodox as the entrepreneurs who are trying to create them. 
 A generation of digital-era Henry Fords, unabashed and brimming with confidence, has emerged. Born of Silicon Valley and the dot-com culture, they are trying to apply to carmaking the same entrepreneurial spirit that built the information superhighway. 
 Most of the inventors are not carmakers by background or training. But they are cocksure, backed by millions of dollars in venture capital and cloaked in the righteousness of environmentalism. To their critics, they are flying at high speed around a blind curve, destined to become reality-check crash-test dummies.
 Cars on the market or in development include the $100,000 all-electric Tesla Roadster, the $190,000 Wrightspeed production super car, an electric pickup truck called the Phoenix, the low-cost diminutive Th!nk car and the Bangalore-made Reva.
 Then there is Mr. Bruce's Venture Vehicle, which is meant to cut costs and fuel consumption with its smaller weight and size. The car relies on technology licensed from a Dutch company that allows the vehicle to turn sharply without toppling over, giving it airplanelike physics that help keep the contents of the vehicle, human and otherwise, safe.
 The company was started by Mr. Bruce, 50, a former graphics designer who once made brochures for major carmakers, and Howard Levine, a Los Angeles lawyer turned dot-com entrepreneur. The financial backers include NGEN Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has put $6 million into the company, even though NGEN has no background in the auto industry. 
 ''I know nothing about cars,'' said Robert Koch, a partner there. But, he said, he has experience in battery technology, which he thinks is an essential component of future vehicles.
 ''Once you have the battery and the propulsion system, building a car is not that complicated,'' Mr. Koch said.
 Over the last century, there has been no shortage of ideas, business plans, sketches and prototypes of new cars. And hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost in developing them.
 But the latest generation of entrepreneurs argues that conditions are particularly rife for overthrowing -- or at least expanding -- the caropoly controlled by Detroit and Japanese auto giants. The newcomers say that the giants are no longer innovative. Consumers, meanwhile, are ravenous for hybrid or electric alternatives, and advances in technology and manufacturing are eliminating the capital-intensive obstacles that have prevented smaller companies from getting into the game.
 Still, skeptics shout louder than a jet engine. 
 David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry-financed research group in Ann Arbor, Mich., said there was little chance that a start-up could succeed in creating a car for the mass market. The entrepreneurs' optimism, he said, reflects ignorance of manufacturing costs, regulatory hurdles and intricate technical challenges involving heating, ventilation and safety. 
 He said the entrepreneurs had trivialized the large sums of money and labor that traditional carmakers have invested in alternatives, nearly all of which have failed. And he said the upstarts' expertise did not qualify them to build cars.
 Drawing an analogy, Mr. Cole said: ''I know about cars. Does that mean I can do a better job than the medical industry at creating an artificial heart?''
 ''Even a sophisticated high-tech person has no clue,'' about the challenges in breaking into the auto business, he added. ''They think the whole world is like doing a microchip, and it's not.''
 Even some of the new entrepreneurs question their ability to produce innovative cars. Ian Wright, 51, the mind behind the Wrightspeed supercar, which he expects to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2.5 seconds -- said he thought that many of the start-ups were misreading consumers by trying to build small, low-cost, high-mileage urbancentric vehicles.
 What Americans want, he said, are size and power. 
 The start-ups are ''almost universally trying to replace economy cars, and that's a complete waste of time,'' he said, arguing that less than 1 percent of the fuel burned in the United States is done by cars that get at least 35 miles a gallon. He added, ''If you're really trying to compete with Toyota at making cheap cars, the problem is, they're the best at creating cheap cars.''
 By contrast, Mr. Wright, who spent most of his career as an electrical engineer designing Internet technology, ultimately envisions building technology to create cars that are both high mileage (50 miles a gallon) and powerful (1,000 horsepower). His Wrightspeed supercar, which he said was two years from production, will prove the capacity of the technology he is developing.
 The smaller upstarts have actually made inroads. The all-electric Reva, based in India, has sold around 2,200 cars since 2001, 1,000 of which are on the streets of London, said Annie Hazlehurst, a venture capitalist with Draper Fisher Jurvetson, which in 2006 led a $20 million round of financing for the company. 
 The Reva, which costs $9,000, has a range up to 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) per battery charge. 
 At the other end of the spectrum, Draper Fisher invested in 2005 in Tesla Motors, which makes an all-electric sports car that it hopes to sell for around $100,000. 
 Like its backers, Tesla's management team was forged in Silicon Valley; the chief executive, Michael Marks, was previously the top executive at Flextronics, an electronics manufacturing services company. Tesla's co-founder and president of technology, Martin Eberhard, had helped start NuvoMedia, an e-books company.
 Tesla has had its struggles. It originally said it would have cars for sale by mid-2007. But it recently said that it was delaying production -- reportedly because of problems with the battery technology -- until the first quarter of 2008, when it will sell its first 50 cars. The company said it would have 600 more cars ready by the end of next year.
 Another electric car already on the market is the boxy $39,000 Th!nk City, made by a Norwegian company called Th!nk Global, with backing from RockPort Capital Partners. William James, a managing general partner at RockPort, based in Boston, said that the new generation of Th!nks were expected to be available in Europe in the first half of 2008, and in limited quantities in the United States in the second half of next year. 
 Part of expanding the car's appeal, Mr. James said, could involve a novel business model that would charge $20,000 a car, but then lease the battery for about $200 a month ''It's cheaper than buying gas,'' he said. ''The business model is pretty compelling.''
 Mr. James said that the economics of carmaking are becoming more favorable for start-ups. For example, it is possible to create assembly plants for $5 million, compared with $500 million for traditional plants, he said, because the new plants are working with premade parts and putting them together. Furthering the lure, he said, is that many cities and countries are taking steps toencourage the use of hybrid-electric vehicles, including subsidizing their purchase or penalizing the use of gasoline-powered cars.
 Which brings us back to the Venture Vehicle. (The company's founders, Mr. Bruce and Mr. Levine, say they are working on a catchier name.) Driving the vehicle is intense, fun and, depending on your capacity for speed and being periodically horizontal, exhilarating.
 The prototype is somewhat crude, however, but the founders envision combining the maneuverability of a motorcycle with the safety of a car. (They said that the Venture Vehicle would not fall under current federal guidelines regulating cars, including mandates for expensive safety tests, but they planned to conduct the tests anyway.)
 They foresee two versions, a gas-electric hybrid for $20,000, getting 100 miles a gallon, and an all-electric for $25,000 that will have a range of 120 miles. 
 Their target is automotive enthusiasts, early adopters, environmentally conscious consumers, as well as commuters, 90 percent of whom they say travel as single passengers. 
 They plan to put the vehicles on the market by the second quarter of 2009. 
 ''There's nothing wrong with four wheels, but three has its advantages,'' said Mr. Levine, 47, the chief executive of Venture Vehicles. ''Specifically, three wheels are lighter and more agile. One of the greatest impediments to fuel efficiency is weight.''
 Mr. Bruce originated the idea for the vehicle in 2005, when he was searching online for alternative-vehicle technologies and came across the phrase ''tilt control technology.''
 ''Then, 'bang,''' he said, recognizing that he had stumbled onto something he thought was cool. 
 He and Mr. Levine traveled to Dordrecht, south of Rotterdam, where they signed a licensing agreement with Carver Engineering for a down payment of less than six figures, future payments, equity in the company and, eventually, royalty fees. In return, they obtained the North American and South American rights to sell the hybrid, electric and biofuel versions of a tilt-based car.
 They have since signed contracts with some of the biggest names in the auto business, including California Motors, which specializes in propulsion systems; Swift Engineering, which builds suspensions and drivetrains; and the American subsidiary of a major European automaker (whom they have declined to name publicly) to design the car.
 Among their eight employees are a former sales and marketing vice president at Chrysler and Mazda, and a former manager at a General Motors plant. But they concede that they themselves are not exactly seasoned car people. 
 ''We're not two gearheads,'' Mr. Levine said. ''We're not two mechanics in a garage with a dream. We're two entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity and came up with a business model.''

HEADLINE: Job Insecurities

 BODY:
Whether they blame the housing bust or the credit squeeze or globalization, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their jobs. When House members go home for their extended Thanksgiving break they can at least assure anxious constituents that they're trying to make joblessness less devastating. Senators may have to think about vacationing elsewhere. 
 Last month, 38 House Republicans joined 226 Democrats to pass a bill that would expand unemployment compensation to many workers who currently don't qualify and would provide special help to workers who lose their jobs to trade competition. In the Senate, bills on the same issues have yet to be voted out of the finance committee. 
 Like the House's reform of unemployment insurance, the Senate's measure would require states to update their jobless benefits if they want to receive a share of $7 billion in new federal funds. Among the changes, 31 states that still use a 30-year-old eligibility formula would need to change their criteria, a move that would extend benefits to 300,000 mostly low-wage workers who currently collect nothing when they lose their jobs. 
 The Senate Finance Committee is also sitting on legislation that would help workers displaced by foreign competition. Both the House and Senate versions -- expansions of the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance program for manufacturing workers -- would increase funding for retraining and help unemployed workers hang on to their health insurance during a period of joblessness. And both bills expand the program to include service-sector workers, a necessary development as offshoring increasingly affects both blue- and white-collar jobs. 
 Americans rightly expect their government to help when they face economic hardship beyond their control. Preparing for layoffs, whether brought on by a downturn or by the ongoing shift to a globalized economy, is the least that lawmakers can do. 
 If the Senate acts quickly to pass these measures, there would be enough time to meld the Senate and House bills into one for final passage before the Christmas break. That would mean everyone in Congress would have good news to bear when they go home for the holidays.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Drops Sharply as Global Agency Sees Demand Easing

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The price of crude oil dropped sharply on Tuesday after a prominent energy group lowered its estimate for worldwide oil demand, saying high prices were harming consumption.
 Oil fell $3.45, or 3.7 percent, to $91.17 a barrel in New York. Last week, oil futures reached a high of $98.62 a barrel. Oil prices, which have more than quadrupled over the last four years, are close to the inflation-adjusted record of $101.70 a barrel reached in April 1980. 
 With an editorial titled ''$100, a turning point?,'' the International Energy Agency suggested in its monthly report on Tuesday that high prices were changing energy use in the developing world and in developed countries. 
 Despite reducing its consumption forecast by half a million barrels a day, the agency still expects oil demand to grow by 1.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent next year. 
 Still, the lowered outlook pushed oil prices down. The oil markets were also responding to comments by Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, who signaled over the weekend that OPEC might consider increasing its production to stem the rise in prices. 
 But Mr. Naimi quickly ruled out an imminent policy decision by the oil cartel as Saudi Arabia plays host to the summit meeting of OPEC heads of states this weekend. The leaders are expected to discuss the security of global oil supplies. 
 The prospect of oil at $100 a barrel seems to have receded, for the moment. 
 The drop in prices was welcomed in Riyadh, where the issue threatened to overshadow the summit meeting. But the question of oil prices remains a particularly sensitive one, especially for Saudi Arabia, the top oil exporter. The kingdom holds a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves.
 During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Naimi carefully avoided drawing any conclusions linking the current high prices and a potential slowdown in consumption. He stressed several times that he believed that oil prices were set by free markets, not oil producers. Typically, he would not be drawn into talking about specific price levels.
 ''We are not really interested in prices that negatively impact economic growth or cause less prosperity,'' Mr. Naimi said. ''The price needs to be fair to many players. That's the difficult formula, to say what the price will be.''
 He added, ''The fundamentals have nothing to do with prices.''
 After his earlier comments helped deflate the market, Mr. Naimi said OPEC's oil ministers would not discuss production levels this week. But he left the door open to a new increase in OPEC's cumulative output when the group meets in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, on Dec. 5.
 After its last meeting, in September, OPEC decided to increase oil production by 500,000 barrels a day, a modest increase of 2 percent in the group's total output. The measure, which became effective Nov. 1, did not curb prices.
 The stunning rise in energy prices, spurred by an increasingly volatile and unpredictable market, has happened despite warnings about the health of the American economy. Last week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the United States was headed for slower growth because of oil prices, among other things. The message prompted a sell-off on Wall Street and stoked new fears of a possible recession.
 Asked whether he was concerned that a slowdown could reduce demand for oil in the United States, Mr. Naimi said: ''We do not wish any country to go into a recession, particularly the biggest consumer in the world. We hope it doesn't happen, and we're not planning on that happening.'' 
 Mr. Naimi said Saudi Arabia was pumping 9 million barrels a day and had increased its production capacity to 11.3 million barrels. He expects another 500,000 barrels of additional capacity within the next three months. Saudi Arabia, he said, is on track to raise its total production capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day by 2009.
 The OPEC summit meeting, which will include the leaders of Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria, will be held here on Saturday and Sunday. It will be preceded by a two-day conference on energy and environmental challenges for OPEC.
 Saudi Arabia and other oil producers have invested tens of billions of dollars to improve their ability to pump more oil on the assumption that demand will keep rising, especially in Asia.
 But at current prices, consumers are feeling the pinch and governments are becoming concerned about the weight of energy costs on economic growth, according to the energy agency. Over time, prices are changing the attitudes of consumers in developed countries.
 ''The cumulative $70 rise in price since 2002 is, we believe, having a cumulative effect,'' the report said. ''Ultimately, whether $100 oil proves a turning point in consumer and government thinking toward energy efficiency is more significant than its direct impact on oil demand growth.''

HEADLINE: Building a Nation of Polyglots, Starting With the Very Young

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TARRYTOWN, N.Y.
 Seven-year-old Cooper Van Der Meer is learning Spanish as a second language.
 That's right. This American native is lucky enough to be in a school system that considers the acquisition of languages so important in today's polyglot, globally entwined America that students start learning a foreign language in kindergarten.
 When Cooper is asked to match ''el ojo'' with the figure of a colorful ''monstruo,'' he moves the words on an electronic blackboard right up to the monster's eye, winning a smile from his teacher, Vanessa Franco. His second-grade classmate, Carissa Perez, may be able to slip the words ''la nariz'' up to the monster's nose more confidently since her Dominican roots give her an edge. But for Cooper, recognizing body parts, days of the week, numbers, animals and greetings in Spanish is a big deal.
 ''Sometimes I don't need to speak Spanish, but I probably will need to,'' he said, sounding like a future master of the universe. ''I want to own a pet shop because I like dogs. If there's a Spanish person in the store, I'll probably translate that guy.'' 
 Cooper's wisdom is percolating across the nation. The United States, often fiercely chauvinistic and sometimes outright isolationist, has never considered the ability to speak a foreign language an essential talent. Unlike many Europeans and Asians who learn languages in primary school, most Americans do not get the chance until high school or in the grades just before -- at too advanced an age to soak in quirky words and syntax with the nimbleness needed for fluency. That is why traveling Americans resign themselves to speaking menu French or Spanish. 
 But with an economy that recognizes few geographical borders, and with people from all over the planet becoming our next-door neighbors, more Americans are demanding language instruction earlier in school. 
 Martha Abbott, director of education at the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, said that while there is no reliable data on the trend, her organization keeps learning of more school systems that think paying for elementary school language teachers is money well invested.
 Since September 2006, all students in grades one through five in Loudon County, Va., have been given 30 to 60 minutes of Spanish instruction each week. Last year, officials in Fairfax County, Va. -- which, with 165,439 students, is the nation's 13th-largest school system -- decided to expand the study of foreign languages to all 137 elementary schools over a seven-year period. Twenty-five Fairfax schools provide 30-minute lessons twice a week in Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Chinese or French starting in the first grade. Ten schools have ambitious ''immersion'' programs where math, science and health are taught in a foreign language. 
 Paula Patrick, the Fairfax system's foreign language coordinator, said Americans have for too long had a ''mind-set that everyone else in the world could learn English.'' Her district is receiving appeals from businesses that need global-ready travelers and from a health care industry that needs translators.
 The growth in language instruction is also taking place in college. A survey by the Modern Language Association released yesterday found a 13 percent increase in language-course enrollments between 2002 and 2006, with a 127 percent increase in the number of students taking Arabic.
 Foreign language instruction does not come cheap. Fairfax estimates that hiring instructors for its expanded program will cost $16 million. The mystery is why more affluent districts that are willing to pay for gifted football coaches aren't starting language instruction earlier, particularly in areas with significant immigrant populations. The logic for doing so seems obvious. As every immigrant knows, it's far easier to learn a language as a 6-year-old than as a 16-year-old. 
 ''They're like sponges,'' said Mary Lynn Pearlman, a kindergarten teacher here, speaking of her young pupils. ''In middle school they would worry about how they sound and their accent. Here, they don't care.''
 But in this school district in Westchester County, where Latinos make up half the 2,600 students, learning Spanish is also a strategy for weaving together a community splintered along class, race and linguistic lines. 
 The district's two villages, Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, are both heavily blue collar, and when factories like the General Motors assembly plant closed, the houses left empty by departing auto workers were filled with Latino immigrants. Until four years ago, Hispanic students, most with roots in Ecuador or the Dominican Republic, were placed in bilingual classes where they would learn all subjects in Spanish or in mainstream classes, with extra English help. Young children from English-speaking homes, though, had no option to take Spanish, in, say, the way English is offered in Sweden.
 In 2003, with increased emphasis on standardized tests exposing how poorly bilingual students were doing in English, Tarrytown did away with most bilingual classes. Tarrytown also found that bilingual students had a tendency to stick together, said Michele Milliam, principal of the Tappan Hill School. 
 Under the new regimen, where almost everyone studies two languages, teachers are noticing that Hispanic and white children are more likely to play together and that parents from different cultures are more willing to approach one another. 
 ''It's not as easy to harbor stereotypes when it's their children your children are mixing with,'' said Dr. Howard Smith, the superintendent. 
 Tarrytown's program follows a two-tier approach. In classes where Spanish is taught as a foreign language, a specialist visits the second, third and fourth grades every fourth day for a 40-minute lesson. (Ms. Franco teaches 16 second- and third-grade classes over the four-day cycle.) In kindergarten and first grade, students are given 20-minute lessons daily by Spanish-speaking assistant teachers. 
 In one kindergarten class the other day, the students told the assistant teacher, Aura Feliciano, the colors they were wearing -- rojo, amarillo, azul or anaranjado (red, yellow, blue and orange). About 20 percent of the elementary students, volunteers all, receive more challenging immersion classes.
 In all Spanish classes, officials said, newcomers from Spanish-speaking homes, get their moments to shine.
 That includes John Tintin, a first grader and son of Ecuadorean immigrants who claims to have learned Spanish ''when I came out of my mom's stomach.''
 Tarrytown's program is far from ideal. One principal, Marilyn Mercado-Belvin of the John Paulding School, has let Mr. Smith know that students need Spanish twice a week, not just every fourth day. 
 But even with flaws, the program produces tangential benefits, like the kindness shown by Ryan Geary, a shy, blue-eyed 6-year-old. She likes to learn Spanish, she said, to be helpful ''because I have some Spanish friends, and they don't speak much English.''
 Ryan can't actually speak Spanish well. Not yet. But she is learning.

HEADLINE: Better Cars, Worse Sales

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley and Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
This year, General Motors has been getting some attention that it isn't accustomed to: warm reviews for its new cars. 
 ''At last, a decent midsize car from General Motors,'' Automobile Magazine said of a stylish new version of the Malibu. The new Cadillac CTS is ''an excellent luxury sport sedan,'' raved Edmunds.com, which praised the more powerful engines that G.M. has made available on the car. And in January, the Saturn Aura was named the North American Car of the Year by auto writers.
 This is all a sharp contrast to six years ago, when the legendary product expert Robert A. Lutz arrived at G.M. to take charge of vehicle development. Back then, the company was selling cars and trucks that he admits -- in his typical blunt-talking fashion -- he never would have parked in his vast personal garage. 
 Now, he says, G.M.'s new models can be compared to the best that the company's Japanese and German competitors have to offer. 
 The question is, Will enough consumers compare them -- and choose G.M.?
 Despite Mr. Lutz's efforts, G.M. still has a hard time getting on drivers' shopping lists. Its market share, close to 28 percent when Mr. Lutz arrived, has dropped to just under 24 percent, in part because G.M. has pulled back on unprofitable sales to rental car companies.
 But there are other factors holding G.M. back, too, that may be hard to overcome despite the improved lineup of cars. 
 Perhaps the biggest challenge is changing the way consumers think about its cars. The idea that G.M.'s cars have been a disaster, even if the trucks were passable, ''has been so ingrained, and so hard to change,'' Mr. Lutz said. 
 Even he acknowledges that this may take another generation of vehicles to change, meaning well into the next decade -- a long time for a company that has lost billions of dollars in recent years and whose competitors keep getting better, too.
 ''We have to be patient,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''It took us 25 years to work our way to where we were, and we can't expect that to change in a year or 18 months.'' Every well-received G.M. model helps to ''eradicate those past perceptions,'' he said. 
 Who's to blame for those perceptions? Fingers are pointed in all directions. 
 Mr. Lutz cites the skeptical automotive media, gathered en masse today for the start of press days for the Los Angeles Auto Show.
 G.M.'s dealers, for their part, have long complained that the company did not invest enough in advertising (though ads for the new Malibu seem to be everywhere, from World Series telecasts to episodes of ''The Next Great American Band''). 
 ''You have to get people into the showroom, and that's a very hard thing to do, especially with the economy,'' said Ed Schoenthaler, owner of Crossroads Chevrolet Buick in West Chicago, Ill.
 Mr. Schoenthaler and other G.M. dealers say they are pleased with G.M.'s current lineup. But the public, he said, ''has no idea how good these cars are.'' 
 Some consumers still feel burned by their past experiences with American automobiles. Faced with numerous choices of vehicles whose quality is more consistent, as measured by J. D. Power & Associates and Consumer Reports, fewer buyers want to take a risk, as G.M.'s declining market share indicates.
 Yvette Lazo, a special education teacher from Miami, said she had owned Chevrolets and Cadillacs but gave up on G.M. after a series of problems, including a dashboard that fell forward into the passenger compartment and a moon roof that came unglued. 
 Since then, the Lazos' last six cars have been Toyotas. ''We don't need to be going to the shop all the time. There were always these things that irked you,'' said Mrs. Lazo, 33, who gets a new model every two years.
 For the Malibu and the CTS, G.M. made a particular effort to improve the interiors, which have ''always been an area of extreme G.M. weakness,'' Mr. Lutz said. 
 G.M. even released photos of the Malibu's two-toned interior before it showed the exterior, which has a much more sporty and curved look than the previous version. 
 ''I think we can look everybody in the eye and say, 'Nobody in the planet makes a better midsize car than that,''' Mr. Lutz said.
 But each model faces formidable competitors.
 For the Malibu, it is the latest version of the Honda Accord, also fresh to the market. Ron Pinelli, the president of Autodata, an industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., prefers it to the Malibu. ''The new Accord is all there,'' he said. 
 The CTS must combat a resurgent Mercedes-Benz, as well as BMW, whose sales are up this year while Cadillac's have fallen. Mr. Pinelli says he is impressed by the CTS, calling it ''awesome.''
 Unlike the foreign brands, whose heritage has been honed over generations in Europe and the United States, G.M. must ''earn their way back into the hearts and minds of the American consumer,'' he said. ''You have to have great products, you have to have the advertising, and the deal has to be there.''
 This time, both Malibu and CTS are receiving the kind of relentless advertising push that Toyota regularly gives to its new cars and trucks. For instance, G.M. has kicked off a four-month $100 million advertising campaign for Malibu, hoping primarily to create awareness that an American company offers a car that can compete with Japanese models, said Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s vice president for sales and marketing.
 G.M. did not do that with a car Mr. Lutz hoped would be one of the company's stars, the Saturn Aura sedan. It has not said how much it devoted to the Aura, but Mr. LaNeve acknowledged to the trade publication Advertising Age that G.M. ''could have spent a few more dollars.'' 
 The model's sales have stumbled this year, though it was named car of the year by journalists at the North American International Auto Show in January.
 Other G.M. cars have suffered similar fates. Mr. Lutz was disappointed at the tepid reception among consumers for some G.M. models, like the Buick Lucerne, a large family car introduced in 2006. 
 It received good reviews -- and good exposure, ending up as a prize on the Martha Stewart edition of ''The Apprentice'' on NBC. But Lucerne sales are down 14.5 percent this year. Likewise, sales of one of Mr. Lutz's earlier favorites, the Pontiac Solstice sports car, have dropped 17.5 percent from 2006, despite a strong start.
 G.M.'s biggest problem is erratic quality, said Jake Fisher, a senior automotive engineer with Consumer Reports. Though Buick scored better than average in the magazine's recent quality survey, G.M.'s seven other brands were listed as subpar. Cadillac ranked third from last among the two dozen brands measured. 
 ''G.M.'s making really nice cars,'' he said, ''but they're losing in reliability.'' 
 Another issue, analysts say, is G.M.'s proliferation of brands. Mr. LaNeve says its eight brands are an advantage. But Mr. Pinelli said the choices simply make it harder for individual cars to get attention. 
 G.M.'s sales are overwhelmingly dominated by Chevrolet. It has about 14 percent of the car market, making it larger than all of Chrysler, and only slightly smaller than the market share held by Ford and Toyota in the United States. 
 Most of G.M.'s other brands capture two points or less of the American market.
 Even so, G.M. has been helped by good sales from its latest sport utilities, as well as the Buick Enclave, a crossover vehicle with S.U.V. features but carlike handling. Likewise, G.M.'s newest pickup trucks sold well when they reached the market, with the Chevrolet Silverado often outselling the Ford F-series on a monthly basis. The F-series will not be overhauled until next year. 
 But S.U.V.'s and pickups are fast losing popularity in the face of $3-a-gallon gasoline, while the car market, dominated by foreign manufacturers, is growing. 
 Mr. Lutz sees hope in the fact that the company seems to have stabilized at just under 24 percent, versus the 28 percent that executives vowed to attain when he first arrived, even donning lapel pins with the number.
 ''Twenty-four is the new 28,'' Mr. Lutz declared, given the company's decision to pull back on rental car sales and huge incentives, as well as the intense industry competition. 
 Long term, G.M. executives know the company needs to cloak itself in the same green mantle that Toyota enjoys, thanks primarily to the hybrid-electric Toyota Prius. 
 At Los Angeles, G.M. is showing hybrid versions of the Silverado and the Malibu. It is also promoting the Chevrolet Volt, a sedan it plans to begin building around 2010. 
 If all its new models succeed, and if G.M. can stabilize and perhaps increase its market share, Mr. Lutz said he would give himself a grade of A-minus.
 At Chrysler, Mr. Lutz helped transform the company's image during the 1990s through vehicles like the Dodge Viper and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Then, consumers were rooting for the feisty underdog to succeed. That sympathy isn't there this time, he said.
 ''It's been tougher than I thought it would be,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar May Reduce European Bonuses

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The drop of the American dollar against the British pound and the euro may claim some of the bonus money of European investment bankers as the latest victim.
 Some bankers are already bracing for reductions in their 2007 bonuses because of losses incurred in the mortgage-related credit market crisis, but many of those working for American banks may suffer further damage because the bonuses are paid in dollars. 
 The dollar has dropped about 5.5 percent against the pound this year. Though the drop may not be at the forefront of bankers' worries about generally lower bonuses, it adds to the blow, said Matthew Osborne, a partner at the recruitment firm Armstrong International here, which presents its annual bonus survey on Wednesday.
 Deutsche Bank analysts predict that the median bonus at investment banks this year is likely to drop at least 10 percent as financial services firms struggle with investment write-downs that could reach a total of $400 billion. Merrill Lynch and UBS reported losses in the third quarter as they wrote down mortgage-backed securities and Citigroup's profit fell 60 percent. In contrast, Goldman Sachs said in September that it set aside $16.9 billion to pay salaries, benefits and bonuses in the first nine months of its year, more than the record amount it paid for all 2006.
 According to the Center for Economic and Business Research, a consultancy here, the global value of bonus payouts could fall 16 percent, to $:7.4 billion ($15.3 billion) for this year. 
 Mr. Osborne said the exchange-rate issue might be a factor in helping European investment banks pay bonuses in pounds, euros or Swiss francs at an advantage and retain employees. The currency blow will be eased somewhat, he said, because most senior bankers usually receive less than half of their bonuses in cash.
 Some banks, he said, are already challenged in retaining top bankers. Managers at American banks will face ''the added issue of paying bonuses in the devaluing U.S. dollar,'' he said. ''You are inevitably going to see some long faces.'' 
 American investment banks including JPMorgan Chase pay bonuses to European bankers in dollars but offer an option at the start of the year to link the bonus to an average exchange rate. 
 Mr. Osborne said the investment banks were taking longer to allocate bonuses this year because difficult market conditions made it harder to set remuneration levels. Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns will be the first large investment banks to announce bonuses at the beginning of December.

HEADLINE: Bush, Confident on Economy, Vetoes Domestic Spending Bill

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ROBERT PEAR. 
Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington, and Robert Pear from New Albany, Ind.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Even in the darkest times, President Bush has been able to draw hope from the almost uncanny ability of the American economy to endure shock after shock with surprisingly limited damage.
 Mr. Bush expressed the same optimism on Tuesday, praising the economy as resilient and reminding people that it bounced back after the Sept. 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina.
 ''This economy is flexible, it is dynamic and it is competitive enough to overcome any challenge we face,'' Mr. Bush told business and civic leaders in New Albany, Ind. 
 As if to underline his confidence in the economy's self-sufficiency, Mr. Bush on Tuesday vetoed a bill for $150.7 billion, nearly $10 billion more than he wanted, for education, health care, job training and other domestic programs. Congressional Democrats are not expected to win enough Republican votes to overturn the veto.
 Some economists worry that the economy's stamina may have hit its limit. Mr. Bush faces a fearsome trifecta of shocks, each of which is daunting: soaring oil prices, a meltdown in housing and mortgage lending and plunging consumer confidence.
 ''We are getting increasingly worried that the resilience is coming to an end,'' said Nigel Gault, senior economist at Global Insight, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. ''We see a double shock in housing and in the credit crunch. The other shock, potentially, is oil.'' 
 Mr. Bush's problem is that the economy essentially depends on factors beyond his control. There is little that the government can do to bring down oil prices in the short term or to prop up consumer confidence.
 In contrast to 2001 when his party controlled Congress, Mr. Bush has little or no latitude to stimulate growth by proposing more tax cuts. He devotes much of his energy instead to prevent Democratic majorities in Congress from raising taxes on high-income households.
 ''I tell them that if you're interested in raising taxes, you can find any excuse to do so,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview Tuesday with the Fox Business Network. ''But I also tell them that raising taxes would be bad for the economy. We don't need to be taking money out of the pockets of investors and savers and consumers.'' 
 Oil prices have climbed 50 percent in the last 12 months, creating what amounts to a foreign tax that pinches consumer spending and reduces growth.
 Housing construction is in the midst of its biggest contraction since World War II. Housing downturns have preceded 8 of the 10 recessions in the last 60 years, but this is the first time declining construction is accompanied by a drop in housing prices and a panic in mortgage markets.
 American companies continue hiring, and consumers continue spending. Stock prices jumped on Tuesday, in part because Wal-Mart, the largest retailer, reported a bigger increase in earnings than investors had expected. 
 But consumer confidence has plunged to a two-year low, according to independent surveys, a bad omen for what has been the economy's most unshakable pillar.
 Many economists, including some forecasters at the Federal Reserve, predict that economic growth will slow to an annual pace of 1.5 percent or less in the final months of this year. 
 Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress last week that the economy would ''slow noticeably'' by the end of the year and remain ''sluggish'' for the first part of 2008. The housing market, Mr. Bernanke warned, has yet to hit bottom and is likely to dampen consumer spending.
 Even if Mr. Bush had more levers at his disposal, he and his top economic advisers harbor a strong suspicion about ''big government'' solutions to economic problems. Mr. Bush has increasingly defined the last lap of his presidency as a battle against bigger government and higher federal spending.
 Defending his veto, Mr. Bush said the ''bloated labor and health spending bill'' included more than 2,200 items designating money for lawmakers' pet projects. He said Congress should ''cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law.''
 Just before leaving the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Bush signed the Defense Department appropriations bill, which provides $459 billion for military programs in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 
 Congress continues to work on a separate bill that would provide a fresh infusion of money for the war in Iraq, while requiring Mr. Bush to start the withdrawal of American troops there. 
 The Defense Department measure includes a stopgap spending bill that finances the operations of most federal agencies at 2007 levels through Dec. 14. Democratic leaders said they hoped to finish work on the annual spending bills by then.
 Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, denounced Mr. Bush for rejecting the health and education bill, which embodies the values and priorities of the Democrats who control Congress.
 ''The same president who is asking us to spend another $200 billion on the misguided war in Iraq and is insisting on providing $60 billion in tax cuts next year to folks who make over a million bucks a year'' is ''now refusing to provide a $6 billion increase to crucial domestic investments in education, health care, medical research and worker protections,'' Mr. Obey said.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, ''Given his dismal record, President Bush is no position to lecture Congress about fiscal responsibility.''
 The theme of the president's day, set forth in the backdrop on stage in Indiana, was ''holding the line on taxes.''
 By threatening to veto any bill that raises taxes, Mr. Bush hopes to derail Democratic demands for additional domestic spending. 
 In his remarks in Indiana, Mr. Bush said: ''This year alone, the leadership in Congress has proposed to spend $22 billion more than my budget provides. Now some of them claim that's not really much of a difference, and the scary part is they seem to mean it. 
 ''Over five years, their proposed spending spree adds up to an extra $205 billion. Put another way, that's about $1,300 in higher spending every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every year for the next five years.''

MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES The head of the Federal Communications Commission, Kevin J. Martin, announced details of his plan to relax the longstanding rule that had prevented a company from owning both a newspaper and a radio or television station in the same city. The proposal may actually force some conglomerates to shed stations or newspapers. 
 TURNING A FROWN UPSIDE DOWN 
 The business news has been grim: stocks are down, oil is near a record high, the dollar is low, and housing prices are sinking. But barring a meltdown, none of these developments will turn out to be as bad as you think. Some are downright welcome. Economic Scene: David Leonhardt. [A1.] 
 President Bush, speaking in Indiana, praised the economy as resilient. But a growing number of analysts worry that the economy's stamina may have reached its limit. [A20.] 
 MARKETS MOVE UP, FOR NOW 
 After several painful days of declines, stock markets moved into positive territory as the Dow Jones industrials surged nearly 320 points on sunnier forecasts from Wal-Mart and two banks. But many analysts doubted the high spirits would last. [C1.] 
 DRIVING CAR BUYERSGeneral Motors has been getting enthusiastic reviews for its new cars, but its market share has been slipping. One big challenge facing G.M. is changing the way consumers think about its cars. [C1.] 
 SLOW PROGRESS IN NEW FUELS The chairman of Ford Motor, William Clay Ford Jr., expressed frustration at the slow pace of alternative fuel development, saying industry leaders expected better progress by now. Speaking at the University of Michigan, Mr. Ford, above, also said he was concerned about growing congestion in cities worldwide. [C9.] 
 SEAWEED AND MARKETING Lululemon Athletica makes popular and pricey yoga clothing, including a line called VitaSea, which the company says is made with seaweed. But some of the company's claims about the fabric have been questioned. [C1.] 
 A GOOD TIME FOR DISCOUNTERS Unease in the economy is proving a boon to the nation's largest discount retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, but a bust for the biggest home improvement chain, Home Depot. [C3.] 
 CRUDE OIL DROPS IN PRICE The price of crude oil dropped after a prominent energy group lowered its estimate for worldwide demand, saying high prices were harming consumption. Oil fell $3.45, or 3.7 percent, to $91.17 a barrel in New York. [C5.] 
 MONEY MARKET FUNDS' SAFETY Large investment firms are being forced to protect their money market funds from losses brought on by investments that no longer seem safe. Bank of America said that it would provide as much as $600 million to prop up several Columbia Management funds. [C1.] 
 CHANGES AT A CITIGROUP UNIT The new head of Citigroup's embattled capital markets unit announced another round of changes that would organize the division more like its rivals. [C4.] 
 VOTE TO CUT AIRLINE EMISSIONS The European Union voted to impose quotas on the emission of carbon dioxide by airlines, setting up a fight with the United States. [C3.] 
 PRICES GOING UP IN CHINA Consumer prices in China unexpectedly surged again last month despite price controls on a wide range of industries, and this month holds the prospect of even higher inflation. [C4.] 
 BONUSES MAY FEEL A PINCH The drop of the American dollar against the British pound and the euro may claim some of the bonus money of European investment bankers. [C9.]

HEADLINE: Where's That Energy Bill?

 BODY:
Two months ago, Washington was filled with hope that Congress would produce an energy bill that would begin to address the two great challenges of oil dependency and climate change. Each chamber had approved respectable if incomplete measures that could be combined in one outstanding bill. Then the bills disappeared into the back rooms as Democratic leaders tried to negotiate a final product. 
 These talks have now reached a dangerous point. With both houses feeling pressure to do something -- anything -- to deal with high oil prices, there's a real danger that one or more essential provisions could be dropped just for the sake of producing a bill. 
 That's not what the country needs. And it doesn't have to happen if the leadership, Nancy Pelosi in the House and Harry Reid in the Senate, hold the line and insist on legislation equal to the country's profound energy problems. Here are the main points of contention: 
 FUEL EFFICIENCY The single most effective way to address the problem of oil imports and consumption is to improve the efficiency of cars and light trucks, which use more than two-thirds of all the oil burned in the United States. Efficiency standards have changed little in 30 years. The Senate bill mandates an ambitious 40 percent improvement by 2020. The House ducked the issue -- but Ms. Pelosi promised to fight for stronger standards in later negotiations. She must now honor that pledge. 
 RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY The House bill requires utilities to generate 15 percent of their power from renewable sources like wind by 2020. Republicans, pressured by a few big utilities like the Southern Company, blocked a similar provision in the Senate. Almost two dozen states have already figured out that this is both good for the environment and good for the economy and have enacted renewable energy standards, which will create jobs, stabilize natural gas prices and reduce global warming emissions. 
 Yet this provision is in greater danger than any other of getting tossed overboard. Ms. Pelosi should insist that it remain in the bill and Mr. Reid should enlist the support of governors from those nearly two dozen states to change Republican thinking in the Senate. 
 TAXING BIG OIL The House rolled back some of the far too generous tax breaks granted to the oil industry in the 2005 energy bill. The proceeds would be used to fund renewable energy intitiatives. The House bill also contains some modest but overdue environmental protections for sensitive Western lands threatened by oil and gas drilling. Industry has been going berserk over both provisions. The House should stand its ground.
 Even if the leadership gets all this right, it still won't be a substitute for comprehensive climate change legislation. It would, however, represent an important down payment on that larger obligation. With so much more to be done, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid simply have to deliver a good energy bill.

PERSON: A. F. Hawkins 

HEADLINE: A. F. Hawkins, 100, Civil Rights Lawmaker

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Augustus F. Hawkins, who was California's first black representative in Congress, serving 14 terms in the House, and who had a hand in important civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, died on Saturday in Bethesda, Md. He was 100 and had lived in Washington since retiring from Congress in January 1991. 
 His death, at a Bethesda hospital, was announced by his niece, Susan Jefferson, The Associated Press reported. 
 Mr. Hawkins, who was known as Gus, represented south-central Los Angeles, including Watts. When he was first elected in 1962, he became one of only six black members of the House. After the elections in 1970, he helped found the Congressional Black Caucus, the influential organizing body for black lawmakers. 
 He was elected to the California State Assembly in Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term as president, and served there from 1934 until 1962. Through his career in government, Mr. Hawkins championed civil rights legislation and the liberal ideals of big government. He supported the New Deal and the Great Society programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
 But as he prepared to retire from the House, at the age of 82, he expressed some disillusionment with Congress and with his fellow black lawmakers, who he said often pursued individual interests instead of working as a cohesive group. ''You could get frustrated by staying here,'' he said in an interview in 1990. 
 After being elected to the House, Mr. Hawkins was assigned in 1963 to the Education and Labor Committee. He played a major role in drafting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and particularly Title VII of that bill, which outlawed racial discrimination in employment and set the mandates for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
 He became chairman of the Education and Labor Committee in 1984 and also had a crucial role in the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which was enacted in 1988 over a veto by President Ronald Reagan. The law specified that federal agencies, schools and other organizations receiving federal funds must comply with civil rights laws in all areas, not just in the program receiving money. 
 Mr. Hawkins was also an advocate for workers and pushed for increases in the minimum wage. 
 In 1978, with Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, he co-sponsored the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act, which set the nation's economic policy with four goals: full employment, production growth, price stability, and balance of trade and budget. The measure also required the Federal Reserve to establish monetary policy intended to maintain long-term growth, minimize inflation and promote price stability. 
 ''Congressman Hawkins left his fingerprints on a host of historic pieces of legislation,'' Representative Carolyn C. Kilpatrick, Democrat of Michigan and the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement. 
 Augustus Freeman Hawkins was born on Aug. 31, 1907, in Shreveport, La., the youngest of five children. His father, Nyanza Hawkins, was a pharmacist. 
 The family moved to California shortly after World War I, when he was 11; he attended Jefferson High School and the University of California, Los Angeles. He was so light-skinned that he was often mistaken for white. 
 Unlike other major civil rights figures, who used their advocacy as a platform from which to seek public office, Mr. Hawkins entered public office first, then used his increasing seniority to advance the cause of civil rights. 
 ''By the time Martin Luther King became a national leader, Hawkins was already on the inside,'' said Ben Highton, a political scientist at the University of California, Davis. 
 In California, Mr. Hawkins ran for the State Assembly against Frederick M. Roberts, a Republican who was the Assembly's first black member. Mr. Hawkins promised that he would cut the streetcar fare in Los Angeles in half, to a nickel. 
 He ran for the House in 1962, after a redrawing of Congressional district lines virtually assured him of victory. And from then on, he won re-election easily. 
 His first wife, Pegga Adeline Smith, a concert singer, died in 1966. His second wife, Elsie, died earlier this year. Survivors include two stepdaughters, Barbara A. Hammond and Brenda L. Stevenson, and a stepson, Michael A. Taylor.

HEADLINE: In First Ads For Giuliani, A Wild City Is Made Over

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MICHAEL LUO; Michael Cooper contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York will begin advertising this week in New Hampshire with a commercial that dramatically presents him as the man who tamed a crime-ridden and unmanageable city in spite of typical human foibles.
 The commercial, Mr. Giuliani's first of the campaign, begins running in New Hampshire on Thursday as part of a stepped-up effort by Mr. Giuliani to win in the nation's first primary state, where polls show former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts leading his Republican rivals. 
 With it, Mr. Giuliani ends a guessing game among his rivals over when he would advertise on television; all of the other major Republican candidates have already begun doing so. 
 The spot features gritty, black-and-white images of New York -- a Harlem movie house marquee and the words, ''Sex World;'' riot police struggling with an unseen perpetrator -- as Mr. Giuliani describes a mess that he inherited: ''They used to call it unmanageable, ungovernable. A large majority of New Yorkers wanted to leave and live somewhere else. It was a city that was in financial crisis, a city that was the crime capital of America.''
 Then the screen floods with color and brilliant images of New York City -- a new-model Volvo cruising along Park Avenue with virtually no traffic and a light-filled and crowd-free Grand Central Terminal -- and the music becomes decidedly upbeat.
 ''By the time I left office, New York City was being proclaimed as the best example of conservative government in the country,'' Mr. Giuliani says, adding, 
 ''We turned it into the safest large city in America, the welfare-to-work capital of America, and most importantly, the spirit of the people of the city had changed. Instead of being hopeless, the large majority of people had hope.''
 The commercial is starkly reminiscent of the famous advertisement for Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, ''Morning in America,'' similarly using an image of a flag being raised into a blue sky and inspirational music.
 Mr. Giuliani's team is seeking in the commercial to address and, if possible, neutralize the stubborn questions of his candidacy -- including how voters will react to his sometimes messy personal life, the recent federal indictment of Bernard B. Kerik, his former police commissioner, and his more liberal positions on social issues that stray from much of the party's conservative base.
 ''I believe I've been tested in a way in which the American people can look to me,'' Mr. Giuliani says. ''They're not going to find perfection, but they're going to find somebody who has dealt with crisis almost on a regular basis and has had results.''
 In 60 seconds, the commercial encapsulates the complicated two-step that Mr. Giuliani is trying to dance in dealing with the city he once governed, at once deriding its past and hailing its recovery as his own legacy.
 ''It shows Rudy as Rudy,'' Mike DuHaime, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, said in an interview Tuesday night. 
 Yet Mr. Giuliani's campaign has been avoiding advertising for as long as possible because his strategy is largely focused on later-voting states where advertising is more expensive.
 Mr. DuHaime said the advertisement would run in Manchester and on the more expensive stations in Boston that are also viewed in New Hampshire, because ''we see an opportunity in New Hampshire.'' 
 While campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, Mr. Romney seized on the issue of college tuition breaks for illegal immigrants to attack Mr. Giuliani, as well as another Republican, Mike Huckabee, according to The Associated Press. In Massachusetts, Mr. Romney vetoed a budget item that would have granted in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. 
 Mr. Romney was referring to a policy at the City University of New York that was rescinded in 2002 -- after Mr. Giuliani left office -- that made illegal immigrants eligible for in-state tuition.
 The Giuliani campaign fought back by saying Mr. Romney never admonished Massachusetts cities with similar ''sanctuary city'' policies and by highlighting a report in The Boston Globe that found he had illegal immigrants doing his yard work.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 24, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 14 about a television commercial by Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign portraying Mr. Giuliani as the man who tamed a crime-ridden and unmanageable New York City misidentified a theater featured in the commercial. It was the Harem Theater, which showed pornographic films until the mid-1990s; the commercial did not include ''a Harlem movie house.''

HEADLINE: In the Continuing Space Race, Private Firms Play a Big Role

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
China's success in shooting down one of its own satellites last January has given new energy to efforts in the United States to develop and launch more -- and cheaper -- satellites.
 Significantly, the new approach to satellites is getting a boost not just from giant aerospace corporations but from small, entrepreneurial companies. Entrepreneurs have also been behind other recent efforts to move ahead in space, including the Ansari X Prize, the $10 million competition that put a pilot in space without government financing in 2004. 
 The efforts of the entrepreneurs are also seen as crucial to keeping the United States at the forefront of space technology as Russia, Europe and increasingly China become more technically adept.
 ''The world is moving to new uses of space, and our technology in the United States has not progressed because of the time and expense it takes us to do a mission,'' said Robert Conger, vice president of Microcosm Inc., a small company that is working to perfect a low-cost launching vehicle at its factory in Hawthorne, Calif. 
 Making launchings cheaper and quicker would benefit both the military and National Aeronautics and Space Administration because critical satellites could easily be replaced if damaged. And, proponents say, such launchings could unleash a spate of educational, commercial and scientific uses of space that are not being pursued because of expense. 
 Not even counting the cost of a satellite itself, most space launchings now cost $30 million to $100 million. The private companies aim to reduce those costs to $4.6 million to $7 million, and one specialized space mission company is under contract to launch two satellites at a cost of $11.5 million apiece. Because of the costs and lengthy preparations for a launch, there were just 22 successful government and commercial launchings in the United States in 2006. Russia, France and other countries put 40 satellites into orbit last year. 
 James Wertz, who teaches astronautics at government space agencies in the United States, Canada and Europe and has written basic textbooks on space mission design and costs, is among those arguing that many more satellites could be launched each year. 
 ''Look at it this way,'' said Mr. Wertz, who is also president of Microcosm. ''If we could have launched a satellite within 20 hours of the Asian tsunami in 2004, we could have found villages needing help right away rather than a week or two later. We could have saved more lives.'' 
 Mr. Wertz founded Microcosm in 1984 to conduct research for the Air Force and to specialize in reducing the cost of space missions. The company, which has 40 employees, is working under contract with the Air Force to develop a rocket that can put a satellite weighing less than 800 pounds in orbit, with eight hours' notice, for $4.6 million. The rocket and fuel assembly -- the launching vehicle -- will cost $3.9 million of that total, Mr. Conger said. 
 A prime difficulty in the process, Mr. Conger said, is designing a fuel tank and pump assembly that can hold liquid oxygen under great pressure and push fuel out fast enough to attain a speed of 4.7 miles a second to achieve orbit, while being light enough to hold down costs. Microcosm engineers, he said, are using composite materials for the fuel tanks. 
 Another company in the same pursuit of low-cost rocketry, but more advanced because it has a major investment from its founder, is Space Exploration Technologies, which calls itself SpaceX. Also based in Hawthorne, it is trying to create an array of rockets, ranging from a low-price Falcon 1, for light satellite payloads, to a Falcon 9, which the company hopes will be able to deliver cargo to the International Space Station in 2009. 
 The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, who started Zip2, a software company, in 1995 and sold it in 1999 for $307 million. He then founded PayPal, the electronic payment system, which went public and was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. Mr. Musk, now 36, then began SpaceX. So far, ''I've invested $100 million in the company,'' he said. 
 Two test firings of the Falcon 1 have failed to reach orbit, but in the second attempt the rocket's propulsion system worked as planned, Mr. Musk said. A third launch is scheduled for January. The launching vehicle's cost will be $7 million, Mr. Musk said. 
 SpaceX, which has 330 employees, also has a $278 million contract from NASA to demonstrate the Falcon 9 rocket and a spaceship, with the goal of carrying cargo in 2009 to the International Space Station. 
 ''We can do any payload for one-half to one-third the price of larger competitors,'' Mr. Musk said, referring to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Arianespace of France, ISC Kosmotras and Dnepr space launching system of Russia and the Orbital Sciences Corporation. 
 The main competitor for the entrepreneurial upstarts is Orbital Sciences, which was founded in 1982 to develop smaller, less expensive space and rocket systems. Orbital, based in Dulles, Va., has 3,300 employees and has had 24 successful launch missions over the last 12 years for its Pegasus system, which sends payloads into orbit on the back of an L-1011 jetliner. 
 The cost of a mission is roughly $30 million. But Orbital -- which gets about $63 million of its $1.05 billion in annual revenue from the launch vehicle business and the balance from missile and satellite development for the military and NASA -- also has a lower-cost launching vehicle named Minotaur 1. That vehicle is putting two satellites in orbit for the Air Force at an average cost of $11.5 million each. Government-supplied rocket engines help hold down costs for the Minotaur.
 ''We have the capability and reliability,'' said Barron S. Beneski, vice president for investor relations for Orbital. ''And reliability doesn't come cheap.''
 The pressure to make lower-cost, more frequent space launches is real, Mr. Conger of Microcosm said. ''Our economy is dependent on satellites these days. Think of credit card verification, flows of information on the Internet, global positioning for navigation,'' he said. And the more important challenge is global competitiveness, he added. 
 Entrepreneurs say satellites could do many more things if launching them could be made more affordable. ''Satellites can track not only velocity but the direction of winds over large areas, so we'll be able to know well in advance where a hurricane is going -- enormously helpful for reducing property damage,'' Mr. Wertz said. 
 In an interview, he and Mr. Conger projected a wide variety of uses for future space missions, from education to specialized manufacturing at zero gravity to soil analysis and surveys of water availability. 
 But Mr. Wertz said he was concerned about continued financing for the cheaper rockets. The company's total investment over more than eight years in the program, which it calls Scorpius Low-Cost Launch Services, is now $65 million from government and $15 million from the company. 
 ''We've got $40 million to go,'' Mr. Wertz said, ''and these are challenging times.''

PERSON: Gerald D. Feldman 

HEADLINE: Gerald D. Feldman, Historian of the Nazis and Finances, Dies at 70

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Gerald D. Feldman, an eminent historian of 20th-century German history who concentrated on the intersection of economics and politics to explore subjects like the hyperinflation of the 1920s and the cozy relationships between financial companies and the Nazis, died on Oct. 31 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 70.
 The cause was cancer, said Beverly Crawford, associate director of the Institute of European Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where Dr. Feldman taught for 44 years. He also directed the institute. 
 Dr. Feldman was noted for his original research into how banks and insurance companies collaborated with Hitler's regime. He was part of a team of international historians that found documents proving that Deutsche Bank had financed the building of Auschwitz. 
 His book ''Allianz and the German Insurance Business, 1933-1945'' (2001), told how Allianz, a giant German insurance company, had given money owed to Jewish beneficiaries of life insurance policies to the Nazi authorities instead and had insured concentration camps. In what he termed ''a state-sanctioned exercise in moral turpitude,'' the company's executives helped the government disguise its defrauding of Jews as ''business as usual.''
 Dr. Feldman firmly established how Allianz Group inspectors had toured concentration camps and were fully aware of what was going on. He later turned his attention to Austrian banks' interactions with the Nazis.
 Dr. Feldman sometimes said that it sounded ''blasphemous'' to study business matters underlying the Holocaust, but that full understanding required it.
 Dr. Feldman held the Jane K. Sather chair at Berkeley. He wrote 12 books, edited 15 and wrote 130 scholarly articles, according to H-German, a Web site run by and intended for historians of Germany. H-Net called Dr. Feldman ''one of the most respected and influential historians of his generation.''
 He held prestigious fellowships, including a Guggenheim and a Woodrow Wilson, and was named a Berlin Prize Fellow in 1998-99. He wrote books and articles in both English and German, many of which were translated to the other language. He advised the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States.
 Gerald Donald Feldman was born on April 24, 1937, in the Bronx and grew up there. He graduated magna cum laude from Columbia and earned his doctorate at Harvard in 1964. He went to Berkeley as an assistant professor in 1963.
 Although he had no formal economics training, he gravitated to financial and business topics. His first book, ''Army, Industry and Labor in Germany, 1914-1918'' (1966), explored how heavy industry and socialist labor had collaborated to exploit opportunities provided by World War I.
 His book ''The Great Disorder: Politics, Economics and Society in the German Inflation, 1914-1924'' (1993) analyzed the stupendous inflation that followed World War I. In 1918, immediately after the war, seven German marks purchased one dollar; by the end of 1923, a dollar in Berlin bought 4.2 trillion marks.
 Dr. Feldman asked how a state and its financial institutions could ''effectively defraud'' citizens through this protracted inflation, then bring about their acceptance of a new currency based on paper notes rather than gold. Part of his answer was not kind: ''character deficiency.''
 The Journal of Military History called this book ''essential reading for anyone who truly wishes to understand what happened to Germany in the first third of the 20th century.''
 Dr. Feldman said he had turned to studying the Holocaust at age 60 partly because he was Jewish. But he wanted his conclusions to emerge from objective scholarship, not emotion, he said. As an example, Lloyd's List, a British newspaper specializing in insurance and other economic areas, said his Allianz book suggested that the company and its senior officers had ''never really had their hearts'' in collaborating with Hitler.
 Dr. Feldman received what he called full cooperation from Allianz, as did the teams that investigated Deutsche Bank and other companies.
 ''In a sense, they're disappointed if we don't come up with something nasty about them,'' he said in an interview with Newsweek in 1999. ''They don't want someone else finding something we missed.''
 In the mid-1980s, Dr. Feldman was involved in a bitter dispute among historians over whether David Abraham, a young Princeton historian, had fabricated part of his book ''The Collapse of the Weimar Republic.'' After praising the book before it was published, Dr. Feldman wrote a 40-page indictment of the final product for Central European History, a scholarly journal.
 Others joined in, and Dr. Abraham, though he defended his work, saying errors were common in any historical work, ended up leaving the history profession, going to law school and becoming a professor of immigration law at the University of Miami.
 Dr. Feldman also occasionally wrote for the press. In 1994, when some wanted Germans to be represented at the 50th anniversary of D-Day, he argued against it in an article in The Los Angeles Times. He said perpetrators must be treated differently from victims.
 Dr. Feldman was divorced from his first wife, Philippa Blume, in 1982. He is survived by his wife, Norma von Ragenfeld-Feldman, and two children from his first marriage, Aaron J. Feldman and Deborah Eve Feldman.
 The professor's passion was Wagnerian operas. The Institute of European Studies said in a newsletter in 2006 that a love of prolonged musical spectacle seemed appropriate for an author whose books routinely exceeded 1,000 pages.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Slip, Signaling Cutback in Holiday Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

DATELINE: Spending is slowing 

 BODY:
but so is inflation, offering the Federal Reserve more room to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates next month, if it wants.
 Retail sales softened in October, rising 0.2 percent after a 0.7 percent gain in September, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The report underscored analysts' expectations that consumers would be more reluctant to spend freely over the holiday season. It was the smallest sales gain since a 0.1 percent rise in August. 
 ''The overall picture is weak,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the research firm MFR. ''The consumer is notching it back quite a bit.''
 A beleaguered housing market and rising energy prices threaten to slow economic activity in the fourth quarter as consumers find their pocketbooks strained by expensive necessities like gasoline and heating oil. 
 Department stores were hit hard in October, as warmer-than-normal weather hurt sales of winter clothing. Furniture sales continue to slow, posting their third consecutive month of declines. Electronics and apparel sold at a middling pace, and sales of sporting goods shrank for the third month in a row. 
 ''U.S. consumers haven't fallen off the proverbial cliff, but they are hanging on for dear life,'' Richard F. Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential in Austin, Tex., wrote in a research note. ''Retailers will likely have to resort to heavy discounting to lure consumers into their stores.''
 Though many economists see a gloomy outlook for spending, the Fed has hinted that it would be reluctant to cut its benchmark interest rate when the central bank meets on Dec. 11, discouraging market watchers who think a rate cut could stimulate growth.
 But prices at the producer level were restrained last month, possibly reassuring Fed officials who are wary of inflation risks. Businesses paid less for energy in October despite rising oil prices, though the recent run-up in crude oil prices could reverse that trend in November. 
 The Producer Price Index rose 0.1 percent in October, compared with a 1.1 percent gain in September, the Labor Department said yesterday. The core index, which offers a fuller snapshot of inflation by excluding volatile food and energy costs, was unchanged after rising 0.1 percent in September.
 Analysts have predicted increased price pressures as businesses are forced to pay higher energy costs. The report gives the Fed more leeway to lower interest rates further, provided there is no resurgence in inflation in the prices of consumer goods. Economists will have a clearer picture of inflation after the government releases the Consumer Price Index today.
 For the year through October, core wholesale prices rose 2.5 percent, the biggest increase since September 2005.
 Separately, inventories at American businesses rose 0.4 percent in September, with the largest gains among manufacturers and wholesalers. The increase came after a 0.3 percent rise in August, the Commerce Department said yesterday.

HEADLINE: 23 Are Charged With Illegal Sports Betting at Borgata Casino in Atlantic City

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
It was just another Wednesday at the cavernous Poker Room in Atlantic City's poshest casino, the Borgata. The cocktail waitresses were gliding around in economical black dresses and the dealers were holding court at packed tables. No one was paying any attention to the television monitors tuned to CNN.
 Had they sneaked a peek, they would have seen a familiar image: the Poker Room. 
 For the better part of the last two years, law-enforcement officials say, the Poker Room has been home to an illegal betting ring on college and professional football and basketball that raked in $22 million, right under the noses of myriad cameras and agents from the Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. 
 And on Wednesday, State Attorney General Anne Milgram announced that 23 people -- including 4 men with alleged ties to organized crime in Philadelphia and 2 floor supervisors at the Borgata -- had been charged with a variety of offenses.
 In an indication of how complex the operation was, law enforcement officials said that the ring relied on two wire rooms in Philadelphia and involved perhaps hundreds of bettors. They said the ringleader, Andrew Micali, an unemployed 32-year-old from Ventnor with ties to the Merlino crime family, was a regular at the Poker Room.
 The investigation marks the third time in the last year that state or federal authorities in New Jersey have cracked an illegal sports betting ring. One involved a former National Hockey League coach and player, Rick Tocchet, who later pleaded guilty.
 Another centered on an Internet gambling ring and ensnared Rudy Garcia, a former assemblyman from Hudson County, who has pleaded not guilty.
 But law enforcement officials said the announcement was noteworthy because it was the first time they could recall anyone with alleged organized crime ties being charged with illegal gambling in Atlantic City.
 ''They greatly underestimated our vigilance and determination to keep organized crime out of Atlantic City's casinos,'' Ms. Milgram said.
 Ms. Milgram emphasized that the Borgata's management had cooperated in the investigation from the outset, and that the betting ring had not compromised any of the legal poker games.
 ''The responsibility lies with those folks who allowed themselves to be corrupted,'' said Capt. Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the State Police. ''It all comes down to greed.''
 Law enforcement officials said they began their investigation, called ''Operation High Roller,'' based on a tip received in March 2006. Relying on video surveillance and other techniques, they determined that illegal gamblers were told whom to place bets with in the Poker Room. The two wire rooms in Philadelphia then handled the bets.
 The casino employees who participated in the ring ignored exchanges of cash and casino chips to skirt financial reporting requirements, they said.
 ''There were transactions by the defendants using casino chips, in a way that would allow them to hide the proceeds of their criminal activity,'' Ms. Milgram said. ''Or, to say it more bluntly, taking cash, turning it into chips, washing the chips through some of the process by either betting or being involved with other bettors, and then taking the money, getting it out.''
 Those who lost, she added, were forced to take out loans at interest rates exceeding 50 percent, violating state law.
 In all, 5 people were arrested on Wednesday and 18 were issued summonses, on charges of promoting gambling, money laundering and criminal usury. Investigators said they found more than $40,000 in Borgata chips and cash in Mr. Micali's safe deposit box at the casino, and that they seized gambling records, a laptop computer and a loaded .357-caliber semiautomatic handgun at his home.
 The state Casino Control Commission is expected to discipline the six casino employees who were charged, and it is likely that their licenses will be revoked, said Daniel Heneghan, a spokesman for the commission.
 Rob Stillwell, a spokesman for the Borgata, said that the casino had done everything it could to ensure that its gambling operations were not tainted.
 But Wednesday's announcement was likely to be a reminder of just how skittish New Jersey has always been about the specter of organized crime in the casinos.
 When the state authorized legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City in 1977, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne said: ''I've said it before and I will repeat it again to organized crime: Keep your filthy hands off Atlantic City. Keep the hell out of our state!''

HEADLINE: Congress and the Mortgage Mess

 BODY:
The House will vote today on much needed legislation to curtail abusive mortgage lending. Last minute lobbying to weaken the bill is coming from all corners: from brokers who hawked the junk loans, lenders who advanced the cash and Wall Street banks that bought the loans and repackaged them into securities for sale to investors. Having profited so immensely during the mortgage bubble, they now want to keep the world safe for future financial excesses. 
 Industry has already scored some regrettable victories. It persuaded the bill's backers to include a provision that would prevent borrowers from suing Wall Street firms in state court -- where consumer protections are often stronger -- for common abusive loan practices. If Congress truly wants to protect consumers, rather than kowtow to the mortgage industry, lawmakers must resist further efforts to cripple the bill and pass a number of essential amendments before the final vote. 
 One key amendment, sponsored by Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would ensure that states are allowed to pursue cases against fraud, misrepresentation, deception, false advertising and civil rights violations. Unfortunately, that still lets the federal government pre-empt state law when it comes to other abusive-loan practices. But it at least blocks the industry from asserting that state law is supplanted for all abuses. 
 Another must-pass amendment would adopt sensible underwriting standards for all nontraditional mortgages -- not just subprime loans -- including a rule that lenders must verify a borrower's ability to repay. The amendment is crucial because it is not only subprime loans that have turned out to be toxic. Another important proposed change would give borrowers the right to modify an illegal loan, before they're forced into foreclosure. 
 The bursting mortgage bubble is already causing too much pain and suffering for Americans. And there is worse to come. Foreclosures have yet to peak, and the full spillover effects have yet to hit the broader economy. The House bill could help to ensure that the unfolding debacle is not repeated, but only if lawmakers insist on putting the interests of American consumers first.

HEADLINE: With Eye on '08, House Takes On Mortgage Rules

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Facing the increasing prospect of a Congressional election season colored by economic uncertainty, lawmakers are moving to ease their political exposure on the home-loan crisis.
 The House is set to take up new regulations for mortgage issuers as soon as Thursday while lawmakers are putting together a separate measure that would allow bankruptcy judges to ease the financial squeeze on some who face losing their homes. 
 Both proposals have drawn rare bipartisan backing in the polarized House, splitting Republicans by geography as some from regions hardest hit by the loan crisis -- notably the Midwest -- have negotiated the measures with Democrats. 
 ''I would certainly like to see us take action at the federal level that will make things better for folks who want to stay in their homes,'' said Representative Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio, whose state has been in the forefront of the home-loan collapse and who has been working with Democrats on the bankruptcy plan.
 The growing effort to take on the home-loan issue points to a potential new dynamic for the 2008 campaign. Rather than focusing on the war in Iraq, lawmakers are beginning to spend as much time talking about the alternative minimum tax, the costs of health care and energy, and instability in the housing market.
 ''Everyone now knows the economy is under a huge amount of stress, and you cannot be on the side of ignoring it,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
 As lawmakers head home for Thanksgiving, leaders are urging Democrats to emphasize a ''middle-class squeeze,'' accusing Republicans of failing to recognize the cumulative effects of the rising costs of college, gasoline, health insurance and other everyday expenses. Republicans are holding Democrats responsible for not providing temporary relief from the alternative minimum income tax, which threatens to capture millions of people next year if it is not rescinded.
 Lawmakers and housing advocates say the emerging legislation is just the beginning of a Congressional response to the fallout from a mortgage breakdown that occurred as unconventional loans were extended to thousands of borrowers eager to get into the housing market.
 The first measure scheduled to be considered by the House is focused more on curbing future lender abuses than providing relief for those now at risk of losing their homes. It would set new standards for ensuring that borrowers have a reasonable ability to repay the loan, establish new licensing requirements for mortgage brokers, put new restrictions on incentives for steering borrowers into riskier loans and provide some liability for financial institutions that trade in faulty mortgages.
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said the bill could be the first major consumer protection measure to emerge from the current Congress, with economic anxiety trumping opposition from powerful industry lobbying groups. ''I think the consumers can beat the industry,'' Mr. Frank said.
 Though the bill has some Republican support, Republican leaders have joined mortgage industry groups in raising serious reservations about the plan. 
 Representative Adam H. Putnam of Florida, chairman of the House Republican Conference, equated the bill with using ''a sledgehammer on a gnat,'' saying it was an exaggerated response to a problem afflicting a relatively small percentage of people.
 Referring to those who took on unconventional loans, Mr. Putnam said, ''There is still 85 percent of homeowners who have taken advantage of this new vehicle to get into homeownership and are doing what they need to do to hang on.'' 
 He and other critics said the new regulations could dry up mortgage money. The White House on Wednesday stopped short of threatening to veto the bill, but said it feared it could ''overly constrict the primary and secondary markets for mortgage finance.''
 Consumer groups have their own problems with the measure, saying too many accommodations have been made to broaden support. They say, for example, that lawmakers have excluded too many loans from requirements on ensuring ability to repay and weakened efforts to impose new liability on Wall Street. They say the proposal to prevent brokers from being paid more to push costlier mortgages has been watered down.
 ''We don't think it changes the incentives that got us where we are today with the mortgage crisis,'' said Michael D. Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending.
 While the new regulations move to the floor, lawmakers are negotiating a separate plan to allow bankruptcy courts to modify mortgage terms and allow an estimated 600,000 borrowers to keep their homes. Advocates of the measure say that a push for lenders and borrowers to voluntarily work out new terms to avoid foreclosure has failed and that threat of court action could encourage lenders to strike deals or clear the way for a reasonable reworking by a judge.
 Lawmakers backing action on the mortgage crisis said the legislation, though not a cure-all, was a step in the right direction.
 ''We are not through the woods,'' said Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, ''but I think we are moving forward.''

HEADLINE: Two Cities Linked By Design

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The area surrounding Chausseestrasse, a former no man's land where a wall once stood in Berlin, may not seem to invite immediate comparisons with the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. But architects and urban planners see parallels in the rapid growth of both of these formerly gritty neighborhoods, particularly in how the arts have spurred gentrification.
 As New York and Berlin undergo architectural booms, such provocative juxtapositions can shed light on how the arts, immigration and community activism affect urban development. That's the thinking behind the ''Berlin-New York Dialogues: Building in Context,'' an exhibition at the Center for Architecture on La Guardia Place in Greenwich Village that will travel to Berlin in March. 
 ''These are two cities that are both on the verge of paradigm shifts in how growth happens,'' said Lynnette Widder, a curator of the show and head of the architecture department at the Rhode Island School of Design.
 The question in New York is whether the city can sustain its building boom, Ms. Widder added, while in Berlin the question is whether the city can continue to reverse years of shrinkage. ''Germany is looking to America as a model of a much more free market,'' she said. 
 The remaking of a united Berlin, meanwhile, offers New Yorkers a new way to reflect on psychological barriers in their own town.
 ''The way the Berlin Wall divided that city for so long -- I think we've got that in New York, but we don't see it,'' said Frederic M. Bell, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, which runs the center. ''There are people who never go north of 14th Street or never go to Red Hook. That's the lesson we're learning from Berlin. What Berlin is learning from us? I think it's a question of scale -- how to live more grandly.''
 Running through Jan. 26, the exhibition is part of the broader Berlin in Lights festival, which includes performances and lectures at organizations including Carnegie Hall, the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Goethe Institute. 
 Rather than focus narrowly on noteworthy buildings, the exhibition and related panel discussions explore issues like how Berlin is reasserting its role in European cultural and intellectual life and how New York is trying to maintain its reputation as a creative center, even as artists are priced out of neighborhoods they helped to rejuvenate.
 ''We didn't really try to have one-on-one comparisons,'' said Kristien Ring, the director of the German Center for Architecture in Berlin. ''We tried to pick themes where one can delve into a dialogue.''
 For example both cities seem to have rediscovered the potential of their waterfronts in recent years, with an array of commercial buildings and residential lofts rising near the Spree River in Berlin and architects drafting plans to enhance the East River esplanade in Manhattan.
 Each of the exhibition's curators has some personal connection with Berlin. Ms. Widder lived there for eight years. Ms. Ring has lived there since 1991. And Sophie Stigliano, the Center for Architecture's director of exhibitions, is German and formerly lived in Berlin. 
 Their show touches on themes like immigration, economic growth and political activism in three neighborhoods in each city: in New York, Red Hook, the South Bronx and Chelsea; in Berlin, the Chausseestrasse, Mitte/ Prenzlauer Berg and the Spree River area. 
 Several projects are examined in each neighborhood. In New York that includes the Bronx Charter School for the Arts, a public elementary school designed by Weisz & Yoes Architects in a converted factory with a colorful tiled facade. The show cites the school as an example of ''culture as catalyst'': the institution's arts-based curriculum has had a broad impact on the neighborhood. 
 In Berlin featured projects include Alexanderplatz, home to the Television Tower and the Berolinahaus by Peter Behrens, as well as the old socialist developments along Karl-Marx Allee, examples of so-called East Modernism. 
 The curators tried to represent areas in varying stages of development: fully formed neighborhoods like Chelsea or Spandauer Vorstadt; nascent areas like Red Hook or Spree; and nontraditional areas like Mott Haven and Hunts Point in the Bronx or Chausseestrasse.
 While private developers tend to have the final say in New York, architecture is commissioned through open competitions in Berlin. Architecture is thus a more crucial part of public life in Berlin than here.
 In the exhibition displays about each city -- including photographs, renderings, maps, statistical information and interviews -- are positioned opposite each other. ''Chausseestrasse and Red Hook needed to talk to each other,'' Ms. Wilder said, because both share a history of grass-roots growth and are now sites of large-scale development, like the Ikea furnishings store in Brooklyn and a new home for the BND, the German intelligence agency, which is moving 4,000 employees from Frankfurt to Berlin. 
 At the same time the curators tried to avoid stretching the comparisons. ''We realized the differences are probably more significant than the similarities,'' Ms. Widder said.

HEADLINE: '08 Budget Is Baghdad's Biggest, if Only It Can Spend It

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Reporting was contributed by Cara Buckley, Khalid al-Ansary and Wisam A. Habeeb from Baghdad, and Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Iraq will spend an unprecedented $19 billion on capital projects across the country in 2008, including $900 million in Baghdad, senior Iraqi officials said Wednesday, even as they warned that the fight against insurgencies, gangs and militias was far from over. 
 ''We must confront the terrorism and extremism that hampers the building of a country of citizenship and law and that provides opportunity, water, electricity and fuel,'' Barham Salih, the deputy prime minister, said in a speech to a gathering of senior Iraqi government and local Baghdad officials. 
 But Mr. Salih, who is also in charge of economic development for the Baghdad security plan, which began in February, added, ''We still have a lot of security challenges.'' 
 The government reached agreement late Tuesday on a $40 billion budget for 2008, including capital and operating costs, and sent it to the Parliament for review, said Mr. Salih, who made the announcement at the gathering. Those present included the two vice presidents, Adel Abdul-Mehdi and Tariq al-Hashemi; Gen. Aboud Qanbar, the military commander overseeing the security plan; and the United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker. 
 Although the city would get more money than ever for capital projects, as well as at least $300 million for its operating budget, it is not clear whether it could spend the capital funds. American development experts say that, at best, only 60 to 65 percent of the $450 million in capital funds allocated for 2007, half as much as for 2008, has actually been spent. Spending has been slowed by security problems, a lack of expertise in contracting projects and inexperience in delegating tasks -- when a project manager is away, others are often afraid to make decisions, and work stops. 
 ''People need to feel the value of peace,'' said Mr. Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, describing the government's intention to increase capital spending. ''There needs to be quick improvement in electricity, in water, in health care.''
 ''The destruction of Baghdad has not been just a matter of its infrastructure, the damage to streets and buildings,'' he added. ''It is the social fabric that has been damaged.'' 
 But he said that even though the social fabric could not be patched overnight, reconstruction could be a sort of peace dividend giving people hope for better times and encouraging them to eschew the violence that has traumatized the capital. 
 Mr. Hashemi's presence at the forum was itself a signal of the efforts at rapprochement. The bloc he leads in Parliament had been boycotting cabinet sessions, but it appeared that an end to the boycott was under negotiation. His fellow vice president, Mr. Abdul-Mehdi, a Shiite, said that bringing back the Sunnis would ''give strength to reconstruction nationwide.'' 
 Separately, the cabinet has forwarded to Parliament for debate a draft overhaul of the way the de-Baathification rules work. The rules have discouraged many Sunnis from seeking government jobs. The draft has been agreed to by the five most powerful political leaders, representing the Shiite parties Dawa and the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, the two largest Kurdish parties and Tawafiq, the Sunni Arab bloc.
 Changing the de-Baathification law is important in helping to reconcile those in the former government of Saddam Hussein, many of whom were Sunni Arabs, and the Shiite majority. 
 The conference about the budget was well attended despite the explosion of a roadside bomb just outside the gates of the city's heavily protected Green Zone about 90 minutes before the session was to begin inside. The bomb killed two civilians, wounded three more and threw two police officers from their guard towers 150 feet away, the police said.
 The explosion raised immediate questions about how such a device could have been planted in such a closely watched area.
 Elsewhere in Baghdad, armed Iraqi guards seized a mosque that houses the headquarters of the Association of Muslim Scholars, a Sunni group that fiercely opposes the American occupation, the group and witnesses said. The group's Web site said that shortly after 9 a.m., guards acting on orders of the Sunni Endowment, which oversees the country's Sunni mosques, surrounded and entered the mosque, Umm al Qura, and ordered its immediate evacuation.
 The motive behind the seizure was not clear, and calls to leaders of the Sunni Endowment were not immediately returned. The Association of Muslim Scholars has long opposed Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, and it called for a boycott of elections last year.
 In Turkey on Wednesday, Gen. Aydogan Babaoglu, the Air Force commander, denied that Turkish fighter jets engaged in cross-border operations on Tuesday, the day the Turks were reported to have bombed deserted Kurdish villages. Iraqi Kurdish officials, police officers and at least one witness said that there were loud booms in the area and that aircraft dropped either bombs or flares over the villages. 
 ''I don't know how the press comes up with such news,'' General Babaoglu said, speaking to the state-run Anatolian News Agency in northern Cyprus. ''I was on duty at that time, and not a single plane of the Turkish Air Force was engaged in any kind of operation. There's nothing like that. Such news absolutely has no grounds.''
 The American military announced the deaths of four soldiers in Iraq. A roadside bomb killed two soldiers and wounded four more in Diyala Province, and an additional soldier was fatally shot in Mosul. In Baghdad, a soldier on patrol was killed and six were wounded by a bomb of the type called an explosively formed penetrator.
 Ethics Aide Disqualifies Himself
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (AP) -- The State Department official responsible for ensuring that the department operates ethically disqualified himself on Wednesday from any investigations related to Blackwater Worldwide after telling lawmakers that his brother was on the advisory board of Blackwater, the embattled security contractor.
 Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said the admission was further evidence that the official, Howard J. Krongard, the department's inspector general, had politicized his office and undermined inquiries concerning Blackwater. The company is the subject of several federal investigations related to its work in Iraq.
 Mr. Krongard first told the committee that his brother, Alvin Krongard, had assured him several weeks ago that he had no connections to Blackwater. But after the committee returned from a break, he said he had just called his brother, who said he had attended a Blackwater strategic planning meeting this week.
 Before the break, Democrats produced a July 26 letter from Blackwater inviting Alvin Krongard to join the advisory board.

HEADLINE: Amid Drought, a Georgian Consumes a Niagara

BYLINE: By BRENDA GOODMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
A day after Gov. Sonny Perdue asked God to forgive Georgia for being wasteful with its water, county officials in the wealthy suburbs northeast of Atlanta confirmed Wednesday just how profligate one consumer had been.
 A homeowner in Marietta, Ga., used 440,000 gallons in September, or about 14,700 gallons a day. By comparison, the average consumption in the United States is about 150 gallons a day per person, and in the Atlanta metropolitan area about 183 gallons. 
 Month after month during a record-setting drought, the two-story, five-bedroom home owned by that consumer, Chris G. Carlos, a wealthy investor who is a member of one of Atlanta's most well known and philanthropic families, has topped Cobb County's list of residential users. 
 Robert Quigley, a spokesman for the Cobb County Water System, said Mr. Carlos had used an average of 260,000 gallons of water a month for the last year, about twice as much as the consumer next-highest on the county's list. Mr. Carlos has apparently been using the water not only to flush nine toilets and maintain a swimming pool but also to refresh nearly four acres of lush landscaping around his white-columned, red brick home.
 When his consumption figures were disclosed this week by WSB-TV in Atlanta, there was an immediate outcry from other homeowners, thousands of whom have been trying to conserve in the face of a drought that is draining the region's reservoirs. Many are following state suggestions to reuse bath water to feed plants, or to flush toilets a bit less often.
 ''We've had a lot of people calling to gripe about this particular man,'' said a woman who answered the phone for the Cobb County Water System. ''He's not real popular right now.''
 The furor led Mr. Carlos to refer all inquiries to a public relations specialist, Joseph M. A. Ledlie, who said Wednesday that Mr. Carlos had only recently become aware of the severity of the water crisis and was now taking steps to conserve. 
 Mr. Ledlie said his client had cut water use by 73 percent from September to October and had vowed to work with water experts to cut it still further. Indeed, Mr. Quigley, the water system's spokesman, said that for the last six days, Mr. Carlos had used an average of 2,000 gallons a day, which, at a rate of 60,000 gallons a month, is about 10 times the average for a Cobb County household but quite a reduction for Mr. Carlos.
 In a written statement, Mr. Carlos himself, whose monthly water bills during the last year have averaged about $1,200 a month, said Wednesday, ''I honestly didn't realize the extent of my water use and regret I didn't act sooner.''
 For months, with the Southeast struggling through the worst drought it has endured in 100 years, governors from North Carolina to Alabama have called on residents and businesses to cut their water use. On Tuesday, Governor Perdue led several hundred people at the State Capitol here in a prayer for rain.
 Many fellow homeowners say they do not see how Mr. Carlos could have missed news of the drought. But while he seems to have run afoul of public opinion, Mr. Quigley is quick to point out that he has broken no laws. An exception to mandatory restrictions that Cobb County has adopted on outdoor water use allows licensed professional landscapers to water new plantings for 15 days after installation. 
 ''We understand that Mr. Carlos had engaged full-time landscaping services'' in which planting was occurring continuously, in exploitation of the loophole, Mr. Quigley said.
 Legal or not, that does not please his neighbors.
 ''With the water crisis that we're in down here, I just think it's ridiculous that he would take advantage of the situation,'' said Ken L. Scott, who lives across the street from Mr. Carlos.
 ''It's tragic for everybody down here,'' Mr. Scott added, ''because if you look at the lakes, they're bone dry.''
 The drought has already taken a severe toll on the region, economic and otherwise.
 Since August, the town of Orme, Tenn., which has run out of water completely, has had to use an old fire truck to ferry about 20,000 gallons of water a day from nearby Alabama. 
 Last month, in the face of a mandatory 50 percent reduction in water use, chicken processors in North Carolina began trucking in water to run their operations.
 A survey in the Atlanta area found that businesses that depended on outdoor planting and watering had laid off almost 14,000 workers in the last six months, and that number is expected to double before the end of the year, said Mary Kay Woodworth, executive director of the Metro Atlanta Landscape and Turf Association.
 And on Wednesday, Pike Nursery, which runs a chain of 22 gardening stores in Georgia, North Carolina and Alabama, filed for bankruptcy in an Atlanta court, blaming the water shortage.

HEADLINE: Buffett Says No Estate Tax Would Be a Gift to the Rich

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett urged Congress yesterday to maintain the estate tax, saying that plans to repeal the tax would benefit a handful of the richest American families and widen income disparity in the United States. 
 Mr. Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told the Senate Finance Committee that advocates of repeal were ''dead wrong'' to call the tax a ''death tax.''
 It would be more appropriate to call it a ''death present,'' Mr. Buffett, 77, said. ''A meaningful estate tax is needed to prevent our democracy from becoming a dynastic plutocracy.''
 Congressional Democrats are likely to seize on Mr. Buffett's comments to bolster their argument that repeal of the estate tax amounts to a windfall for a few wealthy families. Republicans have pushed to eliminate the tax permanently or reduce the rate and exempt more estates by raising the value at which the tax takes effect.
 Mr. Buffett said that in the last 20 years, tax laws have allowed the ''superrich'' to become richer.
 ''Tax law changes have benefited this group, including me, in a huge way,'' he said. ''During that time the average American went exactly nowhere on the economic scale: he's been on a treadmill while the superrich have been on a spaceship.''
 Lawmakers are under pressure to reach some agreement on the future of the tax because a law enacted by Congress in 2001 gradually phases it out through 2010, when it will be fully repealed for one year. The tax is scheduled to return in 2011 with a top rate of 55 percent on estates worth more than $1 million. For this year, individual estates valued at more than $2 million are taxed at a top rate of 45 percent.
 The chairman of the finance committee, Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, said yesterday that fewer than 1 percent of United States households currently pay the tax. He said repeal lacked support in the Senate and the purpose of the hearing was to solicit ideas for replacing the shifting rules and uncertainty of the current system.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the panel, said the estate tax should be repealed because ''death should not be a taxable event.''
 ''As long as a person has accumulated an estate in accordance with the law, the government should not be able to profit from that person's death,'' he said. 
 He said, however, that he might be willing to accept a compromise short of repeal, as long as lawmakers ''are looking out for small-business owners and family farmers.''

HEADLINE: Governors Join in Creating Regional Pacts on Climate Change

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Frustrated with the slow progress of legislation in Washington on energy and global warming, the nation's governors have created regional agreements to cap greenhouse gases and are engaged in a concerted lobbying effort to prod Congress to act.
 Beginning Monday, three Western governors will appear in a nationwide television advertising campaign sponsored by an environmental group trying to generate public and political support for climate change legislation now before the Senate. 
 The 30-second ad features Arnold Schwarzenegger, Republican of California; Jon Huntsman Jr., Republican of Utah; and Brian Schweitzer, Democrat of Montana, standing in casual clothes in scenic spots talking about the threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions. The nation's governors are acting, but Congress is not, they say. ''Now it's their turn,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger says.
 Separately, in Milwaukee on Wednesday, nine Midwestern governors and the premier of Manitoba signed an agreement to reduce carbon emissions and set up a trading system to meet the reduction targets. The Midwestern accord is modeled on similar regional carbon-reduction and energy-saving arrangements among Northeastern, Southwestern and West Coast states.
 The advertising campaign is underwritten by Environmental Defense, an advocacy group that is pressing for quick action on a climate change proposal sponsored by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia.
 The Lieberman-Warner legislation would cap carbon emissions at 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and set up a system for polluting industries to trade emissions credits to meet the goals. Like other such bills before Congress, it would provide incentives for research on capturing and storing carbon dioxide from power plants and subsidies to help the poor handle the higher costs of electricity in a carbon-constrained economy.
 The bill is now before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The committee's chairwoman, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said she hoped to bring the bill to a vote of the full committee by Dec. 6. There is no schedule for action after that, however.
 The governors, who did not receive a fee for appearing in the advertisement, say state leaders are moving to reduce climate-affecting emissions, while the current Congress has so far failed to pass any significant legislation on climate change or energy.
 ''In state after state, we're taking action,'' the governors say, taking turns speaking. ''Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse gas pollution.''
 In an interview, Governor Huntsman said, ''With just weeks left in the legislative calendar, there has been no vote yet dealing realistically with greenhouse gas pollution. We in the West are already wrestling with it and setting ambitious targets.''
 He said action on the national level, in the form of the Lieberman-Warner legislation or a similar economywide carbon cap-and-trade scheme, was preferable to the patchwork system that state governments were putting in place.
 Governor Schweitzer said dealing with global warming was the ''greatest imperative'' of this and future generations. ''We need to find a sustainable, renewable American energy supply so we will not commit the next generation to fight another oil war,'' he said.
 Mr. Schweitzer added: ''Here's a novel concept for Congress. Do something. Anything. Move.''
 Environmental Defense is spending $3 million to broadcast the advertisement, which will appear in 17 markets in 11 states over the next few weeks, said the group's president, Fred Krupp. The ad will also appear during the Sunday morning talk shows on Nov. 25.
 The Midwestern governors expressed similar impatience with the slow pace in Washington on global warming and energy issues. They have banded together to set up a regional emissions control program, to expand production of biofuels and to cooperate on environmental and energy infrastructure projects, like an interstate pipeline for moving carbon emissions from power plants to underground storage vaults.
 Gov. James E. Doyle of Wisconsin, a Democrat who is chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association, said that the individual states in his region were all moving independently toward greater energy efficiency and planned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that it made sense to work in concert.
 ''In the absence of a federal plan we have to move forward,'' Mr. Doyle said, speaking from Milwaukee, where he was the chairman of an energy summit meeting of the Midwestern governors. ''On top of that, this recognizes that, federal plan or no federal plan, the Midwest is uniquely positioned to be a major force in the developing new energy world.''
 He predicted that sooner or later Washington would adopt a national cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, but he was not optimistic that it would act before President Bush leaves office.
 ''I suspect it will require a new administration to come in,'' he said. ''There's a lot of work to be done to prepare for it. If there comes a national cap-and-trade system, we will have done a lot of the work. If not, we will have one in the Midwestern region on a scale that can work.''

HEADLINE: Inter-Korean Talks Focus on Expanding Economic Cooperation

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
In the first meeting of their prime ministers in 15 years, North and South Korea on Wednesday discussed turning their disputed western sea border, the site of naval skirmishes as recently as five years ago, into a ''peace and cooperation zone'' for fishing and manufacturing. 
 The initiative, proposed by South Korea, was at the top of the agenda as the North Korean prime minister, Kim Yong-il, and his South Korean counterpart, Han Duck-soo, began three days of talks in Seoul, hoping to extend the spirit of reconciliation fostered by a summit meeting in October and North Korea's recent move to disable its nuclear weapons facilities. 
 Mr. Kim, a transportation expert, was promoted to prime minister in April, with a directive from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, to revive North Korea's moribund economy. 
 Last month, Prime Minister Kim visited Vietnam, which has normalized ties with the United States and has begun rebuilding its economy with foreign investment.
 South Korean hopes that North Korea will follow Vietnam's course soared in mid-October when Kim Jong-il reportedly told the visiting Vietnamese leader, Nong Duc Manh, the Communist Party secretary general, that he wanted to emulate Vietnam's policy of economic change. 
 North Korea ''is eager to see the Oct. 4 declaration implemented at an early date,'' Prime Minister Kim said Wednesday, referring to a broadly worded agreement between Kim Jong-il and President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea. The meeting on Wednesday was intended to follow up on the agreement. 
 At the summit meeting, the two leaders agreed to a number of joint economic projects. South Korea hopes to improve roads and railways in North Korea and build special economic zones so it can relocate some of its labor-intensive industries there. 
 Among other proposals, Mr. Han suggested an inter-Korean committee to build the ''peace and cooperation zone.'' That plan calls for creating a joint fishing zone along the disputed sea border, opening Haeju, a major naval base on North Korea's southwestern tip, for commercial ships from the South and building an industrial park there. 
 North Korean warships based at Haeju engaged in skirmishes with South Korean gunboats in 1999 and 2002. Persuading the two navies to pull back and turn the area into an economic zone would greatly ease tensions on the divided peninsula, which remains technically at war since the Korean War ended in 1953 with a truce, not a peace treaty. 
 It is unclear whether North Korea's military will try to block the latest initiative, as it has stymied previous reconciliation attempts, including a South Korean proposal to run trains across the border. The defense ministers of the two Koreas plan to meet this month in North Korea.
 The prime ministers also discussed proposals for building joint shipyards in North Korea and improving communications, transportation and other services for South Koreans working at a joint industrial zone in Kaesong, a North Korean border town near Haeju, where about 20,000 North Koreans already are producing clothes, kitchen utensils and watches in factories run by South Koreans.

HEADLINE: Fed to Share Its Thinking In Its Reports

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it would take some of the mystery out of its decision-making, disclosing far more information about its economic forecasts -- and, implicitly, about its objectives for growth and inflation. 
 Though the changes are incremental, analysts said they would open an important window into the Fed's thinking and would be a significant step in the central bank's slow evolution from obsessive secrecy toward openness.
 Starting this month, the Fed will publish its economic forecasts four times a year rather than just twice. More important, the forecasts will look three years into the future, instead of the current two, and will include considerable detail about the range of views among policy makers. 
 In practice, the three-year forecast will provide a guide for what policy makers want to accomplish and how they hope to do it. That is because the forecast represents what Fed officials expect will happen to the economy in response to ''appropriate'' monetary policy. In effect, the Fed will be publishing a game plan that it updates every three months. 
 ''I find it helpful to think of the projections as functioning in three different ways: as a forecast, as a provisional plan and as an evaluation of certain long-run features of the economy,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday in a speech at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization. 
 The changes are more modest than those Mr. Bernanke has long championed. He has argued for years that a central bank ought to announce an official ''inflation target'' that would be a basis for Fed policy.
 The announcement on Wednesday signaled a compromise among Fed policy makers, who have spent more than a year deliberating on how to improve communication with the public. 
 ''It actually marks the introduction of inflation-targeting lite,'' Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note to clients.
 That represents a significant departure from the practices of Alan Greenspan, who reigned over the Fed from 1987 to early 2006. 
 Mr. Greenspan staunchly opposed all proposals for ''inflation targeting,'' contending that explicit public commitments would limit the Fed's ability to respond nimbly to unexpected developments.
 Mr. Bernanke, a leading expert on monetary policy at Princeton University before he came to Washington, argued that an inflation target would make a central bank more open, more predictable and more accountable to the public. In the long run, he argued, greater openness would make monetary policy more effective.
 The changes announced Wednesday are the latest step in the Fed's slow but striking transformation toward openness. Until 1994, the Fed did not even announce its decisions to raise or lower interest rates; investors and journalists had to infer the decision by watching for changes in the overnight federal funds rate.
 It was only in 2000 that the Fed began issuing statements after every policy meeting about the balance of risks between higher inflation and slower growth. And it was not until 2002 that it published a roll call of how each member of the policy-setting committee voted. 
 The Fed is one of the few major central banks that does not announce a specific target for inflation. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada have adopted the practice in one form or another. 
 Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the Fed should have moved more decisively.
 ''If you are a big believer in transparency, which I am, it's incremental,'' Mr. Blinder said. ''If I had my druthers, the Fed would be giving out a forecast eight times a year.'' 
 But Mr. Bernanke announced other changes that could shed far more light on the Fed's internal debates. Starting with the next forecast, to be released Nov. 20 along with minutes from the last policy meeting, the Fed will include a detailed ''narrative'' about how policy makers see the forces that will be shaping the economy.
 As is the case now, the new forecasts will actually be a collection of forecasts from the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks and from the central bank's governors, who sit on the Federal Reserve Board. The so-called central tendency forecast is an amalgam of the highest and lowest estimates.
 But the new forecast will describe in more detail areas of uncertainty in the outlook. And it will include charts showing the exact distribution of policy makers' forecasts for growth, inflation and unemployment. It will also include a comparison between the current projections and those from the previous quarter.
 In a tacit acknowledgment of some critics, Mr. Bernanke also announced that the Fed's forecasts would include the overall rate of inflation, not just the core rate that excludes volatile prices for food and energy. 
 Fed officials have long argued that core inflation is a more meaningful measure of the true trend in inflation. But critics have said the core rate is meaningless to ordinary consumers, who have to grapple with the soaring costs of gasoline and food.

HEADLINE: The Governor in His Labyrinth

 BODY:
When Gov. Eliot Spitzer dropped his proposal to make driver's licenses available to undocumented immigrants yesterday, he sowed disappointment and anger among many of his supporters -- who felt, rightly, that they had been left holding the bag. His original plan to make highways safer and the state more secure was the right idea. But New York's embattled governor did not handle it properly, first waffling on his principles under pressure from the Bush administration, and then slowly recognizing that he was endangering the rest of his agenda by knocking over the hornet's nest that is the nation's immigration debate.
 If this debacle looks like a national smackdown for this governor, it is. However, it could also provide a very hard lesson for a very high-octane politician. Mr. Spitzer can either figure out how to operate the governor's office more skillfully for the next three years, or he can fail in his vital mission to reform and restart New York State. 
 The governor, whose poll numbers have gone from atmospheric to dismal, stands in a long line of politicians whose first terms often made them look like losers. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who this year was touted as presidential material, did so poorly in the polls early on that many people figured wrongly that even a billionaire couldn't buy a second term. After the mayor raised property taxes and whined about going to funerals after the 9/11 attacks, his polls dropped even lower than Mr. Spitzer's are now.
 President Clinton was barely inaugurated the first time around when commentators listed him as a political goner. Whatever he proposed in those early months, the news was about his suggestions for keeping gays in the military, and later his idea of an energy tax, which he advanced and then withdrew much the way Mr. Spitzer has done on driver's licenses. Democrats who supported Mr. Clinton -- at considerable political risk -- were furious and slow to give him back their trust.
 So, if history offers any lessons, it is that the test of this still-green governor is not how deep a hole he has dug for himself in his first year in office. It is whether he can figure out how to climb out of it. 
 Mr. Spitzer was elected by a sizable margin because New Yorkers wanted change in Albany. He came into office wielding that margin like an ax, moving ahead on education funding, health care and economic reform. Now, with little of that support remaining, he will need to move more pragmatically and diplomatically. 
 Part of the challenge is style, clearly. As one Spitzer supporter put it recently, it probably doesn't help the governor to assume battle-readiness every time an outsider walks into his office. Albany is full of politicians who would do anything to stop reform and to denigrate reformers like the governor, but there are plenty of politicians and regular people who simply disagree and want to be heard.
 Going forward, the governor needs to find wise voices and listen carefully to their counsel. They should not change his mission, of course, but refine his methods. And they should offer counterarguments, not help for his debating skills, which are already formidable. The idea would be to help Mr. Spitzer figure out in advance whether his instincts or timing are off. The governor deserves a brain trust in the manner of one of his predecessors, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
 Finally, Governor Spitzer needs to return to ground, to reconnect with the people who elected him. A speaking tour reminding people why they wanted him there might help. A listening tour could be even better.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Ties New Job Hopes to Old

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
This is the first television advertisement for Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential campaign, to run beginning today in New Hampshire.
 PRODUCER 08 Media 
 THE SCRIPT Mr. Giuliani says: ''New York City is the third- or fourth-largest government in the country. It's one of the largest economies in the United States. They used to call it unmanageable, ungovernable. A large majority of New Yorkers wanted to leave and live somewhere else. It was a city that was in financial crisis, a city that was the crime capital of America. A city that was the welfare capital of America. A city that was in very, very difficult condition when I became the mayor. By the time I left office, New York City was being proclaimed as the best example of conservative government in the country. We turned it into the safest large city in America, the welfare-to-work capital of America, and most importantly, the spirit of the people of the city had changed. Instead of being hopeless, the large majority of people had hope. So, I believe I've been tested in a way in which the American people can look to me. They're not going to find perfection, but they're going to find somebody who has dealt with crisis almost on a regular basis and has had results. And, in many cases, exceptional results. Results people thought weren't possible. I'm Rudy Giuliani, and I approve this message.'' 
 ON THE SCREEN The spot opens with colorful shots of the city: pedestrians, an elevated subway train, a row of yellow taxis. As Mr. Giuliani describes the condition of the city when he became mayor, black-and-white scenes appear: the decrepit marquee of a movie house and the words ''Sex World,'' helmeted riot police advancing toward a crowd. Then as Mr. Giuliani talks about his performance as mayor, the music swells and the screen fills with colorful scenes: children raising a flag; a couple gazing at the city from a rooftop. 
 ACCURACY While crime did drop sharply while Mr. Giuliani was mayor, there is considerable debate over how much credit he deserves. When he took office, his predecessor, Mayor David N. Dinkins, had already begun a $1 billion program to increase the ranks of police officers, and crime had begun to decline. During the Giuliani years, the crack cocaine epidemic was quieting down, and across the country, even cities with troubled police departments were seeing notable declines in crime. 
 SCORECARD The 60-second spot drives home the message Mr. Giuliani has emphasized on the stump: he took a liberal city with an ungovernable reputation and tamed it. His reference to ''not finding perfection'' addresses a major challenge of his candidacy: whether the baggage he carries from his personal life -- his socially liberal stances and his close relationships with people like Bernard B. Kerik, the former police commissioner who was indicted on federal charges last week -- will affect his viability as a candidate. JULIE BOSMAN

HEADLINE: Georgia's Future Looks Like More of the Past

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Educated in America, fluent in four languages and in the values of free-market democracies, Mikheil Saakashvili was supposed to have been different. When he was elected president of Georgia after a bloodless revolution in 2003, he was deemed a savior for the post-Soviet landscape, as if he had been conjured by a committee of Washington think tanks and European human rights groups.
 Yet this week, with Georgia under a state of emergency after his government quashed a large demonstration and violently shut an opposition television station, Mr. Saakashvili seemed, even in the eyes of some steadfast supporters, to be ruling with the willfulness of the very autocrats that he once so disdained. Was his true temperament showing, or had the burdens and realities of office somehow changed him? 
 Georgia has in recent years taken on a prominence far greater than its small size would otherwise merit, in large part because under Mr. Saakashvili, it had been considered a model for countries trying to shed decades of despotism and decay.
 Now, Mr. Saakashvili has begun to draw comparisons to a leader who has chosen a different path to lift his nation: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Georgia's neighbor, former overlord and, these days, frequent adversary. The Georgian government's announcement on Wednesday that it would cancel the state of emergency on Friday appeared unlikely to wipe away the stain on the reputation of Mr. Saakashvili, who is only 39 and is known as Misha.
 ''I think that Misha tends toward the authoritarian,'' said Scott Horton, a human rights lawyer in the United States who taught Mr. Saakashvili when he was a student at Columbia Law School in the mid-1990s, later hired him at a law firm in New York and has remained friendly with him. ''I would put it this way: there is a remarkable similarity between Misha and Putin, in terms of their attitudes about presidential prerogatives and authority,'' Mr. Horton said. Like Mr. Putin, he added, Mr. Saakashvili has marginalized Parliament and taken to belittling the opposition. 
 Mr. Horton said he did not believe that Georgia -- a former Soviet republic that lies in the Caucasus, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia -- was turning into a dictatorship or that Mr. Saakashvili was as harsh as Mr. Putin. Still, in Tbilisi and in the West, the question being debated among Mr. Saakashvili's allies was whether he had become another strongman in a region of them.

Bryza, a senior American diplomat who was here this week to try to persuade Mr. Saakashvili to lift the state of emergency, told reporters that he was sympathetic to the pressures that Mr. Saakashvili had to bear. But Mr. Bryza then went on to say that Mr. Saakashvili's closing of the opposition television station ''sent shock waves'' through Washington. 
 Washington had been a place where Mr. Saakashvili had thrived in recent years, becoming a regular on the policy speech circuit and in the halls of government. He was so popular among officials who wanted to hear of his successes -- the fight against corruption, the strong economic growth, the judicial reform -- that he joked that he could turn more heads walking through Congress than Britney Spears.
 In recent days, with characteristic brashness, Mr. Saakashvili has lashed back, contending that a fragile Georgian democracy was severely threatened by the opposition protests, that Russia was trying to destabilize the country and that the television station was advocating the overthrow of the government. The station, Imedi, remains closed, and officials said Wednesday that a court had pulled its license, responding to a request by prosecutors.
 The president noted that soon after he declared the state of emergency, he also called for early presidential elections in January, thereby ensuring that the opposition would have a chance to make its case.
 ''Before anyone starts discussing which eccentric, authoritarian or, what is more, dictatorial ruler the Georgian president resembles, I would like to remind you that I am the president of Georgia who is reducing his own first presidential term of his own free will,'' he said in a speech to the nation. ''And I am resorting to what is unprecedented in our region and in most of the world's countries.''
 Mr. Saakashvili's advisers said it was unfair to lob criticism from the West, where politicians and journalists of all stripes generally understood the importance of acting within certain boundaries to preserve democracy. In this rough part of the word, they said, political dirty tricks and intrigue are the norm. (Mr. Saakashvili has said the opposition has accused him of everything from murders to ''nearly eating babies.'')
 What is more, the advisers said, even as the government faces an irresponsible opposition, it is also grappling with two separatist regions on the Russian border that are receiving aid from Moscow and are always on the brink of stoking a full-blown armed conflict. ''It is more easy to see things in a stereotype way,'' said Giga Bokeria, a member of Parliament and a close ally of the president. ''Here is the president, he didn't like the demonstration, he cracked down, he closed the television stations he didn't like. That is the end of democracy. This is the comfortable position, but it is not the truth.''
 The opposition says Mr. Saakashvili has duped Georgians and Westerners into believing he was a democrat. Salome Zourabichvili, a former foreign minister in Mr. Saakashvili's government who has become an opposition leader, said Mr. Saakashvili was intolerant of criticism and unwilling to share power. ''Their attitude is, 'We are the majority and hence we know what are the good decisions, and we don't have to explain our decisions,''' she said. ''This is a very Bolshevik attitude of the mind. I am not saying that we are living in a Bolshevik country, but that is a mind-set that is the old style and not the democratic way of looking at things.''
 ''At least everybody knows what Putin is and nobody is mistaken about Putin,'' she said.
 But Mr. Bokeria called such views absurd.
 ''From a distance, with all of the propaganda machines against us, it looks very bad,'' he said. ''And it takes time to understand the sequence of events, the dynamic. But he is the same democrat as he was.''

HEADLINE: On Florida Coast, Addicts Find Home in an Oasis of Sobriety

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS; Terry Aguayo contributed reporting from Miami.

DATELINE: DELRAY BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
Whitney Tower, 56, a scion of the Whitney, Vanderbilt and Drexel fortunes, squandered his trust fund and sold family treasures to support a $1,000-a-day heroin habit before landing in a tough-love facility near here seven years ago and never leaving. ''If I went back to New York I'd be dead in two weeks,'' he said.
 In some ways Mr. Tower, who spent three decades in and out of treatment, remains a creature of his pedigree. He favors foppish linen suits and drops names of the fast crowd he once ran with. 
 But his social life these days is dinner at home with sober friends who have settled here in what experts consider the recovery capital of America. He is studying addiction counseling, and he works as an unpaid intern at a local drug treatment center. 
 Delray Beach, a funky outpost of sobriety between Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, is the epicenter of the country's largest and most vibrant recovery community, with scores of halfway houses, more than 5,000 people at 12-step meetings each week, recovery radio shows, a recovery motorcycle club and a coffeehouse that boasts its own therapy group.
 Recovery communities are springing up outside the walls of rehab centers for alumni seeking the safety in numbers.
 The prototype community is in Minnesota, near the Hazelden clinic. But recovering substance abusers are also sinking roots in Arizona, Southern California and the Gold Coast of Florida -- places with more sizzle and better weather. Lindsay Lohan spoke hopefully of finding eternal rehab in the Wasatch mountains of Utah, near Provo, where some graduates of her latest drug treatment center have moved.
 Delray Beach is in a class by itself, experts say, because of its compact geography and critical mass of recovering addicts who cross paths daily in the shops and bistros along Atlantic Avenue. They fly beneath the radar of tourists oblivious to telltale signs of addiction, like unapologetic chain smoking. But they see one another everywhere: 
 On the patio at Starbucks, reading the ''Big Book,'' the bible of Alcoholics Anonymous. At the Longhorn restaurant, pushing tables together for Friday night gatherings. At the Crossroads Club, the headquarters for 115 12-step meetings a week, where gossip is of romance between recovering addicts, overdoses, suicides and friends who have successfully moved back home.
 ''This community is one big helping hand that is always open,'' said Mike Devane, a new halfway house owner, who lost his job and family in New Jersey before coming south five years ago to get sober. 
 This society-within-a-society gets mixed reviews from addiction experts. A few find it insular and cultish. ''Cutting off contact with the outside world, is that a sign of mental health?'' asked Stanton Peele, a psychologist and author who challenges much conventional wisdom in the field.
 But many more experts note that a recovery community like Delray Beach may provide a promising environment for certain addicts. While such communities have not been studied, there is consensus that substance abuse is a chronic and relapsing disease, comparable to diabetes or high blood pressure. It thus requires permanent lifestyle changes that may be easier in a new environment. Relapse rates range from 90 percent, for short treatment programs with no follow-up care, to 40 percent when treatment is comprehensive and long-lasting. 
 And even then, new research shows that sustained addiction can lead to changes in the brain that make relapse all but inevitable, experts say. Success, for those entrenched addicts, is measured by longer and more productive periods of sobriety and shorter and less damaging periods of substance abuse. 
 A. Thomas McLellan, director of the Treatment Research Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, said the way to judge the wisdom of retreating to a bubble of sobriety like Delray Beach was to ask: ''Where were they before? This may be their best available option.'' 
 Harold Jonas, 52, kicked a heroin habit two decades ago in this beachfront city, far from his native Philadelphia, and decided to stay. He married a fellow addict, raised a family, earned a doctorate and opened a halfway house for substance abusers making the transition from residential care to independent living. 
 Steadily, Dr. Jonas and his wife, Dawn, expanded their cottage industry. They organized an association of halfway house owners and opened KoffeeOkee, the coffeehouse-karaoke bar.
 Mr. Devane was among 20 Delray Beach residents who gathered at the cafe one recent night for a weekly counseling session. One ''normie'' -- their word for the 65,000 year-round town folk -- wandered in unawares and was allowed to stay. First-timers sat at the periphery of the circle, avoiding eye contact with others. 
 But Jeannie Saros, a onetime addict and now a therapist who sees private patients in a cottage behind KoffeeOkee, soon had everyone sharing closely guarded secrets. One admitted resuming a ''sick relationship'' with a drug-abusing lover. Another, although sober, said she continued to steal from friends. Mr. Devane, his voice a whisper, confessed to having been a bad father. 
 Many here have lost custody of their children. Among them is Jennifer Boeth Whipple, 53, a journalist who arrived in the clutches of alcoholism in 1998. Ms. Whipple said she ''took to heart'' -- during her third effort at rehabilitation -- ''that some people have to change their lives completely to maintain sobriety.'' 
 So she stuck around, following a carefully phased program, known as the Florida Model, from residential treatment to a halfway house and a ''recovery job'' at Home Depot. Eventually she bought a condominium and worked for an art dealer.
 For six years, Ms. Whipple said, she ''felt very safe here, surrounded by people who'd been through what I'd been through'' -- detoxing in the same roach-infested apartments, cycling through recovery centers familiar to New Yorkers, like Silver Hill or Four Winds. 
 Then a year ago, ''after I'd gotten my sea legs,'' Ms. Whipple returned to New York City, where her son lives with his father. All is well, she said, except she is lonely. She talks to her friends often. ''At times,'' Ms. Whipple said, ''Florida still beckons.'' 
 It is difficult to count the recovery population here because only residential treatment beds are licensed by the state. As of Nov. 1, almost 3,500 people were being treated as in-patients in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade Counties in southeastern Florida, by far the largest concentration in the state.
 Halfway houses, by contrast, are unregulated. But Dr. Jonas said there were about 1,200 halfway house beds in this city alone. With rent averaging $175 a week, these businesses generate almost $11 million a year. 
 Low-wage jobs for people in recovery are plentiful in a tourist economy. Recovering addicts make smoothies at Ben and Jerry's, and sell housewares at Crate and Barrel. Among the current worker bees are an executive chef and a professional baseball player, both busing tables.
 ''Just about every business in town has at least one of us, whether they know it or not,'' said Susan Miller, sober for 13 years and executive director of the Crossroads Club, command central for newcomers seeking meetings, housing, transportation -- for those with too many D.W.I.'s to drive -- and legal help. 
 Typically modest bungalows, halfway houses provide structure and supervision -- curfews, random urine tests, the requirement that tenants have jobs and attend meetings. Still, unscrupulous owners prey on tenants by ''flipping'' the same bed, insisting on several months' rent up front, then evicting someone for rules violations and re-renting the room. Some owners also put rule-breakers out on the curb, with no alternative housing, which can lead to crime and an outcry from neighborhood homeowners.
 A movement to ban halfway houses in residential neighborhoods has so far been unsuccessful, with courts ruling that such restrictions violate the Americans with Disability Act. The association of halfway-house owners is trying self-regulation, and its members are required to find a placement for an evicted tenant, often at a discounted rate in a motel Dr. Jonas owns.
 A bigger concern, said Detective Gary Martin in the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, is drug overdoses -- 218 in 2006 and 241 during the first nine months of 2007. ''I consider close to one overdose every 36 hours a big problem,'' Detective Martin said.
 The overdoses highlight the high risk of relapse. Indeed, even owners of halfway houses fall off the wagon, leaving tenants like Katrina W., 28, clean for a few months of a heroin and crack cocaine addition, suddenly in charge. One resident, testing Katrina's limits, came home smoking crack and blew smoke in her face. Katrina got the resident out without incident and managed to hold on to her fragile sobriety.
 Sobriety is the tightrope addicts walk, even years into recovery. Claire Condon arrived here at age 19, a six-foot beauty withered to 100 pounds by heroin. But in Delray Beach she got sober, got a modeling job, a ''normie'' boyfriend, a condominium and two dogs. 
 Then, a year ago, at age 27, everything unraveled. Ms. Condon battled depression, smoked marijuana to take the edge off her misery, then upgraded to cocaine and OxyContin. She text messaged friends from recovery, urging them to stay away. 
 ''I didn't want to be a tornado in their lives,'' she said. ''But every time they heard someone died, they thought it was me.''
 Ms. Condon resumed treatment, however, and returned to her regular meetings at the Crossroads Club. Back at Square 1, she still hopes to leave here one day. She misses the mountains and the seasons of Connecticut.
 ''That's my goal,'' Ms. Condon said. ''But what pulls on my heart is the people here, the connections I made at a time of desperation.''

PERSON: Clara Fox 

HEADLINE: Clara Fox, Tireless Advocate for Subsidized Housing, Is Dead at 90

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Clara Fox, an advocate of subsidized housing for poor and moderate-income people and the founder of the Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit organization that now houses 2,200 families in 44 buildings in New York City, died on Nov. 9 in Manhattan.
 She was 90 and lived in Manhattan Plaza, the twin-towered complex on West 42nd Street that she helped save from bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. 
 The cause was kidney failure, said Carol Lamberg, the current director of the Settlement Housing Fund, who succeeded Mrs. Fox in January 1983.
 Mrs. Fox formed the Settlement Housing Fund in 1969 by bringing together housing experts from 35 settlement houses, the neighborhood agencies created in the first decades of the 20th century to aid newly arriving immigrants. And though she retired from the organization as its founding executive director, she never stopped advocating for affordable housing. 
 Until her death, she remained co-chairwoman of the New York Housing Conference, a coalition of more than 70 organizations representing developers, bankers, architects, housing advocates and owners of nonprofit buildings. Among other activities, the group, an affiliate of the National Housing Conference, lobbies the government on housing policy. 
 ''Clara originated the idea of combining low- and moderate-income housing with social programs,'' said Conrad Egan, the president of the national conference. When rental buildings were converted to cooperatives in the 1960s under a New York State subsidy program, Mr. Egan said, Mrs. Fox was the first to train former renters in how to manage co-ops.
 Ms. Lamberg said: ''Clara was one of the first people who advocated for low-income cooperatives. She was also one of the first to bring together social agencies and housing groups to work for better housing. Now there are all kinds of nonprofit groups that create and sustain affordable housing. She had a lasting effect.''
 Clara Leon was born in the Bronx on May 10, 1917, a daughter of Ralph and Lillian Frankel Leon. She graduated from the University of Chicago, then earned a master's degree in sociology there. Her marriage to William Fox ended in divorce in 1950. She is survived by her daughter, Roberta Fox, of Manhattan, and a sister, Florence Blank, of the Bronx.
 In the early 1960s, Mrs. Fox, who had been the director of a private nursery school, became New York City's first coordinator of Head Start, the federally sponsored program that provided eight weeks of education and social enrichment for prekindergarten children from poor families. After leaving Head Start in 1965, Mrs. Fox was asked to become housing coordinator for United Neighborhood Houses, the organization of 35 settlement houses that four years later established the Settlement Housing Fund.
 ''Clara was very proud of putting together the plan that saved Manhattan Plaza,'' Ms. Lamberg said.
 Built by a major developer in the mid-1970s, Manhattan Plaza, a complex of 1,688 apartments in two towers between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, was supposed to house middle-income renters. By the time the buildings were completed, Times Square was squalid and inflation was in the double digits. With few renters, Manhattan Plaza faced default.
 The city wanted to turn it into a low-income project, a plan opposed by Broadway theater owners. Mrs. Fox led a committee that came up with an alternative: Manhattan Plaza would house performing artists, theater workers and community residents receiving federal rent subsidies. Those who could afford it -- later to include Mrs. Fox -- would pay market-rate rents.
 In 1983, because of her work on the plan, Mrs. Fox was named an honorary member of Actors' Equity, the professional actors' and stage managers' union.
 On her retirement from the Settlement Housing Fund, Mrs. Fox told The New York Times: ''The thing I feel strongest about is the incredible indifference that seems to exist in government about what's happening to subsidized housing. We have done worse than any other social program, and what we hear from Congressional representatives is there is no constituency in Washington for low-income housing.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Friday about Clara Fox, a leading advocate of subsidized housing, misstated the location of Manhattan Plaza, the housing development where she lived. It is between 9th and 10th Avenues, not 8th and 9th.

HEADLINE: Getting Lost in History in the Other Las Vegas

BYLINE: By STEVEN TALBOT

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS, N.M., laid claim to its name about 70 years before that upstart neon metropolis sprang out of the sands of Nevada -- and it shows. With only about 14,000 people, this Las Vegas has 900 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places, four grand old hotels (two still accepting guests), and not one but two period-piece downtowns. 
 Its Old West credentials are solid. Doc Holliday had a dentist's office in town, and Billy the Kid hung out there. Teddy Roosevelt recruited some of his Rough Riders in Las Vegas and spent a not-so-rough stay at the local hot-springs castle. And before that, this was a stop on the Santa Fe Trail.
 Las Vegas's ill fortune in the 20th century is its good fortune in the 21st. Because the economy collapsed in the early part of the 1900s, no one was tearing down old buildings to make way for new ones. Now many buildings have been restored, but Las Vegas hasn't been covered in stucco in an attempt to adobify it, and tourists are only beginning to trickle in. Take a trip there, and you can get lost in the history and the architecture. 
 You won't literally get lost, however, if you wander the town's nine historic districts with the smart brochure and map published by the Las Vegas Citizens' Committee for Historic Preservation. You can knock about town in an afternoon, to skim a bit of the flavor, or settle in for a weekend or a few days to get to know the city and its surroundings.
 As you admire a stepped parapet on this building or the brickwork on that one, expect to rub elbows with locals -- shoppers pulling up to the drugstore in their pickup trucks; business types, more often in jeans than in suits, on coffee break; the occasional car bellowing music at stop signs. This is a real working town. 
 Las Vegas was once two separate places. Old Town, founded in 1835 by Spanish settlers, fans out from a central plaza and was modestly prosperous in the days of the Santa Fe Trail. On South Pacific Street, adobe structures, one room wide and more than 130 years old, still hug the sidewalk, well-kept residences to this day. 
 In 1879 the railroad arrived, and New Town popped up. ''The railroad blew everything open,'' Ernest Quintana, a lifelong resident of the area and chairman of the preservation committee, said over a cup of coffee at Charlie's Spic & Span Bakery and Cafe. A wave of non-Spanish immigrants laid out a grid of streets and parks reminiscent of Eastern cities and built block after maple-and-elm-shaded block of Victorian houses that still remain -- Queen Anne, Italianate, Georgian Revival or mixed styles, colored peach, blue, yellow and orange, vibrant yet slightly weathered. 
 ''Basically, this place was where different people under Manifest Destiny met,'' Mr. Quintana said. 
 Las Vegas boomed. Ornately trimmed two- and three-story commercial buildings went up on both sides of town, creating the two western Victorian downtowns a half-dozen or so blocks apart. ''For the new visitor, what really boggles the mind is that all of these fantastic buildings happened in a quarter of a century,'' Mr. Quintana said. ''You have to imagine the amount of money that was here.''
 A good place to start a tour is the Railroad Avenue Historic District. The city's visitors center is in the restored brick depot, built in 1898, where Amtrak still stops. Next door is La Castaneda, a Mission Revival hotel that was once a jewel in the Harvey House chain. The arched brick porticoes remain sturdy and the grass and shrubs are trimmed, but some first-floor windows are boarded up and just a small section of the hotel is open today, as a bar. If it's open, stop inside for a sense of the hotel's former grandeur.
 A few blocks away is New Town's downtown, centered on Douglas and Sixth Streets. Two of its buildings -- the Richardsonian Romanesque-style Masonic Temple, built in the 1890s and now with an antiques shop on the first floor, and the neo-Classical Bank of Las Vegas -- were designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Rapp and Rapp. Nearby, the El Fidel Hotel was built in the early 1920s and is still a good place to stay.
 Stroll into the Spic & Span, a never-empty diner, for a glazed doughnut or a burrito: one employee may be whipping up a cappuccino while another is making a fresh tortilla. And close by, drop in at the Las Vegas Museum/Rough Rider Memorial Collection, a good place to find out more about the history of the town.
 In Old Town, the three-story brick Plaza Hotel, renovated in 1982, a century after it was built, stands on one side of the original plaza. Inside, a grand wooden staircase leads to the 37 guest rooms. Guests mingle with locals in the hotel's Landmark Grill.
 On another corner of the plaza, festive blankets, shawls and scarves lie on tables, and patterned rugs hang from a stone wall at the Tapetes de Lana weaving center. Local weavers make the store's wares from wool that has been spun and dyed in a nearby town, some working at the center's own looms (most mornings, visitors are invited to watch) and others in their homes. 
 ''We bring in individuals from the community who are low income,'' said Teresa Victor, whose mother, Carla Gomez, founded the center. ''We train them to weave and then give them a loom and materials.'' Scarves sell for $45, shawls for $125 and rugs range from $95 to $4,800. 
 Elsewhere on the plaza and nearby Bridge Street, galleries and shops sell painted carved wooden images of saints called santos, books (check out the store called Tome on the Range), herbal products and treatments, and standard souvenirs like mugs and T-shirts.
 Five miles northwest of town is Las Vegas's grandest old hotel by far, an eye-popping Queen Anne-style structure called Montezuma Castle. The railroad built a spur there in 1882, drawn by a hot spring on the site, and twice a hotel went up and then burned to the ground. The current building, designed by the Chicago architects John Root and Daniel Burnham, is the third. 
 The Montezuma became a stop for the rich and famous, but its popularity peaked in the 1890s. It was vacant when the Armand Hammer Foundation bought the property in 1981 to be the American campus of United World Colleges, a London-based institution with 12 campuses worldwide. The school grew up on the land and now has 200 students, but the castle remained empty until a restoration and renovation was completed in 2001. It is now used for campus housing and socializing and houses an international conflict resolution center. On selected Saturdays, students lead tour groups into the spacious dining room, updated with two serpent-like Dale Chihuly glass sculptures; the ash-paneled lobby; and other public and private rooms. 
 Down the hill, the hot springs -- the original draw -- are still open. There's little formality -- you're on your own; there are no attendants. Just make sure you wear a bathing suit as you bask in one of the concrete tubs.
 Las Vegas is on the edge of two ecosystems, nestled where the Sangre de Cristo Mountains meet the Great Plains. East of town, at a national wildlife refuge used by 250 species of migrating or nesting birds, an eight-mile loop drive winds past ponds, marshes, grasslands, brush thickets and cottonwood groves. A half-mile hike leads into a box canyon that is home to prairie falcons and cliff swallows. 
 Looking back toward Las Vegas from the refuge, the rounded humps of Hermit's Peak dominate the sky behind the town. Tilt your head to the left, and the peak forms a profile of a face, peering skyward. This mountain -- in the mid-1800s the home of a real hermit, who dug out a cave and moved in -- offers a good, challenging day hike. 
 The 9.5-mile trail rises to an elevation of 10,160 feet from 7,520 feet, and the view from the top is vast -- mountains in one direction and in the other, the Gallinas River snaking down a canyon into town. In front of you, miles and miles of grasslands spread out, probably looking much as they did when the wagon trains and the railroad arrived to put Las Vegas on the map. 
 Traveling the Santa Fe Trail
 The Las Vegas tour guide published by the Citizens' Committee for Historic Preservation (505-425-8803; www.lasvegasnmcchp.com) is available at its offices at 127 Bridge Street or at the Las Vegas Visitor Center (500 Railroad Avenue; 505-425-3707). 
 The Plaza Hotel (230 Plaza, 505-425-3591) has 37 rooms for $69 to $149. Its Landmark Grill offers special menus each month; this month it's comfort food. A filet mignon dinner is $22.95.
 The El Fidel Hotel (500 Douglas Avenue, 505-425-6761), built in Spanish Colonial Revival style in the 1920s, has 18 rooms for $45 to $85. 
 At Charlie's Spic & Span Bakery and Cafe (715 Douglas Avenue; 505-426-1921), try the huevos rancheros, $6.99, or chicken sopapilla, $7.99. 
 For a close-up view of the Montezuma Castle, call United World College (505-454-4200) for advance permission to enter the property, or to register for a tour. The nearby hot spring is freely accessible; tubs are off Route 65 just north of the college. 
 The trailhead for Hermit's Peak is in the El Porvenir campground, about 15 miles outside Las Vegas off Route 65.

 CORRECTION:
A map with the American Journeys column last Friday about Las Vegas, N.M., gave the incorrect location for Montezuma Castle, part of the American campus of United World Colleges. It is on Highway 65 six miles west of Las Vegas, not east of the town.

 Broadway
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Ben Brantley) 
 'THE NEW MEL BROOKS MUSICAL YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN' This tiring adaptation of Mr. Brooks's 1974 movie, directed by Susan Stroman and starring an amiable but overwhelmed Roger Bart, never seems to stop screeching at you. This means that: a) it soon wears out its voice, and b) it leaves you with a monster-size headache (2:45). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse, and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs. (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'BINGO WITH THE INDIANS' Ideas and actors ricochet around the stage in Adam Rapp's chaotic yet intriguing dark comedy about a theater group planning to steal money from a bingo game (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Tribeca, (212) 352-3101. (Caryn James)
 'CRIME AND PUNISHMENT' The novel every high school student dreads is somehow made compelling (and short!) in this three-actor production by the Writers' Theater of Chicago. John Judd is outstanding as the inspector who patiently waits out poor Raskolnikov (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: RUDE AWAKENING' The 25th-anniversary version of Gerard Alessandrini's invaluable index to current American musicals has priceless moments (especially its parody of the hot-and-bothered antics of ''Spring Awakening''). But it's also a sobering reminder that even an inspired satirist can be defeated by emaciated targets (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FRANKENSTEIN' This dreary musical slog through the Mary Shelley novel, with an ill-used Hunter Foster in the title role, is not to be confused with the uptown spoof from Mel Brooks. It won't be (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)
 'FUERZABRUTA' A sensory bath aimed at clubgoing college kids in search of cultural diversion. Thumping techno music, smoke and a standing throng surround you as you watch a curious collection of semi-spectacular technical feats (1:05). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'THE GLORIOUS ONES' An energetic new musical by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens about a commedia dell'arte troupe in which bawdy shenanigans of yore are combined with the sweet sentiments of traditional American musical comedy. It's like a whoopee cushion that emits a wistful sigh (1:40). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'HAMLET' The Wooster Group's sometimes ravishing, often numbing homage to a fabled theatrical event: Richard Burton on Broadway as the Prince of Denmark in 1964. Juxtaposing a film of the performance with live actors, who replicate the on-screen action, the production teeters between hypnotic and narcotic. Elizabeth LeCompte directs (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8750. (Brantley) 
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'MY FIRST TIME' Ken Davenport's venture into Web-theater synergy mines a site called MyFirstTime.com to cull stories of inaugural encounters with sex. Four actors deliver the anecdotes in what amounts to little more than a crassly commercial effort to replicate the success of ''The Vagina Monologues'' (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Ginia Bellafante)
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'PETER AND JERRY' A beautifully acted double bill of linked plays by Edward Albee, ''Zoo Story'' and ''Homelife,'' written more than 40 years apart, that confirm his enduring and unparalleled skills in exploring the feral soul beneath civilized skins. Pam MacKinnon directs the top-flight cast: Johanna Day, Bill Pullman and Dallas Roberts. (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 
 'THE RECEPTIONIST' The ever-wonderful Jayne Houdyshell answers phones, gossips and gives motherly advice in an office where disturbing work is afoot. Adam Bock's play, essentially a gloss on the ''Twilight Zone'' formula, is a zippy hour and change of comedy and suspense (1:10). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center, Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. 
 (Isherwood) 
 'SIVE' The Irish Rep throws itself away on this clunky 1959 melodrama about a schoolgirl married off to a rich old man (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (James) 
 'SPEECH AND DEBATE' Stephen Karam's modest dark comedy about three misfit high school students, which includes a singing, dancing tribute to ''The Crucible,'' is funny, cliche-free and brilliantly performed (1:45). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (James) 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.
 (Genzlinger) 
 Off Off Broadway
 'HAMLET' A mere description is probably all you need to know whether this production is for you: a shortened ''Hamlet'' performed by marionettes on a working carousel. The best moments in this show by the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater come near the end, once the killing starts; the carousel's inescapable round-and-round begins to make sense. Clifton Hyde's live music is also a high point (1:15). Jane's Carousel, 56 Water Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 Extravaganzas
 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS: CELEBRATE!' An occasion to celebrate (2:15). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. 
 (Lawrence Van Gelder) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'THE FANTASTICKS' The Little Musical That Wouldn't Die redux (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' P. L. Travers meets Dr. Phil (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 
 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 Last Chance
 'CROSSING BROOKLYN' The events of Sept. 11 still resist easy synthesis into the stuff of life and art; this musical about two teachers coping with post-traumatic stress demonstrates this both deliberately and by example. The music, by Jenny Giering, often manages to create the jagged, nervous energy of the post-9/11 world, but the book, by Laura Harrington, lapses into formulas (will the character of Des confront what happened on that day? will she and her husband be reconciled through his own interaction with an equally traumatized student?), and the piece, even despite the good direction of Jack Cummings III, has more rough edges than its creators might have intended (1:40). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Anne Midgette) 
 'DRUM OF THE WAVES OF HORIKAWA' What happens when you cross punk with Kabuki? In this production, directed by Brooke O'Harra, you get something loud (duh), lively and exploratory that is also something of a mishmash. The music, by the talented Brendan Connelly, is consistently interesting. But the play, an adaptation of a 1705 Monzaemon Chikamatsu work, seems more burlesqued than illuminated by its encounter with punk. Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'A GLANCE AT NEW YORK' Axis Company's daffy resurrection of this lowbrow stage work from 1848 seems, at 50 minutes, to go by in a heartbeat, and when it's over, you'll have no sense of what made the play so popular way back when. But you'll have been entertained by the company's assaultive delivery. The story involves a rube who comes to New York and is fleeced repeatedly, and a fireman named Mose who punches people (1:00). The Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 
 'MILK-N-HONEY' This frequently entertaining primer on food politics is partly fiction and partly based on interviews with people like farmers, Dumpster divers and food chemists. The show has an appealing sense of mission, but it too earnestly wants to convince us that we are prisoners of American consumerism. On the plus side, you get candy (1:25). 3LD Art and Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 388-7371; closes on Sunday. (Saltz) 'ODE TO THE MAN WHO KNEELS' Richard Maxwell, one of the few truly original theater auteurs to emerge from the past decade, has created a bleak, droll and strangely beautiful musical about cowboys and the women who hurt them (1:15). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 966-3651; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 
 'OHIO STATE MURDERS' LisaGay Hamilton plays the alter ego of the playwright Adrienne Kennedy in this short, sharp, hypnotic play about the specter of racism blighting the life of a college girl in the 1950s. A rare chance to encounter one of the most distinctive American voices of the last half-century (1:05). Theater for a New Audience at the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 
 '1001' This contemporary, kaleidoscopic gloss on the ''1001 Nights'' tales is lively but lacks freshness (1:50). The Nagelberg Theater at the Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (James)
 'THE OXFORD ROOF CLIMBERS REBELLION' An excellent play about two famous soldier-scholars -- T. E. Lawrence and Robert Graves -- and their disillusionment with the British establishment over World War I, particularly the government's attempts to ennoble the slaughter known as the Great War. Although set in Oxford University in 1920, the play is as timely as today's newspaper (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) 
 'SPAIN' Jim Knable's wobbly fantasy stars Annabella Sciorra as an abandoned wife working through her emotional problems in an unusually colorful way. She dreams up a conquistador, played with savory wit by Michael Aronov, to give her tips on getting through life's battles (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: Signs of Slump at Gem Sale in Myanmar

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Officially, the government-sponsored gem auction that opened this week in Myanmar is a success, with 2,667 traders browsing the country's renowned rubies, jade, sapphires, and other precious stones, the New Light of Myanmar, a state-run newspaper, reported Thursday.
 ''More merchants will arrive,'' the newspaper predicted. 
 But dealers and a trader based in Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital, say sales of precious stones -- a financial lifeline for the nation's cash-strapped economy -- are slumping. They say the gem exposition and auction in Yangon, the first since the junta's suppression of popular protests drew international criticism and the threat of United Nations Security Council sanctions, has been unusually quiet.
 ''Business is very slow, not like before,'' U Kyaw, a gem merchant in Yangon, said by phone. 
 The threat of sanctions by the United States and European Union that would prohibit the import of Burmese gemstones has dented dealers' confidence, which could prove a serious problem for the junta that has ruled Myanmar, formerly Burma, for 18 years. Last year, the gem trade generated $296.9 million for the state-run Myanmar Gems Enterprise, the third-largest revenue earner for the military government after fossil fuels and timber. 
 Adisak Thawornviriyanan, director of the Gems and Jewelry Traders Association of Chanthaburi, a province east of Bangkok that is a center for cutting and polishing Burmese gems, has taken part in the gem auctions for the past four years but decided not to attend this one.
 ''We will wait and see if we can sell our old stock, but I wouldn't dare buy more,'' Mr. Adisak said. ''We don't know how strong the U.S. ban will be.''
 Cartier of Paris joined Tiffany and Signet last month when it banned Burmese gems.
 Jewelers of America, which represents about a third of the jewelry shops, announced Oct. 9 that it was backing the tougher ban on Burmese gems being considered by the United States.
 A bill in Congress seeks to close a loophole that allows the import of Burmese gems polished or cut in a third country. It was passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month and awaits approval by the Ways and Means Committee before going to the full House. A Senate bill is in committee. 
 Rubies are the most popular Burmese gem in the United States, with official imports of $87.4 million in 2006, mostly via Thailand, the main trading and polishing center for Burmese colored stones. Unofficial imports are probably much higher.
 Should Congress pass the bill, as seems likely, countries like Japan and China might make up some of the lost sales, said Sean Turnell, an expert on the Burmese economy with Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Smuggling will also mitigate the boycott and trade curbs, he said. But he predicted that a decline in demand from the United States and European Union would cause Burmese gem prices to drop.
 The boycotts could also make it harder for generals and Burmese business executives to move their assets out of the country. In the absence of a stable currency and with restrictions on holding dollars in Myanmar, ''gems perform a very important function in moving personal assets around the deck,'' Mr. Turnell said.
 The boycotts and threat of sanctions have spawned a passionate but familiar debate over whether the measures influence governments. 
 ''If the U.S. and the E.U. were to cease buying all Burmese gemstones, I think it would take a huge chunk out of the regime's pocket,'' said Brian Leber, a jeweler based near Chicago who is leading lobbying efforts to halt all imports of Burmese gems.
 Critics of sanctions say they will hurt those Burmese miners who earn their money independently from the government, often by smuggling gems to Thailand.
 ''This is going to be absolutely devastating to the people that deal with gems,'' said Edward Boehm, vice president of the International Colored Gemstone Association. ''Most of the mining that is done is artisanal and falls out of the radar of the government.''
 Mr. Leber said the biggest beneficiary of the gem trade is the military-controlled government.
 ''There's an argument that this is only hurting the little people,'' he said. ''There really aren't little people who have direct control over things in the gem industry.''
 How accurately gems can be identified as being of Burmese origin has sparked debate. Mr. Leber and other gem experts says rubies can be identified by chemical signatures.
 But Henry Ho, a jeweler in Bangkok who has long dealt in Burmese gems, says ultimately gem trading is based on trust.
 ''Only God and the miner know where the gems come from,'' Mr. Ho said. ''God doesn't speak to you, and the miner will lie about it.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose 0.3% in October, as Expected

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Inflation remains contained despite high oil prices and a record low dollar, a government report showed yesterday, offering some reassurance to the Federal Reserve as it considers whether to lower interest rates again at its meeting next month.
 But economists warned that sharp increases in food and energy costs will weigh on consumers in the coming months, putting a damper on spending in other parts of the economy. 
 Still, the Consumer Price Index for October was in line with analysts' expectations. Market watchers deemed it a benign report -- increasingly a rarity in an economic environment that grows more volatile by the day. 
 Consumer prices grew 0.3 percent last month, holding steady from September, the Labor Department said. The closely watched core index, which excludes the prices of food and energy products, which vary greatly, rose just 0.2 percent for the fifth consecutive month. 
 Core inflation has risen 2.2 percent over the last 12 months, a slightly faster pace than the Fed would like but far from a sign of imminent price pressures. Lower interest rates can stimulate the economy but lead to rising prices, leaving the Fed wary of any inflation threats.
 ''There's been a lot of concern in the marketplace and in the business press about the dollar and high commodity prices feeding into core inflation and causing a problem for the Fed,'' said Zach Pandl, an economist at Lehman Brothers. ''Those concerns are pretty much overstated, and I think that was confirmed in the report.''
 Indeed, the mild inflation numbers -- coupled with the Producer Price Index, which showed on Wednesday that prices were contained at the producer level as well -- signal that higher commodity costs have not yet entered the broader economy. Crude oil futures dipped 66 cents yesterday, to settle at $93.43 a barrel in New York.
 Slower price growth leaves room for the Fed to lower interest rates, if it wants, although central bankers have hinted in recent remarks that they were inclined to hold rates steady at their next meeting on Dec. 11.
 But some economists were wary that consumers will still feel a squeeze over the holidays, potentially hurting businesses. Increases in food and beverage prices, for instance, are at their highest annual rate in nearly 17 years. The price of gasoline rose 1.4 percent in October. 
 ''Lower- to middle-income households are having to pay these higher costs for foods and energy,'' said Richard F. Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential in Austin, Tex. ''That clearly cuts down their ability for discretionary spending.''
 With the housing market in recession and the recent declines in the stock market, many analysts have painted a bleak economic picture for the fourth quarter.
 Still, if there is a drastic downturn in the economy over the next few weeks, low inflation could placate the hawks on the Fed's board of governors. Investors who bet on the Fed's actions predict a quarter-point cut in its benchmark overnight lending rate after next month's meeting. 
 ''This report gives them the latitude to do whatever they think is necessary,'' Mr. Moody said, referring to the Fed.
 Over all, the Consumer Price Index is up 3.5 percent over the last year, its fastest annual pace in 14 months. Soaring energy prices account for most of that gain, and the 12-month figure may be misleading since inflation dipped last fall. 
 There was also some cheerful news for consumers. Home payments and rent, which make up more than half of the index, rose only 0.2 percent, keeping pace with previous months. Clothing costs were unchanged from September and have decreased 1.2 percent in the last 12 months.
 The mixed report left some economists feeling a little ambivalent. ''You can kind of make it say whatever you want it to say,'' Mr. Moody said.
 Another report from the Labor Department showed that first-time claims for jobless benefits rose 20,000, to 339,000, last week.
 A separate report yesterday showed that manufacturing activity in New York State slowed slightly in November. But analysts had expected a sharp drop in the index, which is measured by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Shipments nudged up and inventories fell, sending the index to 27.37 after a 28.75 reading in October, a three-year high.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Seeking a Top Niche in Global Finance

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Years ago, Japan rose to economic prominence by taking apart American products like cars and television sets to learn how to make them better. 
 Now, as Japan's focus on manufacturing wanes, economic planners here are trying to reverse engineer another source of the United States' economic strength: Wall Street.
 Japan's Financial Services Agency, which oversees the nation's banking and securities industries, is working on a plan, to be presented before the end of the year, aimed at transforming Tokyo into a global financial capital more on par with New York and London. Top Japanese officials have toured Wall Street and the City, London's financial district, in search of the secrets of their vitality.
 But so far, the initial drafts suggest that Japan's economic specialists are having trouble figuring out the secret of the Western financial centers' success. 
 The Japanese government is also seeking ways to maintain Tokyo as the financial capital of Asia, and to keep ahead of rivals like Hong Kong, Singapore and even Mumbai, formerly Bombay. Officials here hope that the plan will attract more foreign investors and help revive their country's stock markets, which have underperformed other major markets, even after the turmoil in subprime lending hurt American and European financial institutions.
 The plan comes as Japan's $4.5 trillion economy is on the rebound. In the most recent quarter, it grew at a solid annual pace of 2.6 percent.
 But for many years, the Japanese, rather than investing more at home, have been putting their money overseas because of the low returns from domestic stocks and bonds. Some of that flow of money abroad now appears to be slowing, a move reflected in a stronger Japanese yen. That gives resonance to the Japanese hopes of creating a financial district in Tokyo that can lure foreign investment and Western professionals. 
 But some of the proposals from the Financial Services Agency read more like excerpts from a real estate brochure than a manifesto for financial ascendance. There are proposals for building more spacious apartments, earthquake-resistant offices and plusher sports clubs. 
 One idea is to add restaurants that serve Western fare like spaghetti and stay open after midnight to accommodate the financial industry's grueling work hours. Drafts of the plan also call for adding English-speaking hospitals and schools, more English street signs and a faster train link to Narita, the main international airport, a 90-minute trip from downtown.
 Less evident are the sorts of changes that might actually draw foreign professionals and companies: lower taxes, a larger English-speaking talent pool, and greater transparency and restraint in market oversight by the agency itself.
 ''The agency's plan does not solve the core issues,'' said Naoko Nemoto, a banking analyst at Standard & Poor's here, who was on an agency committee that made early recommendations for the plan. ''Tokyo will lose out if it doesn't make bigger changes.'' 
 Critics said the lack of more substantial measures reflect bureaucratic resistance by the Financial Services Agency, which fears losing its power. An even bigger hurdle, many say, is a deep-seated aversion in Japan to finance, which is regarded here as a dirty game.
 This has made many politicians and economists reluctant to promote the finance industries instead of manufacturing, which Japanese celebrate as honest work from the sweat of the brow.
 Many Japanese businessmen and economists agree that such attitudes must change if Tokyo is to compete in a crowded field of current and would-be world financial centers -- including the ascent of Hong Kong as financier and alternate marketplace for a fast-growing China.
 Singapore has rolled out the red carpet to foreign investors, with low taxes and spare regulation. Contenders like Shanghai, Mumbai and Dubai, on the Persian Gulf, have emerged as investment centers, including the money from Middle East oil wealth.
 To make a comeback, Tokyo must reverse more than a decade of decline. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has fallen from being the largest stock market in the world at 1990 market capitalization to No. 2, behind the New York Stock Exchange. During that time, the value of all shares traded on the Tokyo exchange rose less than 60 percent, to about $4.6 trillion at the end of last year.
 By contrast, the value of the New York exchange increased fivefold. Hong Kong's main exchange rose by a factor of 21, though it is still half the size of Tokyo. In London, already the global center for trading in currency, the main stock market has grown fourfold since 1990 and could soon overtake Tokyo.
 In recent years, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has become even less attractive for foreign companies because of high costs and language barriers. There are now 26 foreign companies listed on the exchange, down from 127 in 1991, the market said.
 And while Japan remains Asia's largest and most advanced economy, many here are alarmed by the rise of China as an industrial powerhouse. Proponents of the financial-capital plan hope it will help Japan shift from a goods-producing nation into more of a soft power like the United States, which creates, designs and finances goods and services while doing less manufacturing itself. 
 ''The United States and England were both economically ill for a time, but succeeded in finding new growth in their financial industries,'' said Yuji Yamamoto, a former financial services minister who is a chief architect of the plan. ''We need to emulate that success.'' 
 Mr. Yamamoto visited New York, Washington and London in January, when he was still the minister. During the trip, he asked officials like Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, what was wrong with Tokyo. They told him that if Japan did not open its markets, ''it will just be a small Asian country,'' he said.
 But the most memorable moment, he said, was walking around Wall Street and seeing the offices of financial companies from around the world. London also made a deep impression because so many of the firms were from developing regions, like India, South America and the Middle East. This contrasted with Tokyo, where the vast majority of companies are Japanese.
 ''That is when I realized the secret of Wall Street and the City success was their ability to attract money and talent from all over the world,'' Mr. Yamamoto declared. 
 He decided that the way to emulate such success was to turn Tokyo's financial district, Kabutocho, into a more international environment where foreign bankers and investors could feel comfortable living and doing business.
 Most outsiders agree that Tokyo has enormous potential as a hub for foreign companies, not only because of Japan's wealth but also because the city is widely regarded as one of the safest and cleanest in Asia. But there are concerns that the plan will do little more than create a ghetto for well-heeled foreigners.
 The proposals also fail to get at the complaints of foreign investors and bankers over high taxes and onerous regulations. 
 The biggest sore point is the Financial Services Agency itself, which is widely criticized as having enormous discretion in setting rules and enforcing them. Japanese bureaucrats have long wielded murky powers over private business. Many foreign investors and financial professionals point to the agency's shutting down Citigroup's Japanese private banking unit three years ago as an instance of heavy-handedness toward foreign companies.
 Tokyo ''is a wonderful city to live in,'' said Robert Feldman, an economist in the Tokyo office ofMorgan Stanley. ''But unless it changes its regulatory environment, no one will come here.''

HEADLINE: poor are lagging in hurricane aid from mississippi

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

DATELINE: GULFPORT, Miss., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Like the other Gulf Coast states battered by Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi was required by Congress to spend half of its billions in federal grant money to help low-income citizens trying to recover from the storm.
 But so far, the state has spent $1.7 billion in federal money on programs that have mostly benefited relatively affluent residents and big businesses. The money has gone to compensate many middle- and upper-income homeowners, to aid utility companies whose equipment was damaged and to prop up the state's insurance system.
 Just $167 million, or about 10 percent of the federal money, has been spent on programs dedicated to helping the poor, mostly through a smaller grant program for lower-income homeowners.
 And while that total will certainly increase, Mississippi has set aside just 23 percent of its $5.5 billion grant money -- $1.25 billion -- for these programs. About 37 percent of the residents of the state's coast are low income, according to federal figures. 
 Mississippi is the only state for which the Bush administration has waived the rule that 50 percent of its Community Development Block Grants be spent on low-income programs, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers the program. It is also the only state to ask for such waivers. 
 State officials, from Gov. Haley Barbour on down, insist that the state does not discriminate by race or income when it hands out aid to storm victims.
 ''We feel like we have programs in place to address all walks of life,'' said Gray Swoope, executive director of the Mississippi Development Authority, which administers the federally financed grant programs. 
 Any delays in spending money on low-income projects have been caused by the complexity of creating the projects, said Donna Sanford, director of the disaster recovery program for the development authority. The state, Ms. Sanford said, ''has done everything that we can to keep it on track and moving as fast as possible to meet the needs of everyone.''
 Nonetheless, resentment at being left out of Mississippi's economic recovery has been stirring in poor communities along the coast, and nowhere more so than in this city, hit hard by Hurricane Katrina's storm surge, where the state plans to spend $600 million of the federal money to repair and improve its shipping port. 
 Though the expansion will increase employment here, historically very few port jobs have gone to low-income residents. 
 Some critics contend that the main interest of state leaders in spending community development dollars is to help big businesses like shipbuilders and casinos and the port.
 The state's spending plan ''moves business to the forefront and forgets about the people on the ground,'' said Anthony Thompson, pastor at Tabernacle of Faith Ministries, whose spotless church (rebuilt by volunteers) is next to a moldering subsidized housing project that he says has not been touched since the storm.
 In his mostly black neighborhood in west Gulfport, Mr. Thompson said, ''I see a lot of people waiting on help; I see a lot of houses still damaged.''
 State officials say that programs not limited to lower-income residents help them nevertheless.
 The aid to utilities helped everyone on the coast, including renters, officials say. And almost a third of the families who got money from the state's main housing compensation program were low-income, which in Gulfport would mean an annual income of less than $39,000 a year for a family of four.
 The nature of that program helps explain the unhappiness in some neighborhoods. It provided grants of up to $150,000 to homeowners who lived outside of the federally defined flood plain and so did not have flood insurance to cover their losses when their houses were swamped by the storm surge.
 To be eligible, families had to have carried regular homeowners' insurance, so that, as the governor said when he was selling the plan to Congress, ''we're not bailing out irresponsible people.''
 But advocates for the poor said that requirement barred many of the least affluent, especially retirees and the disabled, who live on fixed incomes. ''The fact is, people who have no money choose food and medicine, and not insurance,'' said Ashley Tsongas, a policy adviser for the aid group Oxfam America. ''That moral superiority doesn't recognize the reality people face.''
 Renters were also excluded from the program, as they were in Louisiana, and homeowners who had wind damage were also not covered. Some federal officials have said Louisiana's decision to help cover wind losses is one reason its program almost ran out of money.
 Two-thirds of Mississippi's block grants have not yet been spent. In fact, few of the coastal states have spent much of their grant money, with the exception of Louisiana, which has already used almost half of its original allotment and just received an additional $3 billion for its home-rebuilding program. 
 Because fewer applicants than expected applied for Mississippi's assistance program, the state still has almost $2 billion left, some of which it plans to use for community development projects and for the port expansion.
 The port, at the foot of Gulfport's main street, flies a Chiquita banner under its American flag; fruit imports remain down but are bouncing back, though exports of frozen poultry have stopped since the storm destroyed the port's refrigerated warehouses. The state says that the expansion will add about 1,000 jobs over the next five years, and that many of those will be reserved for low-income residents.
 But some community advocates are dubious, noting that before the storm only 10 percent of the port jobs went to low-income residents. They also think the cost per job will be too high. 
 And they note that the port's own master plan envisions a new tourist and casino development. ''It's not all about bananas,'' said Reilly Morse, a lawyer for the Mississippi Center for Justice.
 Mr. Morse and many others who oppose the port plan say the state should first ensure that all the families now living in more than 10,000 government trailers have a permanent place to live, that rental housing gets built and that all homeowners can repair their houses.
 ''I don't have any problem with economic development and expanding the port, but not at the cost of people,'' said James W. Crowell, president of the N.A.A.C.P. branch in Biloxi, just down the beach from Gulfport.
 Brent Warr, who became Gulfport's mayor just months before the storm, called the port expansion ''an incredible opportunity for the city,'' and said he had been assured that the new facilities would be devoted to maritime use, not to gambling and cruise ships. ''We don't have to make this community about neon and chrome,'' he said.
 Asked about the frustrations some residents have about the lack of aid in their communities, Mr. Warr said it would take time, because the development authority has to create programs all at once while making sure the money is well spent. ''It's like taking a funnel and packing it so full of money that nothing can come out,'' he said.
 Dorothy J. McClendon fears that none of that money will reach her east Gulfport neighborhood, Soria City, where she leads a civic group with the modest motto, ''Moving Toward a Drug-Free Community.''
 Because it is north of the railroad tracks which serve as a sort of levee, the neighborhood did not flood, so residents cannot get state grants, Ms. McClendon said. Few had insurance to cover their wind-damaged roofs; she is sleeping on a couch in her living room because shefears that the water-damaged ceiling in her bedroom is going to fall.
 Repairs to public works and economic development projects appear to happening elsewhere; Soria City's main business is a tiny shop selling sodas and snacks and 25-cent cigarettes. Even the program to help small landlords does not apply to this neighborhood, Ms. McClendon said, because while there are plenty of properties that could be fixed up and rented out, few were occupied right before the storm, as the program requires. 
 ''But we're here, we're hurting,'' she said. ''We need help, too.''

HEADLINE: When the Golf Course Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By SALLIE BRADY

 BODY:
THERE'S never been anything terribly sexy about living in a golf community. Imagine cookie-cutter spec homes dotting yet another dull par 4 in Myrtle Beach, and you get the picture. Even if you like the game and are in the market for a vacation home, you may never have considered buying in one of these old-style resorts. 
 This is a phenomenon not lost on builders, who are out to change that -- and the look of golf-course living. The new breed of golf community has a strong personality with distinctive architecture; loads of amenities, many catering to families; and a real sense of place. 
 The new choices include log homes on a Colorado mountain, sleek modern designs in Florida, and estates managed by Ritz-Carlton in Virginia. Aside from the manicured 18 holes, there is barely anything recognizable from the typical golf club in these developments, which can come with round-trip airport transfers, concierge services (like club and dog washing), spas and stables. 
 ''The classic model of houses ringing a golf course is dying,'' said John Kirk, an architect with the New York firm Cooper Robertson & Partners, who designed homes at WaterSound, a beachside golf community in the Florida panhandle. ''Instead the golf course is like a big public green,'' he said, adding that ''people want to be able to walk to the post office or to get their morning coffee.'' 
 Vacation home buyers continue to get younger -- a median age of 47 in 2006, down from 52 in 2005, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors -- as more families move in next to the retirees at golf communities. Developers have responded by offering more design options, holiday kids' clubs and summer camps, and myriad recreational activities beyond the driving range. 
 But the question is whether there are enough buyers for these new golf retreats. ''The long-term demographics are favorable,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors. ''It would not be surprising if we saw the vacation market hold its own while the rest of the market declines.'' 
 Bernard Markstein III, a senior economist with the National Association of Home Builders, concurred, saying: ''The vacation buyers are still there. They might be a little more cautious, but to some extent it's turning into a buyer's market. It might be a good time to buy a vacation home.'' 
 As tastes change, developers are willing to try just about anything to woo the new crowd. Here are a few examples. 
 The Mediterranean Villa
 The Gardens of Isleworth; Windermere, Fla.; www.isleworth.com
 ''We kept hearing that people wanted to downsize,'' Lisa Richards, president of Isleworth Realty, said of the Gardens of Isleworth's new homes -- averaging around 4,000 square feet compared with the community's 10,000-square-foot houses. The Gardens' 30 Italian-inspired villas, which start at $2.95 million, are built around private courtyards with features like sliding glass walls, landscaped fire pits, fireplaces, and water walls that blur the lines between indoors and out. 
 ''We've lived in Isleworth for 18 years,'' said Dick Smith, 78, a retired automobile manufacturing executive, of himself and his wife, Jolene, 74. ''But we wanted something smaller, so we sold and bought one of the Gardens.'' 
 Among Mr. Smith's new neighbors in the Gardens is Paula Creamer, the 21-year-old L.P.G.A. star. With Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara and other P.G.A. players among its residents, the Isleworth development, outside Orlando, is heaven for serious golfers. 
 ''You see Tiger out there playing Annika, but they don't bother with us,'' Mr. Smith says of his weekday foursome. ''It's too much of a business for them to bother with a $5 Nassau.'' 
 Home ownership does not grant membership to the Isleworth Country Club and its difficult (142 slope) Arnold Palmer course, which is by invitation.
 The Newport 'Cottage'
 Carnegie Abbey Club; Portsmouth, R.I.; www.carnegieabbeyclub.com
 ''We've had a record-breaking month,'' said Kathy Schmitt, director of sales for the Carnegie Abbey Club, between tours on a late August day. And it's been even better since, she said this week, with $28.8 million more in sales. 
 ''The average age of our residence buyer is 47, with young children,'' Ms. Schmitt added.
 Founded by the international club developer Peter de Savary, Carnegie Abbey is a private club with a links course designed by Donald Steel, a spa, a marina and an equestrian center. In 2004, it began building cedar-shingled houses, averaging 6,500 square feet, down the road from the course, which opened in 2000. A 79-unit, 21-story condominium tower is also under construction. Prices range from $850,000 for a condominium to $15 million for a furnished home.
 To buy real estate, you have to join the country club: $175,000 for golfers; $87,500 for nongolfers. 
 The Colorado Ranch
 Adam's Rib Ranch; Eagle, Colo.; www.discoveradamsribranch.com
 When Fred Kummer Jr., 78, was buying up 15,000 acres of the Rockies north of Vail 30 years ago, he intended to build a ski resort. Instead, this August he watched Tom Weiskopf tee off for the first time on the 18-hole course that Mr. Weiskopf designed in Mr. Kummer's new golf community.
 Ninety-nine log homes are scheduled for Adam's Rib (four are finished), situated in an area referred to as ''the banana belt,'' because of its relatively mild climate. ''You can play from April 1 through late October,'' said Mr. Kummer, the founder of the Adam's Mark Hotel chain. 
 The finished timber-sided homes, which have native-stone fireplaces, outdoor saunas and concierge and transportation services, start at $3 million. Homesites begin at $850,000. Golf club memberships ($150,000) are extra. 
 The Cedar Shake in the South
 WaterSound; WaterSound, Fla.; www.watersoundflorida.com
 Chris Pickren was 38 and working in real estate when he moved from New Orleans six years ago to this new golf and beach community, one of several built on 800,000 acres by the development company St. Joe on Florida's Emerald Coast, between Pensacola and Panama City. Now, with his wife, Melinda, 39, and three young children, Mr. Pickren is a year-rounder in his beachside home, which he says reminds him of Nantucket and Maine. 
 ''Even though this entire area is a second-home market, this is a place you can live,'' said Mr. Pickren of his neighborhood of wood-sided houses with breezy Southern porches connected by boardwalks over the sand dunes.
 A village commons, the Tom Fazio-designed Camp Creek Golf Club and an unusual 10-hole par-3 course designed by Davis Love III can all be reached by golf cart, and a newly acquired Greg Norman course is five minutes by car. Homes average 2,600 square feet and range from $460,000 to $1.3 million. Homeowners are entitled to 12 free rounds of golf a year at Camp Creek, where membership begins at $30,000.
 The Edwardian High-Rise
 Bear Mountain; Victoria, British Columbia; www.bearmountain.ca
 ''It looks like a castle,'' said Cynthia Thompson, 45, of the Highlander, a 15-story condominium modeled after Victoria's century-old Empress Hotel, just after she and her husband, Greg, 50, bought a two-bedroom golf retreat there. 
 Tired of the heat of Phoenix, where they live in a golf community, the couple wanted a summer vacation property. When they called Bear Mountain to book a tee time on its Jack Nicklaus-designed course, they were told they could take part in the resort's Fly and Try program, which would reimburse them for airfare and a hotel room if they bought property. 
 ''We had never considered buying in Victoria, but it's beautiful,'' Mrs. Thompson said. ''The course is amazing, and I don't think we'll need a car.'' 
 Many of the 1,300-acre resort's condos are being snapped up by Americans from hot-weather locales like Texas, California and Arizona. Condos start at 530 square feet for 350,000 Canadian dollars ($367,450 at $1.07 to the Canadian dollar) and go to 2,000 square feet for 2.1 million Canadian dollars. 
 ''The average age of the buyer here is 48 to 52,'' said Dale Sproule, director of real estate. He added that the development's owners -- led by the ex-National Hockey League player Len Barrie and including former and current N.H.L. stars like Joe Nieuwendyk and Ryan Smyth -- have helped attract a young crowd. ''We're selling as fast as we can build,'' Mr. Sproule said. 
 The Hunt Country Estate
 Creighton Farms; Aldie, Va.; www.creightonfarms.com
 The Ritz-Carlton hotel chain is creating its first estate-style golf residence, set on 900 acres of Virginia horse country just 13 miles from Dulles International Airport. The buyers of the development's 181 homesites, which start at $850,000, will be members of a new Jack Nicklaus 18-hole course, which is already open. A lavish clubhouse will offer such hotel-like services as catering, spa treatments and party planning. Move-in dates are predicted for the second half of 2008. 
 The Architect-Designed Home
 Windsor; Vero Beach, Fla.; www.windsorflorida.com
 From its inception, distinctive architecture was a priority for the streets of Windsor. Founded in the late 1980s by Hilary and W. Galen Weston, who wanted to create an exclusive golf and polo community on a 416-acre barrier island, the resort will top off at 350 homes with only 275 golfing members, who can play the Robert Trent Jones Jr. course without a tee time. 
 While a British Colonial look predominates, five homes designed by the architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen have contributed a more modern chic mix, along with a contemporary clubhouse.
 ''There's no place like it,'' said Mark Mitchell, 57, of Winnetka, Ill., the president of Industrial Representatives Inc., an electronics sales company, who owns a Windsor home with his wife, Patti, 57, and four young adult children. ''It's like a low-key beach town, and you can walk for miles and miles on the beach and never see a high-rise.''
 Betsy Hanley, president of Windsor real estate, said the median age of the community's homeowners gets younger annually -- the 32-year-old Seattle Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck just bought there -- and more than 50 percent come from the Northeast. Lots vary from 1,900 square feet to one and a half acres, with prices starting at $1.5 million for a 3,000-square-foot ''tennis cottage.''

 BODY:
THE ARISTOPHANIC LABORATORY The illustrious playwrights of ancient Greece gave us the tortured Oedipus, the grief-stricken Electra and the jealous and murderous Medea, among other dark and passionate characters, but every play coming out of Athens at that time was not necessarily tragic. Though we see the work of Aristophanes less frequently nowadays, he was toiling away too, writing bawdy, irreverent comedies with overtly political themes. This master of the Greek Old Comedy period is the only parodist from his era whose work survives today -- he wrote about 40 plays during his lifetime (around 450 to 388 B.C.), though fewer than a dozen are still extant. 
 The Target Margin Theater, which spent last season breathing new life into Greek tragedy and philosophy, including adaptations of Plato's ''Symposium'' and Aristotle's ''Poetics,'' is lightening up things by devoting its 2007-8 season to Aristophanes. This is the last weekend of the Aristophanic Laboratory, a festival of adaptations and interpretations of the existing plays and fragments. The final offerings are ''The Name Means Public Spirited. Or, All Those Other Things,'' above, by Mallery Avidon, which is loosely adapted from ''Ecclesiazusae'' (say that 10 times fast -- it's eck-lee-zee-AH-zoo-sigh and kind of fun to say out loud), and takeoffs on ''Lysistrata'' and ''Peace,'' two of Aristophanes' most overt and imaginative pleas for peace. The plays may be old, but the themes, well, not so much. Most of Aristophanes' life was defined by the long and brutal Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, and his plays are filled with appeals for an end to the fighting. 
 Target Margin's Aristophanes season will continue in May with a production of ''Aristophanes' Frogs,'' adapted by David Greenspan and directed by the company's artistic director, David Herskovits. (Through tomorrow, Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, 212-352-3101, here.org; $10.) STEVEN McELROY

 Broadway
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'THE NEW MEL BROOKS MUSICAL YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN' This tiring adaptation of Mr. Brooks's 1974 movie, directed by Susan Stroman and starring an amiable but overwhelmed Roger Bart, never seems to stop screeching at you. This means that: a) it soon wears out its voice, and b) it leaves you with a monster-size headache (2:45). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse, and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs. (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'BINGO WITH THE INDIANS' Ideas and actors ricochet around the stage in Adam Rapp's chaotic yet intriguing dark comedy about a theater group planning to steal money from a bingo game (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Tribeca, (212) 352-3101. (Caryn James)
 'THE BROTHERS SIZE' Loosely based on West African myths, this impressive and emotionally absorbing debut by Tarrell Alvin McCraney portrays two battling brothers in Louisiana (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Jason Zinoman) 
 'CRIME AND PUNISHMENT' The novel every high school student dreads is somehow made compelling (and short!) in this three-actor production by the Writers' Theater of Chicago. John Judd is outstanding as the inspector who patiently waits out poor Raskolnikov (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: RUDE AWAKENING' The 25th-anniversary version of Gerard Alessandrini's invaluable index to current American musicals has priceless moments (especially its parody of the hot-and-bothered antics of ''Spring Awakening''). But it's also a sobering reminder that even an inspired satirist can be defeated by emaciated targets (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FRANKENSTEIN' This dreary musical slog through the Mary Shelley novel, with an ill-used Hunter Foster in the title role, is not to be confused with the uptown spoof from Mel Brooks. It won't be (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 
 'FUERZABRUTA' A sensory bath aimed at clubgoing college kids in search of cultural diversion. Thumping techno music, smoke and a standing throng surround you as you watch a curious collection of semi-spectacular technical feats (1:05). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'THE GLORIOUS ONES' An energetic new musical by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens about a commedia dell'arte troupe in which bawdy shenanigans of yore are combined with the sweet sentiments of traditional American musical comedy. It's like a whoopee cushion that emits a wistful sigh (1:40). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'HAMLET' The Wooster Group's sometimes ravishing, often numbing homage to a fabled theatrical event: Richard Burton on Broadway as the Prince of Denmark in 1964. Juxtaposing a film of the performance with live actors, who replicate the on-screen action, the production teeters between hypnotic and narcotic. Elizabeth LeCompte directs (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8750. (Brantley) 
 'HOODOO LOVE' The playwright Katori Hall appears to have a strong and promising voice. But she is still working out how to articulate what she wants to say, and this uneven play is definitely a step along the way to an arrival that is still in the future. Ms. Hall casts a sprawling net around the story of an aspiring blues singer in 1930s Nashville. Oddly, in a play that purports to be about music, the music is somewhat of an afterthought (2:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette) 
 'JUMP' Video game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman) 
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'MY FIRST TIME' Ken Davenport's venture into Web-theater synergy mines a site called MyFirstTime.com to cull stories of inaugural encounters with sex. Four actors deliver the anecdotes in what amounts to little more than a crassly commercial effort to replicate the success of ''The Vagina Monologues'' (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)
 'NONE OF THE ABOVE' An uneven revival of a slight comedy that wants to be taken seriously. There are some clever one-liners, but much of the humor is of the sitcom variety. A bigger problem in this staging is a lack of chemistry between the play's two characters (1:45). Lion Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'PETER AND JERRY' A beautifully acted double bill of linked plays by Edward Albee, ''Zoo Story'' and ''Homelife,'' written more than 40 years apart, that confirm his enduring and unparalleled skills in exploring the feral soul beneath civilized skins. Pam MacKinnon directs the top-flight cast: Johanna Day, Bill Pullman and Dallas Roberts. (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 
 'POLITICAL IDOL' Uneven but at times hilarious, this musical revue satirizing the presidential primaries does to politics what ''Forbidden Broadway'' does to theater (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (James)
 'THE RECEPTIONIST' The ever-wonderful Jayne Houdyshell answers phones, gossips and gives motherly advice in an office where disturbing work is afoot. Adam Bock's play, essentially a gloss on the ''Twilight Zone'' formula, is a zippy hour and change of comedy and suspense (1:10). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center, Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 
 'THE RISE OF DOROTHY HALE' Myra Baistow has fashioned an intriguing but uneven look at the real-life case of Dorothy Hale, a minor actress with important friends (including Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who fell to her death from the Hampshire House on Central Park South in 1938. The case has eerie parallels to the Marilyn Monroe story (1:45). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) 
 'SIVE' The Irish Rep throws itself away on this clunky 1959 melodrama about a schoolgirl married off to a rich old man (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (James) 
 'SPEECH AND DEBATE' Stephen Karam's modest dark comedy about three misfit high school students, which includes a singing, dancing tribute to ''The Crucible,'' is funny, cliche-free and brilliantly performed (1:45). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (James) 
 'THINGS WE WANT' Jonathan Marc Sherman's thickly whimsical comedy of despair has a seriously cool cast (Paul Dano, Peter Dinklage and Josh Hamilton) and a director to match in Ethan Hawke. But this dysfunctional family portrait mostly feels like an internal monologue distributed among four characters (2:00). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'TINGS DEY HAPPEN' An engrossing one-man show about the Fulbright year its author and performer, Dan Hoyle, spent in Nigeria; in the spirit of theatrical journalism, it is at once a travelogue, a cultural survey and a good introductory course in oil politics. But it is the people the audience meets who raise the exercise above a guided tour (1:25). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Hampton) 
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 'WALMARTOPIA' This time-traveling musical satire is an uneasy mix of an earnest, power-to-the-workers message and blunt satire, positing an Orwellian future ruled by Wal-Mart. The music is a pastiche of styles, ranging from a Peter Allen conga line to gospel, but Cheryl Freeman's energetic performance as a put-upon Wal-Mart employee rises above it all (2:00). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (James)
 Off Off Broadway
 'HAMLET' A mere description is probably all you need to know whether this production is for you: a shortened ''Hamlet'' performed by marionettes on a working carousel. The best moments in this show by the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater come near the end, once the killing starts; the carousel's inescapable round-and-round begins to make sense. Clifton Hyde's live music is also a high point (1:15). Jane's Carousel, 56 Water Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 'THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE, I CAN FEEL IT' This unfocused multimedia piece about the '60s and politics feels like a student thesis (1:30). The Tank @ Collective Unconscious, 279 Church Street, Tribeca, (212) 352-3101. (James)
 Extravaganzas
 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS: CELEBRATE!' An occasion to celebrate (2:15). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'THE FANTASTICKS' The Little Musical That Wouldn't Die redux (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' P. L. Travers meets Dr. Phil (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 
 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 Last Chance
 'CROSSING BROOKLYN' The events of Sept. 11 still resist easy synthesis into the stuff of life and art; this musical about two teachers coping with post-traumatic stress several months after the attacks demonstrates this both deliberately and by example. The music, by Jenny Giering, often manages to create the jagged, nervous energy of the post-9/11 world, but the book, by Laura Harrington, lapses into formulas, and the piece, even despite the good direction of Jack Cummings III, has more rough edges than its creators might have intended (1:40). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) 
 'DRUM OF THE WAVES OF HORIKAWA' What happens when you cross punk with Kabuki? In this production, directed by Brooke O'Harra, you get something loud (duh), lively and exploratory that is also something of a mishmash. The music, by the talented Brendan Connelly, is consistently interesting. But the play, an adaptation of a 1705 Monzaemon Chikamatsu work, seems more burlesqued than illuminated by its encounter with punk. Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Saturday. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'A GLANCE AT NEW YORK' Axis Company's daffy resurrection of this lowbrow stage work from 1848 seems, at 50 minutes, to go by in a heartbeat, and when it's over, you'll have no sense of what made the play so popular way back when. But you'll have been entertained by the company's assaultive delivery. The story involves a rube who comes to New York and is fleeced repeatedly, and a fireman named Mose who punches people (1:00). The Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Saturday. (Genzlinger) 
 'LUCY' An occasionally provocative drama, about a mother who must learn how to take care of her autistic daughter, that takes on difficult issues and explores them without sentiment (1:45). The Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 
 'MILK-N-HONEY' This frequently entertaining primer on food politics is partly fiction and partly based on interviews with people like farmers, Dumpster divers and food chemists. The show has an appealing sense of mission, but it too earnestly wants to convince us that we are prisoners of American consumerism. On the plus side, you get candy (1:25). 3LD Art and Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 388-7371; closes on Sunday. (Saltz) 
 'ODE TO THE MAN WHO KNEELS' Richard Maxwell, one of the few truly original theater auteurs to emerge from the past decade, has created a bleak, droll and strangely beautiful musical about cowboys and the women who hurt them (1:15). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 966-3651; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 
 'OHIO STATE MURDERS' LisaGay Hamilton plays the alter ego of the playwright Adrienne Kennedy in this short, sharp, hypnotic play about the specter of racism blighting the life of a college girl in the 1950s. A rare chance to encounter one of the most distinctive American voices of the last half-century (1:05). Theater for a New Audience at the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 
 '1001' This contemporary, kaleidoscopic gloss on the ''1001 Nights'' tales is lively but lacks freshness (1:50). The Nagelberg Theater at the Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Saturday. (James)
 'THE OXFORD ROOF CLIMBERS REBELLION' An excellent play about two famous soldier-scholars -- T. E. Lawrence and Robert Graves -- and their disillusionment with the British establishment over World War I, particularly the government's attempts to ennoble the slaughter known as the Great War. Although set in Oxford University in 1920, the play is as timely as today's newspaper (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Saturday. (Isherwood) 
 'SPAIN' Jim Knable's wobbly fantasy stars Annabella Sciorra as an abandoned wife working through her emotional problems in an unusually colorful way. She dreams up a conquistador, played with savory wit by Michael Aronov, to give her tips on getting through life's battles (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes on Saturday. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: House Votes to Rein In Certain Mortgage Lending Practices

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
With home foreclosures skyrocketing, the House on Thursday voted to crack down on mortgage lenders by enacting federal licensing and to fine them for steering people to risky subprime loans when other financing is available. 
 The measure, which passed 291-127, is a reaction to the mortgage crisis that has entangled millions of people with shaky credit who had signed up for unconventional mortgages and found their mortgage payments rising to unaffordable levels. 
 Besides making lenders responsible for knowing if borrowers can repay loans, the bill would prohibit excessive fees for payoff information or late payments, the financing of points and fees and practices that increase the risk of foreclosure, like balloon payments and encouraging borrowers to default. 
 It would also make Wall Street banks that package mortgage securities into investments liable for violations of lending laws. The bill now goes to the Senate, where a similar bill has been stalled for weeks.
 The number of homes involved in foreclosure proceedings nationwide almost doubled in the third quarter of this year when compared with 2006, according to RealtyTrac Inc. And more than two million adjustable-rate mortgages are scheduled to reset by the end of 2008.
 But Republicans and the White House warned that Congressional meddling with mortgage markets would make it harder for borrowers to refinance loans that are due to reset at higher interest rates, and make it almost impossible for poor people to get loans.

HEADLINE: They're Still Replaying the Tie in The Game

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The legendary Yale quarterback Brian Dowling will travel here this weekend from his home in Boston to watch his alma mater defend a perfect season against Harvard in The Game. 
 As a player nearly four decades ago, he headed in the opposite direction, from here to Cambridge, Mass., although just as much was on the line. Yale and Harvard were undefeated. The Ivy League championship would be decided. 
 Leading by 29-13 with 42 seconds remaining, Dowling's Elis appeared to have locked up a perfect season. But Harvard scored an improbable 16 points and the game ended in perhaps the most famous tie in college football history. Unbeaten records were preserved, but as The Harvard Crimson proclaimed in a banner headline, ''Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29.'' 
 ''It was a frustrating way to end my class's career at Yale,'' Dowling said this week in a telephone interview. ''People are still asking us about it 39 years later.'' 
 In the stands on Saturday, Dowling will finally get a chance to break that tie, at least vicariously. For the first time since that 1968 game, Yale (9-0, 6-0) and Harvard (7-2, 6-0) are unbeaten in the league.
 Yale officials say they expect a capacity crowd at the 61,446-seat Yale Bowl, and there has been no shortage of hype for the game among students and alumni. Players from the 1968 game knew a thing or two about that.
 ''I remember becoming a friend of an awful lot of alums I had never talked to before,'' said Gus Crim, a fullback on the Harvard squad who now works in real estate in Ohio. 
 At Yale, Carm Cozza, the coach at the time, remembered dining at the private club Mory's only to have a crowd of students spontaneously rally outside and demand that he address them. Students hung banners from their dormitory windows and mobbed the team's bus every time it left campus. 
 ''The hype -- not just that one game, but that whole season -- was unbelievable,'' said Cozza, who at 77 remains a part of the Yale athletic department and is a radio analyst for the Bulldogs. ''It was just wonderful. It's something I think the players probably from both teams will never forget.''
 Entering the Harvard game in 1968, Yale had won 16 straight, the nation's longest streak, and was No. 18 in the coaches' poll. The 40,000-seat Harvard Stadium quickly sold out; officials estimated they could have sold 100,000 tickets. Students became scalpers. One enterprising Yale senior, according to news reports, sold two seats for $175. (Adjusted for inflation, that price would exceed $1,000 today.) 
 All three national television networks were on hand. Alumni told Dowling that beating Harvard was the most important thing he would ever do.
 But by the second quarter, all that attention and suspense seemed unwarranted. Yale led by 22-0, propelled by Dowling and the halfback and the future N.F.L. star Calvin Hill, who was the Cowboys' No. 1 draft choice. Harvard seemed powerless. Even its star offensive lineman, Tommy Lee Jones, did not seem to be of much help.
 ''We basically dominated,'' Cozza said. 
 At halftime, Crim said, he felt one thing: ''Embarrassed.''
 Harvard battled back, but with less than a minute to go, it trailed, 29-13. Facing a third-and-18, the backup quarterback Frank Champi was sacked and lost the football. The game appeared over -- until Fritz Reed, a Harvard tackle, picked up the ball and ambled into the Yale red zone. 
 Harvard had new life. Champi hit Bruce Freeman for a touchdown on the next play, and Crim plunged in the end zone for a 2-point conversion after a pass-interference penalty had negated Yale's defensive stand on Harvard's first attempt. The score was 29-21. An onside kick bounced off a Yale player and was recovered by Harvard.
 ''I said, 'Now it's ordained,''' Crim said. ''We're not getting this far to not tie the game.''
 On the ensuing possession, Champi scrambled 14 yards to the Yale 35, and a face-mask penalty sent the Crimson to the 20. Thirty-two seconds remained. On the Yale sideline, Dowling said he and Hill begged Cozza to let them go in the game on defense. Cozza refused.
 ''It was just very frustrating to watch,'' said Dowling, who finished ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting that year.
 After two incompletions, Crim managed to gain 14 yards on a draw play to the Yale 6. Champi was sacked on the next play, pushing Harvard back to the 8.
 Four seconds remained. Champi took the snap, but he was trapped. He scrambled, tried to lateral, tried to find a receiver. It was a broken play. Then he saw Victor Gatto, the running back and senior captain, break free in the end zone. Champi threw a strike to him to bring Harvard to 2 points with no time left on the clock. Thousands of Harvard students poured out of the stands.
 ''It took awhile to clear the field,'' said Gatto, who had left the game with an injured hamstring. ''But by that point though, the momentum was there. And that was it.''
 On the conversion attempt, Champi took the snap and found tight end Pete Varney for the score. 
 Students stormed the field again, this time for good. 
 ''It was just unbelievable,'' Cozza said. ''Everything that could go wrong for us in the last 42 seconds seemed to happen. Inadvertent whistles, holding penalties, fumbles, an onside kick, just about anything and everything that could happen.''
 The next day, when the crowds had finally decamped, Crim returned to Harvard Stadium and walked down the sideline. 
 ''I said, 'Wow, you'll never re-create anything like this,''' he recalled. He came to one conclusion: ''There's never going to be another matchup like this in our lifetime.''
 The college football landscape has since changed significantly. The Ivy League left Division I-A in 1982, and although Harvard and Yale are ranked in the top 25 in college football's second tier this season, they are no longer national powerhouses. Around Boston, Harvard football plays second fiddle to the New England Patriots. In New Haven, the Bulldogs are lucky to fill the Yale Bowl halfway for games against any opponent other than Harvard.
 But the rivalry is no less intense, and its history has not been forgotten. 
 Dowling, who was the model for a character in the Doonesbury comic strip and is now a consultant in Boston, will be here Saturday for the 124th meeting of the teams. He said he recognized the parallels between 1968 and this year. ''It makes for a more exciting atmosphere,'' he said.
 At his news conference this week, Harvard Coach Tim Murphy opened his discussion of the rivalry with a recollection of the 1968 game; he was 12 at the time. At Yale, Coach Jack Siedlecki told reporters he did not need to remind his players about the annals of Yale-Harvard lore and the bitterness of that tie.
 ''The kids know,'' Siedlecki said this week. ''I don't have to say a word. They're pretty bright.''
 On Saturday, there will be no tie because of overtime. 
 ''The one good thing now,'' Cozza said, ''is somebody's going to win it.''

 MIXER Not to be outdone by other cultural-turned-party institutions around town, Eyebeam gallery, devoted to high-tech projects and research, is now starting its own art-and-fun series, Mixer. The inaugural event begins Saturday with a live multimedia performance by the video artist Benton-C Bainbridge. In ''Brother Islands (Places to Lose People),'' above, Mr. Bainbridge, who was a recent Eyebeam teaching fellow, documents the history of two abandoned East River islands; using video, photos, music and actors playing ghosts, he hopes to explore the idea and mechanics of quarantine. 
 The setup will help: the work will literally surround the audience, who sit in the middle of six 10-foot-tall screens, said Paul Amitai, Eyebeam's program and events coordinator. (Each Mixer event is organized around a theme; Saturday's is ''place.'') After the video opera, Eyebeam's 8,000-square-foot warehouse space will be transformed into a dance party, with laptop electro by the D.J. Jesse Stiles 3000 and live video mixing by Vade and the 1970s synthesizer pioneer Bill Etra, . It's also an opportunity for the audience to interact with the technology. 
 ''They could play around with some of the tools that Benton was using,'' Mr. Amitai said. ''Or they could just zone out and watch.'' The next Mixer, scheduled for Feb. 23, will most likely address sustainability and the environment; the lineup includes the British group D-Fuse, which has done video collaborations with Beck. ''They'll be the headlining A/V act,'' Mr. Amitai said, adding that he meant that in a cool way. (Saturday at 8 p.m., Eyebeam, 540 West 21st Street, Chelsea, eyebeam.org; $10.) MELENA RYZIK

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A Spare Times listing in Weekend on Nov. 16 about a Ukrainian event in Manhattan, using information provided by the New York Police Department and the mayor's Community Assistance Unit, referred to it incorrectly. It was a march to commemorate the death of millions of Ukrainians in the famine of 1932-33, which resulted from Soviet policies. It was not a Ukrainian Day Parade. A reader pointed out the error at the time and received a response from editors; the reader wrote to The Times again this week requesting a correction, which editors agreed was warranted.

HEADLINE: The Well-Shaped Phrase as Art

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
So here we are. Just about any scrap of canvas or even paper by Andy Warhol is worth at least a million dollars and usually several. Richard Prince's retro ''Nurse'' paintings have cleared $6 million less than five years after they were made. And Jeff Koons's least-interesting baubles, despite glimmers of anti-bauble intent, go for as much as $23 million. 
 Be grateful, then, for Lawrence Weiner's mind-stretching 40-year retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which is respite, wake-up call and purification rite all in one. It should be required viewing for anyone interested in today's art, especially people who frequent contemporary art auctions. 
 A joint effort of the Whitney and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, this profuse exhibition has been organized by Donna De Salvo, the Whitney's chief curator, and Ann Goldstein, the Los Angeles museum's senior curator. It honors a Conceptual artist who has made history, and plenty of memorable artworks, while influencing Barbara Kruger, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and Tony Feher, among others. Yet Mr. Weiner has largely and quite deliberately skipped over the production and marketing of salable, portable, immutable objects. 
 The show consists primarily of cryptic yet suggestive phrases in large letters, splayed across walls, ceiling beams and occasionally floors, that conjure up various physical situations but often leave to your imagination the objects or the scale involved. ''A Turbulence Induced Within a Body of Water'' could be hands splashing in a bathtub or a tanker churning waves behind it. ''Encased By + Reduced to Rust'' evokes a crumbling object, but it could also be a soul or an artist's talent. (And there is that twist of ''rust'' where you expect ''dust.'') 
 Containing nearly 120 works -- not including a large wall of posters and several vitrines of multiples -- this drastically overcrowded show comes close to reducing Mr. Weiner's work to a form of merchandise. But it is his first retrospective in this country, long overdue, despite many such shows in Europe. It has a big story to tell, and while this story will undoubtedly look better in the spacious sprawl of the Los Angeles museum's Geffen building, even here the show gives the lie to the current notion that market value is the primary measure of importance. 
 Mr. Weiner is rightly seen as a founding figure of Postminimalism's Conceptual arm, which includes artists like Douglas Huebler, Robert Barry, Joseph Kosuth and Sol LeWitt. But he might better be described as a language-based sculptor. He folds together the skills of a Russian Constructivist graphic designer, a Socratic philosopher, a Dada-Fluxus joker, a Concrete poet and a Madison Avenue ad executive with an astute sense of both semiotics and public display. And his penchant for starkly plain typefaces and for stacking phrases up walls like Judd boxes, combined with his emphasis on language's visual and spatial qualities, also gives him a few Minimalist bona fides.
 Mr. Weiner was born in New York in 1942 and graduated from Stuyvesant High School at 16. After studying at Hunter College for less than a year, he struck out on his own, painting, doing odd jobs and traveling around North America. He rubbed shoulders with the Beat poets in San Francisco and the Abstract Expressionists in Greenwich Village. In 1960 he briefly got into trouble by using explosive charges to make a series of small craters in a state park in Mill Valley in northern California. 
 Possibly the first earthwork, ''Cratering Piece'' continued to haunt Mr. Weiner after he returned to New York. His paintings became more sculptural, until one day he started carving a block of stone from the Brooklyn Bridge. Soon he became engrossed in just moving the block around on the table he built for it. He began to see art as a simple physical interaction, and this realization inspired him to write out similar interactions with objects. His basic unit of visual expression was set: the short, well-shaped phrase that could nonetheless operate on several levels at once -- physical, interpersonal, metaphorical, spatial and even political. 
 In 1969 Mr. Weiner issued a well-known statement of intent describing the three conditions in which his works could exist: they could be constructed by him, fabricated by someone else or not built at all. The Whitney show includes several executions of blunt early efforts that deploy different materials and actions, not all of which should be tried at home. Exhibit A is ''A Wall Cratered by a Single Shotgun Blast'' (carried out at very close range), as well as ''Two Minutes of Spray Paint Directly Upon the Floor From a Standard Aerosol Spray Can,'' exceptionally beautiful in hot pink. One of my favorites, spelled out but not executed, is ''A Square Removal From a Rug in Use.'' 
 Mr. Weiner's works are made for each situation as it arises. Most at the Whitney are presented in their unbuilt state, as language writ large or small on architectural surfaces of all kinds, or printed in books and catalogs or on matchbook covers, exhibition cards and posters. 
 It is clear even before you enter the museum that they can revive tired colloquialisms or lean toward obscurity. Stretched across the top of the Whitney's facade you'll see an optimistic incitement to look, only look, given a new exultant vantage point: ''As Far as the Eye Can See,'' the show's title, in huge yellow letters outlined in red. Considerably lower, in the sidewalk, a cast-iron manhole cover offers ''In Direct Line With Another & The Next.'' It is one of 19 manhole covers that permanently insinuate a bit of geometric order around Union Square, and has been brought uptown for the show.
 Later works have a haiku-type specificity, like ''Drops of Blue Water Forced Over the Rim of a Pot Made of Clay'' (1986), seen here in large orange letters outlined in blue. Politics is often part of the package, like the global tragedy (and responsibility) implied in ''A Glacier Vandalized.'' A work seen in drawings sharply addresses the present: ''We Are Ships at Sea Not Ducks on a Pond.'' Its first manifestation was in large wood letters attached to two pontoons floating in the harbor of Hamburg, Germany, in 1989. 
 Sometimes there is a strong erotic undercurrent, something that is more explicit in Mr. Weiner's films. Fittingly the 1994 work ''Stretched as Tightly as Possible/ (Satin) & (Petroleum Jelly)'' is placed across from several storyboards. Here it appears in large letters cut into a broad strip of shiny black vinyl, full of innuendo, but also sounding oddly like a recipe for a painting by Ed Ruscha, whose involvement with language is one of the precedents for Mr. Weiner's. 
 Because Mr. Weiner's words are mutable, appearing in one state and then another, they are not only continually remade but also renewed. In this way he subverts the notion of linear development and reflects a desire that his work not be -- as one piece puts it -- ''Distorted by the Assumption of a Direction.'' The visual nature of his art has changed with his ideas about scale, typeface and punctuation, and the addition of balletic loops, like the one that suggests the trajectory of a leaping fish in ''Taken to as Deep as the Sea Can Be.'' 
 Driven by the joy of language and quite a bit of humor, Mr. Weiner's ebullient work asks tough questions about who makes or owns art, where it can occur and how long it lasts. It reminds us that while art and money may have been inextricably entwined throughout most of history, art's realvalue is not measured in strings of zeros, high-priced materials or bravura skill, but in communication, experience, economy of means (the true beauty) and, yes, the inspired disturbance of all status quos.
 It also affirms that art ultimately triggers some kind of transcendence that can only be completed by the viewer. Mr. Weiner has elevated Robert Rauschenberg's famous dictum -- to the effect that ''this is art if I say so'' -- to the more inclusive ''this is art if you think so.'' His polymorphous efforts create situations in which such thoughts feel not only natural, they feel like our own.

HEADLINE: Writers' Strike Opens New Window on Hollywood

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
David D'Orsa, who last week passed his days among the stars, says he may soon be serving up lattes. Leonard Dick told his children they need to get better at turning out the lights. Meredith Buyrucu will go to San Diego this weekend to eat in her mother's kitchen, ''which is kind of embarrassing,'' she said, ''since I'm 40 years old.''
 When the Hollywood writers' strike pulled back the curtain on the world of television, what Americans saw was not a cashmere-wrapped actress alighting from her Escalade, but rather a bunch of middle-aged writers in ill-fitting red T-shirts standing on a picket line on Pico Boulevard. 
 With the strike deep into Week 2, thousands of union writers are unemployed until further notice, and dozens of assistants, food stylists, electricians, makeup artists, landscapers and thousands of other ''below the line'' workers in the industry are finding that their work is drying up, too, punching a psychic wound through large swaths of Los Angeles.
 ''It is a major topic around town,'' said Beth Holley, the office administrator at Global Effects Inc., a prop shop in North Hollywood. ''I don't think there are very many people who have not been affected directly or know someone affected.''
 The city's most defining industry, representing roughly 7 percent of its economy, has always operated with ample doses of smoke and mirrors. Elaborate marketing campaigns promote shows everyone knows will be canceled after a few episodes; unaffordable BMWs are leased by junior agents to save face at the Grill; actresses with eating disorders are given malteds to carry around on sets for waiting paparazzi. Much of what is said and done in Hollywood is meant to give the impression of solidity.
 But in reality, one tug on a card can make an entire production implode, rendering scores of people instantly unemployed. Many are middle-class laborers who populate the San Fernando Valley and other neighborhoods outside the glamorous canyons that most Americans associate with show business.
 Mr. Dick, a writer on ''House'' on Fox, said that wherever he goes in his red strike shirt -- his daughter's basketball game, for example -- another writer approaches to commiserate. ''You realize this really is a company town,'' Mr. Dick said.
 Producers who are usually absentee parents for the bulk of the fall season are now padding around the house, when they are not on a strike line. Writers with newly minted union cards wonder if they will ever get beyond their first jobs. Low level assistants have found themselves instantly out of work and desperate. 
 The Writers Guild of America West has a $13 million fund that will provide loans to ''members who face financial hardship because their income is demonstrably affected'' by the strike. 
 ''I've got big N.Y.U. loans and health insurance that I have to pay for,'' said Kimberly Mercado, who recently got her first writing job on the Fox show ''New Amsterdam'' and leased an Audi A4 to celebrate. ''That was my big excitement,'' Ms. Mercado said, adding that she hoped she would not have to give up the car.
 The strike, which has been the talk of coffee shops and playgrounds, is something of a metaphor for the broader labor force of Los Angeles, a place of enormous geographical and class division. It has pit studio executives against writers -- the bulk of whom are paid far less than high-profile strikers like Larry David -- and writers against some trade professionals, whose feelings about the strike are ambivalent at best. 
 ''Our people are middle-class workers,'' said Ed Brown, a business agent at the local trade union that represents 6,000 crafts people. ''These are not the people that people see at Hollywood insider parties. We are the collateral damage.''
 Mr. D'Orsa, an assistant to the executive producers of the FX show ''The Riches,'' said he would soon be headed to Starbucks, resume in hand. 
 Getbackinthatroom.blogspot .com is keeping a running tally of industry workers who have been laid off -- almost 250 as of Thursday afternoon. 
 ''I am unemployed thanks to both sides not wanting to lose face,'' said Ms. Buyrucu, a costumer on ''Grey's Anatomy'' on ABC. ''Yes, they have families, too, but they're making the choice. We don't have a choice.'' 
 And yet for as dominant a role as the entertainment industry may play in the minds of Americans, and as prevalent as the red shirts of strikers are on the Westside of Los Angeles, the ebb and flow of the broader life of the city is undisturbed. 
 ''It is tough to energize people to come up for middle-class and upper-middle-class people,'' said Fernando J. Guerra, director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University. ''Hollywood has always considered itself in L.A. but not part of L.A. They consider themselves a national industry.''

HEADLINE: Price Rise At Starbucks Cuts Visits And Shares

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Starbucks, the world's largest chain of coffee shops, lowered its profit and sales forecasts yesterday after reporting its first decline in customer visits.
 The shares fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. 
 The forecast revisions suggested that Starbucks was losing customers to McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, where a cup of coffee may cost $1 less.
 ''Starbucks is saying what the rest of the U.S. is saying, that the consumer is getting hit,'' said James Walsh, who helps invest $1.1 billion at Coldstream Capital Management in Bellevue, Wash. ''They're not immune.''
 Starbucks posted a quarterly profit that was up 35 percent on higher prices. But it lowered its sales and earnings forecasts after customer visits fell.
 The company said yesterday that earnings next year would be $1.02 to $1.05 a share, a gain of at most 21 percent but less than its previous forecast of a 22 percent increase. Analysts had been anticipating a profit of $1.05 a share.
 Starbucks lost customers after an increase in late July of 9 cents a cup caused some customers to go to competitors instead. Margins have also been hurt by higher dairy costs and the sales of less-profitable breakfast sandwiches and salads.
 The price increase was ''the right thing to do'' because of the rising costs,'' the chief executive, James L. Donald, said.. 
 ''Unbeknownst to us, we saw economic headwinds that quite frankly came up probably stronger than I thought,'' Mr. Donald said. ''The consumer is being faced with rising costs in every sector of their lives, and so part of that is reflecting on us.''
 Fourth-quarter net income advanced to $158.5 million, or 21 cents a share, from $117.3 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier, the company, based in Seattle, said in a statement. The results matched analysts' estimates. Revenue climbed 22 percent, to $2.44 billion.
 In trading yesterday, shares of Starbucks fell 15 cents, to $24.10, and then dropped $1.88, to $22.22 after hours. 
 The stock price has declined 32 percent this year on investor concern that sales at stores open at least a year may slow as the company tries to reach a goal of 40,000 locations worldwide.
 Sales at stores open at least a year increased 4 percent in the quarter.

HEADLINE: China Stand On Imports Upsets U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Few American industries have had more success in selling goods to China than makers of medical devices like X-rays, pacemakers and patient monitors. Which is why a recent Chinese decree was so troubling.
 The directive, issued in June, called for burdensome new safety inspections for foreign-made medical devices -- but not for those made in China. The Bush administration is crying foul. 
 Even more worrisome to the administration is that the directive seems part of a recent pattern in which Chinese officials issue new regulations aimed at favoring Chinese industries over foreign competitors, despite efforts by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to ease economic tensions.
 ''There is clearly a growing economic nationalism in China that is leading to discrimination against foreign investors in pillar sectors of the economy,'' said Myron Brilliant, vice president for Asia at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''It's not only a threat to foreign investors but it also undermines China's transition to a market-based economy.'' 
 The Chinese actions and the administration's concerns threaten to roil the atmosphere when Mr. Paulson goes to China in early December with other cabinet members in another round of the ''strategic economic dialogue'' that he began in September 2006. After seeking to defuse lingering trade disputes with China for the last 15 months, Mr. Paulson instead may have to tamp down fresh outbreaks.
 ''I can't tell you how many companies have come up to me -- software, chemicals, autos -- who say they're concerned about the trend,'' said a senior administration official, speaking anonymously to avoid antagonizing the Chinese. ''We're very troubled about the long-term direction on some of these policies.''
 The American concerns are shared in Europe, which like the United States, is growing more upset about the trade deficit with China.
 ''What we're seeing are growing industrial interests lobbying state authorities in China and giving them preferential treatment,'' Peter Mandelson, the top trade envoy of the European Union, said in an interview. ''The result is clear discrimination against foreign companies.''
 There has been little progress on Mr. Paulson's top priority of getting China to let the value of its currency rise, a step that would make imports from China more expensive and exports to China cheaper, and there are worries that the dialogue will increasingly be seen as useless.
 ''I wouldn't say it has hurt, but it has not helped very much,'' said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''Clearly the Chinese see the dialogue as a stalling mechanism to prevent Congress from putting up barriers to Chinese goods.'' 
 Mr. Paulson and his top aides say the dialogue has been beneficial by providing a framework in which to resolve disputes, even if it has yielded few short-term results. Even though exports to China are advancing at a rapid pace, they have done little to ease the alarms in Congress over the trade deficit with China, which this year is running well ahead of the $232 billion level of last year.
 ''The U.S.-China economic relationship has an enormous and growing amount of complexity,'' said David H. McCormick, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. ''In some areas we are making progress. In other areas, we're not making enough progress. But the agenda remains in the interest of both countries.''
 Mr. McCormick said he did not think the actions by China in the last year were new but instead reflected many years of Chinese industrial policy favoring domestic industries in aerospace and shipbuilding.
 But the medical device industry is one of several that seems to have been the target recently, administration officials say. The fear in Washington is that the growth of sales by big manufacturers like Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, and Boston Scientific, which have doubled since 2002, could be set back.
 ''If this decision is not reversed,'' said Nancy S. Travis, a vice president of AdvaMed, the industry trade association, ''it will result in boxes and boxes of medical devices piling up in Chinese ports, while potentially similar domestically produced medical devices are freely sold in the market.''
 Beyond the medical device sector were many other examples cited in a report in September by the Chamber of Commerce, drawing on the experience of businesses operating in China.
 China, said the report, had become ''increasingly sophisticated at developing and wielding industrial policies'' in procurement, standards and antimonopoly laws to the disadvantage of foreign investors and importers. Among the examples cited are standards for wireless technology, mobile phones and mobile phone batteries that favor Chinese companies, as well as antimonopoly laws that exempt Chinese government enterprises. 
 In the last year, the Commerce Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative have adopted tougher tactics, authorizing the expansion of duties on Chinese imports and taking China to court at the World Trade Organization. In response, China has denounced the American tactics and countersued at the W.T.O.
 For a time, administration officials say, China shut down its talks with the trade office over Chinese piracy and counterfeiting of software, drugs and videos. 
 Administration officials also say that the recent furor over the safety of Chinese food, toys, toothpaste and other products has taken its toll in the economic relationship, and they hope that Mr. Paulson's visit in December coincides with some new agreements to improve safety standards in both countries.
 The American medical device industry, according to some China experts, may be a victim of retaliation by some Chinese authorities because of complaints by the United States over unsafe and dangerous exports of Chinese products.
 These experts say that China's consumer product safety authority has been discredited by the recent disclosures of tainted products. That appears to have opened the door for a separate customs bureaucracy, which issued the new regulation that worries the Bush administration, to grab power from a rival agency.
 Of particular concern to Mr. Paulson have been efforts to open up China to access by American banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A former top executive at Goldman Sachs who had done many deals with China over the years, Mr. Paulson started the dialogue in part to accomplish this goal.
 The Chinese lifted some limits on access by financial firms during the last round six months ago. But the United States continues to complain about caps on foreign investment of financial service companies and limits on foreign ownership of Chinese banks.
 But even those skeptical of the results of Mr. Paulson's initiative say it has helped defuse some of the tension between the nations.
 ''If you look at the problems of the last few months, like the product safety issue, the strategic dialogue has served as a mechanism for dealing with them,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, director of the China program at the Brookings Institution. ''If the Chinese didn't have confidence in Paulson, we probably would have seen some uglier retaliations.''

HEADLINE: U.S. COURT VOIDS FUEL STANDARDS FOR SOME TRUCKS

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER and MICHELINE MAYNARD; Felicity Barringer reported from San Francisco and Micheline Maynard from Detroit.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court here rejected the Bush administration's year-old fuel-economy standards for light trucks and sport utility vehicles on Thursday, saying that they were not tough enough because regulators had failed to thoroughly assess the economic impact of tailpipe emissions that contribute to climate change.
 A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, voided the new regulations for 2008-2011 model year vehicles and told the Transportation Department to produce new rules taking into account the value of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
 The court, siding with 4 environmental groups and 13 states and cities, also asked the government to explain why it still treated light trucks -- which include pickups, sport utility vehicles and minivans -- more mildly than passenger cars. 
 Under the rejected rule, the average fuel economy of light trucks was to rise to 23.5 miles a gallon in 2010, up from the current standard of 22.5 m.p.g., but still well below the current standard for passenger cars of 27.5 m.p.g.
 The ruling, which is likely to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, represents a major setback for both the auto industry and the White House at a time of growing public concern over the rising price of gasoline and the issue of climate change.
 Lawyers specializing in environmental issues said on Thursday that the decision had significant implications beyond the automobile industry's struggles over fuel-economy standards. 
 It was the third federal court ruling in seven months pressing regulators to take the risk of climate change into consideration as they set standards for industries that emit carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases produced when oil, coal and natural gas are burned to produce energy. 
 ''What this says to me is that the courts are catching up with climate change and the law is catching up with climate change,'' said Patrick A. Parenteau, an environmental law professor at Vermont Law School. ''Climate change has ushered in a whole new era of judicial review.'' 
 In each case, starting with the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 ruling this year that the Environmental Protection Agency can regulate heat-trapping emissions, courts have found that federal officials must either grapple with the consequences of climate change or explain why they chose not to.
 In the latest decision, Judge Betty B. Fletcher wrote that the ''impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change is precisely the kind of cumulative-impacts analysis'' required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
 While the federal government may use a cost-benefit analysis to determine the ''maximum feasible'' fuel-economy standard, she added, ''it cannot put a thumb on the scale by undervaluing the benefits and overvaluing the costs of more stringent standards.''
 The appeals court, in a decision that was unanimous on all the major points, also chided the Bush administration for exempting larger S.U.V.'s -- those like the Ford Excursion and the Hummer H2 that weigh 8,500 pounds to 10,000 pounds -- from any fuel-economy standards.
 Among the environmental groups bringing the case were the Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 ''This is another major rebuke of the Bush administration's policy of ignoring global warming,'' said Aaron Colangelo, a lawyer with the N.R.D.C. 
 Kieran Suckling, policy director of the Center for Biological Diversity, called the decision ''a seismic change moment in terms of environmental regulation of all kinds in this country.''
 The ruling came after a decision two months ago by a federal judge in Vermont who rejected industry arguments that states like California, Vermont and New York were improperly usurping a federal prerogative when they set out to regulate tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide. The judge also ruled against the industry's argument that it was not feasible to comply with the state standards.
 The decision comes at a time when American auto companies, in particular, have been trying to paint themselves as more environmentally conscious and interested in developing more fuel-efficient vehicles. At this week's auto show in Los Angeles, for example, several automakers introduced a number of new hybrid-electric car and trucks.
 But Detroit and some foreign automakers have continued to lobby against the most stringent Congressional proposals to raise fuel-economy standards, supporting more modest proposals instead.
 ''Automakers support aggressive fuel-economy increases that would raise the standards for all vehicles to as much as 35 miles per gallon by 2022,'' Dave McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in a statement. At the same time, he said, the standards should seek ''a good balance of safety, higher fuel economy and jobs benefits for all Americans.''
 The Bush administration has called for an increase in fuel economy that would require fuel efficiency to rise about one mile a gallon a year for the next few years. Fuel standards have recently been raised in Europe and Japan, and China has imposed its first standards.
 Congress is debating several proposals for tougher auto-mileage standards and is beginning to address the broader question of setting a nationwide cap on the overall level of carbon dioxide and other global-warming emissions.
 As for the latest court ruling, Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said: ''We're in the process of reviewing the decision and we will consider all of our options'' -- among them is appealing the case to the Supreme Court.
 Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, a state that has been in the forefront of regulating greenhouse gases, called the decision a ''major victory'' and ''a stunning rebuke'' to the Bush administration. He added that it signaled to Congress that it ''must get serious about automobile efficiency and combating dangerous foreign oil dependency and global warming.'' 
 When the fuel-economy rules were introduced 19 months ago by Norman Y. Mineta, the transportation secretary then, they were estimated to cost auto manufacturers $6.7 billion and to add about $200 to the cost of the average vehicle. Environmentalists quickly attacked the rules, saying the industry could achieve far higher standards economically and technologically.
 That was at the core of the environmentalists' court challenge, accompanied by arguments that there was no clear explanation for treating light trucks differently from passenger cars and that bigger trucks should not be exempted from the federal standards.
 ''The need of the nation to conserve energy is even more pressing today'' than when the original fuel-economy law was enacted, Judge Fletcher wrote. ''What was a reasonable balancing of competing statutory priorities 20 years ago may not be a reasonable balancing of those priorities today.''

HEADLINE: A Gas Tax and Other Energy Ideas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Nov. 14):
 It has been clear for a long time that the Bush administration is not interested in an energy policy, or environmental policy, that will upset the status quo. And it has been equally clear that we are paying the price for that stubbornness, a very stiff price indeed. 
 The only bright note is that the clock will soon run out on this regime and a new one will be able to forge its own policies. These are the issues that we should force our presidential candidates to debate. 
 With the citizenry beginning to see the importance of safe and reliable sources of energy, and with more and more turning on to the green revolution, there is a real chance that, with new leadership, we'll finally break the stranglehold of the entrenched energy interests in this country. Don Ryan
 Westborough, Mass., Nov. 14, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman's column hits the nail right on the head. For the last 30 years, since Walter F. Mondale suffered a landslide defeat for having the courage to pledge to raise taxes in order to close the budget deficit, our national leaders have refused to show similar courage in addressing any difficult issue -- from the need for a gasoline tax to cut our dependence on foreign oil to the need to cut benefits or raise taxes to resolve the crisis in the Social Security system. 
 The politicians' lack of courage is regrettable but understandable, since they all want to get elected. What is more regrettable and completely incomprehensible is how the voting public and the media allow our leaders to get away with such cowardice. If we continue to allow the candidates in both parties to tell us only what we want to hear instead of the truth that we need to hear, we will deserve the inept leadership that we will get. Avi Moskowitz
 West Hempstead, N.Y., Nov. 15, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The burden of the proposed tax $1-a-gallon gas tax would fall squarely on the shoulders of the poor, the working poor and the lower end of the middle class. Folks who live in rural areas who are working poor often must drive many miles every day to work and to gain access to basic goods and services. This sector of the population cannot afford modern fuel-efficient cars and often has little access to meaningful public transportation. 
 Both of these options are easily available to the middle and upper-middle classes that live in big cities and have the resources to make meaningful changes in their oil consumption practices. 
 More regressive taxation will not solve any of our ever-growing economic disparities, and a gas tax especially only has the power to create wider divisions in our country. Silas Maddox
 Bakersville, N.C., Nov. 15, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 I applaud Thomas L. Friedman's call for a $1 gasoline tax, but I propose one major change to his plan: tax gasoline, but not diesel. Businesses would be much more likely to support this tax if their transportation costs were unaffected.
 Given that most consumer goods travel by diesel truck, we wouldn't see appreciable inflation on products other than gasoline. This would also encourage consumers to buy diesel cars that are more fuel-efficient than cars that run on gasoline.
 As an added bonus, diesel cars are able to run on biodiesel, which would further reduce carbon emissions. A win win, I believe. Tom Hassell
 Rowayton, Conn., Nov. 14, 2007
 To the Editor:
 What about a tax on gas to pay for this war? We could call it the Iraqi Freedom Tax. I can't think of a more tangible way, short of a draft, to bring the cost of this war home to the American people. 
 As you fill up your tank, you get to ponder exit strategies, or maybe you gaze down at your bumper sticker and feel good about supporting our troops. 
 Either way, we begin to think about the ramifications of this war, and just maybe Congress gets the veto-proof majority it needs to set some dates and begin planning our inevitable departure.

HEADLINE: It Was Clinton vs. Obama on Health Care

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
So whom is an uninsured voter to believe?
 In one of the liveliest exchanges of the Democratic debate last night, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said that Senator Barack Obama's health care plan ''would leave 15 million Americans out.'' That, Mrs. Clinton added in an ominous nod to the early nominating states, is ''about the population of Nevada, Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire.'' Mr. Obama countered that ''the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care.''
 The crux of their dispute centers on their overall approaches to health care. 
 Mrs. Clinton's plan would require all Americans to get coverage and would provide subsidies to make it more affordable. Mr. Obama's plan would require only children to have coverage; his plan would require employers to provide coverage or contribute to a new public program that would make insurance more affordable to people not covered by their jobs or by the government. 
 ''The only difference between Senator Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated -- forced -- them to get health care,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's not what I'm seeing around Nevada. What I see are people who would love to have health care. They desperately want it. But the problem is they can't afford it.''
 Many experts in health care agree that without a mandate, some people would not get coverage. The Clinton campaign puts that figure at 15 million people.
 The Obama campaign argues that a mandate might not be enforceable, and that if health insurance is affordable and attractive, most people will enroll. 
 About Mrs. Clinton's demographics of the early nominating states: According to 2006 census figures, the combined population of Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina is closer to 11 million.
 The idea of an individual mandate -- requiring people to have health insurance -- has long been debated by experts in health policy. A basic purpose of insurance is to protect people against the risk of high medical costs, and health economists say it is easier to manage such risks if more people, especially healthy people, are in the insurance pool.
 When the purchase of insurance is voluntary, people who expect to be sick are more likely to buy it, and insurers often try to deny coverage to those whom they expect to have high medical costs. Mrs. Clinton and other supporters of an individual mandate say it would reduce this problem. As a corollary, Mrs. Clinton would require insurers to offer coverage to anyone who applied.
 John Edwards would also require people to have insurance.
 Mr. Obama questioned last night how such a mandate would be enforced. ''She states that she wants to mandate health care coverage, but she's not garnishing people's wages to make sure that they have it,'' he said.
 His aides also circulated an article in which Mrs. Clinton was quoted as saying that she had not yet proposed any punitive measures for people who do not get health insurance. An aide to her said that a Clinton White House would work with Congress to create an enforcement mechanism.
 The major Democratic proposals to expand coverage would offer federal subsides to help people buy private insurance. The Clinton plan would cost an estimated $110 billion a year, the Edwards plan $90 billion to $120 billion a year, and the Obama plan $50 billion to $65 billion a year. All three say they would pay for their plans in part by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy.

HEADLINE: Late Shows Move to Help The Workers Not on Strike

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
With no end in sight to the strike by writers against networks and production studios, several hosts of late-night shows have begun taking steps to ensure that their nonwriting staffs receive some portion of their pay, at least in the short term.
 At the same time, producers of several shows, especially those based in New York, have been involved in back-channel talks in the last 10 days intended to find some way to get the shows back on the air as soon as possible. 
 Those efforts, which had hit some snags and might end after their existence was first reported last night on the Web site of the entertainment trade publication Variety, were intended to make sure none of the shows tried to break with the writers and come back on their own, according to several executives involved.
 But one executive said the talks did not get much farther than questions about what each show might be planning to do over the next few weeks. The executive said the talks were not that different from communications that go on routinely among the late-night shows when they have issues in common.
 Still, any move to bring the shows back could have been expected to be opposed by the Writers Guild, which has looked to the late-night shows as a first example of how the strike could be effective in halting TV production.
 Meanwhile, one late-night host, David Letterman, made a move to ensure that the staff of his ''Late Show'' on CBS as well as Craig Ferguson's ''Late Late Show'' would continue be paid, although not in full. Mr. Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants, owns both shows. The news of Mr. Letterman's plan was first reported on DeadlineHollywood.com.
 Yesterday, executives at two other late-night shows, ''Tonight'' and ''Late Night'' on NBC, said they were also working on plans to ensure their staff members would not face immediate layoffs and loss of income. An NBC spokeswoman, Rebecca Marks, said last night that NBC, which is a unit of General Electric, had assured the staffs of both shows that the network would continue to pay them for the next two weeks.
 The late-night shows have 100 to 200 nonwriting employees.
 The host of ''Late Night,'' Conan O'Brien, had been concerned enough to make a specific pledge to pay his staff members out of his own pocket should that need arise. But Mr. O'Brien does not own his show, and NBC pays for his staff.
 Jeff Ross, the executive producer of Mr. O'Brien's show, said: ''Conan has made an offer to pay to keep the staff going as long as possible. Conan has been telling the network for some time that he will go into his own pocket for this. But we're hoping it will not be necessary because G.E.'s pockets are a lot deeper than Conan's.''
 Through this week, the Letterman employees were being paid their full salaries. Yesterday, Worldwide Pants issued a statement said that shows scheduled for next week have been canceled and a decision has been made about how to continue to pay the nonwriting staff. 
 The statement did not spell out the formula, but an executive involved in the decision described the economic breakdown: An employee making $2,000 a week or less would be paid in full. For salaries above $2,000 a week, the employee would receive 50 percent of anything over $2,000, except that no employee would receive more than $4,000 a week.
 The staffs of the two Worldwide Pants shows have been promised that they would receive the payments through at least the beginning of January, although the shows go back into production before then. The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details of the compensation were private, said that the shows would decide whether to continue to cancel production on a week-by-week basis.

HEADLINE: China Tilting Away From Longtime Trading Partners

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THE economy of China continues to grow rapidly, but the benefits of that growth are no longer being spread as widely around the world, with Europe a particular loser as its exports to China begin to fall.
 That trend, if it continues, is likely to slow growth in both the United States, which needs a strong export performance to offset a weakening domestic economy, and in Europe, where some signs indicate recent growth may be about to weaken anyway.
 This week, China reported that its trade surplus for October came to a record $27 billion, a figure that is larger than its surplus for the entire year of 2003. 
 But even as it was posting a record surplus, China was reporting that its imports were at the lowest level in several months, and were particularly weak from Europe.
 Over the last three months, China imported an average of $9.7 billion a month from Europe, a figure that was almost 5 percent lower than imports in the same three months of 2006. It was China's biggest year-over-year decline in imports from Europe since 1998, when China was only a marginal presence in world trade, rather than the dominant force it has become.
 Chinese imports from Japan and the United States are still growing, but at a slower rate than they had been.
 At the same time, Chinese imports from the rest of the world -- other than Europe, the United States and Japan -- are growing at a rapid pace that seems likely to continue. At the beginning of this decade, about half of China's imports came from those three industrial areas. Now their combined share is down to a third.
 That may reflect a growing Chinese thirst for commodities, including food products and oil, and a declining appetite for the kind of machines that it once needed to gear up its industrial capacity. Many of those machines came from Germany, which as recently as mid-2004 was running an annual trade surplus with China of about $8 billion. Now Germany is running an annual deficit of more than $3 billion, contributing to a European deficit of $135 billion over the last 12 months.
 The European deficit with China is still smaller than that of the United States, with a figure of $162 billion, but the gap is narrowing. The American deficit is 18 percent higher than it was a year earlier, while the European one has grown by 46 percent.
 China has come under increasing pressure from the United States and Europe to allow its currency to appreciate, something it began to do in 2005, During the most recent 12 months, through October, the dollar lost 5.3 percent of its value against the Chinese yuan.
 But by letting the yuan slowly rise in value against the dollar, China allowed it to fall against other currencies during a time of dollar weakness. The euro gained 7.6 percent against the yuan, while the British pound rose 3.3 percent. Those currency movements have worsened the competitive position of European exports against competing products from the United States or Japan, whose currency fell 1.3 percent against the yuan. Japan runs a trade surplus with China, which has been rising recently.
 All the figures in this article, and in the accompanying charts, are from Chinese government reports. China's figures for its trade surplus have been well below those reported by its trading partners, for reasons that are not completely clear. But the trends shown in those figures are presumably accurate, even if the levels are open to question.

HEADLINE: One Market Remains Sound: Money Is Still There for Best Art

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Never mind the gyrations on Wall Street or the subprime mortgage and equity crisis. There's still plenty of money out there and an unquenched appetite for art. At least that seems to be the verdict after a two-week round of auctions at Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips de Pury & Company, with bidders paying record prices for everything from a rare Matisse to a red heart sculpture by Jeff Koons. 
 Those with long experience in the art world can tick off other uncertain times: the recession in the early 1970s, when prices for every kind of collectible plummeted; the period after Black Monday in the fall of 1987, when prices of Impressionist paintings leapt to unimaginable heights on the strength of Japanese buying power; the Persian Gulf war, when appetites soured, and distress sales predominated; and the November after 9/11, when the market just about limped along. 
 Despite all the theorizing that the new rich in Europe, Russia and the Middle East would capitalize on the weak dollar and snap up prized artworks, Americans ended up being the dominant buyers.
 ''Everyone was expecting bumps, but there weren't many,'' said Allan Schwartzman, a Manhattan art adviser after Sotheby's sale of contemporary art on Wednesday evening. ''The amount of money out there is staggering.'' 
 So are the numbers of art dealers and advisers counseling the rich. Taking their advice, collectors tended to go for works that were top-rate, and these brought the highest prices. When something had been quietly shopped around, was overpriced or second-rate, it either did not sell or sold below its estimate. 
 In the first week of sales of Impressionist and modern art, for instance, Christie's was able to pull off a successful night on Nov. 6 because it had the goods -- and at the right estimates. Its star, Matisse's 1937 painting ''L'Odalisque, Harmonie Bleue,'' a richly patterned canvas depicting Lydia Delectorskaya, a Russian emigre and one of the artist's preferred models, brought a record price of $33.6 million. 
 Sotheby's sale the next night was doomed by mediocrity. Two of the priciest works had problems. While a stunning Gauguin from this artist's Tahitian period normally brings big prices, ''Te Poipoi'' (''The Morning''), an 1892 painting of a woman squatting in the water with her dress hiked up around her waist, failed to pass muster. The painting barely sold. A lone telephone bidder, the Hong Kong collector Joseph Lau, bought it for $39.2 million, including Sotheby's commission. 
 At the same sale, a sun-dappled work, ''The Fields (Wheat Fields),'' one of the last painted by van Gogh before he died in 1890, went unsold. The word on the street was that it had been offered to collectors by two dealers for months before it went to auction. It was an expensive round for Sotheby's, which acknowledged that it had lost $14.6 million in guarantees. (To win consignments, auction houses often issue guarantees to prospective sellers, agreeing to fork out a minimum sum even if the work does not sell.)
 Popular taste these days still gravitates toward postwar and contemporary art. Both Sotheby's and Christie's were able to post impressive results over the two weeks of sales with works by artists like John Chamberlain, Richard Prince, Mr. Koons and Lucian Freud selling well beyond their estimates. Still, some works failed to sell or drew only one bidder, and often the result was expensive for the auction house. In the heat of competition, auction houses had granted guarantees that exceeded estimates, a highly risky strategy. 
 As always, rumors have been flying about who bought what. Appropriately enough, Laurence Graff, the London jeweler, is thought to have bought Jeff Koons's ''Diamond (Blue),'' a monumental sculpture of a diamond resting on four gold prongs that went for $11.8 million. The British artist Damien Hirst scooped up a 1969 self-portrait by Francis Bacon for $33 million; the Los Angeles financier Eli Broad took home Mr. Koons's ''Hanging Heart'' for $23.5 million. 
 Steven A. Cohen, the hedge-fund billionaire, did a bit of shopping too. Bidding through several different art dealers, he is said to have bought several artworks, among them Francis Bacon's 1969 ''Second Version of Study for Bullfight No. 1,'' for $45.9 million. 
 The mystery is half the fun. It is also part of the problem. As the auction houses continue giving sellers undisclosed guarantees, as well as a percentage of the fee they charge buyers, it is hard to pin down what kind of profits they will ultimately make. Complicating the situation, when Sotheby's or Christie's is nervous that a work will not do well, it is not unusual for the house to contact potential buyers and offer special payment terms. 
 Although the relatively strong results brought a flood of relief to the auction houses, the fear is still palpable. Had buyers been scared off by the rocky financial markets, these companies would be facing losses of millions of dollars and warehouses of scorched art. 
 There is certain to be more caution the next time around. The auction houses may not be so quick to offer sellers such risky incentives. Collectors fearing that the market has passed its peak may be more reluctant to part with the treasures on their walls unless they have no choice. The result could be a more sober market. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the outcome of the big fall art auctions in Manhattan misidentified the buyer of ''Hanging Heart,'' a sculpture by the artist Jeff Koons that was sold at Sotheby's on Nov. 14. Although speculation about the buyer's identity centered last week on the Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad, Mr. Broad says he did not purchase the work.

HEADLINE: Bargains Before the First Bite

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Yes, the economic outlook is grim.
 But they call it the holiday shopping season for a reason. For all the dour predictions, Americans will still mob the malls in search of the right gift at the right price.
 Here is a guide to the five trends that are likely to dominate the gift-buying season that (officially, at least) begins next week. 
 PRE-TURKEY SHOPPING Disregarding the last known boundaries between tradition and capitalism, retailers are trying to persuade Americans to start their Black Friday shopping before the first bite of Thanksgiving dinner.
 The biggest offender is CompUSA, the technology store. The chain -- the first retailer to open at 12:01 a.m. on the Friday after Thanksgiving two years ago, then at 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving last year -- is holding an online-only sale this year at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving. 
 ''Before you pop the turkey into the oven, you can buy online,'' said the chain's spokeswoman, Jessica Nunez, who added that the sale was not an intrusion into a national holiday, but ''just another option'' for time-starved, deal-hungry consumers.
 Remember when Black Friday, so-called because historically retailers become profitable that day, was actually on Friday? Well, we don't either, and neither, it seems, do retailers.
 The rule breaking began with Wal-Mart, which has held miniature Black Friday sales every weekend of November, in a brazen attempt to rearrange the holiday shopping calendar -- and, of course, to steal business from its competitors. Every Friday morning since Nov. 2, it has offered door-buster discounts starting at 6 a.m.
 Now, seemingly everyone is following suit. Toys ''R'' Us has held door-buster sales every Friday and Saturday this month (including one this morning, starting at 7 a.m.)
 Kmart will open at 7 a.m. on Thanksgiving this year and, on Black Friday, J. C. Penney is opening an hour earlier than last year, at 4 a.m. 
 Stores will reward the early birds with food. CompUSA is offering pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving night and several malls are serving Maxwell House coffee at 6 a.m. on Black Friday. One retailer, Best Buy, is having none of it. The chain is closed on Thanksgiving and opening at the comparatively reasonable hour of 5 a.m. on Friday morning.
 Brian Lucas, a company spokesman, said the chain ''believes this is the right thing to do for our customers, who have come to think of Black Friday morning as somewhat of a tradition to start the shopping season, and to our employees, who value having time with their families on Thanksgiving day.''
 BE YOUR OWN ROCK STAR The toy industry wants to turn every child under 10 into a self-made rock star, with a genuine guitar in one hand and a video game version in the other.
 As if in lock step, every major toy maker -- like Hasbro and Mattel -- has put a guitar-based game in its product lineup and every big retailer has put those products on its top 10 toy list. 
 The companies say they are piggybacking on the runaway success of Guitar Hero, the video game guitar system; the popularity of Hannah Montana, the rock star television character; and the enduring strength of the reality show ''American Idol.''
 ''Whenever a trend is as hot as this, a lot of people come up with the same idea,'' said Neil B. Friedman, the president of Mattel Brands.
 He should know. This holiday season, the Fisher-Price unit of Mattel is rolling out the I Can Play Guitar System ($100), for children 6 and older, a mock guitar that hooks up to a television. Users learn to play by matching color-coded hand positions on the screen to those on the toy guitar. 
 Hasbro is introducing the Power Tour Electric Guitar ($70), which teaches users to play 12 preloaded songs or plug in an MP3 player and strum along to a favorite song. There are touch sensors in place of the strings, though.
 For the less dexterous, Tech2Go is marketing American Idol Talent Challenge ($50), a guitarless DVD-based game that resembles karaoke. Players can sing up to 12 preloaded songs on the game's microphone, then wait for an unvarnished review from ''American Idol's'' hosts: Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul.
 And, of course, there is the latest iteration of Guitar Hero, called Legends of Rock, for PlayStation, Xbox or Wii video game systems. The technology, from Red Octane, remains unchanged: users try to match notes on a guitar with those on the screen.
 The only downside to the new toys? Kids might actually want to grow up to be rock stars, with all the baggage that entails. The chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, Gerald L. Storch, is unperturbed. ''What could be more wholesome than music?'' he said. 
 THE ELECTRONIC COMPASS For five years, two electronics, the MP3 player and a flat-screen television, have owned the holiday shopping season, dominating the covers of brochures from big chains like Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Circuit City.
 This year, those technologies have met their match: portable G.P.S. systems, which can be used in cars, on bicycles and for hiking. 
 ''G.P.S. will be the technology of the holiday season,'' Ronald Sargent, the chief executive of Staples, predicted in an interview. 
 The reason is that prices for the units, which use three-dimensional screen images and verbal commands to direct users from one location to another, have fallen to $200 for the cheapest models, down from $1,000 several years ago. 
 The once-bulky devices have also shrunk, to three to five inches in width. And now that cab drivers and rental car agencies have started using the systems, thousands of consumers are seeing the devices in action -- and want one of their own.
 Major retailers are stocking a variety of models, but the brands may sound unfamiliar: Garmin, Mio, Tom-Tom and Magellan. (Sorry, Sony and Apple are not big players in the G.P.S. business.)
 The popular Garmin Nuvi 680 Personal Travel Assistant ($800) has a color screen that adjusts its brightness to sunlight and offers real-time information on weather conditions, traffic reports, gas prices, even local movie times.
 A more affordable version is made by Moi. The C230 Portable G.P.S. Navigator ($200) offers turn-by-turn directions, announced by the system, and warnings when the driver is speeding.
 Andre Sam, who manages a Best Buy store on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, said G.P.S. ''has really picked up in popularity,'' adding: ''The flat-panel TVs have been done. This is the gift for the person who already has everything.''
 A MARTHA CHRISTMAS This year's most highly anticipated retail face-off is Martha Stewart vs. Martha Stewart. 
 The domestic diva turned law breaker turned rehabilitated talk- show host is the subject of dueling marketing campaigns at Kmart and Macy's, where she has designed two strikingly similar home decor lines. 
 And we mean similar. The names? The Martha Stewart Collection (at Macy's) and Martha Stewart Everyday collection (at Kmart). The prices? A towel at Macy's for $7.99 and a towel at Kmart for -- you guessed it -- $7.99.
 Kmart came first, of course, in 1997, with Martha Stewart Everyday, a best-selling line of sheets, towels and dishes. But troubles have befallen Kmart since it merged with Sears, and Ms. Stewart's company, vexed with the chain's poor performance, struck a deal for a higher-end line with Macy's, much to Kmart's regret.
 Macy's print and television marketing blitz for the Martha Stewart Collection began this fall and, not to be outdone, Kmart reintroduced the Martha Stewart Everyday collection about the same time. 
 Bill Stewart (no relation), the chief marketing officer at Kmart, said the chain needed to revamp the Martha line to ''reclaim our rightful place as the leader for price and value in the home department.'' 
 A result is that Ms. Stewart's face is plastered across newspaper circulars, TV screens and telephone booths across the country.
 Which line does Martha favor? Officially, she loves all her children equally. But in September, Ms. Stewart brought the audience from her TV show up to Macy's Herald Square store in Manhattan for a tour of her new product line. She did not, however, make a similar pilgrimage across the avenue to the Kmart store on 34th Street. 
 No matter, said Mr. Stewart. ''What we see, from our consumer research, is that there is much more knowledge that Martha Stewart is at Kmart'' than at Macy's. 
 MERRY MARKDOWNS What is bad for retailers -- a tough economy -- is good for bargain hunters, in stores and online. 
 After the weakest fall shopping season in a decade, retail analysts predict the return of deep desperation discounts this holiday. The worse a store's performance, the steeper the markdowns.
 Here are the chains with weak sales so far: Macy's, Nordstrom, Abercrombie & Fitch, Chico's, Ann Taylor, and Limited, the owner of Express and Victoria's Secret. 
 In a reversal from years past, reliable price slashers like Gap and Aeropostale have cut their orders, anticipating a slowdown, so discounts will be sparse. 
 ''But don't kid yourself,'' said John D. Morris, an analyst at Wachovia Securities, ''it is still going to be a more promotional Christmas season.'' Mr. Morris, who keeps a running tally on discounts, says markdowns are already up more than 7 percent this holiday season over last year, ''and rising fast.'' 
 The big online discount this season is free shipping, with no conditions, for many Web sites the Monday after Thanksgiving, known as Cyber Monday, because consumers return to work from a weekend of mall browsing and buy online. 
 This year, an estimated 25 percent of Web retailers will offer free shipping, no matter how small the order, on Nov. 26. Among them are Joann.com, the Web site of Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts; HSN.com, the home shopping network Web site; and Giftcertificates.com, a site that sells gift cards from hundreds of stores.
 Most retailers provide free shipping for orders $50 or higher. Doesn't it seem that stores lose money on $10 online orders, shipped from New York to California? 
 ''The number of sales it generates more than offsets the cost of free shipping,'' said Laura Thorpe, the e-commerce manager for marketing at Bealls, a department store offering no-condition free shipping next Monday on its Web site, www.Bealls.com

HEADLINE: Case of Mother Torn From Baby Reflects Immigration Quandary

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Federal immigration agents were searching a house in Ohio last month when they found a young Honduran woman nursing her baby.
 The woman, Saida Umanzor, is an illegal immigrant and was taken to jail to await deportation. Her 9-month-old daughter, Brittney Bejarano, who was born in the United States and is a citizen, was put in the care of social workers. 
 The decision to separate a mother from her breast-feeding child drew strong denunciations from Hispanic and women's health groups. Last week, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency rushed to issue new guidelines on the detention of nursing mothers, allowing them to be released unless they pose a national security risk. 
 The case exposes a recurring quandary for immigration authorities as an increasing number of American-born children of illegal immigrants become caught up in deportation operations. With the Bush administration stepping up enforcement, the immigration agency has been left scrambling to devise procedures to deal with children who, by law, do not fall under its jurisdiction because they are citizens. 
 ''We are faced with these sorts of situations frequently, where a large number of individuals come illegally or overstay and have children in the United States,'' said Kelly A. Nantel, a spokeswoman for the agency. ''Unfortunately, the parents are putting their children in these difficult situations.''
 Yesterday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released new written guidelines for agents, establishing how they should treat single parents, pregnant women, nursing mothers and other immigrants with special child or family care responsibilities who are arrested in raids.
 The guidelines, which codify practices in use for several months and apply mainly to larger raids, instruct agents to coordinate with federal and local health service agencies to screen immigrants who are arrested to determine if they are caring for young children or other dependents who may be at risk. The agents must consider recommendations from social workers who interview detained immigrants about whether they should be released to their families while awaiting deportation. 
 The new guidelines were a response to intense criticism from officials in Massachusetts about one raid, at a backpack factory in New Bedford in March. They do not specifically address the American citizen children affected by raids, whose numbers have only become clear in recent months. 
 About two-thirds of the children of the illegal immigrants detained in immigration raids in the past year were born in the United States, according to a study by the National Council of La Raza and the Urban Institute, groups that have pushed for gentler deportation policies for immigrant families. 
 Based on that finding, at least 13,000 American children have seen one or both parents deported in the past two years after round-ups in factories and neighborhoods. The figures are expected to grow. Over all, about 3.1 million American children have at least one parent who is an illegal immigrant, according to a widely accepted estimate by the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington. 
 Under the 14th Amendment, any child born in the United States is a citizen and cannot be deported. But with very rare exceptions, immigration law does not allow United States citizen children to confer legal status on parents who are illegal immigrants, until the children are 18 years old. While the federal government does not keep statistics on the children of deportees, immigration lawyers said that most immigrants who are deported take their children with them, even if the children are American citizens. 
 ''Children have no rights to keep family members here because they are citizens,'' said Jacqueline Bhabha, a lecturer at Harvard Law School who specializes in citizenship law. When parents face deportation, she said, the law ''penalizes United States citizen children by forcing them to choose between their family and their country.''
 Ms. Umanzor, 26, was arrested in her home on Maple Street in Conneaut, Ohio, on Oct. 26 and was released 11 days later on orders of Julie L. Myers, the head of the immigration agency. While in detention, Ms. Umanzor did not see her daughter Brittney, who had been fed only breast milk before her mother's arrest. Ms. Umanzor remains under house arrest with Brittney and her two other children in Conneaut, 70 miles east of Cleveland, under an order for deportation. Her lawyer, David W. Leopold, has asked that her deportation be delayed on humanitarian grounds. 
 Ms. Umanzor had been at home with two of her three children, both American citizens, when the immigration agents arrived, along with a county police officer carrying a criminal warrant for a brother-in-law of Ms. Umanzor who also lived in the house.
 As the agents searched, Ms. Umanzor breast-fed her jittery baby, she recalled in an interview after her release. 
 The baby was born in January in Oregon, where Ms. Umanzor's husband, also Honduran and an illegal immigrant, was working in a saw mill. 
 Through a quick records check during the raid, the immigration agents discovered a July 2006 order of deportation for Ms. Umanzor, who had failed to appear for a court date after she was caught crossing a Texas border river illegally.
 The agents detained her as a fugitive. She was forced to leave both Brittney and the other American daughter, Alexandra, who is 3, since the agents could not detain them. 
 ''Just thinking that I was going to leave my little girl, I began to feel sick,'' Ms. Umanzor said of the baby. ''I had a pain in my heart.'' 
 Ms. Umanzor turned over her daughters to social workers from the Ashtabula County Children Services Board, who had been summoned by the immigration authorities. In all, the social workers took in six children who lived in the Maple Street house, including Ms. Umanzor's oldest child, a son born in Honduras. They also included three children of Ms. Umanzor's sister, an illegal immigrant who was at work that day. Four of the children were born in the United States. 
 In jail and with her nursing abruptly halted, Ms. Umanzor's breasts become painfully engorged. With the help of Veronica Dahlberg, director of a Hispanic women's group in Ashtabula County, a breast pump was delivered on her third day in jail. Brittney, meanwhile, did not eat for three days, refusing to take formula from a bottle, Ms. Dahlberg said.
 After four days, the county released all six children to Ms. Umanzor's sister, who managed to wean Brittney to a bottle.
 On Nov. 7, after two dozen women's health advocates and researchers sent a letter protesting Ms. Umanzor's detention, Ms. Myers issued a memorandum instructing field officers ''to exercise discretion'' during arrests by releasing nursing mothers from detention unless they presented a national security or public safety risk. 
 In cases where the breast-feeding children were United States citizens and entitled to public services, Ms. Myers urged the officers to seek assistance from social agencies to ''maintain the unity of the mother and child.'' 
 In their study, released this month, La Raza, a national Hispanic organization, and the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington, examined three factory raids in the past year, in Greeley, Colo.; Grand Island, Neb.; and New Bedford. A total of 912 adults arrested in the raids had 506 children among them, three-quarters of whom were under 10 years old. About 340 of those children were born in the United States. 
 The study found that the children faced economic hardship after one or both of their bread-winning parents were detained or deported. Many families hid for days or longer in their homes, sometimes retreating to basements, the study reported. Although many children showed symptoms of emotional distress, family members were reluctant to seek public assistance for them, even if the children were citizens, fearing new arrests of relatives who were illegal immigrants. 
 Groups advocating curbs on immigration say that children of illegal immigrants cannot be spared the consequences of their parents' legal violations just because they are American citizens. 
 ''Children are not human shields,'' said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. ''Nobody wants to hurt anybody's kids. But any time parents break the law, it has an impact on their children.'' 
 Joseph Hammell, a lawyer from the Minnesota firm of Dorsey & Whitney who is conducting a separate legal survey of recent raids for the Urban Institute, noted that the authorities were guided by immigration law, which includes few of the protections for citizen children that are basic in family and criminal courts. 
 ''In the context of immigration and deportation proceedings,'' Mr. Hammell said, ''we are completely out of step with our societal values of protecting the best interests of our children.''
 Ms. Nantel, the immigration agency spokeswoman, said the primary responsibility for the plight of the American children of illegal immigrants rests with parents who violated the law. ''It's a challenging situation'' for the agency, Ms. Nantel said. ''It's unfortunate that children are impacted negatively by the decisions of their parents.''

HEADLINE: Fed Governor, Hinting of Steady Policy, Says a Rate Cut Would Have Few Benefits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor said yesterday that another interest rate cut would probably offer few additional benefits to the economy, a hint that the central bank plans to hold rates steady at its meeting next month. 
 Members of the Fed are usually circumspect. But Randall S. Kroszner, who will vote at the bank's policy meeting on Dec. 11, offered a surprisingly candid view that the current benchmark interest rate of 4.5 percent should sustain economic stability, even in what he acknowledged would be a difficult fourth quarter.
 ''The current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year,'' Mr. Kroszner said in remarks to the Institute of International Finance in Manhattan. 
 He added that central bankers might not be swayed by a new batch of poor economic data, although there may be plenty on the way. The Fed announced yesterday that industrial production fell 0.5 percent in October. 
 ''A sequence of data releases consistent with the rough patch for economic activity that I expect in coming months would not, by themselves, suggest to me that the current stance of monetary policy is inappropriate,'' he said.
 Mr. Kroszner warned that the housing recession was likely to worsen and predicted weaker home sales and a cutback in consumer spending as mortgage rates rise and foreclosures increase. But he said he expected the economy ''to return to its longer-run sustainable rate'' after a difficult few months. ''Conditions for subprime borrowers will get worse before they get better,'' he said.
 The Fed surprised market watchers in September when it cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by half a percentage point. That move sent stock markets soaring as investors hoped easier credit would stimulate the economy and allay the subprime turmoil.
 But markets began to fall as financial companies announced billions of dollars in write-downs related to mortgage-backed securities. In October, the Fed cut interest rates again by a quarter-point.
 The bank's statement at the time suggested a reluctance to ease rates further. In his remarks, Mr. Kroszner warned against a series of consecutive rate cuts, suggesting such a move could set off inflation. ''All else equal, each successive action in the same direction tends to lower the incremental benefits and to raise the incremental costs of additional actions,'' he said.
 Mr. Kroszner also acknowledged that the Fed's move last month was influenced by fears of a substantial stock market sell-off.
 ''To no small extent, stresses in financial markets contributed significantly to those macroeconomic risks,'' he said, referring to the problems confronted by the Fed in its October and September meetings.
 Robert A. Dye, senior economist at PNC, said, ''The Fed in October very clearly telegraphed that they would not ease in December.'' That view has been echoed in subsequent speeches by Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman. 
 But investors who bet on the bank's actions still believe a cut may be on the way. Futures markets now predict a quarter-point cut with 86 percent certainty.
 Brian Bethune, an economist at the research firm Global Insight, suggested that Mr. Kroszner's speech was ''an attempt to steer the market a little bit back toward more reasonable expectations.''
 ''The market's got ahead of itself,'' he said. ''It's difficult to interpret things right now.''
 Mr. Kroszner's comments came as the government released a surprisingly weak report on industrial production. The overall decline of 0.5 percent in October was the first since May, as manufacturers felt the effects of consumers' concerns about high oil prices. 
 The weak dollar has kept domestic business activity growing as foreign demand increases, but the report suggested companies are taking a more conservative stance, lowering inventories in anticipation of a spending slowdown.
 ''Exports can only take you so far,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. ''I think we're starting to see the evidence pile up of the effects of weaker domestic demand.'' He added, ''There doesn't seem to be much reason for optimism, with housing continuing to decline.''

A ruling by a federal appeals court this week to throw out proposed fuel-economy standards is likely to accelerate efforts in Congress to set higher requirements for all vehicles, industry analysts said Friday.
 Detroit auto companies had been lobbying to soften proposals for higher fuel economy, and the court ruling, which voided the Bush administration's year-old standard for light trucks because it did not take pollution issues into account, represents an unexpected setback to that effort.
 Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has pledged that an energy bill, which is expected to include proposals for higher fuel-economy standards, will be acted upon before the end of the year. The Senate passed legislation last summer that calls for increases on a faster timetable than automakers say they can meet. 
 On Thursday, a federal appeals court in San Francisco sided with 4 environmental groups and 13 cities and states in asking the government to explain why it set lower fuel-economy standards for light trucks, including minivans, sport utilities and pickups, than it did for cars. 
 The auto companies have argued that the higher standards in Congressional proposals would force them to discontinue some of their biggest sport utilities and pickups, essentially limiting customers' choices. 
 But sales of big S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans are down anyway this year, essentially canceling out that argument. 
 In fact, the strongest category in the automobile industry this year is small S.U.V.'s, like the Toyota RAV-4 and Ford Escape, with year-to-date sales up more than 26 percent from 2006, according to figures from Autodata. 
 Crossover vehicles, which have many S.U.V. features but are built on car platforms, are also selling strongly, with sales up 17 percent from 2006.
 Many of those vehicles already have fuel-economy ratings that would meet the higher standards that Congress is considering.
 The three-sided attack, by the courts, Congress and consumers, may make it almost impossible for Detroit companies to win the easier regulations that they have sought.
 ''The fuel-economy debate is not only being driven by a regulatory push, but a customer pull,'' said John A. Casesa, an auto industry analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group. ''We're at a point where most politicians are too skeptical to even listen to the industry's argument.'' 
 To be sure, automakers have said they can live with higher fuel-economy levels. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers says it supports measures that would increase fuel economy by 2022 and maintain separate levels for cars and trucks.
 The Senate bill would require all vehicles to achieve 35 miles per gallon by 2020, while some House proposals require higher fuel economy.
 Cars must now meet a standard of 27.5 miles per gallon, which has been unchanged for years, while light trucks now must get 22.5 m.p.g. That was set to rise to 23.5 m.p.g. under the rules set aside by the appeals court.
 In recent weeks, the chief executives of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler have all visited Washington, as part of a bid for restraint. And they are rolling out more fuel-efficient vehicles, like the hybrid-electric Chevrolet Silverado that G.M. displayed at the Los Angeles auto show this week.
 At the same time, Ford's chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., said automakers should not bear an undue burden when it comes to the environment.
 ''We need to do our part, but we're only a piece of a much bigger puzzle,'' Mr. Ford said at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
 Analysts said such stances were unlikely to win much sympathy in Washington, where auto companies successfully fought higher fuel-economy standards by arguing that the changes would lead to job cuts and lost profits. That happened anyway, as the companies failed to respond to the shift away from big vehicles.
 Mr. Casesa said the carmakers were paying the price for that past success. Now, with the mood in the country favoring higher fuel standards, ''their lack of credibility in Washington has put them in a very tough spot,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Condemned to Death and Capitalism

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
In recent years politically minded American filmmakers have, with reasonable cause, turned their artistic attention to the Iraq war and the various domestic policy issues that have arisen from it. And so the treatment of struggles in other parts of the world may have been sacrificed in some sense to that cinematic fashion. 
 ''Pu-239,'' which makes its debut tonight on HBO, arrives with an impressive pedigree and an imaginative nobility. Based on a short story by the itinerant Ken Kalfus -- a writer who has lived in Moscow, Dublin and the Bronx and been compared to Calvino and Hemingway -- the film counts George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh among its executive producers. Scott Z. Burns, a producer of Al Gore's film ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' wrote and directed it with the intention of bringing into sharper view the twisted glitter, cacophony and terror of post-Soviet Russian life.
 The clever premise of the film has a dying man embracing capitalist impulses at their most perverse to secure his family's financial future in the face of his employers' malevolent neglect. Exposed to weapons-grade plutonium -- Pu-239 -- in the deteriorating nuclear plant where he has worked, Timofey (Paddy Considine) becomes a scapegoat for the inefficiencies that have led to his radiation poisoning. When the plant fails to take responsibility, he decides to steal some Pu-239 and sell it on the global black market.
 The slow pacing and gloomy tones of Mr. Burns's camera create the despairing mood, which precludes any notions of whistle-blowing by Timofey. The nuclear suspense dramas of the late 1970s and early '80s (''The China Syndrome,'' ''Silkwood'') fed on paranoia: the goal was to make you nervous. But Mr. Burns has oddly created a thriller that essentially fails to unsettle. 
 The film is at once too broad and too intimate -- lyrical voice-overs about the meaning of family and the temporality of happiness mix with moments of gang comedy. It comes at the mess of modern Russian life -- the story is set in the mid 1990s -- from every possible entry point: petty mobsters in gold chains shaking down shopkeepers, corruption high and low, the infiltration of McDonald's, opportunistic women eager to prostitute themselves to the highest foreign bidder.
 In his effort to unload his merchandise, Timofey teams up with an aspiring gangster, Shiv, played by Oscar Isaac with nimble humor but doomed in his own right. Still the contrast between the men is too stark for their connection to seem authentic. And once they pair up, we find the film shape-shifting again into an exploration of male bonding.
 Mr. Burns quite understandably found a lot to excite him in his subject. But he welcomed too much of the noise.
 PU-239
 HBO, tonight at 8; Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time.
 Written and directed by Scott Z. Burns from a short story by Ken Kalfus; Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, Peter Berg, Zanne Devine, Armyan Bernstein, Ben Cosgrove, Jennifer Fox and Peter Berg, executive producers; Charlie Lyons, Miranda de Pencier, Guy Jon Louthan, producers.

HEADLINE: OPEC Gathering Finds High Oil Prices More Worrisome Than Welcome

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
As oil prices hover around $95 a barrel, OPEC might be expected to celebrate. Its members are reaping record revenues, demand for their product keeps rising and the world economy seems capable of sustaining oil prices that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago. 
 But the oil-producing group faces an increasingly uncertain environment, one that is casting a pall over an OPEC gathering here. Fears are rising that high oil prices will help throw the global economy into recession. The dollar, the currency usually used in oil trading, is falling, and concern is growing in many quarters about the effect of fossil fuels on the planet's climate. 
 In short, as leaders of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in the capital of Saudi Arabia for a rare summit meeting this weekend, high prices and rising consumption are seen even within OPEC as a mixed blessing. 
 ''These prices are potentially dangerous, especially if they remain high,'' said Mohamed bin Dhaen al-Hamli, the oil minister for the United Arab Emirates. ''We cannot remain complacent.''
 In recent days, oil ministers have resisted calls to increase output and ruled out any changes until the next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 5 in Abu Dhabi. Saudi Arabia in particular is eager not to overshadow this weekend's gathering with a discussion about supplies and prices.
 At the same time, Saudi officials were relieved to see oil fall from its record close of $96.70 a barrel, set last week. No one here wanted to see prices reach the politically charged figure of $100 just as OPEC leaders were meeting in Riyadh. Oil futures, which have more than tripled in price in four years, closed at $95.10 a barrel in New York on Friday.
 The two-day meeting will focus on such issues as security of supplies and environmental policy. OPEC is eager to show it is both a reliable oil supplier that has not failed its customers and that it is attuned to concerns about the environment, especially ahead of a United Nations meeting on climate change next month in Bali. The group wants to begin an environmental initiative focusing on ways to capture and store the carbon dioxide that results from burning fossil fuels, instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.
 ''We do not like policies that discriminate against petroleum or fossil fuels in general,'' Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, said during a news conference on Tuesday. ''It behooves us to find a technological process that will make the continued use of fossil fuels possible.''
 OPEC's 12 members, an eclectic group that includes Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and the latest member, Angola, account for about 40 percent of the world's oil exports and 80 percent of its proven reserves. Ecuador is set to rejoin the group this weekend after dropping out of OPEC in the 1990s.
 President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is becoming increasingly vocal in his calls for OPEC to revert to its more militant position of the 1970s. This week, Mr. Chavez proposed that OPEC devise a plan to sell oil to poor countries at much lower prices while charging wealthy nations more. The cartel, he said, should ''raise its level of political action.'' Such language does not go over well with Saudi officials, who are worried about Mr. Chavez's presence here.
 Hossein Adeli, the chairman of the Ravand Institute for Economic and International Studies, in Tehran, said there would always be a temptation to bring politics into OPEC. ''Oil and gas are the most political commodities in the world,'' he said. 
 Unlike Mr. Chavez, most members of the cartel are annoyed by their inability to rein in an oil market heavily influenced by financial operators, like hedge funds and pension funds.
 ''We are so perplexed and so frustrated with the idea we have anything to do with these prices,'' said Prince Abdel Aziz bin Salman, the deputy petroleum minister of Saudi Arabia.
 OPEC countries have indeed benefited immensely from the surge in oil prices. The 12 members are expected to receive $658 billion in revenue this year, up from $605 billion last year, according to a recent estimate by the Energy Information Administration. Next year, their revenue could rise to $762 billion, according to the energy agency.
 At the same time, the price of everything from drilling rigs to multibillion-dollar processing plants for oil or natural gas has double or tripled, and caused project delays or cancellations. In Kuwait, a plan for a new refinery was shelved after the expected construction cost jumped to $14 billion from $7 billion.
 ''The rise in prices has been a nightmare for producers,'' said Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's energy minister.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report on Climate Details Risks of Inaction

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: VALENCIA, Spain, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
In its final and most powerful report, a United Nations panel of scientists meeting here describes the mounting risks of climate change in language that is both more specific and forceful than its previous assessments, according to scientists here.
 Synthesizing reams of data from its three previous reports, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the first time specifically points out important risks if governments fail to respond: melting ice sheets that could lead to a rapid rise in sea levels and the extinction of large numbers of species brought about by even moderate amounts of warming, on the order of 1 to 3 degrees. 
 The report carries heightened significance because it is the last word from the influential global climate panel before world leaders meet in Bali, Indonesia, next month to begin to discuss a global climate change treaty that will replace the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012. It is also the first report from the panel since it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October -- an honor that many scientists here said emboldened them to stand more forcefully behind their positions. 
 As a sign of the deepening urgency surrounding the climate change issue, the report, which was being printed Friday night, will be officially released by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday. 
 The full report was embargoed from news organizations until Saturday. But drafts have been circulating for weeks, and descriptions of its findings began to appear on Web sites and in news agency reports on Friday. Bush administration officials held a news conference to discuss the report but insisted that their comments be withheld until after its official release. 
 ''This document goes further than any of the previous efforts,'' said Hans Verolme, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Global Climate Change Program. ''The pressure has been palpable -- people know they are delivering a document that will be cited for years to come and will define policy.'' 
 The previous three sections, released between February and April, focused on one issue at a time: the first on science, the second on how the world could adapt to warming and the third about how countries could ''mitigate,'' or reduce the greenhouse gases produced.
 This fourth and final assessment -- the so-called synthesis report -- seeks to combine lessons from all three. Its conclusions are culled from data contained in the thousands of pages that were essentially technical supplements to the panel's previous publications. How that data is summarized and presented to the world is a powerful guide to what the scientists consider of utmost importance at the end of a five-year process, offering concrete guidelines for policy makers.
 ''You look to a synthesis report to provide clarity, to clarify what was obscure in previous reports,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. ''Now, how can we take these findings and formulate a policy response that's quick enough and big enough?'' 
 While drafts of the panel's reports are written by panels of scientists, the language is reviewed and often altered by delegates from 130 governments who meet before their final approval and release. Those negotiations took place here this week, and were often contentious, with the United States, China and India raising many objections, said scientists who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to publicly refer to any countries by name. 
 The scientists and country representatives who had flocked here this week to participate in negotiations on the final wording applauded as the panel's chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, declared the panel's years of work concluded, just after 10:30 p.m. on Friday.
 Even though the synthesis report is more alarming than its predecessors, some researchers believe that it still understates the trajectory of global warming and its impact. The I.P.C.C.'s scientific process, which takes five years of study and writing from start to finish, cannot take into account the very latest data on climate change or economic trends, which show larger than predicted development and energy use in China. 
 ''The world is already at or above the worst case scenarios in terms of emissions,'' said Gernot Klepper, of the Kiel Institute for World Economy in Kiel, Germany. ''In terms of emissions, we are moving past the most pessimistic estimates of the I.P.C.C., and by some estimates we are above that red line.''
 The panel presents several scenarios for the trajectory of emissions and climate change. In 2006, 8.4 gigatons of carbon were put into the atmosphere from fossil fuels, according to a study in the proceedings of the National Academy of Science, which was co-written by Dr. Klepper. That is almost identical to the panel's worst case prediction for that year.
 Likewise, a recent International Energy Agency report looking at the unexpectedly rapid emissions growth in China and India estimated that if current policies were not changed the world would warm six degrees by 2030, a disastrous increase far higher than the panel's estimates of one to four degrees by the end of the century.
 While the United States, Saudi Arabia and China tried to change the text in order to play down the consequences of global warming, developing nations -- which will bear the initial brunt of climate change -- were much more forceful than at previous meetings in opposing these efforts, one scientist who was in the negotiating room said.
 ''I suspect that will continue,'' he said. ''As they feel more and more threatened by the sea and the storms they will insist that, as one of them put it, 'We do not want this report to be warm and fuzzy when the reality is cold and risky,' or something like that,'' he said.
 One novel aspect of the report is a specific list of ''Reasons for Concern.'' It includes items that are thought to be very likely outgrowths of climate change that had been mentioned in previous reports, like an increase in extreme weather events. 
 But it for the first time includes less likely but more alarming possibilities, like the relatively rapid melting of polar ice. Previous reports focused more on changes the scientists felt were ''highly likely.''
 ''This time, they take a step back and look at the totality,'' Dr. Verolme said. ''Saying it is less likely to occur, but if it does we are fried.''
 One such area is the future melting of ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica. In earlier reports, the panel's scientists acknowledged that their computer models were poor at such predictions, and did not reflect the rapid melting that scientists have recently observed. If these areas melt entirely, seas would rise 40 feet, scientists said. While scientists are certain that the sheets will melt over millennia, producing sea-level rises, there is now evidence to suggest that it could happen much faster than this, perhaps over centuries. 
 ''In my view that would make it not just difficult, but impossible to adapt successfully, some of my colleagues would say catastrophic,'' said Dr. Oppenheimer. ''If they say that it's possible that melting could occur in centuries leading to meters of change, that's a headline.''
 This final report also puts more emphasis on the ripple effect of small degrees of temperature change, some of which are already being seen, such as species extinctions and loss of biodiversity.
 ''A relatively modest degree of warming -- one to three degrees -- spells a lot of trouble and I think that was not clear in the previous report,'' Dr. Oppenheimer said. He said part of the reason for the lack of clarity was that governments had ''messed around'' with the language and structure of the report during the approval process. 
 This time around, the consequences of different degrees of climate change will be better laid out so that the ministers who meet in Bali next month will understand the options and the consequences of inaction. ''This should light a fire under policy makers,'' Dr. Oppenheimer said.

HEADLINE: The M.B.A. Under Attack

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL. 
Complete links are at nytimes.com/business. E-mail: whatsonline@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THERE is a rising reaction against management theory, according to The Economist. A new book by the management expert Gary Hamel, ''The Future of Management,'' notes that several well-known executives of hot companies -- among them, Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google and John P. Mackey of Whole Foods Market -- did not go to business school.
 More to the point, another new book, by the Harvard Business School professor Rakesh Khurana, ''charts how management science declined from a serious intellectual endeavour to a slapdash set of potted theories,'' as The Economist characterizes it (economist.com). 
 That book, ''From Higher Aims to Hired Hands: The Social Transformation of American Business Schools and the Unfulfilled Promise of Management'' is ''academic'' and ''dense,'' according to Business Week, but it still manages to be scathing. Business schools not only fail to produce the best managers but also repudiate professionalism by emphasizing individual achievement over company loyalty, according to Mr. Khurana (businessweek.com). 
 Now come the contrarians. A study by Nick Bloom, an assistant economics professor at Stanford University, and John Van Reenen, an economics professor at the London School of Economics, concludes that companies using the most widely accepted management theories taught by business schools outperform their peers in productivity, sales growth and return on capital (stanford.edu/nbloom). According to the authors, ''these measures of better management practice are strongly associated with superior firm performance.''
 ''That this is at all controversial,'' concludes The Economist, ''shows how far management theory has fallen from its peak,'' when it was expected to become a science.
 SILICONE VALLEY? The entertainment industry, Marc Andreessen writes, ''is in the early stages of being rebuilt in the image of Silicon Valley.'' And the Hollywood writers strike is only going to hasten that transformation, especially if it goes on for a long time (blog.pmarca.com).
 Mr. Andreessen, the founder of Netscape, writes in his blog that the strike, ''and the studios' response to the strike, may radically accelerate a structural shift in the media industry -- a shift of power from studios and conglomerates towards creators and talent.''
 He compares the industry's generally clumsy handling of new media and piracy to that of the recording industry. ''The situation already wasn't looking too good,'' he writes, ''but the one even more effective way to alienate viewers than attacking their viewing options is to actually kill the programs they are watching.''
 HEAT UNTIL LEGIBLE The annual report of a Croatian food company, Podravka, must be baked before it can be read.
 Designed by the creative agency Bruketa & Zinic, the report, titled ''Well Done,'' must be wrapped in foil and heated for 25 minutes before its thermo-reactive ink reveals itself, according to the design blog Dezeen, which presents pictures and cooking instructions (dezeen.com). Included as an appetizer is a small booklet with ''great Podravka recipes,'' according to the agency. ''If you are not precise, the booklet will burn, just as any overcooked meal.''
 Oh, yes, the company's results. Podravka, which bills itself as the biggest food company in southeast Europe, reported that operating income was up 3.39 percent in the third quarter. It is safe to assume that if the annual report contained bad news, the company would not have evoked the imagery of cooking books. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Will Trim State Work Force

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
About 500 state employees in Rhode Island are expected to lose their jobs, Gov. Donald L. Carcieri announced on Friday. The state is trying to close a projected $450 million budget gap for the next fiscal year. 
 Mr. Carcieri's office sent termination notices to 153 employees on Thursday and told 330 others they would probably lose their jobs by July 1, although it will likely be sooner, said Jeff Neal, a spokesman for Mr. Carcieri, a Republican. 
 The administration expects the cuts to save $41.6 million. The state is expecting to save a total of $100 million a year with the additional layoffs of 168 contract workers on Nov. 1 and losing nearly 500 positions through retirement and attrition. The state has 15,000 employees. 
 ''From the governor's point of view, this is one of the last options we have,'' Mr. Neal said. ''It is not an option that he would have preferred to take, at least not in this fashion. 
 ''But with the dramatic nature of our growing deficit problems and the fact that these problems have occurred every year and are projected to occur every single year in the future,'' he continued, ''the governor believed it was important to make a significant structural change.''
 Other states also have fiscal problems. Arizona and Florida are operating under or projecting budget deficits, stemming in part from weak housing markets, said Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Massachusetts, officials project a $1.3 billion deficit for the next fiscal year. In Maryland, Gov. Martin O'Malley is asking lawmakers to help close a $1.7 billion shortfall. 
 California's chief budget analyst urged lawmakers on Wednesday to cut spending immediately or raise taxes to help shrink the a $10 billion budget gap. It came to light three months after the budget passed, showing a $4 billion reserve. Energy costs and housing problems have been huge drains on the economy. 
 ''There are assumptions in every budget,'' the State Senate Republican leader, Dick Ackerman of Irvine, said. ''You hope that they don't all go bad. But last year, many of them did.''
 In Rhode Island, a significant number of layoffs will come from the five social service agencies Mr. Carcieri seeks to consolidate. A list shows sheriffs workers, nurses, janitors, prison counselors and lawyers are to be laid off.
 Officials said the projected shortfall was caused by decreased revenue, increased expenditures and stagnant employment growth. In addition to the projected shortfall, the state also has to close a current $150 million gap. Mr. Neal said Mr. Carcieri, legislative leaders and other officials planned to meet next week to work on solutions. 
 Steven M. Costantino, chairman of the House Finance Committee, said the state had been grappling with huge deficits for years and had to come up with creative ways to reverse them. 
 ''Rhode Island is on a really bad course,'' Mr. Costantino said. ''I do think that every level of government has to participate in solving this problem, and I do think that sacrifices in all levels of government including personnel are going to have to be made.''
 Ellen Frank, a senior economic analyst at the Poverty Institute at Rhode Island College, said she believed that the state faced such a large deficit because many tax cuts were enacted in the last decade, drastically cutting revenue. 
 ''Rhode Island has structural deficit problems, meaning that this is not simply due to an unusual drop in revenue,'' Ms. Frank said. ''This is a deeper problem that has to do with shifts in the state's economy and a lot of tax cutting,'' 
 Mr. Neal and Mr. Costantino disagreed, saying that taxes were still too high and that raising them might drive away business. Union leaders said Mr. Carcieri's plan affected the most vulnerable agencies and low-wage workers.

HEADLINE: Indian Coalition Wins Political Dispute Over Nuclear Pact

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
The government's Communist allies gave Prime Minister Manmohan Singh significant breathing room on Friday to push ahead in pursuing a landmark nuclear accord with the United States. 
 The Communists, who have vigorously opposed the accord, said they would allow the government to go ahead with talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations monitoring group, which must give its blessings before India can gain access to nuclear technology on the world market.
 Mr. Singh has pushed for the accord at great cost to his government, which has come under fiery criticism from both right and left. The rightist Bharatiya Janata Party denounced the deal as a threat to India's nuclear weapons program, while the Communists objected to it on the ground that it would deepen ties with the United States. 
 Mr. Singh's government relies on the four Communist parties to maintain a majority in Parliament, and last month, in a sting to the White House, Mr. Singh conceded publicly that he would not allow the government to fall in order to save the deal, which is considered the centerpiece of a new amity between India and the United States.
 But after a closely watched meeting on Friday, the Communists gave the government the go-ahead, and the government, which has said the deal does not require a vote in Parliament, agreed to consult a committee before entering into any binding agreements with the global agency. 
 Domestic politics seems to have tempered the stand of both sides. 
 The main leftist party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has in recent weeks come under growing criticism in one of the two states it controls, West Bengal, over its handling of a local peasant rebellion. 
 The ruling Congress Party appears hesitant to force a confrontation with its leftist allies before a crucial state election in Gujarat, which is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. 
 Still, it remains unclear whether the opening provided by the Communists will give India the time it needs ultimately to get the deal through the United States Congress before the presidential campaign season intensifies, potentially making it harder to get bipartisan legislation passed. 
 Privately, American officials, who admit to being shocked by the Indian back-stepping, have made it known to New Delhi that its reluctance to advance on the deal could cost the country dearly, on everything from military cooperation to American support for its bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council. 
 Strobe Talbott, a deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration and now president of the Brookings Institution, said chances of getting the deal through the Congress would diminish over time and make it difficult to negotiate a similar deal with a future administration anytime soon, whether Democratic or Republican. 
 ''This has got to happen soon, or it's going to be on ice for a very long time,'' he said from Washington. 
 Indian government officials for their part privately say that while the delays over the nuclear accord could damage the country's credibility in the short term, India will remain an attractive long-term partner for the United States. Trade between India and the United States has grown by 20 percent a year over the last five years, to $32 billion in 2006, according to the United States Census Bureau. 
 ''Look at the cards we hold, even though we are the losers in this in the short run,'' Lalit Mansingh, a retired Indian diplomat, who served in Washington until 2004. ''Our economy is growing, it's a big market for American companies, and there are choices for India.''

HEADLINE: Yankees Use Economics to Their Advantage

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
With Alex Rodriguez virtually back in pinstripes, the Yankees have come full circle in an episode that epitomizes what separates them from the Boston Red Sox.
 If World Series championships determine success, then the Red Sox' system has recently trumped the Yankees' modus operandi. The Yankees are like the Energizer bunny with money: they keep spending and spending and spending. The Red Sox, at some point, draw a line and deal with the consequences.
 Think back to four years ago, when the Red Sox were negotiating a blockbuster trade with the Texas Rangers, Rodriguez for Manny Ramirez. They were the two highest-paid players in baseball -- Rodriguez at $252 million for 10 years, Ramirez at $160 million for eight years. In putting together the deal, the teams were trying to equalize the money owed as best they could. 
 Rodriguez agreed to adjust his contract to save Boston money, but the Players Association said no, contending that it would cost Rodriguez too much money. The union made a proposal, but the Red Sox rejected that idea because it would have cost them an additional $16 million. The deal died. 
 But if the Yankees been in Boston's position, they almost certainly would have agreed to the deal and paid the extra.
 Just look at recent developments. The Red Sox have not re-signed their third baseman, Mike Lowell, because he wants a fourth year in the contract and they are holding firm at three years. The Yankees, however, gave Jorge Posada the fourth year he wanted to remain with them.
 The Lowell negotiations are reminiscent of Johnny Damon's free agency two years ago. The Red Sox offered Damon four years, but would not go beyond $40 million. The Yankees offered four years and $52 million, and Damon defected. 
 A year earlier, the Mets snatched Pedro Martinez from the Red Sox by giving him the all-important fourth year that Boston wouldn't. 
 Larry Lucchino, the Red Sox' chief executive, wouldn't talk abut the Yankees' negotiating strategy and spending policies, but he explained how the Red Sox approach negotiations.
 ''We deliberate long and hard on every individual free-agent signing,'' he said, ''and try to assign a value and length to a contract and work to get it done within those parameters.''
 The Red Sox adhere to those parameters, even if their position results in the loss of popular players. 
 In the case of Lowell, who was the team's leading run producer this year and was the World Series most valuable player, Lucchino said: ''We made it clear that we very much want to sign Mike Lowell for a multitude of reasons. But we won't have anything further to say on that unless and until we have an announcement to make.''
 On the matter of a fourth year for Lowell, Lucchino said, ''No comment.''
 The Yankees have a looser signing strategy. If they want a player, whether he's theirs or someone else's, they usually do what it takes to sign him.
 With Posada this month, they thought they had lost Rodriguez and that they couldn't afford to lose Posada, too. They also didn't know if Andy Pettitte would be back, and still don't; and they have yet to re-sign Mariano Rivera. The prospect of losing all four productive players was unappetizing.
 Had they known that Rodriguez would return, would they have given the 36-year-old Posada the extra year? Probably, considering his performance this season and the absence of a catcher to replace him. If the Yankees have to overpay for a player they want by giving him an extra year, they consider it the cost of doing business. 
 The commissioner's office wasn't happy with the Posada contract, but the Yankees believed that if they hadn't given four years to Posada, the Mets would have. The Mets had met with Posada and were prepared to make an attractive offer.
 The Yankees didn't want to offer Rivera $45 million for three years -- they first offered $40 million -- but they don't want to lose him. In this instance, though, the Yankees say they will not give Rivera the fourth year he wants. 
 They have already received nasty looks and comments from other teams and the commissioner's office for their three-year offer to Rivera, their closer. They should be safe in resisting a fourth year because it is highly unlikely that any other team would offer that much money for a relief pitcher who will be 38 on Nov. 29, with the wear and tear his arm has endured for 12 years, including 12 postseasons.
 A member of the Yankees' hierarchy acknowledged that the Red Sox' philosophy is right in limiting the number of years. But the Yankees can afford to be flexible on length of contracts because they have the financial resources to accommodate extra years. The Red Sox don't have that economic luxury.
 Neither the Yankees nor the Red Sox wanted to discuss their strategies.
 ''This is not the type of topic suitable for public debate during the free-agency period, if at all,'' Lucchino said. ''We're not interested in disclosing to other clubs what our policies and approaches may be.''

HEADLINE: English, Algebra, Phys Ed ... and Biotech

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MORE than a decade ago, after George Cachianes, a former researcher at Genentech, decided to become a teacher, he started a biotechnology course at Lincoln High School in San Francisco. He saw the class as way of marrying basic biotechnology principles with modern lab practices -- and insights into how business harvests biotech innovations for profit. 
 If you're interested in seeing the future of biotechnology education, you might want to visit one of George Cachianes's classrooms. ''Students are motivated by understanding the relationships between research, creativity and making money,'' he says. 
 Lincoln has five biotech classes, each with about 30 students. Four other public high schools in San Francisco offer the course, drawing on Mr. Cachianes's syllabus. Mr. Cachianes, who still teaches at Lincoln, divides his classes into teams of five students; each team ''adopts'' an actual biotech company. 
 The students write annual reports, correspond with company officials and learn about products in the pipeline. Students also learn the latest lab techniques. They cut DNA. And recombine it. They transfer jellyfish genes into bacteria. They purify proteins. They even sequence their own cheek-cell DNA.
 Cool, eh? And very, very important.
 We know the refrain by now: the United States, birthplace of most of the great commercial advances of the last 60 years, must increasingly rely on overseas talent, otherwise known as imported brains, to maintain an edge.
 Talented immigrants are crucial to American vitality, and employers are smart to woo them. But research universities aren't content to rely only on the overseas pipeline, and are working to make science and engineering studies more appealing to American students.
 Sometimes overlooked in this mix is how high schools can help cultivate a fresh crop of scientists, engineers and lab technicians. Secondary science and mathematics education is on the rise, with growing numbers of students in more challenging classes. Enrollment in advanced biology and physics courses doubled from 1997 to 2004, nearly doubled for advanced math and rose 50 percent for advanced chemistry, according to the National Science Foundation. 
 Advanced classes are just one response to the drive for more American innovators. Another is to give high school students more hands-on experience with innovation, which, in the real world, is how researchers pursue their passions. Exposing students to experiments, data crunching and lab floors, of course, helps make academic abstractions more concrete.
 ''We moved away from hands-on learning when we thought computers could simulate everything,'' says G. Wayne Clough, president of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and a member of the National Science Foundation's board. ''Now we're moving back to hands-on, and high school is a great place to begin.''
 Some public high schools are giving students lab experiences that approach, or even exceed, those found in university settings. And some teachers see an economic payoff in all of this. Biotechnology, for example, remains a promising field, and companies in the industry have less math-intensive demands than electronics and computing employers. So biotech is a popular field with students and is emerging as an educational proving ground.
 ''Our whole goal is to transform the work force,'' says Xan Simonsen, who coordinates the biotech program for high schools in Mesa, Ariz. The schools follow a curriculum very similar to San Francisco's, including an emphasis on learning about the biotech business. 
 To be sure, biotech lab work is expensive. Mr. Cachianes's classroom in San Francisco has about $500,000 of equipment, obtained mainly through grants and donations from local companies. (The spending total was similar for the Mesa district's biotech labs.) 
 ''What Mr. Cachianes is doing is very high end, but he shows what's possible,'' says Paul A. Hanle, president of the Biotechnology Institute, a nonprofit group in Arlington, Va., that provides training for secondary school teachers.
 While the institute promotes a low-cost alternative for teachers that it labels ''biotech on a shoestring,'' Mr. Hanle says ''high-end programs in high schools are growing significantly.''
 San Francisco's high schools continue to have one of the most sophisticated biotech programs in the country, perhaps because of the city's proximity to thriving biotech companies.
 THREE years ago, Mr. Cachianes began offering a second, more advanced biotech course in response to requests from seniors who had done well in his other class. Last spring, Wendell Lim, a molecular biology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, learned about the course and chose five graduating seniors to work in his lab over the summer.
 Active in the emerging field of synthetic biology, which marries engineering, computing and biotech, Dr. Lim wanted the team of students to enter a Massachusetts Institute of Technology contest. 
 Dr. Lim asked Mr. Cachianes's graduating seniors to carry out two experiments: one to create a protein ''scaffold'' to control the flow of information in a cell, and the other to create the cellular version of an electronic bar code. ''These kids took a while to gain confidence, but by the end of the summer, their experimental work was as good or better than a lot of our graduate students','' Dr. Lim said.
 This month, the Lincoln-U.C.S.F. team, all of whose members now attend public universities and colleges in California, flew to M.I.T. to present its findings. Competing against 57 teams from universities representing 20 countries, it snared one of six finalist spots. A team from China won. 
 The lesson here is that seeds of innovation are sown in high school -- and that setting higher expectations can encourage better performance. ''Our kids can shatter limits,'' Mr. Cachianes says, ''if we adults take a risk and give them the chance to try.''

HEADLINE: The Lottery Industry's Own Powerball

BYLINE: By RON STODGHILL

 BODY:
STANDING recently in a Knoxville stadium filled with roaring University of Tennessee football fans, Rebecca Paul Hargrove, the highflying impresario of legalized gambling, proudly waved a symbolic check for a billion dollars. The moment, captured on jumbo screens across the stadium, was among the countless plugs for the fund-raising prowess of Tennessee's lottery, which Ms. Hargrove started four years ago. 
 As lottery executives go, few can claim her knack for seizing the spotlight. No matter the occasion, Ms. Hargrove, a former Indiana beauty queen turned Powerball potentate, has proved especially gifted at navigating -- some say plowing -- her way onto center stage. Often, there is a Salem Menthol 100 or a Diet Coke in her hand. Always, issued in her trademark husky voice, is a less-than-subtle play for a few of your hard-earned dollars.
 ''Anytime you buy gas, I want you to spend the change on a lottery ticket,'' says Ms. Hargrove, the president and chief executive of the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation. ''That's what I do. I raise the money, and the state spends it.'' 
 Cantankerous, kinetic and shrewd, Ms. Hargrove, 58, embodies what many consider to be the virtues and vices of the lottery industry, from the rise in prize payouts to the proliferation of games and escalating executive compensation. Over the last two decades, she has built three of the nation's largest state lotteries from scratch -- Florida, Georgia and Tennessee -- turning them into multibillion-dollar enterprises that have helped fuel the industry's explosive growth. At each turn, she has used her perch to reshape state-sponsored gambling into a highly sophisticated commercial enterprises peddling products that are as ubiquitous as Cokes or Snickers.
 Her track record, coupled with senior positions on several industry boards and influential committees, has given Ms. Hargrove a strong hand in creating the template for the nation's lotteries, influencing everything from the design and marketing of games to the legislation under which lotteries operate.
 ''Rebecca has pretty much written the big book on lottery start-ups,'' says Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association, a nonprofit industry group. ''Anyone starting a lottery today, if it's not Rebecca, will certainly be making a trip to talk to Rebecca.'' 
 Politicians covet the billions that new-style lotteries generate for their states -- $56 billion last year. But there are financial and social costs. Ever-increasing prize payouts and marketing costs take a big bite out of money that could be going into education or other government programs. And the proliferation of faster, more addictive games can entice some people into spending huge proportions of their incomes on lottery tickets. 
 ''The problem with lotteries is that they take money away from low-income people, or those most would agree should not be used as a tax base,'' says Earl L. Grinols, author of ''Gambling in America: Costs and Benefits'' and an economics professor at Baylor University. ''While the argument is that playing the lottery is voluntary, I suspect that those players spending a disproportionate amount of their income on lottery don't completely understand the probabilities of winning and losing that go with the lottery.''
 Tom Grey, spokesman for the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, a nonprofit advocacy group, is also a critic of lotteries and Ms. Hargrove's involvement with them. ''This is not a benign product,'' he says. ''This is an addictive product, and she has made it as American as apple pie.'' 
 For her part, Ms. Hargrove contends that the vast majority of lottery customers play responsibly. She also says the commercialization of state lotteries is necessary to compete for consumers inundated with other products, many of which, like lottery tickets, are generally bought on impulse. That lotteries are government-backed is irrelevant in the marketplace, she adds. 
 ''I believe in a corporate structure where you are free from all political influence,'' she says, sitting in her spacious office in Nashville, its walls crowded with awards and professional memorabilia. ''The more you have the ability to make a decision based on what's right for the corporation, the more you will maximize your profits.''
 Hiring Ms. Hargrove has certainly paid off for Tennessee. Within five months of her arrival, the lottery introduced 29 instant-ticket games and two online games, and awarded $227.5 million in prizes. In those first months of 2004, it surpassed financial projections by more than 40 percent by transferring $123 million to the state's education fund and $2 million into after-school programs. 
 ''There is everybody else and then there is Rebecca,'' says Marvell R. Mitchell, a member of the Tennessee Lottery Board, which recruited Ms. Hargrove. ''She brings home the bacon -- more bacon than anyone else -- wherever she is.''
 ALONG with having a reputation for swiftly ramping up new lotteries, Ms. Hargrove is known for running them efficiently. The core mission of 23 of the nation's lotteries in 42 states and the District of Columbia is to raise funds for public schools. But those lotteries accounted for less than 1 percent of the total spending for kindergarten-through-12th-grade education last year in at least five of those states, according to a New York Times examination of lottery documents. New York had the highest percentage, 5.3 percent.
 In 1993, as an alternative to merely supplanting existing school funding with lottery dollars, Ms. Hargrove led the Hope Scholarships, an academic merit-based program developed by a former governor of Georgia, Zell Miller, to provide college scholarships to students. The scholarships are set aside to ensure that the money goes directly to students rather than into the state budget. Several states, including Tennessee, have passed lottery legislation duplicating Georgia's model. 
 Ms. Hargrove also has a natural marketer's instinct for inventing or picking games that become instant hits, often imitated by other states. A few years ago, while at an industry conference in Melbourne, Australia, Ms. Hargrove, who was then running Georgia's lottery, was having cocktails with a German colleague. The two decided to brainstorm a new lottery game, an in-state alternative to large-jackpot multistate games. 
 ''We sat for there for three hours designing a game,'' she says. The result was Fantasy 5, an online in-state parimutuel game that has become among the lottery industry's most popular because of large jackpots. It also has better odds than more common multistate games like Powerball. 
 Last year, to expand the Tennessee lottery's reach beyond convenience-store counters, Ms. Hargrove introduced ''Hot Trax Champions,'' a fast-paced online game intended for bars and using real video of Nascar drivers. While prize drawings of most other lottery games occur once or twice daily, Hot Trax Champions has drawings every five minutes from 6:05 a.m. to 1:50 a.m., and potential jackpots of up to $25,000. 
 ''Her timing for introducing new products is impeccable,'' says Thomas N. Shaheen, executive director of North Carolina's lottery. ''Once one of her products hits the streets, it usually does well.''
 Some people argue, though, that Ms. Hargrove's influence has been a mixed blessing for the industry. In her push to transform institutions of public trust into private corporations, opponents of lotteries say, the good will of these state-sponsored agencies has been derailed. Indeed, after starting the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation, Ms. Hargrove suggested removing the word ''education'' from its title, but backed down after strong board resistance.
 Critics also take exception to Ms. Hargrove's annual compensation, which has totaled $750,000 in some years. Industry analysts say that package is about five times that of most lottery directors. Such hefty compensation pressures other states to raise salaries, which further steers the industry away from its public service mission, lottery opponents say.
 Mr. Mitchell, however, defends Ms. Hargrove's pay package. ''When you are looking for someone who is responsible for creating scholarship dollars across the state of Tennessee, that is a serious endeavor,'' he says. ''From that standpoint, I think she is underpaid.'' 
 Ms. Hargrove also says the pay is justified. ''In general, I think that lottery directors are underpaid,'' she says. ''What we sell is a consumer product, and I believe in pay-for-performance.''
 Two former lottery directors, who declined to be identified out of concern that speaking negatively about Ms. Hargrove might damage their careers, have questioned her close ties to vendors, especially the GTech Corporation. Frank Mirabella, a former senior state adviser in Florida who worked with Ms. Hargrove, said that during her tenure there she urged officials from other state lotteries to hire GTech. Ms. Hargrove denies it, saying ''I never steered anybody to anyone at any time.''
 While she was chief executive of Georgia's lottery, several news articles highlighted that she had held a closed-door meetingwith GTech executives as the company was bidding against a rival, Scientific Games, for the state's lottery contract. Although GTech's services would have cost the state more, it won the contract. During that time, news articles also linked her to a former GTech national sales manager, J. David Smith, who was convicted in 1998 in an elaborate kickback scheme that involved inflated consulting fees to lotteries.
 GTech's spokesman, Bob Vincent, says Ms. Hargrove has never given GTech preferential treatment and that most of her critics resent her long success record. ''She is probably the best at what she does, and people are envious of that,'' Mr. Vincent says. 
 Ms. Hargrove says she held closed-door meetings with all potential vendors. She denies ever favoring GTech, or any other vendor, and says she has never been on a committee that chose the vendors. 
 Responding to reports about her ties to Mr. Smith, which include attending the Kentucky Derby with him and writing a character reference letter on his behalf, Ms. Hargrove says: ''You know how many times I've been to the Kentucky Derby? About 15 times, one of which was with J. David. And I was seated by my husband, and paid for my own ticket.'' 
 She also says Mr. Smith was not working for GTech at the time of the event. As for writing a character reference letter for Mr. Smith, she says: ''It was similar to hundreds of letters I've written. And it was written long before the indictment.''
 Moreover, she says that after more than 20 years in the industry, she has a network of contacts in it that is wider than most. ''Obviously, the people I am closest with tend to be those people I've worked with over the years,'' she says, adding that many of them have moved on to run other lotteries and into leadership positions at vendor companies. ''When you're building a billion-dollar business from scratch, those relationships get to be close. But I feel comfortable with my relationships with the people that I've worked with and mentored.''
 BUT Ms. Hargrove's rich compensation, along with several management missteps, including a technical glitch in the Tennessee's lottery computer system that caused errors for three weeks in lottery drawing results, has placed her leadership and salary under renewed scrutiny. Among her more vocal critics is Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat of Tennessee who was one of the state's earliest lottery advocates -- he even called Ms. Hargrove the Michael Jordan of the industry upon her arrival in the state. 
 These days, though, Mr. Cohen says that lotteries virtually run themselves and that Ms. Hargrove's impact in Tennessee has been marginal at best. He points to the Georgia lottery, which has thrived even though Ms. Hargrove no longer runs it. Last year, for example, Georgia's lottery sales per capita rose to more than $339, or about 93 cents a day for every resident. Under Ms. Hargrove, Tennessee's per capita lottery sales were $163, less than half that of Georgia's. 
 ''She's no Michael Jordan. She's more like Horace Grant,'' Mr. Cohen says, referring to Mr. Jordan's less dynamic Chicago Bulls teammate. ''The lottery is performing exactly as expected, with or without her. She's just a bigger-than-life personality, an Ethel Merman, P. T. Barnum. She has spent her life on stage, strutting and showing off to an audience. But it's just flair.'' 
 He adds: ''Her salary contradicts the whole purpose of the lottery, which is supposed to be about kids who want to go to school. It's against the spirit of what the lottery is about.'' 
 Ms. Hargrove, who declined to comment on the specifics of Mr. Cohen's remarks, says: ''Steve worked for a long time in this state to get the lottery started and feels strongly about it. I hope he is proud of the money we have raised.'' 
 WHILE Ms. Hargrove dismisses politics as the bane of state lotteries, she herself rode its coattails into the industry. She began her career in 1977 in local television news in Springfield, Ill., after graduating from Butler University in Indianapolis. At the time, she was married to Terry Paul, a prominent southern Illinois construction executive who is now deceased. Working briefly, she says, as a ''weather girl'' before shifting into advertising and promotions, she also was heavily involved in the local politics, becoming chairwoman of the Illinois Republican Party in the early 1980s. That brought her to the attention of James Thompson, then the governor, who tapped her in 1985 to lead the Illinois State Lottery. 
 Back then, lottery positions were doled out mostly as political patronage, and by Ms. Hargrove's own acknowledgment, she was put in the job with few expectations. ''I bounced in there in a fur coat and my little red convertible,'' she recalls. ''My role was basically to go give speeches and not bother anyone.'' Instead, Ms. Hargrove says, she put herself through a self-styled crash course, attending trade conferences and studying numerous state lotteries and more established European operations. 
 Among her conclusions about the Illinois lottery was this: ''It made no sense to me that what was basically a marketing organization was sitting in the Department of Revenue. I mean, could the Department of Revenue ever be entrepreneurial in spirit?'' After working with the state legislature, she says, she and other officials won an executive order in July 1986 to make the Illinois lottery a free-standing agency. 
 She says she also bolstered the agency's marketing efforts, hiring sales representatives from such corporations as Budweiser and Coca-Cola (most of her sales team had been former tax collectors) and promoting the lottery through advertising campaigns on black radio stations.
 Even Ms. Hargrove's harshest critics -- many spoke only on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals -- concede that, beyond her bravado, her uncanny insight into lottery customers, especially working-class America, has benefited the industry. Having grown up in a lower-middle-class family in Indianapolis -- her father worked in a Duracell battery factory and her mother did clerical work at Butler University -- Ms. Hargrove is a blend of high-brow and pedestrian values. (Formerly Rebecca Paul, she married Jere L. Hargrove, a former Tennessee state senator, last year.)
 Earthiness, combined with a taste for the high life, has become part of Ms. Hargrove's signature marketing style, say associates who have worked closely with her. She owns four large homes and a sleek ragtop Mercedes-Benz, yet orders lunch many days from fast-food outlets. Her two favorite retailers, Target and Tiffany's, are located across the street from each other in downtown Nashville. Dining recently at the upscale Nashville City Club, Ms. Hargrove was displeased with the menu and asked the waiter to have something special prepared for her: bacon and eggs.
 ''You can go visit the house I grew up in and see I wasn't born with a silver spoon,'' Ms. Hargrove says. ''But I am as comfortable with the governor as I am with the butler, maid or janitor.'' Indeed, at the Tennessee lottery, she is known for taking cigarette breaks with players waiting to buy tickets at a kiosk at the lottery's main office. 
 Ms. Hargrove's common touch has also infused some of the industry's most effective advertising campaigns, people in the industry say. One television commercial showed a truck cruising on a country road with dollar bills fluttering off its flatbed, with the tagline ''Georgia's newest cash crop.'' Also in Georgia, she used Ray Charles in a campaign to promote Hope Scholarships. 
 Coming up with up catchy slogans and campaigns comes naturally to Ms. Hargrove. ''I don't even have a vice president of advertising because I'm going to do it anyway,'' she says.
 Some colleagues and competitors say she has overstated her achievements. For example, while Ms. Hargrove likes to credit herself for breathing life into a comatose Illinois lottery, her predecessor, Michael Jones, who now works as a lottery consultant, disputes that. He says the lottery's sales were already robust. Ms. Hargrove ''did not rescue a moribund lottery in Illinois,'' he says. ''The lottery was successful before she arrived.'' 
 Ms. Hargrove says of Mr. Jones: ''He put together a great lottery in which you could grow.''
 IN 1987, Ms. Hargrove left Illinois for Florida, which had passed legislation the previous year to start a lottery. She had not run a start-up yet, but Florida wanted its program to be as large as the Illinois lottery, says Mr. Mirabella. ''At the time, she seemed like a natural fit.'' 
 Ms. Hargrove used her experience in Illinois to create what has since become a standard operating template for other state lotteries. Florida's new free-standing state agency was called the Department of the Lottery, and Ms. Hargrove, as secretary of the lottery, set up her own security force, an internal audit department, and her own legal staff. And while the department's budget was set by the legislature, she exercised great discretion over compensation. 
 Florida set industry records for lottery sales in the first year of operations. But the freedoms accorded this new quasi-public entity led to a political outcry. While Ms. Hargrove won kudos for orchestrating a swift start-up in Florida, for example, she also earned a reputation as a lavish spender. Most controversial was a party Ms. Hargrove organized in 1989 in Coral Gables for million-dollar prize winners on a yacht owned by Donald Trump. 
 In 1990, when Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, took office as Florida's governor, among his first moves was firing Ms. Paul, a threat he had made during his campaign. Jim Krog, the first chief of staff for Mr. Chiles, who died in 1998, says Ms. Hargrove's image unsettled his boss. ''She had cranked up a hell of a lottery,'' Mr. Krog says. ''But the governor was not a big fan of gambling to begin with. And she has a reputation for being flamboyant, of wanting to be seen and having a Champagne-and-caviar lifestyle. He didn't want someone who was viewed as a hustler for gambling, and that's what she is.''
 Ms. Hargrove defends the party as an attempt to raise the national profile of Florida's lottery, whose customer base tends to be tourists. She says the move backfired because of politics, not from poor business judgment on her part. ''Donald Trump let us borrow the yacht, so it was no cost to us,'' she says. ''And there was a picture in USA Today of the event, so it served its purpose. My job is to maximize revenue, which meant tapping into the tourist market. I just got caught up in a political campaign for governor.''
 After leaving Florida, she spent 10 years in Georgia before joining the Tennessee lottery in 2004. 
 Ernie Passailaigue, head of South Carolina's lottery, says Ms. Hargrove has often found herself under scrutiny because of the risks she has taken to move lotteries forward. ''For the most part, lotteries don't make news unless it's something negative,'' says Mr. Passailaigue, who is also president of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. ''But there are very few innovations in this industry that don't have Rebecca's fingerprints all over them.''
 MS. HARGROVE's embrace of new technology has not always endeared her to players. This year, for example, she computerized three of Tennessee's lottery games, but a programming glitch skewed the random selection process.
 Since then, Ms. Hargrove has been under pressure by players and even several state legislators to bring back the older system. Though she has offered refunds to those who played the defective games, she has so far resisted switching back. 
 ''Sometimes I have to make tough business decisions,'' she says. ''Just the other day, I called one of my friends in the industry and asked them, 'What's a nice girl like me doing in a mess like this?''' 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Rebecca Paul Hargrove, who has run state lotteries in Illinois, Florida, Georgia and now Tennessee, misstated a former title of her husband, Jere L. Hargrove. He was a Tennessee state representative, not state senator. The article also referred incorrectly to the location of two retailers that reflect Ms. Hargrove's tastes as a consumer. The stores, Target and Tiffany's, are across the street from each other in the Buckhead area of Atlanta, not in downtown Nashville.

 BODY:
THANKSGIVING NIGHT, by Richard Bausch. (Harper Perennial, $15.95.) Bausch's 10th novel, set in the fictional town of Point Royal, Va., as its citizens prepare to celebrate the ''last Thanksgiving of the century,'' is old-fashioned -- generously full of quirky characters, humor and details as well as real emotion. ''It's as if Bausch had set out to create the biggest dining table he could find, then put everyone he could think of around it,'' Meg Wolitzer wrote in the Book Review. A very different Thanksgiving dinner, this one in Concord, Mass., is the subject of THE GHOST AT THE TABLE, by Suzanne Berne (Shannon Ravenel/Algonquin, $13.95). Two sisters -- the elder determined to make everything perfect, the younger sullen and aloof -- battle over their memories of childhood, particularly the death of their mother. One critic called it ''a witty, moving and psychologically acute story.''
 MIRRORS OF THE UNSEEN: Journeys in Iran, by Jason Elliot. (Picador/St. Martin's, $16.) Focusing on Iran's culture, Elliot, a British travel writer, ranges from Cyrus the Great's empire to the present as he evokes history's modern echoes in encounters with ordinary Iranians and in the country's poetry and architecture. 
 MEMORIAL, by Bruce Wagner. (Simon & Schuster, $16.) In his most recent Los Angeles novel, Wagner focuses on a dysfunctional middle-class family. Like his ''cellphone trilogy,'' which skewered Hollywood pretensions, this book is full of status details and odd asides, but it also demonstrates Wagner's ''ability not only to write savage, often very funny satire, but also to create deeply felt, sympathetic characters,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times.
 BLOOD AND THUNDER: An Epic of the American West, by Hampton Sides. (Anchor, $15.95.) This panoramic retelling of the United States' conquest of the Southwest, from the early 1800s through the Civil War and its aftermath, focuses on the clash of three cultures -- Easterners, Indians and the established Hispanic communities in what is now New Mexico. Sides places Kit Carson, ''the prototype of the Western hero,'' at the center of the story; the Navajo leader Narbona embodies the opposition to the forces of conquest. 
 CLIMBING THE MANGO TREES: A Memoir of a Childhood in India, by Madhur Jaffrey. (Vintage, $14.95.) Jaffrey's memoir of growing up in India in the 1930s and '40s focuses on ''taste memory,'' evoking her life in a secure and happy family through descriptions of food. (The book closes with a section of family recipes.) ''When I left India to study in England, I could not cook at all,'' Jaffrey remembers, ''but my palate had already recorded millions of flavors. From cumin to ginger, they were all in my head, waiting to be called into service.'' WOMEN OF THE RAJ: The Mothers, Wives, and Daughters of the British Empire in India, by Margaret MacMillan (Random House, $15.95), offers quite another perspective. MacMillan, who wrote this book before ''Paris 1919,'' is the granddaughter of ''a very reluctant memsahib.'' She describes the lives of the women who accompanied the men who ruled British India. ''Sometimes they were magnificent,'' MacMillan says. ''Sometimes ... they were awful, as only people who are frightened can be.''
 DOES AMERICAN DEMOCRACY STILL WORK by Alan Wolfe. (Yale University, $15). Wolfe, a political scientist, notes that a moralistic populism threatens to undermine democratic values and argues for more ''quality control'' in American politics. The conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan's growing disenchantment with the Bush administration made him question what it meant to be a conservative. In THE CONSERVATIVE SOUL: Fundamentalism, Freedom, and the Future of the Right (Harper Perennial, $14.95), he distinguishes between conservatism and a fundamentalism that is ''the nemesis of conservatism as I have always understood it.'' ''Rescuing conservatism,'' Sullivan writes, ''means rejecting the current fundamentalist supremacy.'' 
 THE BOOK OF DAVE: A Revelation of the Recent Past and the Distant Future, by Will Self. (Bloomsbury, $15.95.) Self's fifth novel imagines an English society 500 years in the future, following an apocalyptic flood, whose primitive citizens' holy book is a screed written in the 21st century by Dave Rudman, a brutish, racist London cabbie.
 THE WAR OF THE WORLD: Twentieth-Century Conflict and the Descent of the West, by Niall Ferguson. (Penguin, $18.) Ferguson's ambitious work poses the question of why ''the hundred years after 1900 were ... the bloodiest century in modern history.'' His answer: ''Ethnic conflict, economic volatility and empires in decline.'' ''Ferguson is a fine narrator and impressive scholar,'' our reviewer, Simon Sebag Montefiore, wrote, ''but above all he is a passionate teacher'' of the ''lessons of history.''
 THE GIRL WITH THE GALLERY: Edith Gregor Halpert and the Making of the Modern Art Market, by Lindsay Pollock. (PublicAffairs, $16.95.) This biography of the pioneering but unheralded art dealer (her roster of artists included Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis, Charles Sheeler and Jacob Lawrence) offers an unusual view of the financial nuts and bolts of running a gallery in the years when New York was becoming the world's art capital.

HEADLINE: The New Jersey Exodus That Wasn't

BYLINE: By MARY E. FORSBERG. 
Mary E. Forsberg is the research director at the New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonprofit research organization.

DATELINE: Trenton 

 BODY:
 IT seems as if everyone is talking about a recent study by Rutgers University that suggests that New Jersey is soon to be a barren state devoid of people, shops and commerce. 
 Reaction to the report has been breathless, with newspaper headlines proclaiming ''Exodus from N.J. grows'' and ''Honey, I shrunk N.J.'' The accompanying news articles are using phrases like ''population drain'' and ''fleeing the state in droves.'' One editorial suggested that ''New Jerseyans should not bother getting to know their neighbors,'' since they'll be leaving soon. The Mercer County Chamber of Commerce held a discussion on the report and vowed to create a foundation aimed at changing the state's business climate. 
 But a closer inspection shows that the Rutgers report's doomsday forecast is based on selective use of census data. The report notes that more people are leaving New Jersey for other states than are moving in from other states. By this measurement, 231,565 more people left than came. 
 When only state-to-state movement is considered, New Jersey is indeed one of 24 states that are losing population to Southern and Western states. But such movement is only part of the story. When births, deaths and immigration are figured in -- data that the Rutgers report did not include -- only Louisiana and North Dakota have lost population in this decade.
 The United States population has grown by nearly 18 million people since 2000 and 40 percent of this growth is immigrants from other countries. New Jersey benefits from this, having the fifth-largest immigrant influx of any state.
 The Rutgers study ignores these people. It does not point out that New Jersey's population has actually grown by 310,213 since 2000. Nor does it mention that the number of people coming to the state from other countries is greater than the number who have moved from New Jersey to another state. Census data not found in the Rutgers report reveal that nearly 360,000 people have moved to New Jersey from other countries; just under 278,000 have moved to another state. 
 So, New Jersey's population is not declining. True, it is growing at a slower rate than in the past. But is that a bad thing for the nation's most densely populated state? 
 The Rutgers analysis says New Jersey is not just losing people, but money too. It uses Internal Revenue Service data that track the residence of federal tax filers to show which states people move to and from each year. But here again, major points are missed. For example, though more people leave New Jersey for other states than move in from other states, the median income of people who come is higher than that of those who leave. This suggests that many who leave are retirees, while many who come are in their peak earning years. 
 A more accurate picture can be seen by examining state income tax data from the New Jersey Division of Taxation. In 2005 (the most recent year for which state data are available), more than 2.7 million income tax returns were filed in New Jersey, an increase of 6.2 percent from 2001. State income tax in 2005 was assessed on gross income of $258.1 billion, up 15 percent from 2001. And, in 2005 there were 37,648 tax returns with incomes greater than $500,000, up from 28,000 in 2001. 
 New Jersey is holding its own, but that doesn't mean there are no problems. The lack of affordable housing remains an issue, and for too long, government has ignored the need to invest in transportation and other areas that will make the state more livable and maximize the advantage of New Jersey's location. What we need is an honest look at our priorities and how to pay for them, not scary warnings for the last person leaving the state to turn out the lights.
 There's no question that New Jersey inspires ambivalence among its residents. But despite quality-of-life challenges, it continues to attract and offer economic opportunity to hard-working people from all over the world. Despite the claims by the Rutgers report, the sky over New Jersey is not falling.

LENGTH: 619 words

HEADLINE: Back to the Lighthouse

 BODY:
''Paris has her tower,'' the promotional blurb reads. ''London has its bridge. China has the Wall. Long Island will have ... THE LIGHTHOUSE.''
 What is this all about? It's about Charles Wang, the billionaire developer and hockey team co-owner, who hasn't gotten over his tower fixation. He and a partner filed a proposal last week with the Town of Hempstead for a huge development called the Lighthouse at Long Island. It would turn a 77-acre dead zone of county-owned land in Uniondale -- the Nassau Hub -- into a megaplex of shops, offices, condominiums, hotels, parking lots and garages, all wrapped around a rebuilt Nassau Coliseum, where Mr. Wang's Islanders play. 
 About the only thing it would not have is a lighthouse. There had been one in Mr. Wang's original proposal, unveiled in 2004. It was to be 60 stories tall, with a beacon and an observation deck, but it was razzed to death and abandoned. Mr. Wang has kept only the project's name and overall immensity, and is bracing for a long slog with the governmental bodies in Hempstead and Nassau County that control its fate. 
 Having been burned before in trying to get Long Islanders to see things his way -- there is a deep aversion to gargantuan things that reshape the suburban landscape, unless they are called Home Depot or Bed, Bath & Beyond -- Mr. Wang is now straddling the line between boldness and timidity. Go to www.lighthouseli.com, pore over the glossy images and watch the video, and you may be forgiven for thinking that Mr. Wang is proposing the mildest, most inoffensive 5.5 million-square-foot development imaginable. 
 The Lighthouse on Long Island is shown as a bucolic, sunlit oasis where people shop, stroll, ice-skate, go to Islanders games, nuzzle their children, get massages and jog with their golden retrievers.
 (It is also strangely, overwhelmingly white. There are a few African-Americans in the slide shows, but don't blink or you will miss them. You will find a couple of black athletes being fixed up in the ''Sports Technology Center.'')
 The emphasis is on the Islanders, of course, along with luxury shopping, luxury hotels and luxury condominiums, on fancy weddings and banquets, with offices and housing discreetly tucked in here and there. The project is to be completed in phases, with the most important parts -- the new Coliseum, convention center, hotel rooms and condos -- going up first, and the apartments coming later.
 We recognize that conceptual drawings on a Web site are a far cry from a finished product. But it is not premature or unfair to point out that a lot of the things Nassau actually needs -- the elements of the ''New Suburbia'' that County Executive Tom Suozzi keeps talking about -- are either glossed over or nowhere to be found. What about mass transit? A robust mix of rail, bus and trolley is absolutely critical to making this part of Nassau work again. Why are the plans for it so vague? Where is the housing for regular people, the ones who, at the rate things are going, will end up traveling to Islander games from North Carolina? 
 Shouldn't the school-tax windfall from the project be shared among neighboring communities, as the county assessor has proposed, rather than being dumped lavishly on Uniondale? And once the construction jobs are gone, what good jobs will be left for local residents, besides shop clerk and ticket taker? The Hub needs to be an economic engine for all of Nassau, not just for Mr. Wang's Islanders.
 There is time for a discussion about these concerns, and we look to Mr. Suozzi to lead it. The Lighthouse could anchor and fulfill his dream of ''New Suburbia.'' But so far, the most important ingredients of that vision look like afterthoughts.

HEADLINE: Michigan's Immigrants Could Face Tighter Rules

BYLINE: By CATRIN EINHORN

 BODY:
Several Michigan lawmakers, frustrated with the defeat in Congress of an immigration law overhaul, are proposing state laws to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants. 
 The lawmakers, all Democrats from the state House, offered a package of bills late last week intended to crack down on employers, making it a felony to hire an illegal immigrant knowingly. Violation could mean fines of up to $250,000 and as much as five years in prison for repeat offenders. 
 The sponsors said the legislation would be formally introduced this month in the House. ''We have no legal weapons right now in the state of Michigan,'' said State Representative Kate Elbi, one of the sponsors. ''What we're doing is giving our state the tools that we need.''
 Adrian Vazquez, who works for the Michigan Organizing Project, an immigrant rights group, said such a plan would destroy the lives of people who had raised their families in Michigan and contributed to the economy. Illegal immigrants, Mr. Vazquez said, should not have to pay for a broken immigration system; the federal government should fix it.
 A proposed change of federal immigration law was defeated in June. But at least 20 states have enacted laws this year addressing the employment of immigrants. But the rush of state laws has also spurred a series of legal clashes with federal law. 
 In Arizona, immigrant rights advocates and business groups sued the state in federal court over a new law to force employers to check their workers' legal status or risk having their business licenses suspended or revoked.
 ''These types of laws are very clearly pre-empted by federal law,'' said Tyler Moran, the employment policy director with the National Immigration Law Center, a plaintiff in the Arizona case. The State of Arizona has called for dismissal of the case. 
 In Illinois, legislators passed a law that was sympathetic to illegal immigrants, barring employers from using a federal database to verify if potential employees were authorized to work. The Department of Homeland Security has sued to block the law, arguing that it is unconstitutional because it seeks to pre-empt federal law.
 For now, states will most likely continue to pass their own immigration-related laws, even as the legal turf remains murky, said Dirk Hegen, a policy associate with the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
 Lawmakers in Michigan said they were aware of the potential for legal clashes but confident of their proposals. 
 ''We're going to word everything as correctly as we possibly can to make sure that we pass state and federal constitutional muster,'' said Representative Mike Simpson, another sponsor of the proposed legislation.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 20, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about Michigan lawmakers who are proposing state measures to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants misspelled the surname of one lawmaker. She is State Representative Kate Ebli, not Elbi.

HEADLINE: Sweeping the Clouds Away

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
Sunny days! The earliest episodes of ''Sesame Street'' are available on digital video! Break out some Keebler products, fire up the DVD player and prepare for the exquisite pleasure-pain of top-shelf nostalgia.
 Just don't bring the children. According to an earnest warning on Volumes 1 and 2, ''Sesame Street: Old School'' is adults-only: ''These early 'Sesame Street' episodes are intended for grown-ups, and may not suit the needs of today's preschool child.'' 
 Say what? At a recent all-ages home screening, a hush fell over the room. ''What did they do to us?'' asked one Gen-X mother of two, finally. The show rolled, and the sweet trauma came flooding back. What they did to us was hard-core. Man, was that scene rough. The masonry on the dingy brownstone at 123 Sesame Street, where the closeted Ernie and Bert shared a dismal basement apartment, was deteriorating. Cookie Monster was on a fast track to diabetes. Oscar's depression was untreated. Prozacky Elmo didn't exist. 
 Nothing in the children's entertainment of today, candy-colored animation hopped up on computer tricks, can prepare young or old for this frightening glimpse of simpler times. Back then -- as on the very first episode, which aired on PBS Nov. 10, 1969 -- a pretty, lonely girl like Sally might find herself befriended by an older male stranger who held her hand and took her home. Granted, Gordon just wanted Sally to meet his wife and have some milk and cookies, but . . . well, he could have wanted anything. As it was, he fed her milk and cookies. The milk looks dangerously whole.
 Live-action cows also charge the 1969 screen -- cows eating common grass, not grain improved with hormones. Cows are milked by plain old farmers, who use their unsanitary hands and fill one bucket at a time. Elsewhere, two brothers risk concussion while whaling on each other with allergenic feather pillows. Overweight layabouts, lacking touch-screen iPods and headphones, jockey for airtime with their deafening transistor radios. And one of those radios plays a late-'60s news report -- something about a ''senior American official'' and ''two billion in credit over the next five years'' -- that conjures a bleak economic climate, with war debt and stagflation in the offing. 
 The old ''Sesame Street'' is not for the faint of heart, and certainly not for softies born since 1998, when the chipper ''Elmo's World'' started. Anyone who considers bull markets normal, extracurricular activities sacrosanct and New York a tidy, governable place -- well, the original ''Sesame Street'' might hurt your feelings.
 I asked Carol-Lynn Parente, the executive producer of ''Sesame Street,'' how exactly the first episodes were unsuitable for toddlers in 2007. She told me about Alistair Cookie and the parody ''Monsterpiece Theater.'' Alistair Cookie, played by Cookie Monster, used to appear with a pipe, which he later gobbled. According to Parente, ''That modeled the wrong behavior'' -- smoking, eating pipes -- ''so we reshot those scenes without the pipe, and then we dropped the parody altogether.''
 Which brought Parente to a feature of ''Sesame Street'' that had not been reconstructed: the chronically mood-disordered Oscar the Grouch. On the first episode, Oscar seems irredeemably miserable -- hypersensitive, sarcastic, misanthropic. (Bert, too, is described as grouchy; none of the characters, in fact, is especially sunshiney except maybe Ernie, who also seems slow.) ''We might not be able to create a character like Oscar now,'' she said.
 Snuffleupagus is visible only to Big Bird; since 1985, all the characters can see him, as Big Bird's old protestations that he was not hallucinating came to seem a little creepy, not to mention somewhat strained. As for Cookie Monster, he can be seen in the old-school episodes in his former inglorious incarnation: a blue, googly-eyed cookievore with a signature gobble (''om nom nom nom''). Originally designed by Jim Henson for use in commercials for General Foods International and Frito-Lay, Cookie Monster was never a righteous figure. His controversial conversion to a more diverse diet wouldn't come until 2005, and in the early seasons he comes across a Child's First Addict.
 The biggest surprise of the early episodes is the rural -- agrarian, even -- sequences. Episode 1 spends a stoned time warp in the company of backlighted cows, while they mill around and chew cud. This pastoral scene rolls to an industrial voiceover explaining dairy farms, and the sleepy chords of Joe Raposo's aimless masterpiece, ''Hey Cow, I See You Now.'' Chewing the grass so green/Making the milk/Waiting for milking time/Waiting for giving time/Mmmmm.
 Oh, what's that? Right, the trance of early ''Sesame Street'' and its country-time sequences. In spite of the show's devotion to its ''target child,'' the ''4-year-old inner-city black youngster'' (as The New York Times explained in 1979), the first episodes join kids cavorting in amber waves of grain -- black children, mostly, who must be pressed into service as the face of America's farms uniquely on ''Sesame Street.''
 In East Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant in 1978, 95 percent of households with kids ages 2 to 5 watched ''Sesame Street.'' The figure was even higher in Washington. Nationwide, though, the number wasn't much lower, and was largely determined by the whims of the PBS affiliates: 80 percent in houses with young children. The so-called inner city became anywhere that ''Sesame Street'' played, because the Children's Television Workshop declared the inner city not a grim sociological reality but a full-color fantasy -- an eccentric scene, framed by a box and far removed from real farmland and city streets alike.
 The concept of the ''inner city'' -- or ''slums,'' as The Times bluntly put it in its first review of ''Sesame Street'' -- was therefore transformed into a kind of Xanadu on the show: a bright, no-clouds, clear-air place where people bopped around with monsters and didn't worry too much about money, cleanliness or projecting false cheer. The Upper West Side, hardly a burned-out ghetto, was said to be the model.
 People on ''Sesame Street'' had limited possibilities and fixed identities, and (the best part) you weren't expected to change much. The harshness of existence was a given, and no one was proposing that numbers and letters would lead you ''out'' of your inner city to Elysian suburbs. Instead, ''Sesame Street'' suggested that learning might merely make our days more bearable, more interesting, funnier. It encouraged us, above all, to be nice to our neighbors and to cultivate the safer pleasures that take the edge off -- taking baths, eating cookies, reading. Don't tell the kids.
 Points of Entry
 Caveat teletor: Volumes 1 and 2 of ''Sesame Street: Old School'' are available on DVD, which you can sample and buy on Sesameworkshop.org. With a few episodes, extras and celebrity appearances by the likes of Richard Pryor and Lou Rawls, ''Old School'' sounds harmless enough. But are you ready to mainline this much '70s nostalgia? 
 The Way Old: YouTube is great for performance art. If 1969 is not far back enough for you, how's 1935? The Oscar-winning short film ''How to Sleep,'' by the Algonquin Round-Tabler Robert Benchley, can be found here in sumptuous black-and-white; search for his name and the film's title on YouTube.
 Come of Age: Marshall Herskovitz and EdwardZwick, the men of ''My So-Called Life'' and ''thirtysomething,'' have at last introduced their online-only young-adult series, ''Quarterlife.'' It started Nov. 11 on MySpaceTV.com, and it marks the first time a network-quality series -- a long indie film, really -- has been produced directly for the Internet. If the old times unnerve you, welcome to the new times.

HEADLINE: California Dreaming, With a Tint of Green, at a Car Show

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 THE annual auto show here, which opened to the public on Friday, is usually a laid-back, colorful affair with an emphasis on the sports cars and convertibles that suit the Southern California lifestyle. But this year, the accent is on sustainable mobility and the only color that matters is green. 
 If the show is shorter on actual new models than many in the industry had expected, it is long on talk about future models that would be powered by alternative fuels, hybrid drivetrains or both. The boast that most automakers seem to be making to their competitors is, ''My green is greener than your green.'' 
 California, of course, has long since dropped any pretense of being laid back about environmental issues, establishing itself as the greenest of states. Its intent to lead the nation in air quality and climate change matters was reasserted this month when the state filed suit against the federal government, demanding action on a request that the state be allowed to set its own greenhouse gas limits. And on Thursday morning, the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit threw out federal fuel economy standards for light trucks that were to take effect next year. The decision resulted from a lawsuit filed by 11 states, including California, arguing that federal regulators had not taken into account the effects of carbon dioxide emissions when setting mileage standards. 
 While the ruling's effects were immediately unclear, it demonstrated that fuel economy and emissions rules remain fluid, and that California continues to have significant influence on policies that extend beyond its borders.
 Disagreements over the best environmental course spilled over to the auto show, which runs through Nov. 25 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. When previews began Wednesday, something of a schoolyard-style face-off occurred as Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors, accused a competitor of denigrating G.M.'s proposed plug-in hybrid car, the Chevrolet Volt. G.M. says the Volt, first shown in Detroit last January, will go into production by 2010.
 So a highlight of the Los Angeles show seemed to come when the Volt was driven onto the stage Wednesday, along with six other new G.M. models that are street-legal and drivable. But the Volt at the show was powered by a nonhybrid motor suitable only for moving it on and off the stage. The battery packs that G.M. envisions for the Volt ''are now in bench-testing,'' Mr. Lutz said, adding, ''By the end of the first quarter of 2008, we will have street-drivable prototypes.''
 Mr. Lutz, who is known for speaking his mind, appeared to be fighting mad at what he characterized as a competitor's predictions that the Volt was primarily a public relations vehicle that will never be built.
 ''We are headed to a showdown at the O.K. Corral,'' he told a small group of reporters after G.M.'s green-theme presentation. ''One of our Asian competitors -- and I won't say who -- took a bunch of journalists over to the Tokyo Motor Show and gave them a technical briefing in which they said the Volt is a scam. It's a P.R. stunt. They said our lithium-ion batteries won't work, and we'll never bring the car to market.'' 
 He continued, ''Next year, about the time the Easter Bunny brings us our eggs, we will find out who is right, and who is scamming whom.''
 Mr. Lutz later confirmed that he was referring to comments by Kazuo Okamoto, an executive vice president at Toyota, at a recent technical seminar.
 Toyota denied that Mr. Okamoto had denigrated the Volt. ''That never happened -- it was never said,'' responded Mike Michels, corporate manager for external communications at Toyota. ''We aren't trash-talking anyone.''
 G.M.'s other hybrid technologies are further along, including a two-mode transmission system developed in conjunction with BMW and the former DaimlerChrysler. G.M. had previously demonstrated production-ready versions of this hybrid technology in its big Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon S.U.V.'s., and it introduced two new models here, a Cadillac Escalade Hybrid and a Chevrolet Silverado pickup with the same system.
 Chrysler, meanwhile, unveiled its own large S.U.V.'s with the two-mode hybrid system, a Dodge Durango and a Chrysler Aspen. Chrysler also gave Americans their first close-up look at a new crossover wagon, the Dodge Journey, which would replace Chrysler's low-end, short-wheelbase minivans. 
 Chrysler's other introduction here was a racing version of its Dodge Viper sports car with an decidedly ungreen 600 horsepower.
 Few other high-horsepower vehicles made their world premieres here, but some go-fast machines appeared at a North American auto show for the first time. These included a 200-m.p.h. Porsche 911 GT2; the $1.4 million Lamborghini Reventon, two street-legal high-performance sedans from Subaru and Mitsubishi; and a Ford Mustang Bullitt, named for the Steve McQueen film with a famous chase scene.
 Ford showed a new flagship sedan for its Lincoln line, the MKS. During the keynote speech at a press breakfast, Alan Mulally, Ford's president, outlined a ''blueprint for sustainability'' initiative that Ford is undertaking between now and 2020. Over the next three years, he said, Ford will begin cutting engine sizes and using turbochargers and direct fuel injection to improve power and economy. Then, from 2012 to 2020, Ford plans to put its cars on diets that will trim 250 to 750 pounds. Beyond that, he said Ford would aggressively pursue plug-in electric and fuel-cell technologies.
 These were among the other significant vehicle introductions and announcements here:
 BMW 135 This coupe is a return to a ''right size'' sports sedan, more in keeping with the original concept of the 3 Series when that line was introduced a generation ago. 
 HYUNDAI GENESIS This sports coupe concept car from Hyundai aims squarely at the Ford Mustang. Though Hyundai has no illusions that it will sell hundreds of thousands of the cars, the segment has plenty of room for competition -- at least until the Dodge Challenger and Chevrolet Camaro arrive in a year or two.
 TOYOTA SEQUOIA Though it is still powered by a big V-8, the new Sequoia is not as thirsty for unleaded premium as it used to be. Besides 12 percent better fuel economy, output is boosted to 381 horsepower and an impressive 401 pound-feet of torque. A flex-fuel version arrives next year.
 JAGUAR XF The replacement for the aging S-Type sedan has finally arrived, and it comes with a question: who will own Jaguar when the sleek XF goes on sale in the spring? Hint: It will no longer be the Ford Motor Company.
 AUDI CROSS CABRIOLET QUATTRO This concept car is part S.U.V., part off-roader and part convertible -- and 100 percent fantasy. Still, it was one of the few creative design studies shown here.
 NISSAN GT-R This new $70,000 sports coupe was the star of the Tokyo Motor Show. It still commanded attention in its North American debut. 
 PORSCHE CAYENNE HYBRID Germany's leading sports car maker unveiled advanced propulsion vehicles old and new. It displayed the 1899 Lohner-Porsche electric vehicle designed by Ferdinand Porsche along with the Cayenne Hybrid S.U.V. that goes on sale by the end of this decade. Porsche said the hybrid powertrain would also be offered in the four-door Panamera that makes its debut in 2009.
 HONDA FCX CLARITY Honda introduced a production version of its hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle, which will be leased to selected individuals next summer. Honda says the car will get the equivalent of 68 m.p.g. in everyday driving.
 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER FCHV Bob Carter, general manager of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said development of its hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle ''continues to move far ahead of any infrastructure to support it.'' VOLKSWAGEN SPACE UP BLUE The most refreshingly candid comment heard at this otherwise dead-serious auto salon came from the Volkswagen executive who introduced a fuel-cell version of its coming up city car. Of the car's alleged propulsion system, which included fuel cells, a rechargeable electric motor and roof-mounted solar panels, Ulrich Hackenberg said, ''This is a little bit pie-in-the-sky actually.''
 Imagine that -- candor at an auto show.

HEADLINE: As the Calendar Turns, So Do Many Stocks' Fortunes

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT'S hardly earth-shattering news when a particular stock performs better in one month than another. But what if those standout months -- of especially strong or weak performance -- remain the same, year in and year out? 
 This pattern occurs for many stocks, according to a new study. Though its authors couldn't explain why stocks would adhere to such monthly rhythms, they believe that the pattern is strong enough to influence the timing of investments. Before you buy or sell a particular stock, they suggest, you should first check how it performed in the same calendar month in previous years. 
 The study, called ''Seasonality in the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns,'' was written by two finance professors, Steven L. Heston of the University of Maryland, and Ronnie Sadka of the University of Washington. (This year, Professor Sadka is also a visiting finance professor at the University of Chicago.) Publication of the study is forthcoming in the Journal of Financial Economics.
 The professors searched for monthly patterns in the performance of all common stocks that traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange from 1963 through 2002. They found that some stocks tended to perform particularly well or poorly each January, while others tended to regularly beat or lag the market in February, and so forth for each month of the year. They found that these patterns were remarkably persistent, lasting as long as two decades. 
 Though the professors didn't measure the precise proportion of stocks that showed the pattern, they do know it is quite widespread. In an interview, Professor Heston said it is a ''fairly pervasive effect that exists among both large- and small-cap stocks and across different industries.''
 How sizable are the monthly patterns? Consider a hypothetical portfolio that each month owned the 10 percent of stocks that performed the best in the same month a year earlier, and simultaneously sold short the 10 percent of issues that had the lowest returns a year earlier. Before transaction costs, according to the professors' calculations, this portfolio would have produced an average annual return of more than 13 percent a year over the four decades they studied. What's particularly impressive is that the portfolio was market-neutral: it made no market-timing bet on the direction of the overall market.
 Professor Heston said he distrusted his findings at first, suspecting that the monthly patterns were caused by a programming error. He would have expected an astrologer, not a rigorous econometrician, to claim that stocks show distinct monthly rhythms, he said, but he began to believe they were genuine after Professor Sadka, his co-author, independently reached the same result.
 Professor Heston says it is important not to confuse the monthly patterns with what Wall Street calls the momentum effect. According to this better-known pattern, a stock that has performed well in one year tends to continue doing well over the next year or so. By contrast, he said, the pattern that he and his co-researcher have documented focuses on what happened during just one month of the previous 12 and ignores the intervening 11.
 Why do stocks adhere to monthly rhythms? It is tempting to attribute them to varying cycles of good and bad times that different industries follow during the year. Retailers, for example, tend to shine around the holidays, just as heating oil companies fare best in winter and refineries in summer. But the professors dismissed this possibility after finding that, on average, stocks within an industry showed as wide a variation in monthly patterns as stocks of different industries.
 Might the patterns be caused by the different months when companies report their earnings? The professors dismissed that idea, too. The monthly patterns they detected were not related to companies' earnings cycles.
 In fact, the professors came up empty in trying to explain why stocks show these strong monthly patterns. Statisticians might normally view this lack of explanation as a warning flag that the pattern isn't real. But pointing to its long-term persistence, and its confirmation by various academic referees, Professor Heston says he is ''completely confident that the pattern is genuine.''
 Could a short-term trader beat the market by pursuing a strategy that each month owned the best stocks from that month in previous years, while simultaneously shorting the worst performers? Professor Heston thinks this would be hard to accomplish. He noted that the holding period for this portfolio would be just one month, and that transaction costs for turning over the portfolio 12 times a year would most likely be higher than the 13 percent annualized return that the portfolio achieved before transaction costs.
 PROFESSOR HESTON said traders nevertheless could exploit the results of this research, provided they were about to buy or sell stocks anyway, for other reasons, and would therefore not incur added transaction costs by paying attention to monthly rhythms. Before buying stocks, for example, they should first see how the stocks on their buy lists performed in the same calendar month in previous years. Other things being equal, Professor Heston said, ''it would not be a bad idea'' for such investors to buy a stock sooner rather than later if it was a particularly good performer in the same calendar months of prior years, while waiting a month if it performed very poorly.
 The reverse would be the case when selling stocks, he said. Investors would immediately sell particularly bad performers from the same month of previous years, while waiting to sell those that did well.

HEADLINE: Values on Rise for Rare Collectibles

BYLINE: By MATTHEW HEALEY

 BODY:
In the fall of 2005, Charles Hack, a New Yorker who has made a fortune in real estate and spent a lot of it on old master paintings and Renaissance sculpture, noticed a newspaper advertisement for an auction of a rare stamp.
 The 24-cent airmail stamp issued in 1918, popularly known to collectors as the Inverted Jenny, became famous -- and valuable -- because of an error: the airplane in the center of the design, a Curtiss JN-4, is printed upside-down. Only 100 of the misprints are known to exist. Mr. Hack attended that auction and bought the stamp for $297,000, including commission. 
 Last Wednesday, Mr. Hack attended another stamp auction, at Siegel Auction Galleries in New York City, and went home with a second Inverted Jenny after bidding $850,000. The final price, with the commission, came to $977,500, a record for an American stamp sold at auction and a confirmation of a trend that is transforming the world of high-end collectibles.
 His second Inverted Jenny cost more because it is one of the finest, but auction prices for many rare and high-quality collectibles, including coins and memorabilia, have gone up significantly in recent months.
 Just in the past week, a collection of American pattern coins -- rare samples made to show off proposed designs, like tests for the first United States pennies in 1792 -- was traded for $30 million between an anonymous buyer and seller. The deal, brokered by Legend Numismatics of Lincroft, N.J., doubled the previous record for a coin collection. And a rare and pristine poster for the 1935 movie ''Bride of Frankenstein,'' starring Boris Karloff, was sold Wednesday by Heritage Auction Galleries of Dallas for $334,600, which included commission.
 The seller of the poster had bought it from a theater owner in the 1960s for 50 cents, said Greg Rohan, president and co-owner of Heritage.
 Mr. Hack, 60, collected stamps in his youth, but decided to pursue fine art as he began making money in residential and commercial real estate around the country. Among his specialties are Belgian symbolist painters like Fernand Khnopff, whose works are rare and not widely collected. Now, he has returned to philately with a dedication comparable to his passion for art.
 ''Stamps have a parallel quality to fine art -- this thing gives a satisfaction, it's a great piece of Americana,'' Mr. Hack said last week.
 Sonny Hagendorf, a dealer in rare stamps who has guided Mr. Hack in his collecting over the last two years, said there were a number of reasons why stamp prices were rising: the weak dollar, low interest rates, the fact that stamps are ''undervalued vis-a-vis coins and paper money'' and other collectibles. But he said a major influence on the robust market for rare stamps were baby boomers in their 50s and 60s who are ''getting to the point where they can buy the things they want.'' 
 Mr. Hack is a prime example of that.
 ''Boomers like myself reach 60, have incredible wealth, and are thinking about places to put it,'' he said. ''In fine art, even mediocre pieces by well-known artists bring a million dollars.''
 The Inverted Jenny, he said, is ''an American icon that is really undervalued.''
 Mr. Rohan, of Heritage, said prices of other collectibles like vintage science fiction books had been rising for the same reason. ''Sci-fi especially has been coming on stronger, as people in technology fields reach their 40s. They read these as kids,'' and want to capture the nostalgia, he said. 
 Mr. Rohan was also bidding on the Inverted Jenny on Wednesday on behalf of a Heritage client, but lost out to Mr. Hack. He said this client, like many of those who buy regularly from Heritage, collected in several areas: coins, paper money, movie posters, art and sculpture. ''These are passionate collectors -- they remember as a child these things were trophies.''
 Mr. Hagendorf has seen prices on rare stamps rise before. He said he bought the very same stamp that was sold on Wednesday in 1980 for $160,000, then a record, on behalf of a pension fund. The stamp has changed hands several times since then.
 ''Back then it was speculative,'' he said, with buyers trying to hedge against inflation. Nowadays, buyers tend to be real collectors, with the ''slightly irrational desire to own the item.''
 ''Lately we're seeing auctions with multiple collectors and many under-bidders up to a very high level,'' Mr. Hagendorf said. ''This is a vibrant market with a long way to go, but it's not just driven by its going up.''

HEADLINE: Funny Songs Are Inspired By Sad Times For the Rich

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It's true that the country singer Merle Hazard has never been to the Hamptons.
 But he does bill himself as America's first and only country music star to sing about mortgage-backed securities, derivatives and leveraged buyouts, and he slightly knows the economist Arthur Laffer, best known for the supply-side Laffer Curve beloved by anti-tax conservatives.
 Hence Mr. Hazard's credentials to be the auteur behind the YouTube music video ''In the Hamptons,'' one of those marvels of instant pop culture likely at some point to be forwarded to an inbox near you. 
 Mr. Hazard, to be technical, has another identity, as Jon Shayne, a 46-year-old money manager who studied philosophy at Harvard and then got a law degree from Vanderbilt and whose company manages more than $120 million from Nashville. 
 Over the summer, he gained a measure of fame on the Internet and beyond when he spun himself off as an independent issue in rented cowboy duds known as Merle Hazard. 
 The name evokes both the country star Merle Haggard and the term ''moral hazard,'' which at the Grand Ole Opry and elsewhere refers to situations when a person's behavior is altered because his risks are borne by others -- say, by the Fed willing to bail out over-leveraged investors.
 Mr. Hazard's I.P.O., a song called ''H-E-D-G-E,'' a very loose takeoff on a song about a different variety of uninsured loss, Tammy Wynette's ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E,'' became a niche favorite on YouTube. Dedicated to ''the hardworking men and women on trading desks all across America,'' it's almost certainly the only country song about the subprime meltdown and its effects on the global credit markets. 
 Looking for a sequel, he was pondering a parody of Elvis Presley's ''Kentucky Rain'' when his brother, David, a comedy writer in Los Angeles, thought instead of Elvis's gloriously bombastic ''In the Ghetto.''
 David Shayne wrote a lyric. Mr. Hazard amped up the financial elements. A friend in New York, Kay Gardiner, who does have a house in the Hamptons (''Southampton, north of the highway''), provided some real-world details, and you get the picture in soulful, Elvis-esque baritone: ''At Georgica Beach, one windy morn/A mortgage bond trader sits forlorn/In the Hamptons.''
 There are references to Ben S. Bernanke and Milton Friedman, a bad bet on interest rates and the inevitable heartache. (''Bond-trading man gets fired of course/And the lawyer for a pretty lady files for divorce/In the Hamptons.'')
 MS. GARDINER, who writes books and a blog on that old country music favorite, knitting, with Mr. Hazard's, er, Mr. Shayne's wife, Ann, says the locale could have been, say, Bedford, but that didn't scan. 
 ''And there's something about the Hamptons,'' said Ms. Gardiner, a former assistant United States attorney in Manhattan. ''It has that cachet, and it's instantly recognizable as the playground for the rich. In my view, East Hampton is the King Hampton, so you wanted to pick Georgica Beach and the house on Lily Pond Road.''
 Mr. Hazard signed up Mr. Laffer to do a turn as his co-star, dashed out to Katy K's Western wear (''Yee Haw, Oy Vey!'') for a pearl snap shirt with a treble clef symbol and eighth note on the shoulders, did the video mostly using his kids' Macintosh computer, and posted it Monday. It's already had more than 4,600 hits and has begun popping up around the blogosphere.
 For what it's worth, Mr. Hazard sees more unfolding bad news as the credit bubble pops and thus, for better or worse, more material, though he's humble about his success so far: ''I believe in staying close to your fans, and have always performed at every county fair, honky-tonk, and annual shareholder meeting that will have me.''
 Back on Long Island, Helen S. Rattray, publisher of The East Hampton Star, couldn't think of many songs about the Hamptons, though Bob Dylan's ''Sara'' from his ''Desire'' album makes reference to Lily Pond Lane.
 Her first thought was proudly parochial. ''Lots of people still don't think there's anything called the Hamptons,'' she said. ''They think it's all individual neighborhoods and towns and villages. But if everyone else thinks there's a place called the Hamptons maybe we should, too.''
 Still, after watching the video, she reckoned it got a lot right. 
 ''It's very funny,'' she said. ''Every time he mentioned Milton Friedman it really cracked me up. But what really got me is that my son David's column in this week's paper is all doom and gloom about how bad this recession is going to be. It happens all the time. You write something, and the laugh is better.''
 And, she added, the days of proud locals railing against the new world of wealth on the East End are pretty much over. Alas, she said, life in the Hamptons now isn't that far from ''In the Hamptons.'' 
 ''We're aware it's the real estate market and all those bonuses from the financial industry that keep us going,'' she said. ''All the locals who might have resented it, have cashed out and moved to the Carolinas. Local isn't local anymore.''

HEADLINE: Betting Against the Dollar? This Time, Asia May Deserve a Look

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
JIM O'NEILL, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs, has been down on the American dollar for at least 10 years. ''Being bearish on the dollar has been one of the easiest things to do,'' Mr. O'Neill said. And there are still lucrative currency bets to be made, Mr. O'Neill and many other financial professionals say, even though the direction of the American currency isn't as obvious today. ''It's getting trickier,'' Mr. O'Neill said.
 One reason for the difficulty is that the dollar has lost so much value against the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar that it may not have much further to go before it reverses course against them. Mr. O'Neill, who is based in London, points out that while it took just 84.5 cents to buy a euro as recently as six years ago, it now takes $1.45, a move of more than 70 percent. 
 If the cheap dollar continues to help spur American exports and thereby reduce the trade deficit, Mr. O'Neill says he thinks that the dollar may be near its bottom against those currencies. ''The dollar could weaken further in the very short term,'' he says, ''but a year from now I personally expect the dollar will be stronger against most European currencies.'' 
 But that's not likely to be the case with Asian currencies, like those of China, Japan, India and even tiny Singapore, in his view. ''Many of these economies are seeing enormous growth,'' Mr. O'Neill said. And the dollar has not lost as nearly much value against these currencies, which tend to be controlled or influenced by the government. China intervenes in foreign exchange markets to manage the value of the yuan and has allowed an upward drift of only about 5 percent year to date. Japan does not intervene, but its huge pools of liquidity and near-zero interest rates have spawned the so-called carry trade, in which hedge funds and other major institutional investors borrow money in yen and convert the yen to other currencies to invest in other markets. The practical effect has been much the same as government intervention: the yen has risen only slightly against the dollar.
 Despite some Asian governments' desire to keep their currencies where they are, many experts believe that big upward moves are inevitable throughout the region. ''The game is just getting ramped up,'' said Arthur P. Steinmetz, senior vice president and portfolio manager at the OppenheimerFunds in New York. ''There are some powerful fundamental forces that are going to make this interesting.''
 One of the most important, says Mr. Steinmetz, who manages $22 billion in mutual funds, is the direction of interest rates in the United States. ''The biggest driver of movement in currencies is interest rate differentials,'' he said. ''Money naturally flows to countries with high interest rates and away from countries with low interest rates. The United States is a low-yielding country and interest rates are going lower because of what the Federal Reserve is doing.''
 Add it all up and it may be time for individual investors to make decisions not only about whether to invest in dollar-denominated or other instruments, but also whether to choose mutual funds and exchange traded funds that have the appropriate exposure to Asian currencies rather than relying on plain-vanilla international funds that may be equally exposed to different regions of the world. (Very few experts recommend that individual investors become involved in foreign-exchange derivative trading or in buying individual non-American stocks.) 
 But charting a winning Asian currency strategy is hard because stock markets in China, Hong Kong, India and elsewhere in the region are at or near all-time highs -- China's stock market has more than doubled this year -- and a vast majority of experts expect corrections if not short-term crashes. 
 What's an investor to do? ''I would invest through funds whose managers know how to shift from what's too high to what's cheap,'' said Roger Kubarych, chief United States economist for UniCredit Markets and Investment Banking, who is based in New York. ''That's why you go to professionals. Any individual would have to study the markets for two or three years to understand them. Starting from a standing stop, you're better off in mutual funds. There's no doubt about it.''
 Some experts say that even if Asian stock markets suffer fairly sharp corrections, they may be smart long-term bets. ''One has to make a distinction between the markets and the currencies,'' said Mark Cliffe, chief economist of the ING Group, the Dutch-based bank. ''Asian stock markets are at all-time highs. But you can't say that about the currencies. They are still undervalued. They should be in line for a structural appreciation against the United States dollar and European currencies as well.''
 Still, Gregg Wolper, senior mutual fund analyst at Morningstar, says there's no guarantee that now is the time to bet against the dollar versus Asian or emerging-market currencies. 
 ''Currency trends have a habit of surprising even the experts,'' he said. He also argues that a majority of individual investors should put their money into mutual funds that have the latitude to move money around the world and aren't limited to certain regions. ''It makes sense to let the manager make the decisions,'' Mr. Wolper said.
 But for sophisticated investors who may have a higher tolerance for risk and a longer time horizon, a variety of tools are available to make more specific investments. A list of Asia-Pacific mutual funds, for example, is available at the Morningstar site. These funds, which do not include Japanese investments, have returned of nearly 50 percent, on average, so far this year. Among these funds, one strong performer has been AIM China, whose largest investments include China Mobile and PetroChina. The fund has returned 82.7 percent so far this year, according to Morningstar. 
 Of all the mutual fund companies, Mr. Wolper cites the Matthews family of funds as being particularly savvy. ''They have specialized in Asia for many years,'' he said. ''They've definitely shown expertise in investing in that area in a feasible and reasonably long-term way.'' For example, it offers funds specifically for China, Japan, South Korea and India.
 Many investors are skeptical about investing in Japanese stocks because Japan's stock market has suffered for more than a decade. But Mr. Kubarych says investors should consider investing in internationally oriented Japanese companies. ''There is a new generation of people leading these companies,'' he said. ''Their attitude is, 'We have to really deliver for our shareholders.' That's not something I would have heard five years ago.'' He recommends Canon, Kyocera and Toyota.
 The boldest individual investors may want to play specific currencies or specific stock markets through E.T.F.'s, which track market indexes. For example, the iShares MSCI Singapore Index invests in the equities of Singapore's largest blue-chip companies and has risen nearly 24 percent this year in dollar terms.
 INVESTING in Asian bonds is generally seen as harder than investing in Asian stocks, but Mr. Steinmetz says that the bond strategy is wiser for some investors. ''A bond fund is a more of a pure play on the currency,'' he said, ''because the interest rate component is less volatile.'' The fund he manages with the most exposure to Asian currencies through bonds is Oppenheimer International Bond, which also targets Latin American currencies by buying bonds denominated in those currencies. 
 As Mr. Wolper notes, the strong double-digit returns of many of these instruments this year offer no guarantee that they will maintain such performance in the future. And investors who hold assets not denominated in dollars must have the stomach to ride out geopolitical shockwaves. ''I tell people to be careful,'' Mr. O'Neill of Goldman said. 
 But if the dollar is headed for further erosion against Asian currencies, it may be smart to endure short-term trials and tribulations for solid long-term gains. There are opportunities to be had.

HEADLINE: Records Are Made to Be ...Overstuffed With Significance

BYLINE: By BRYAN CURTIS

 BODY:
BARRY BONDS'S indictment Thursday on four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice put a kind of official imprimatur on his presumed villainy. Bonds, who broke Hank Aaron's career home run record on Aug. 7, has long been suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs. And though he has not been convicted, his indictment goes a step further in raising doubts about how Bonds accrued his 762 home runs, and threatens to emblazon the record with baseball's favorite punctuation mark, the asterisk.
 But another reading of the case suggests that his demonization is something of a historical inevitability. Bonds's accomplishment is weighted with baggage because it can hardly be otherwise for the most cherished records in sports. 
 When a truly outsize ballplayer breaks a truly outsize record, he invariably carries the cultural freight of his times. ''This record is not tainted at all,'' Bonds said after hitting No. 762. But there is no such thing as an ''untainted'' record, if by tainted you mean it is tied up with the hopes, fears, paranoia, racial prejudices, mores and economic climate of the era in which it was set. The simple number in the record book is never so pure in the public realm. 
 All big accomplishments in sports are seen through a contemporary prism, suggests John Thorn, a baseball historian and an editor of ''Total Baseball.'' ''By definition, your view is distorted when you have your nose up against the glass,'' he says. 
 In baseball, the plot has a cyclical familiarity. In almost every case, the new record holder is seen as a villain, an exemplar of new and dangerous times, while the previous record holder is an unburdened hero. ''It's such a simple story, you would think you're watching Punch and Judy,'' Thorn says. ''There's only two roles, and they seem to alternate.''
 When Babe Ruth retired in 1935, he had hit 714 home runs, hundreds more than anybody else in baseball history. In his time, however, Ruth was not seen as the bumptious icon he was later made out to be. After the 1925 season, in which he played only 98 games, Ruth was publicly derided at a banquet by New York's mayor, Jimmy Walker, who said that Ruth had let down the kids with his poor play. With his outsized girth and fondness for controlled beverages, Ruth epitomized the excesses of the Roaring Twenties, and like every baseball player then and now, his contract demands were deemed greedy and exorbitant. 
 In short, Ruth was a flawed man of his times with layers beyond his caricature. But by the time Aaron broke his record on April 8, 1974, Ruth had died and gone to the realm of the simple and heroic. Aaron replaced him not only as baseball's most notable slugger, but as a lightning rod for the social conditions of the time. His pursuit of Ruth's record symbolized African-American players' gaining a toehold in Major League Baseball two decades after they'd been admitted to the game and just a decade after Congress desegregated public facilities.
 On a more basic level, he was a black man dethroning a white hero. For those rooting against Aaron, his chase produced, at best, a kind of complex ambivalence and, at worst, virulent hatred. He regularly received death threats during the 1973 season, prompting Ruth's widow, Claire Hodgson, to come forward and tell the riled public that her husband would have wanted Aaron to break the record. 
 From 1920's decadence to racial fears to Balco. Bonds is the emblematic slugger of baseball's steroid era. He has never failed a league-administered drug test. But his implication in the steroids scandal furthered the suspicion that performance-enhancing drugs had seeped into baseball, and that players were illicitly rewriting the history books while the commissioner and the players' union stood by and watched.
 Bonds was not the only player accused of using steroids, but he was the most visible and, thus, a convenient target of scorn for a public becoming accustomed to seeing its athletes, and corporate executives, and politicians, bending the rules to gain an edge.
 Now, enter the new slugger who will save baseball from Bonds: Alex Rodriguez, who at 32 is 244 homers short of the record.
 His new contract with the Yankees reportedly will include a provision for him to share some of the revenue -- perhaps up to $25 million -- generated by his pursuit of the record. It is curious that some cheer Rodriguez as the white knight to displace the evil Bonds, since Rodriguez has been one of baseball's leading pariahs -- a man who, in the era of hedge funds and exuberant capitalism, had turned his career into a purely economic proposal. Now he would do the same with baseball's most hallowed record. Rodriguez may be free of steroids, but the day he breaks the record will contain no less baggage.

HEADLINE: Up, Up and Away

BYLINE: By SUSAN STEWART

DATELINE: LARCHMONT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 CLARKE AUCTION GALLERY is a cavernous barn of a building that sits at the end of an alley behind Larchmont's main shopping drag. Although Clarke's is less than a block away from pricey furniture and accessories stores, there is nothing fancy about it -- unless you count the Steinway baby grand that sold there last month, or the $10,000 Russian box, or the beautiful Buddha lamp that should be mine. ...
 But this is not about my lamp. Not entirely.
 Clarke's is a sleepy place three weeks a month, a repository for the estate furniture, art and collectibles overseen by the owner of the business, Joseph Ronan Clarke, 52, a Dublin-born auctioneer who learned his trade in London and once worked as a lighting technician for the English punk-rock band the Sex Pistols. 
 Mr. Clarke, known as Ron; Diana C. Onyshkewych, the manager; and the rest of the staff members (8 regulars and as many as 19 at auction time) seek out items that they will later appraise, move, photograph and catalog. Then, for a weekend, the place is abuzz as dealers and collectors preview merchandise in preparation for the Monday night auction.
 At 6 p.m., Ruben Krigsman, a retired executive from Harrison, N.Y., was settling in for the long haul. There were 460 lots -- items or groups of items -- for sale. A couple of tables held phones for bidders who would be calling in. There were 506 arranged absentee bids from prospective buyers who couldn't be there but had guaranteed certain prices for certain objects. About 50 live bidders sat on folding chairs, numbered paper paddles in their hands for signaling bids.
 This was an average-size auction for a small auction house, but there are great variations in auctions around the region. Robert Edward Auctions, a sports memorabilia business in Watchung, N.J., holds only one a year. Edward is strictly an Internet auction house, whose average lot sells for more than $5,000 and whose monthlong bidding period attracts some 200,000 online bidders. Castner's Auction and Appraisal Service, in Branchville, N.J., where automobiles and farm equipment as well as antiques are sold, has two auctions a month, which it has begun Webcasting.
 Clarke's is a retro kind of auction house, low key and quirky and about as different from Sotheby's as it is possible to be. 
 ''They're low on the food chain,'' said Leon Castner, who, since selling his own auction house, teaches courses in antique appraisal. ''What they sell is going to be turned over three or four times.''
 In other words, Mr. Castner says, much of the merchandise at Clarke's consists of ''virgin items'' -- estate furnishings that haven't been resold before (or recently) and whose value may be unclear. These goods are at the beginning of the process by which one person's old chair, for instance, eventually becomes another's fabulous find.
 Junk, some might say. Or, just as easily, undiscovered treasure.
 Ruben -- you make friends fast in the fevered atmosphere of an auction -- had his eye on a weather vane, but he was also there to watch the mid-20th-century lots. Mr. Clarke was auctioning a couple of Manhattan collections of furniture from the '50s and '60s. There were shag rugs and white plastic, mirror balls and Danish modern: ''Austin Powers'' meets ''The Jetsons.''
 Ruben loves midcentury.
 ''A couple of pieces I have are considered the holy grail of Scandinavian design,'' he said. He then described ''a giant bird with a clock in its chest.''
 He said his home is ''kind of an exciting house.'' He seemed like a good person to sit next to.
 Ms. Onyshkewych started the bidding with Lot No. 1, an antique Persian carpet. It went for a mere $40. I felt my pulse quicken. I once bought a rug at a yard sale for $40 -- I could do this. But I remembered the words of Nancy Sasso, a Larchmont resident and auction veteran.
 ''I have made mistakes,'' she said, looking at a couple of reproduction cane-backed chairs during a preview period at Clarke's. ''I bought an oversize rug that didn't even fit in my house. I had to fold it over.''
 Clarke's sells a lot of vintage furniture and a lot of reproductions. Mr. Clarke expects his buyers to know the difference. They bear the responsibility for their choices, and consigners -- the people whose property is being auctioned -- know that he rarely puts a reserve, or minimum, price on items.
 ''I have 460 lots tonight,'' he said. ''I will sell all of them. If I have to sell it for a dollar, I'll sell it for a dollar.''
 Mr. Castner said that local, small auctions usually don't use minimums ''because they're a headache.'' 
 ''With no reserve,'' he said, ''you do have a chance of finding that one item that's worth so much.''
 Some auction houses take a middle path. ''I put a reserve only on certain articles, and they have to be expensive,'' said Tom LeClair, who, with his sister, Missy, runs the Clearing House Auction Galleries, which his parents started 47 years ago in Wethersfield, Conn. Like most auctioneers, Mr. LeClair makes his money by charging consigners a commission on the sale, ranging from 5 to 50 percent, depending on the value of the item (the more valuable, the less commission the consigner pays).
 Forgoing reserves is Mr. Clarke's way of ''keeping things moving.'' It also gives hope to the poor. Those of us who can't afford to buy fine antiques at retail know that, at an auction, we might just get lucky.
 ''Let's face it,'' said Katherine Doyle, chief executive of Doyle New York, a Manhattan auction house. ''People are always, always looking for something that wasn't cataloged properly.''
 I knew the feeling. As I studied the lots, my near-total ignorance of antiques did not prevent me from picking out certain items whose value, I was sure, nobody else had discerned: a pair of white porcelain monkeys hanging from the ceiling, a French spice cabinet, a mirrored Louis XV reproduction coffee table, and the Buddha lamp.
 I was particularly smitten by the Buddha, serenely draped in an azure robe. But it was Lot No. 375; we had miles to go.
 Ruben and I sat through Austrian boxes and Italian wall mirrors, bronze dog andirons ($850) and sterling cocktail shakers. There was a thrill when a Russian silver-and-enamel box estimated to sell for $600 to $900 brought $10,000. Mr. Clarke said, ''Going, going, gone'' for the first time (his usual phrase was ''Last chance, fair warning''). Everybody applauded.
 ''They think it's Faberge,'' Ruben whispered, with a shrug. 
 Clarke's has sold some pricey items -- its Nov. 5 art auction featured a John Wilde painting that sold for $48,000. The success of eBay and television programs like ''Antiques Roadshow'' has increasingly pushed Clarke's and other midlevel auction houses toward the fine art market, or at least toward the expensive and away from the cheap.
 One factor in this trend is the practice of charging buyers' premiums. The three big Manhattan auction houses -- Sotheby's, Christie's and Doyle -- announced recently that they would increase their surcharge to winning bidders to 25 percent an item, from 20 percent, for goods under $20,000. (Higher-priced items have lower surcharges, or premiums.) Clarke's, like many auction houses outside the city, charges a buyer's premium of 15 percent.
 ''I give as much attention to a $200 item as to a $50,000 one,'' Mr. Clarke is fond of saying.
 Paul D. Marinucci, who owns Butterscotch Auction Gallery in Katonah, the only other Westchester auction house, said: ''It's not a thriving business. It's a subculture in that we have a following of people who've been coming for a long time.''
 Mr. LeClair, of Clearing House, said about 75 percent of his weekly bidders are regulars. ''They're in the trade, they're private parties, and they're vendors.''
 And they have more opportunities in auction-rich Connecticut than anywhere else in the region, he said, for one simple reason. ''No auctioneer licenses are required in Connecticut,'' he said. ''You hang out a shingle, you're in business. In New York and New Jersey, you need licenses.''
 Licensed or not, regional auction houses are all feeling the changes wrought by the Internet, which gives the smallest local business the potential for an international presence.
 ''What used to be sold at auctions was appealing locally,'' said Ms. Doyle. ''Now it's the higher-priced object that appeals to a global market.''
 Still, at Clarke's, there is midvalue merchandise to be found.
 ''A $5,000 item in the city is one of many,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''But a $5,000 item here can stand out and do well.''
 To procure those $5,000 items, Mr. Clarke spends most of his time appraising estates, hoping to get them as consignments. The morning of the auction, he had snapped up a good one on Central Park South.
 ''New York is just incredible,'' he said. ''People say the English and Irish have the antiques, but they don't -- they're here.''
 How had he convinced the family on Central Park South that he was the man to auction their furnishings? Mr. Clarke laughed.
 ''The minute they heard the accent, I had it.''
 Like most suburban auction houses, Clarke's is not Christie's or Sotheby's or Doyle. But neither is it a repository of the kind of things you would find at a church bazaar. It's a place where dealers like Timothy Riordan, who owns an antique shop in New Rochelle, occasionally get deals.
 Mr. Riordan examined a bull's-eye mirror before the August auction, and described how he could rebuild the frame, add new gold leaf and resell it. He was describing the work of a ''mover,'' a local dealer who buys low, fixes up and sells high: the mainstay of the used-furniture economy. Most of the bidders at Clarke's fall into that category.
 ''I have a big nut here,'' Mr. Clarke said, noting that his business could not survive if he depended only on private townspeople. ''If I relied on Larchmont, I wouldn't make it. I need the trade.''
 That includes people like Peter Schweller, who deals in old master prints in Manhattan. Mr. Schweller helped work the auction phones, and went for a midnight breakfast at a local diner with the Clarke's crew.
 ''What he looks at,'' Mr. Schweller said of Mr. Clarke, ''is what New York is going to be looking at.''
 Mr. Clarke said, ''I'm a good picker,'' adding that during his youth in Ireland and England he had spent more time in flea markets than in school.
 ''At 3 p.m. in Camden Town they'd bring in barrels of ale,'' he said mistily. ''You can't get a drink in Brimfield at midnight,'' he said, referring to the big Connecticut antique fair, where 10,000 dealers gather twice a year to resell what they buy at places like Clarke's.
 Mr. Clarke prides himself on honesty and says he does not let bidders and consigners inflate prices artificially, even if it would mean bigger one-time sales.
 ''It's a bit of a dishonest business, so it's easy to seem honest,'' he said.
 ''A guy who's spending $100,000 a year with me -- why would I want to hurt him?'' he said.
 Still, auctions breed conflict.
 ''One guy wrote to consumer affairs,'' Mr. Clarke said, ''and said not only did I sell his table cheap, but I was in collusion with the police.'' (There is usually an off-duty officer at the auctions to supervise parking and loading.) Mr. Clarke said that another disappointed consigner lost a suit against him in Mamaroneck Court over the low price he got for his hall mirror.
 It's a ''buyer beware'' business, but that doesn't mean such stories are rare.
 Robert Lifson of Robert Edward Auctions, the sports memorabilia auctioneer in Watchung, spoke of a man who was '' relentless in telling us we'd misdescribed some baseball cards'' that he bought.
 ''We'd called them 'fair to good,' and he thought they were in 'poor' condition,'' Mr. Lifson said. ''For his $1,300 lot, he sent calculations worthy of Einstein. His adjustment, in the end, was $11. I sent him the $11. It was so stupid.''
 Mr. Lifson carries fire and theft insurance; other auctioneers, like Mr. LeClair, carry ''errors and omissions'' insurance that covers the kind of appraisal mistakes that could cost a consigner big money. Usually, of course, it works the other way. 
 ''A lot of people think that their items are more valuable than they are,'' Mr. Clarke said after the Monday auction. ''Those two armoires at the end tonight -- they died. That is what I will hear about.''
 The problem with the armoires? They were ''brown wood'' -- Mr. Clarke's favorite insult, synonymous with shabby chic.
 Ditto Victorian, which Mr. LeClair said is as unprofitable as it is ubiquitous.
 Styles change, Mr. Castner said, ''and brown wood is soft right now, but good stuff is always good stuff.''
 After a couple of hours of good stuff and not-so-good stuff -- and no bargains -- we were less than halfway through the auction.
 ''I'm bored to death,'' Ruben whispered. Then he told me about a chest he had bought at Clarke's for $1,000 and sold for $5,000. He wasn't going anywhere.
 LOT 203, my hanging monkeys, went for $1,200. That price -- more than twice the estimate -- put to rest any lingering self-doubt. Clearly, I had an eye. I started planning where I would put my Buddha lamp.
 Ruben gave me a sidelong glance. ''You can get bargains,'' he said, ''but not in this crowd.''
 Twenty minutes later, Ruben had his weather vane -- for $900, triple the estimated price. The minute it was his, it became a bargain.
 ''That was really worth $2,000,'' he said happily.
 We had been there for almost four hours. In the back, the proprietor of a local deli was packing up his brownies and coffee machine. The bidders who had come for the midcentury lots were long gone. Mr. Clarke was muttering about ''cheap'' bids.
 Entertainment was provided by Jose Olivera, the floor manager. Mr. Olivera wore Belleek vases on his brow like horns. Displaying an Asian dog's-head sculpture, he stuck his hand through the mouth and wagged it like a tongue. The head brought $375 -- $75 over the estimate.
 At 11:20, I eagerly held up my paddle when Mr. Clarke opened bids on my Buddha lamp. $75, $125 ... suddenly somebody on the phone was offering $450. I couldn't believe it. I also couldn't afford it.
 I could probably have gotten the French spice cabinet, but when bidding stopped at $180, I stopped, too, afraid I was the only person who didn't realize it was from Restoration Hardware. (It wasn't.)
 ''It's a sophisticated audience'' Ms. Onyschkewych said the next day. ''Certain non-rare country items don't tend to go too high.''
 A non-rare country item -- that's me.
 I got the name of the thief who had purloined my Buddha lamp and called her. She has an antique shop in Manhattan.
 ''This is not a good time,'' she said, the first time I called her.
 ''I am so busy,'' she said the second time. I begged her to tell me about my lamp. 
 She said this: ''I think it's 19th century, that Buddha. 1870s.''
 I had loved the Buddha when it was a mere 1930s Art Deco novelty. I felt even more strongly that this woman did not deserve it. But that is the difference between real auction people and neophytes. Like breeders, dealers keep their emotions in check and their eyes on the prize, or atleast the price.

HEADLINE: Ruined by Suspicion: The Sad Tale of Babe Dahlgren

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Barry Bonds may go to jail if a jury believes he lied about using steroids. Many other players could face suspensions next season if George J. Mitchell identifies them in his coming investigative report on steroids in baseball.
 But the story of Bonds or any other player doesn't approach the tale of Babe Dahlgren, a major league first baseman from 1935 to 1946, whose career and life were ruined by an unsubstantiated rumor that he smoked marijuana.
 Under Major League Baseball's drug-testing program today, players get 50-game suspensions for testing positive for steroid use, 25 games for amphetamine use. Dahlgren, whose career ended nearly 60 years before testing began, merely had his life wrecked.
 The first player tested for drug use, in 1943, Dahlgren volunteered to be tested, and he underwent a series of examinations by a doctor in Philadelphia to prove he was not a user of marijuana. 
 This bizarre and sad, heart-rending story is told in a new book, ''Rumor in Town'' (Woodlyn Lane), by Matt Dahlgren, the player's 37-year-old grandson, who had promised that he would get to the bottom of the scurrilous talk. 
 He did, learning that it was started by Joe McCarthy, manager of seven Yankees World Series champions, and propagated by Branch Rickey, father of baseball's farm system and a brilliant executive.
 In this engrossing book, Matt Dahlgren also writes that a succession of baseball commissioners did nothing to help Dahlgren clear his name, starting with Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who told him, according to the book, that ''castration would be an appropriate punishment for the culprit behind the rumor.''
 ''Babe would write to Landis every time he heard of someone who heard the rumor, but Landis never did anything,'' Matt Dahlgren said Friday in a telephone interview. ''Babe wrote to other commissioners, and none of them did anything.''
 By the time Fay Vincent took office in 1989, Dahlgren, then 77, had wearied in his pursuit of trying to get a commissioner to help him salvage his reputation.
 ''It's too bad; I wish I had been involved,'' Vincent said by telephone from Florida. ''I would have tried to fix it.'' 
 He added: ''People railroaded him for illegitimate reasons. It's a sad story. He was accused of being on drugs when I doubt very much that he was.''
 Vincent, who lauded the book, said, ''It's not one of baseball's prettiest stories, and I regret that it didn't get fixed before he died.''
 Why did McCarthy start the rumor? With detective-like qualities and using as a guide a manuscript his grandfather wrote, Matt Dahlgren pieced together the story. 
 It began with a meeting, at the suggestion of James Dawson, who covered the Yankees for The New York Times, between Dahlgren and Lefty O'Doul, an expert hitting instructor, at the wedding of Joe DiMaggio and Dorothy Arnold. 
 McCarthy, apparently seeing O'Doul as a threat, learned of O'Doul's hitting help and confronted Dahlgren about it. After that season (1940), McCarthy orchestrated Dahlgren's trade to the Boston Braves.
 At the time, McCarthy explained the trade by saying that Dahlgren's arms were too short to play first base, even though Dahlgren, who had replaced Lou Gehrig the year before, was widely considered the league's finest first baseman. 
 But in a subsequent conversation with ''baseball insiders,'' McCarthy offered a different reason for the trade, demonstrating his resentment of Dahlgren at the same time. Dahlgren, his grandson quoted McCarthy as saying, would not have made a game-losing error in a late-season game that hurt the Yankees' pennant chances ''if he wasn't a marijuana smoker.'' 
 Dahlgren did not become aware of the rumor for a couple of years, but it was responsible for a series of moves in his career. In the next two seasons, 1941 and '42, he played for the Braves, the Cubs, the Browns and the Dodgers. Early in 1943, Dahlgren had an unpleasant salary session with Rickey, a frugal -- cheap -- general manager.
 According to the book, Rickey infuriated Dahlgren by asking, ''Do you smoke marijuana?'' 
 Rickey traded Dahlgren to Philadelphia before the season, and during a trip to play the Dodgers, Dahlgren and a teammate, Danny Litwhiler, encountered Charlie Dressen, a former Dodgers coach. Dressen said Rickey was asked by his bosses why he traded Dahlgren, and ''Rickey told them he traded you because you smoke marijuana.''
 The trail went further. The Phillies traded Dahlgren, who was an All-Star, to Pittsburgh in December 1943. Matt Dahlgren figured it out. 
 Ted McGrew had been the Dodgers' chief scout and attended the meeting at which Rickey cited marijuana as the reason he traded Dahlgren. Bill Cox, the Phillies' owner, who was about to be barred for life for betting on their games, hired McGrew in October. Two months later Dahlgren was traded. 
 It was not his final move. In April 1946, the Pirates sold Dahlgren to the St. Louis Browns, his seventh move in six seasons.
 In 1985, 11 years before he died, Dahlgren wrote a letter to an old teammate, Al Lopez, asking the name of a scout who Lopez said was present at dinner when the owner of the Indianapolis minor league club told him that Rickey had ''gone to great lengths to damage my reputation by saying I smoked marijuana.''
 In a handwritten reply, the 77-year-old Lopez told Dahlgren, ''The scout's name was Ted McGrew.''
 Split in Israel League
 The Israel Baseball League had a successful first season, but its founder may be hard pressed to keep that success going. 
 Last Thursday, Daniel Kurtzer, the league commissioner and former ambassador to Israel and Egypt, resigned with nine members of the advisory board, including Marvin Goldklang, a limited Yankees partner; Randy Levine, the Yankees' president; and Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College.
 In their letter of resignation, summing up the concerns of all, Goldklang and Zimbalist wrote that ''it has become apparent that the business leadership of the league has ceased to perform in an effective, constructive or responsible manner and has failed to manage its capital and other resources in a manner likely to produce successful results.''
 Furthermore, they said, the league had not paid some players, managers and umpires.
 In a telephone interview, Goldklang added, ''The biggest issue was the feeling that trust in the management of the league was compromised.''
 The criticism was aimed at Larry Baras, the Boston bagel entrepreneur, who founded the league. Baras was not available Friday, but in a phone interview Martin Berger, a Miami lawyer who is the league president, said: ''We are upset and disappointed that they're leaving, but we are going ahead for next year. We have been talking to people who potentially are going to purchase the teams.''
 Dan Duquette, a former major league general manager, will continue to be the league's baseball operations director.
 The advisers who resigned said the league was unwilling to provide financial information.
 ''They were asking us for things that we didn't have yet,'' Berger said. ''We haven't done our financials for this year.''
 Vincent Is Upbeat on Game
 Fay Vincent, who as deputy commissioner dealt with the Pete Rose scandal, doesn't see the Barry Bonds indictment being a problem for baseball.
 ''I don't believe it's a serious blow,'' Vincent said. ''Baseball is riding very high, in part thanks to Mr. Selig. Clubs are making an enormous amount of money. Baseball will shrug this off without any great harm whatsoever.''
 A federal grand jury in San Francisco indicted Bonds the same day that Commissioner Bud Selig announced that major league revenue this year was a record $6.075 billion. 
 Some people believe the steroids scandal is hurting baseball, but it's hard to find evidence of that harm in the 2007 record attendance or the record revenue. Selig sees more lucrative days ahead. That's more than Bonds can say. His lawyers believe the government's case will fall apart, but they are his lawyers.
 The government nevertheless could have a difficult time winning a conviction in San Francisco. That's Bonds's town, and a jury could have at least a few big fans who will view things differently from the way prosecutors will portray them.
 Recalling the case of Rose, the career hits leader, who was suspended by baseball in 1989 and later convicted of tax evasion, Vincent said federal authorities at the time told him and John Dowd, the Washington lawyer who investigated Rose's betting, that they would not have indicted Rose on tax charges ''if we had not got him first because they didn't think they could get a jury to convict him.''

HEADLINE: Darcy Pulitzer, Jeremy Goldstein

 BODY:
Darcy Lowen Pulitzer, a daughter of Sandra Buring Pulitzer and Arthur C. Pulitzer of New Orleans, was married last evening to Jeremy Zev Goldstein, a son of Eileen Rubenstein Goldstein and Dr. Paul D. Goldstein of Highland Park, Ill. Rabbi Edward Cohn officiated at Temple Sinai in New Orleans. 
 The bride, 27, will continue to use her name professionally. She is an account executive at MGX Lab, a branding and marketing firm in New York, where she advises companies on marketing strategy and the creation of brand identity. She graduated from Syracuse University. 
 Her father retired as an owner and the president of Wembly Industries, which was a neckwear manufacturer in New Orleans. He is a founder of the Horizon Initiative, an organization that seeks to improve the quality of life in New Orleans through economic development. Her mother is a producer of musical events, mainly for civic, cultural and philanthropic organizations. 
 The bridegroom, 29, is a vice president who sells derivatives in the securities division at Goldman Sachs in New York. He graduated magna cum laude from Tulane. 
 His mother is on the women's board of the Jewish United Fund in Chicago. His father is a pediatrician and the president of Pediatric Healthcare Associates, which has offices in Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove and Skokie, Ill. The bridegroom's parents are the founders of the Myra Rubenstein Weis Health Resource Center at Highland Park Hospital, which promotes health education through a variety of programs in surrounding communities. The bridegroom's paternal grandfather, the late Dr. Nathan Goldstein, was an internist and a minority partner in the New Orleans Saints football team and the New Orleans Jazz basketball team. 
 The couple's relationship began in the summer of 2004 with the realization that they had more than the usual history in common. The night they met, introduced by a mutual friend at Halo, a nightclub in New York, they realized that their fathers had attended the same high school in New Orleans and that a home his parents had once considered buying was the house where she grew up. 
 ''I knew instantaneously that this was the one I would always be with,'' Mr. Goldstein said. 
 She recalled: '' I spoke to him for 20 minutes and when he left the bar I said, 'I am going to make him my boyfriend.' At the end of our conversation we were talking about what we both wanted out of life to make us happy.''
 Within a month, she realized her goal.
 Their bonds were to be tested a year later during Hurricane Katrina, when her grandmother, Margaret Buring, and his grandfather, Dr. Goldstein, who both had been in hospitals, were evacuated and disappeared. 
 ''We were probably up for 72 hours, calling every single school, church hospital, events center, police department and Red Cross in all surrounding states,'' Ms. Pulitzer said. ''We were like zombies together. We couldn't sleep. We weren't hungry. We were crying a lot.''
 But throughout their ordeal, she kept reassuring Mr. Goldstein by saying, ''Don't worry, they are on a date.'' 
 As it turned out, Mr. Goldstein's grandfather, who was in the late stages of Parkinson's disease and unable to talk, had been flown to Atlanta by helicopter where a physician treating him looked him up online, found an article about him and called his family. 
 Ms. Pulitzer's grandmother had somehow gotten to the airport and managed to get on a plane to Atlanta by accompanying a stranger in a wheelchair who needed assistance. 
 ''If you can get through something like that,'' Mr. Goldstein said, ''the uncertainty of life and death, you realize there is nothing you can't get through together.''

HEADLINE: Memo to Yeats: Ireland Has Changed

BYLINE: By JUSTIN BERGMAN

 BODY:
IRELAND has changed dramatically in recent years thanks to a soaring economy and unprecedented prosperity, but in terms of its literature many still associate the country with its masters George Bernard Shaw, W. B. Yeats and James Joyce. 
 The playwright Abbie Spallen wants to update that notion. She is part of a new generation of Irish writers and filmmakers who are tackling weighty contemporary issues, forming a representation of the country that goes beyond the classics and even the highly politicized literature produced during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
 ''So many Irish plays have had a kind of rural, idolized view of Ireland,'' Ms. Spallen said recently at the offices of the Manhattan Theater Club, which is producing her play ''Pumpgirl'' off Broadway next month. ''There's a definite need and want to address what's happening in society in Ireland at the moment.'' 
 ''The country is almost like a lottery winner,'' she added, ''and there are problems that come along with that, almost like a frightening slipping away of humanity.''
 ''Pumpgirl,'' which opens Dec. 4 at the New York City Center, portrays the lives of three people who have not benefited from the ''Celtic Tiger'' boom of the last decade, when Ireland went from one of Western Europe's poorest countries to one of its wealthiest. 
 Living in the strikingly beautiful but depressed region of Northern Ireland that lies just over the border from the south, the characters are trapped as much by geography as by their economic stations. They don't belong to the growth of the south, and they are on the periphery of Belfast's recent resurgence.
 Ms. Spallen, who grew up in the town of Newry in the North's borderland region and recently moved back there for a short time, said she got the inspiration for the play after stopping at a gas station in a rural town where a female attendant filled up her car. 
 ''I just got fascinated with this character because I don't think anybody like that has actually been represented'' in a play before, she said. ''There's kind of one of those people in every town, in every petrol station you pull up to. And for me, because I'm from around that area, a lot of it is my memories of my childhood, and in fact things haven't actually moved on. There's a stagnation of souls, even with a developing economy.''
 In the play Pumpgirl is a tomboy who longs for attention but seems to attract the wrong kind of men, including Hammy, a race car driver who constantly hangs around the gas station. Hammy's lonely wife, Sinead, waits every night for her husband to come home and wonders what has become of her life. 
 The story is told as three separate monologues, with the tension building around two incidents -- one an act of infidelity, the other of violence -- as the characters try to deal with feelings of guilt, desperation and futile longing. 
 Ms. Spallen, who is 39, was trying to survive as an actress in Dublin when she wrote the play two years ago. The dialogue is infused with the patois of the borderlands and dark Irish humor, a combination that makes the script authentic but also somewhat difficult for a nonnative to comprehend fully.
 Carolyn Cantor, the director, said it was like reading a foreign language the first time she went through the play, but she decoded it with Ms. Spallen's help. 
 ''A lot of the first week was Abbie telling stories, giving us a sense of the place and people and what that world is,'' Ms. Cantor said. ''She brought pictures, she played music. You can really hear her voice in the play. She's a great storyteller.''
 The production benefits from having one Irish actress in the cast, Geraldine Hughes, who wrote and performed a one-woman Off Broadway show, ''Belfast Blues,'' in 2005, about her experiences growing up in war-torn Belfast. Ms. Hughes, who left Northern Ireland for the United States nearly 20 years ago, said the language and nuances in ''Pumpgirl'' immediately brought her back to her roots. 
 ''There's an Irish word called seanachai, which means storyteller, and it derives from this tradition of Irish people having the ability to tell a good tale,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''This story really demands that ability. It's also telling a very horrific story in a funny way.'' 
 Ms. Spallen sees the influences of traditional Irish storytelling and poetry in her work, particularly in the detail-rich and rhythmic monologues. She said the challenge for the writers of her generation is to keep elements of this rich history alive while also telling stories that are relevant, as Martin McDonagh did in ''The Pillowman'' and Mark O'Halloran did in his film ''Garage.'' (By pure coincidence that film is also about a rural Irish gas station attendant, although Ms. Spallen noted that she wrote her play first.) 
 ''With great wealth can come an uneasiness about self and an uneasiness about identity,'' she said. ''I left Dublin because I saw that around me, and I just think it's such a terrible thing to lose, the heart and soul of the country.''

HEADLINE: Does Death Penalty Save Lives? A New Debate

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
For the first time in a generation, the question of whether the death penalty deters murders has captured the attention of scholars in law and economics, setting off an intense new debate about one of the central justifications for capital punishment.
 According to roughly a dozen recent studies, executions save lives. For each inmate put to death, the studies say, 3 to 18 murders are prevented. 
 The effect is most pronounced, according to some studies, in Texas and other states that execute condemned inmates relatively often and relatively quickly.
 The studies, performed by economists in the past decade, compare the number of executions in different jurisdictions with homicide rates over time -- while trying to eliminate the effects of crime rates, conviction rates and other factors -- and say that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise. One influential study looked at 3,054 counties over two decades. 
 ''I personally am opposed to the death penalty,'' said H. Naci Mocan, an economist at Louisiana State University and an author of a study finding that each execution saves five lives. ''But my research shows that there is a deterrent effect.''
 The studies have been the subject of sharp criticism, much of it from legal scholars who say that the theories of economists do not apply to the violent world of crime and punishment. Critics of the studies say they are based on faulty premises, insufficient data and flawed methodologies. 
 The death penalty ''is applied so rarely that the number of homicides it can plausibly have caused or deterred cannot reliably be disentangled from the large year-to-year changes in the homicide rate caused by other factors,'' John J. Donohue III, a law professor at Yale with a doctorate in economics, and Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in the Stanford Law Review in 2005. ''The existing evidence for deterrence,'' they concluded, ''is surprisingly fragile.''
 Gary Becker, who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992 and has followed the debate, said the current empirical evidence was ''certainly not decisive'' because ''we just don't get enough variation to be confident we have isolated a deterrent effect.''
 But, Mr. Becker added, ''the evidence of a variety of types -- not simply the quantitative evidence -- has been enough to convince me that capital punishment does deter and is worth using for the worst sorts of offenses.''
 The debate, which first gained significant academic attention two years ago, reprises one from the 1970's, when early and since largely discredited studies on the deterrent effect of capital punishment were discussed in the Supreme Court's decision to reinstitute capital punishment in 1976 after a four-year moratorium. 
 The early studies were inconclusive, Justice Potter Stewart wrote for three justices in the majority in that decision. But he nonetheless concluded that ''the death penalty undoubtedly is a significant deterrent.''
 The Supreme Court now appears to have once again imposed a moratorium on executions as it considers how to assess the constitutionality of lethal injections. The decision in that case, which is expected next year, will be much narrower than the one in 1976, and the new studies will probably not play any direct role in it.
 But the studies have started to reshape the debate over capital punishment and to influence prominent legal scholars. 
 ''The evidence on whether it has a significant deterrent effect seems sufficiently plausible that the moral issue becomes a difficult one,'' said Cass R. Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has frequently taken liberal positions. ''I did shift from being against the death penalty to thinking that if it has a significant deterrent effect it's probably justified.'' 
 Professor Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule, a law professor at Harvard, wrote in their own Stanford Law Review article that ''the recent evidence of a deterrent effect from capital punishment seems impressive, especially in light of its 'apparent power and unanimity,' '' quoting a conclusion of a separate overview of the evidence in 2005 by Robert Weisberg, a law professor at Stanford, in the Annual Review of Law and Social Science.
 ''Capital punishment may well save lives,'' the two professors continued. ''Those who object to capital punishment, and who do so in the name of protecting life, must come to terms with the possibility that the failure to inflict capital punishment will fail to protect life.''
 To a large extent, the participants in the debate talk past one another because they work in different disciplines. 
 ''You have two parallel universes -- economists and others,'' said Franklin E. Zimring, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of ''The Contradictions of American Capital Punishment.'' Responding to the new studies, he said, ''is like learning to waltz with a cloud.''
 To economists, it is obvious that if the cost of an activity rises, the amount of the activity will drop.
 ''To say anything else is to brand yourself an imbecile,'' said Professor Wolfers, an author of the Stanford Law Review article criticizing the death penalty studies. 
 To many economists, then, it follows inexorably that there will be fewer murders as the likelihood of execution rises.
 ''I am definitely against the death penalty on lots of different grounds,'' said Joanna M. Shepherd, a law professor at Emory with a doctorate in economics who wrote or contributed to several studies. ''But I do believe that people respond to incentives.''
 But not everyone agrees that potential murderers know enough or can think clearly enough to make rational calculations. And the chances of being caught, convicted, sentenced to death and executed are in any event quite remote. Only about one in 300 homicides results in an execution.
 ''I honestly think it's a distraction,'' Professor Wolfers said. ''The debate here is over whether we kill 60 guys or not. The food stamps program is much more important.''
 The studies try to explain changes in the murder rate over time, asking whether the use of the death penalty made a difference. They look at the experiences of states or counties, gauging whether executions at a given time seemed to affect the murder rate that year, the year after or at some other later time. And they try to remove the influence of broader social trends like the crime rate generally, the effectiveness of the criminal justice system, economic conditions and demographic changes.
 Critics say the larger factors are impossible to disentangle from whatever effects executions may have. They add that the new studies' conclusions are skewed by data from a few anomalous jurisdictions, notably Texas, and by a failure to distinguish among various kinds of homicide.
 There is also a classic economics question lurking in the background, Professor Wolfers said. ''Capital punishment is very expensive,'' he said, ''so if you choose to spend money on capital punishment you are choosing not to spend it somewhere else, like policing.''
 A single capital litigation can cost more than $1 million. It is at least possible that devoting that money to crime prevention would prevent more murders than whatever number, if any, an execution would deter.
 The recent studies are, some independent observers say, of good quality, given the limitations of the available data.
 ''These are sophisticated econometricians who know how to do multiple regression analysis at a pretty high level,'' Professor Weisberg of Stanford said. 
 The economics studies are, moreover, typically published in peer-reviewed journals, while critiques tend to appear in law reviews edited by students.
 The available data is nevertheless thin, mostly because there are so few executions. 
 In 2003, for instance, there were more than 16,000 homicides but only 153 death sentences and 65 executions.
 ''It seems unlikely,'' Professor Donohue and Professor Wolfers concluded in their Stanford article, ''that any study based only on recent U.S. data can find a reliable link between homicide and execution rates.''
 The two professors offered one particularly compelling comparison. Canada has executed no one since 1962. Yet the murder rates in the United States and Canada have moved in close parallel since then, including before, during and after the four-year death penalty moratorium in the United States in the 1970s.
 If criminals do not clearly respond to the slim possibility of an execution, another study suggested, they are affected by the kind of existence they will face in their state prison system.
 A 2003 paper by Lawrence Katz, Steven D. Levitt and Ellen Shustorovich published in The American Law and Economics Review found a ''a strong and robust negative relationship'' between prison conditions, as measured by the number of deaths in prison from any cause, and the crime rate. The effect is, the authors say, ''quite large: 30-100 violent crimes and a similar number or property crimes'' were deterred per prison death.
 On the other hand, the authors found, ''there simply does not appear to be enough information in the data on capital punishment to reliably estimate a deterrent effect.''
 There is a lesson here, according to some scholars.
 ''Deterrence cannot be achieved with a half-hearted execution program,'' Professor Shepherd of Emory wrote in the Michigan Law Review in 2005. She found a deterrent effect in only those states that executed at least nine people between 1977 and 1996.
 Professor Wolfers said the answer to the question of whether the death penalty deterred was ''not unknowable in the abstract,'' given enough data.
 ''If I was allowed 1,000 executions and 1,000 exonerations, and I was allowed to do it in a random, focused way,'' he said, ''I could probably give you an answer.''

HEADLINE: State Gets A Taste For Goats

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: Jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Tranquility 

 BODY:
 GOAT No. 15 was trying to escape, wriggling its way between the narrow fence rails, when Lou Tommaso scolded it with a voice that sounded more like the auto-body shop owner he once was than the farmer he has since become. 
 ''Don't even think about it,'' he said in the tone and cadence of his native Brooklyn, projecting the kind of gruff authority that even a goat seemed to heed. 
 Mr. Tommaso bent down and wrestled No. 15 over to the green livestock scale that would determine its fate today: whether it would spend a few more weeks gamboling around outside an old red dairy barn in this bucolic Sussex County hamlet, or would instead become one of the first casualties in an experiment intended to bring more goats to a state that eats a lot of them, but doesn't raise too many of its own.
 As New Jersey's population has changed, so has its diet. The most recent immigrants to the state -- from the Middle East and South Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America -- have brought with them a taste for the meat of an animal that Americans tend to regard more as a tin-can-eating cartoon figure than as dinner.
 For the last six years -- ever since he left his previous careers, at his body shop and in his family's funeral home in Brooklyn -- Mr. Tommaso has been raising corn, hay, beef cattle and pigs at LL Pittenger Farm, the 180 rolling acres that have belonged to his fiancee's family for generations. For the last five months he has been raising 40 goats, too, as part of a pilot program that illustrates how immigration is changing not just the cities of New Jersey, but its rural reaches as well.
 ''Sixty-six,'' said Robert Mickel, a county agricultural agent, reading the weight on the scale -- not quite enough yet. ''This one's all hair.''
 Most of America's meat goats are raised in the South, Texas mainly, but consumed in the Northeast. They travel here by truck, to the live markets, slaughterhouses and halal butcher shops of a state that processes 38 percent of all the nation's meat goats. So why not raise them here, too?
 ''They have the production, we have the market,'' said Dan Wunderlich of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture. ''But we don't have the landmass to meet the demand that is here.''
 New Jersey does have some farms that specialize in breeding and raising meat goats, whose population has quintupled to perhaps 18,000 in the last four years, but what it has even more of are part-time farmettes, swaths of rural property whose owners need to raise, and sell, some kind of agricultural product to retain their low farmland property-tax assessments. And goats fit the bill nicely, making unlikely potential partners of the immigrants of cities like Paterson and the exurban lairds of counties like Hunterdon. When the state agricultural department offered a class on meat goat production last winter, 163 people showed up, far more than expected.
 At the full-time farm run by Mr. Tommaso, who had volunteered to raise this test group, another goat, No. 17, scrambled onto the scale. ''I'm afraid my girl might be one to go,'' said Steve Komar, another county agricultural agent working on the project, as his favorite was weighed. ''That's the No. 1 rule about doing a livestock project: Don't get attached. Right, girl?''
 ''Seventy-one,'' Mr. Mickel announced, sealing its fate. All goats over 70 pounds had a date with a slaughterhouse in Camden County in a few days.
 The goats had arrived from Texas back in June, and had been fattening themselves all summer in an experiment in agricultural economics. What would happen if goats were shipped to New Jersey not as adults ready for slaughter, as they are now, but as kids that could then spend their formative growing months on small local farms? Would the meat taste better? Could it find an audience beyond the traditional immigrant market?
 ''To me it's a cross between venison and lamb,'' said Mr. Tommaso, who used to eat goat regularly back in Brooklyn -- curried goat, jerk goat, goat stew, brought in by the Jamaicans and Haitians he knew through his body shop. ''I've got my Jamaican friends waiting for it in Brooklyn.''
 Five of the goats weighed in at more than 70 pounds, and a few days later, Mr. Mickel returned to Mr. Tommaso's farm and loaded them in his pickup truck for the trip south to their fate. One whole carcass went to a restaurant in High Bridge. Another went to a country club near Princeton. The rib cuts from another ended up in Mr. Komar's frying pan, with some olive oil and garlic.
 ''It tasted very similar to a steak,'' he said. ''We were very, very pleased with the quality.''
 He was also pleased to learn that his meal, at least this first one, wasn't No. 17. ''She's still there at the butcher,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Cleaner Sound

 BODY:
Much progress toward a cleaner environment has been made through the market-based magic of pollution credits. The government sets a goal for reducing the levels of a given contaminant -- sulfur dioxide, say -- and allows polluters to reach it by negotiating among themselves. Efficient high achievers who surpass given cleanup targets earn credits that they can sell to those who do not. Laggards can buy time, but they cannot necessarily wriggle out of the obligation to come clean, or at least cleaner. That is because the tolerable level of a pollutant is gradually lowered, and lowered again, until the air -- or water, or whatever it is -- is clear.
 The scheme has worked wonders to reduce some forms of air pollution, and a similar plan to reduce the discharge of nitrogen into Long Island Sound has had striking results in Connecticut. Sewage treatment plants there have been among the many contributors to the Sound's starkly declining water quality, with nitrogen in their wastewater causing bacteria and algae to flourish and starving the water of oxygen. 
 But thanks to a credit system, the state has aggressively reduced the amount of nitrogen flowing into the Sound. In five years of trading, discharges of nitrogen have been brought down to 34,000 pounds a day, from 50,000, with the goal being 18,500 by 2014.
 Officials in Westchester say they want to try the Connecticut approach, but the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation will not let them. It says the county's four sewage plants are too far behind the curve and there are too few players to make the trading game work. '''There is not a supplier of nitrogen credits in this basin that could satisfy the requirements that Westchester has to satisfy,'' James DeZolt, assistant director in the State Division of Water, said in last Sunday's Times.
 The pressure is real. Under a comprehensive cleanup agreement with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, New York and Connecticut have until 2014 to reduce, by 58.5 percent, the nitrogen reaching the Sound from sewage plants in about 80 communities.
 One of the worst nitrogen dumpers, New York City, is moving forward with a $700 million effort to upgrade four plants. It is expensive but critical -- those plants produce about half the nitrogen that periodically turns much of the western Sound into a summertime dead zone, where nothing that breathes can live.
 As for Westchester, the county is complaining that its four plants would need to spend $355 million to $573 million on improvements to meet the discharge targets, and that the price is too steep for taxpayers in the affected sewer districts. 
 ''We are all for protecting Long Island Sound,'' the deputy county executive, Larry Schwartz, told The Times, ''but you've got to balance that over what people can afford to pay.''
 We are agnostic about what places do to get their nitrogen levels down, but not about whether they should. Westchester may flinch at the threat of localized taxpayer pain, but it should not use that to shrink from addressing an urgent regional problem. The money and means for upgrades must be found, whether indirectly through nitrogen trading or straight from taxpayers' wallets. 
 The price will be high but not necessarily ruinous -- the early cost estimates for New York City's sewage-plant upgrades ran to more than $1 billion, until an aggressive search for economizing and efficiency brought the number sharply down. And there should be federal money available for protecting the Sound. 
 The future of Long Island Sound is no budget annoyance to be haggled down or bargained to death. It took considerable pressure from the federal government to get New York City on the right path, and backsliding is a continual peril. The Sound is as threatened as it is precious -- the water is warming and lobsters and salt marshes have been dying, for reasons no one has precisely figured out. 
 But one of the bad things we do know about is nitrogen runoff. And it is in our power to fix.

HEADLINE: Under Siege, Life in Gaza Just Shrinks

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
IT'S a miserable time to be a Gazan. 
 Hopes were high in 2005, when Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and 9,000 Jewish settlers, and the international community lined up to help the Palestinians make Gaza a model for their potential state. 
 But happy endings are rare in this part of the world. In the last year, life in Gaza has been plagued by criminal gangs as well as fighting among Palestinian groups. Some rocket barrages aimed at Israel fall on Gaza itself, and Israeli retaliation for the rest ranges from military strikes to economic quarantine. 
 Months of battling between the main political factions, Fatah and Hamas, culminated in a Gazan civil war in June, with 160 people killed and 800 wounded, many of them civilians. Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, was the winner. 
 The struggle is hardly finished, with Fatah trying to consolidate in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. Just last week, a large Fatah demonstration on the third anniversary of Yasir Arafat's death ended in violence when Hamas police fired into a rock-throwing crowd and killed six people, while beating others.
 Hamas is under siege, and with it, the people of Gaza. 
 It's not just that Hamas is shunned by the West and Israel, which has declared Gaza ''a hostile entity'' and is moving to restrict supplies of gasoline, diesel fuel and electricity. Gaza is also shunned by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, who is a ready accomplice in the effort to punish and pressure Hamas.
 After the Israelis pulled out in 2005, Gazans complained that they lived in a big prison, since Israel still controlled their airspace, sea coasts and principal border crossings. Such claims had an element of propaganda, but now, with the crossing into Egypt for people also shut, by Egypt, the accusation is much closer to reality. 
 A trickle of the 1.5 million inhabitants of Gaza can now leave their tiny coastal strip for any reason whatsoever. The streets are ghostly, with little traffic, and the private economy is dying, lacking needed imports and unable to export. 
 Gaza is a deeply conservative society, but Hamas's growth has been reflected in the increasing number of women not only covering their hair, but also their faces. Israel says that it will ensure that no one starves in Gaza, and that the essentials of life will be provided.
 But Israel also wants to see that Hamas suffers, by making Gazans suffer, to impress on them that the best path lies in accommodation and negotiation with Israel for a Palestinian state. Fatah backs that strategy, not the violent, religious and national struggle against Israel that Hamas advocates and practices.
 Raji Sourani, director of Gaza's Palestinian Center for Human Rights, is himself stuck in Gaza. No friend to Hamas, he has a new metaphor.
 ''At least in prison, and I've been in prison, there are rules,'' he said. ''But now we live in a kind of animal farm. We live in a pen, and they dump in food and medicine.''
 These photographs show today's diminished Gaza, more isolated and more religious, where people try, as they must, to go on with the everyday epics of ordinary life. 

GRAPHIC: ON EDGE A woman passes under the watchful eye of a member of Hamas's security forces outside the Parliament building in Gaza City.
SCRIMPING: Majid Ajour used to sell pigeons for $3 apiece. With the principal border crossings to Israel and Egypt closed, the price of imported feed has risen. Now he tries to sell his pigeons for nearly $4 each.
EMPTY STREETS Gaza City can feel like a ghost town on a Friday morning, with its factories closed, jobs scarce and gas too expensive for many people to use.
SEEN LATELY: In an already deeply conservative society, the influence of Hamas is growing more visible: many Muslim women cover their faces now, not just their hair.

HEADLINE: The Sleep-Industrial Complex

BYLINE: By JON MOOALLEM. 
Jon Mooallem, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about bottled water and efforts to update bottle bills in certain states.

 BODY:
Pete Bils's background is in sales -- or, as he puts it, ''retail concepts.'' He joined Select Comfort 12 years ago to teach its salespeople how to better sell the company's Sleep Number Bed. The Sleep Number Bed is an air-filled mattress. Each side can be inflated with a little remote control to the ideal level of firmness for the person sleeping on it -- his or her ''sleep number,'' zero to 100 -- thus accommodating a husband who prefers his side firm and a wife who likes hers softer. You may recognize the Sleep Number Bed from its television commercials featuring the original Bionic Woman, Lindsay Wagner. Or you may have seen Bils himself explicating its many features and benefits in the loneliest hours of the night on the QVC shopping network. 
 Off-camera, Bils spends much of his time reading scientific research. He mingles at medical conferences and is chairman of the company's ''Sleep Advisory Board,'' a consortium of doctors. He ''sleep tinkers,'' coordinating pilot studies in sleep labs to understand how to build the mattress of the future. His goal at Select Comfort is to educate Americans about the science and benefits of healthful sleep, and this, plus his title -- senior director of sleep innovation and clinical research -- makes him seem deliberately more man-of-science than mattress-salesman. The distinction is less clear-cut when it comes to the man himself.
 ''How'd you sleep last night?'' Bils asked, strolling into a conference room to meet me at the company's headquarters outside Minneapolis one morning last summer. He blared it, the way certain men blare, ''Darn glad to meet you.'' Later, sitting down to lunch, he noted that the weather had not been ''muggy'' or ''unbearable'' but ''bad sleeping weather.'' Then raising a smile from behind his menu, he issued another electrifying ''How'd you sleep last night?''-- this time at the waiter who'd come to take his order. The waiter, it turned out, hadn't slept so well. After some chitchat, Bils ordered the risotto. 
 Bils, who is 48, is olive-skinned, handsome and, like virtually everyone else Select Comfort arranged for me to meet, relentlessly upbeat. At lunch, I let several minutes pass just listening to the table of executives tell one another how awesome their own Sleep Number Beds are. (Employees have their individual sleep numbers printed on their business cards.) One woman described having to take Tylenol PM to make it through a recent night away from home. Bils said he ships out a Sleep Number Bed when he travels to do QVC tapings. His daughters have slept on Sleep Numbers since they left the crib, and he even jury-rigged something similar for his bulldog. ''I've learned a lot about sleep from my dogs,'' he said. For starters, all bulldogs appear to have sleep apnea. One of the two public relations officers supervising my visit jumped in: her dog's sleep number is 10, she said; she sets her bed for him at night. ''Do whales have REM sleep?'' another colleague asked Bils. ''Yes, a form of it,'' Bils said. Eventually, he turned to me and summed up with a groaner: ''We firmly believe -- no pun intended -- that a mattress can make significant changes in sleep quality.'' This turns out to be a very radical idea.
 For years, doctors have been discouraged by Americans' disregard for and mismanagement of their sleep. (''I might as well have been running a chain of beauty parlors for the last four decades'' is how one described his advocacy.) But bragging about how little you sleep, a hallmark of the '80s power broker, is starting in certain circles to come off as masochistic buffoonery. The sleep docs we once ignored appear on morning shows to offer tips. Health professionals and marketers are hopeful that a new seriousness about sleep will continue moving out of a luxury-minded vanguard and into the mainstream. Sleep may finally be claiming its place beside diet and exercise as both a critical health issue and a niche for profitable consumer products.
 A sleep boom, or as Forbes put it last year, ''a sleep racket,'' is under way. Business 2.0 estimates American ''sleeponomics'' to be worth $20 billion a year, which includes everything from the more than 1,000 accredited sleep clinics (some of them at spas) conducting overnight tests for disorders like apnea, to countless over-the-counter and herbal sleep aids, to how-to books and sleep-encouraging gadgets and talismans. Zia Sleep Sanctuary, a first of its kind luxury sleep store that I visited in Eden Prairie, Minn., carries ''light-therapy'' visors, the Zen Alarm Clock, the Mombasa Majesty mosquito net and a $600 pair of noise-canceling earplugs as well as 16 varieties of mattresses and 30 different pillows. 
 Prescription sleeping pills have been the most obvious beneficiary. Forty-nine million prescriptions were written last year, up 53 percent from five years ago, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company. It is now a $3.7 billion business, more than doubling since 2003. At $3 or $4 per pill, their success indicates not only that we have an increasingly urgent craving for sleep but also that many of us have apparently forgotten how to do it altogether -- quite a feat for any mammal.
 To hear the mattress industry tell it, we're skipping them over. A few companies have tried to cash in with ultra-high-end novelties. A video promoting Hastens's $60,000 Vividus bed shows the horsehair it's stuffed with being sensuously detangled and fluffed by shapely Nordic women. But more down-to-earth mattresses have not conjured any of that allure. Despite long and influential success in the industry, for instance, Select Comfort's stock was struggling around the time of my visit. And so America's mattress men, traditionally a band of fast-talking, price-busting commodities brokers, are now trying to figure out how to transform their anonymous white rectangles into holistic health and wellness machines. 
 More than once, I heard mattress executives invoke the spectral characters of sleeping-pill commercials -- the Day-Glo green moth; Abe Lincoln and the talking beaver -- as chastening mascots of everything they're missing out on. Some point to the quick-fix mentality sleeping pills represent as a sign of how thoroughly confused about sleep society has become. ''The good news is, there's more and more awareness about the power of a good night's sleep,'' says David Perry, bedding editor of the trade magazine Furniture Today. The bad news: ''What we're doing in America is, we're drugging people to make it through the night on, in many cases, a lousy bed.'' 
 Our misunderstandings about sleep have been centuries in the making. As has already happened in the food and nutrition businesses, some sectors of our new sleep-industrial complex will surely find it profitable to clear up our confusion, while others will simply exploit it. But as mattress companies and sleeping-pill makers both barrel into the marketplace to sell us a good night's sleep, it's tough to know where in the jumble of science and storytelling the truth about sleep lies.
 All good nights of sleep are alike. Each miserable night of sleep is miserable in its own way. You either close your eyes and, many hours later, open them, or you endure an idiosyncratic epic of waiting, trying, failing, irritation, self-sabotage and despair, then stand up at sunrise racked with war stories you don't have the energy to tell.
 Sleep research is a young field and still doesn't have a definitive picture of what ''normal'' sleep is, making discussions of abnormal sleep imprecise. The National Institutes of Health can define insomnia only very broadly, as ''complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep.'' Insomnia can be transient -- a few off nights -- or horrifically chronic. Complaints may be about difficulty falling asleep or about waking up during the night. But it's hard to know exactly what those complaints should be judged against. Nor has research determined which objective measures -- total time slept, percentage of time spent in the various stages of sleep, etc. -- correlate to a person's subjective feeling of having slept well or poorly. Some people whose sleep looks normal in the lab complain bitterly; some whose sleep looks terrible never do.
 Even something as empirical-seeming as how long we sleep becomes problematic. In studies, insomniacs almost invariably overestimate how long it took them to fall asleep and underestimate how long they slept; in one, more than a third of the participants consistently thought they'd slept at least an hour less than their brain-wave activity indicated. Yet in a way, this hardly matters. Wallace Mendelson, past president of the Sleep Research Society, explained to me, ''When a patient comes to a doctor, he doesn't say, 'I'm here to see you because my EEG shows an insufficient number of minutes of sleep.' He comes to you saying: 'I don't feel like I'm getting enough. I'm tired.' '' Thus, while insomnia is frequently linked to another, distinct physiological disease or disorder, its diagnosis and treatment often remain, much like pain, locked in the realm of our own inscrutable reports. 
 Fewer than half of Americans say they get a good night's sleep every night or almost every night, according to a 2005 poll by the National Sleep Foundation. The N.S.F. is a nonprofit largely financed by the pharmaceutical industry and one of many groups -- including the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Better Sleep Council, a nonprofit supported by the mattress industry -- that have pushed the value of sleep, and the perils of sleep deprivation and disorders, into public view. (You can mark the change in seasons with their press releases. End of summer: ''From Zzzs to A's: Healthy Sleep Is Key for Back-to-School Success.'' Daylight Savings Time: ''Fall Back Into Bed and Catch Up on Your Sleep.'')
 Some of America's dissatisfaction likely boils down to poor ''sleep hygiene'' -- basic bad habits like not keeping a regular bedtime; overconsumption of alcohol or coffee; or winding ourselves up with work or television before bed. There is a sometimes-stunning failure to see sleep's cause-and-effect relationship to what we do while awake. One therapist told me he cured a man's insomnia by suggesting he stop eating spicy Indian curry late at night. Bils says, ''Most sleep problems are self-inflicted by sleepers not knowing how to sleep.'' Moreover, doctors have long warned that Americans are suffering from self-caused sleep deprivation without even realizing it. The most damaging and persistent delusion we've acquired about sleep is that the vital human function is optional. As one psychologist puts it, ''You don't have people walking around figuring out how to get by on less air.''
 Getting Americans to come to bed is therefore still the mattress industry's first challenge. Recently it has been gathering behind the idea of ''selling better sleep,'' promoting a fuller understanding of sleep and its health benefits. Bils's research and advocacy at Select Comfort exemplifies the approach, as does a recent series of appearances by doctors at mattress stores around the country, sponsored by Leggett & Platt, the leading supplier of steel springs. Mark Quinn, a Leggett & Platt vice president, told me, ''I think nutrition and fitness have done a great job, and I look at them as example industries.'' They've taught the public: ''If you don't eat right, you'll die. If you don't exercise, you'll die.'' 
 Quinn delivered a galvanizing pep talk on selling better sleep to an industry convention in April. He cited new research linking insufficient sleep to poorer metabolism and appetite control. ''Are you telling me that we can say, as an industry, 'If you sleep better you might be able to lose weight?' '' he said as a slide reading ''Chronic sleep deprivation could be making you fat!'' filled the wall behind him. Plus, he continued, a bad night of sleep makes you look worn out. ''We have a product that can make you look good, and we never talk about it to anybody!'' Quinn later told me, ''Create the pain, then give them the solution.'' 
 Still, says Furniture Today's David Perry: ''the mattress is not nearly as sexy a part of the equation as drugs or sleep-disorder centers. It just kind of lies there.'' For generations many consumers perceived the innerspring beds of the three dominant ''S-brands'' -- Sealy, Serta and Simmons -- to be interchangeable. A Gallup poll 10 years ago found that nearly half of Americans didn't know what brand of mattress they slept on. The industry blamed itself, often ruthlessly.
 ''The sleep industry has cheapened the mattress,'' says Rick Anderson, North American president for Tempur-Pedic. (Tempur-Pedic is the leader in visco-elastic foam, sometimes called ''memory foam,'' mattresses, made from spongy polyurethane.) Retailers know they are selling a product bought only grudgingly and only once every 12 or 15 years. So they've emphasized low prices, shouting about limited-time-only sales that never actually end. ''It's 'Buy it cheap, buy it now,' '' Anderson says. ''You turn the mattress into a low-priced commodity and, lo and behold, you shouldn't be surprised when the consumer tells you the mattress isn't that important.''+
 Both Select Comfort and Tempur-Pedic began trying to change that perception when they introduced their beds in the late '80s and '90s. As noninnerspring or ''alternative bedding'' companies, they were burdened with proving that what they had -- air and foam respectively -- was not only better than the grid of steel springs we'd employed for a century but worth prices as high as $7,000. Unfortunately, the scant published scientific literature on mattresses offered little help. (There had been few real developments since the '50s, when one of the first studies exploring the effects of different sleep surfaces found that the differences between sleeping on a new mattress and on a piece of plywood with some carpet slung over it were ''not large and not always statistically significant.'') So Select Comfort financed its own mattress research and now shows in its marketing how people's sleep improved on the Sleep Number Bed in labs at Stanford and Duke.
 Select Comfort also began using pressure mapping in its stores. Pressure mapping is a digital diagnostic that shows on a computer screen how the mattress is evenly distributing a customer's weight and conforming around his body. It illustrates ''that you're wearing the mattress versus lying on top of it,'' Bils says. Points of high pressure are uncomfortable, the thinking goes. They force a sleeper to shift or roll over, and that movement disturbs sleep. There doesn't appear to be solid scientific validation of this theory; typical sleepers have been shown to change positions 20 to 60 times a night. But when I mentioned that to Anderson at Tempur-Pedic, which promotes its beds for the same reason, he shot back: ''They don't need to.''
 By 2005, noninnerspring beds accounted for nearly a quarter of the 
 $4.6 billion spent on mattresses. Their staying power and overt sciencey-ness had colossal ripple effects on the entire industry. Jim Gabbert, the second-generation mattress retailer behind Zia Sleep Sanctuary, explains: ''At first everyone saw air and visco as a fad, like water beds. 'It won't amount to much.' Now all the mainstream innerspring manufacturers are scrambling to compete with those guys. Those specialty manufacturers taught the mainline brand names that you can price things higher, add more features, have a better story.'' 
 The big question became, what else might Americans sleep on -- and what combinations of things? The S-brands rolled out their own memory foam beds. Latex foams, modestly successful for decades, also came into vogue -- as did various gels. Meanwhile, the industry was finally breaking down the wives' tale that firm mattresses are always better. ''Comfort'' became the new buzzword, freeing manufacturers to combine all their new, high-tech materials in infinite iterations on a single bed. Pillowtops, distinct slabs of cushy material stitched on the tops of mattresses, gradually thickened, and beds ascended skyward, layer by layer, in towers of trademarked babble. Serta offers KoolComfort foam. Simmons makes Natural Care Latex and, via its brand ComforPedic, NxG Advanced Memory Foam. Having muscled their way into a virtual stalemate of technology inside the mattress, manufacturers seem to have merely started their arms race all over again on top of it. The end result may not be much better; rather than seeing beds as all the same, consumers are often totally incapable of understanding their countless differences. ''It does get confusing,'' says Brandon Jackson, bedding director at Houston's Gallery Furniture store. ''After a while, those layers are really only there to add to the cost.'' When Jackson started six and a half years ago, selling a $1,000 mattress was ''a home run.'' Now his average ticket is $3,300.
 Standing in Select Comfort's R. and D. building, among the new, retooled Sleep Number Beds just released, it was clear that the company couldn't disagree more with Jackson's view. Two engineers knelt and unzipped the covering of the Sleep Number 9000, the top of the line, to show me its layers. Stacked above the two inflatable air chambers were a blue memory foam, another proprietary foam called Intralux and a thin white scrim with a honeycomb pattern on it. This was called Outlast Adaptive Comfort, which, like Tempur-Pedic's foam, was originally developed for NASA. Outlast's tiny, ''encapsulated phase change materials'' actually switch back and forth from liquid to solid, absorbing heat and producing a pronounced cooling sensation.
 The 9000 was engineered with heat in mind. Bils explained that, as you fall asleep, your body temperature drops. A mattress should disperse the heat you're expelling. Otherwise the bed ''sleeps hot,'' cooking you in your own trapped body heat. Sleeping hot is a growing complaint about many beds and may be a consequence of the industry's manic emphasis on comfort: the shift toward using less-breathable, synthetic materials that conform more snugly to the body, and then stacking them to greater thicknesses. Memory foam especially has a reputation for sleeping hot, though Tempur-Pedic, which sells only foam beds, disputes it as ''largely urban myth.'' For the 9000, Select Comfort claims to have used a memory foam porous enough to provide air flow but not porous enough to tear apart over time. Yet as they detailed these meticulous solutions to the heat issue, the half-dozen Select Comfort executives in the room insisted that sleeping hot had never been a problem with their beds to begin with. 
 Soon the engineers turned the program over to Kris Willardson, the company's accessories maven. Willardson had set up a makeshift display on top of a cabinet and, now and again, had been interjecting to show me whichever of her pillows or sheets dovetailed on the subject at hand. ''What we also did,'' she now said, ''was build Outlast into a pillow protector.'' I didn't know what that was. ''Pillow protectors are used on top of your pillow but under your pillow case,'' she explained, holding one up. There were phase-changing microcapsules in there as well.
 Too many sleepers flip their pillows all night long, looking for the cool side, only to heat it up again, Willardson said. ''To the extent that it disturbs your sleep, that is one less thing you'll be doing. So complementary products keep reinforcing those messages.'' 
 The message, I suppose, behind so many of the mattress industry's claims is that all of a bed's high-tech features should combine to create nothing at all -- a space free of any impediments to sleep whatsoever. Even the message of the Sleep Number Bed itself, with its two independently inflatable halves, was that your sleep should not be compromised by the adversarial preferences for firmness of the person you love. Now the mattress would shield you from your own body heat, free you from rolling over and end the Sisyphean cycle of flipping and reflipping your sizzling pillow. The industry was clearing the decks for that big, long nothingness to take hold.
 Even the most comfortable mattress can only create a place for sleep, not manufacture it directly. But a sleeping pill puts us down -- and under circumstances when we're unable to do it ourselves. Bils told me: ''The sleeping pill is an easy path. It promotes sleep over all the rules you break.'' In trying to deride his competition, he spelled out its greatest advantage.
 Pharmaceutical companies realize they are selling a reassuring guarantee. ''Does your restless mind keep you from sleeping?'' asks one Lunesta commercial, while the green moth floats in front of a tossing man. Suddenly, like a hypnotist's watch, it dispatches him into a deep slumber and flies on to lull even the stern, stone visages of Mount Rushmore to sleep. A couple in a commercial for Ambien CR, meanwhile, lie absolutely motionless all night until the darkness around them fades to daylight.
 Last year the industry spent more than $600 million on advertising, helping the newest generation of pills, the so-called ''Z drugs,'' destigmatize sleeping-pill use. The nation's most popular, Ambien and its extended-release counterpart Ambien CR, accounted for 60 percent of all sleep-aid prescriptions last year according to IMS Health, for $2.8 billion in sales. Surely great numbers of Americans are experiencing the kind of satisfying knockouts depicted in the commercials.
 Yet, as a very infrequent but contented user of both Lunesta and Ambien myself, I was startled to read efficacy trials for those drugs submitted to the F.D.A. In one six-week trial, for example, people taking Ambien every night fell asleep, on average, only 23 minutes faster than those taking the placebo. They spent 88 percent of their time in bed asleep, as opposed to 82 percent. Given that their objectively measured improvements are frequently this meager, why do sleeping pills create incommensurate feelings of having slept so well? 
 A popular theory is that one of the pill's side-effects is actually contributing to their success. Most sleeping pills are known to block the formation of memories during their use, creating amnesia. This is why people who endure freaky side-effects -- so-called ''complex sleep-related behaviors'' like getting into a car and driving or ravenously eating, all while asleep -- don't remember those events. Yet this amnesia could be quite beneficial, suggests Michael Bonnet, a professor of neurology at Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine in Dayton, Ohio. ''How do you know you slept last night?'' Bonnet asked me. A night of lousy, interrupted sleep, he points out, is easy to remember. ''It's full of memories, noise and pain, and heat and rolling around and obtrusive thoughts and worries -- all of these various stimuli.'' And we may continue to register such things even while asleep, making sleep vaguely unrefreshing. But a good night of sleep, Bonnet went on to say, ''is always the antithesis to all those things, which is oblivion.'' A sleeping pill, Bonnet speculates, in addition to encouraging sleep chemically in the brain, also ''erases all of these thoughts that we use to define ourselves as being awake. The pill knocks them all out, and the patient says, 'Hey, I must have been asleep because I don't remember anything.' '' 
 Drug-company representatives and consultants I spoke to confirm that their pills can create this mild form of amnesia but disagree that it contributes any significant benefit. ''That is not my understanding of how Ambien works,'' Dario Mirski, a psychiatrist and spokesman for Ambien's manufacturer, Sanofi-Aventis, told me. It is difficult to find a clinical trial in which Z-drug takers drastically overestimated how long they slept. 
 Andrew Krystal, a Duke University psychiatrist and consultant to pharmaceutical companies like Sepracor, Lunesta's manufacturer, acknowledges an apparent discrepancy in studies between small, objectively recorded improvements and the large percentage of subjects who end up feeling that a pill alleviated their insomnia. But because insomnia is complaint-based, he explained to me, an insomniac is cured when he stops complaining. Who's to say how many more minutes of sleep or fewer awakenings during the night it should take to relieve each individual's highly subjective dissatisfaction? Many insomniacs don't show impaired sleep by any objective measure to begin with -- but presumably they benefit from sleeping pills, too. So, Krystal asked, what would you expect to see improve? (A 1990 study presents a jarring example: it focused on a group of insomniacs who, when woken up, swore they hadn't been sleeping. But if given a sleeping pill first, then woken up, they knew they'd been asleep.) He added, ''I'm not a person who shares the view that the reason the drugs work is because they're amnestic.'' 
 Another prevalent theory is that sleeping pills produce a beneficial physiological effect that clinicians don't realize they should be measuring. The standard battery of brain-wave and other measurements used in sleep labs provide only a ''limited picture,'' Krystal said. Nevertheless, several researchers suggested why the amnesia factor isn't likely to be explained to patients, even as a theory. We tend to see sleep problems as physiological. A treatment that works, even in part, by altering our perception of that problem would seem like ''more of a fake,'' says Charles Morin, director of the Sleep Research Center at Laval University in Quebec City. Imagine, Morin said, if doctors told their patients: ''You keep waking up at night but you just don't remember it.''
 Sleep doctors have criticized sleeping-pill ads for setting up an unattainable expectation of how blissful and easy sleep should be. But the mattress industry operates under that expectation, too, trying vigorously to build a state-of-the-art, NASA-engineered arena on which that idealized, paralytic oblivion can occur. But how did we come to need so much help sleeping in the first place, and how did we come to want, much less expect, the sleep these people are selling?
 The story of our ruined sleep, in virtually every telling I've heard, begins with Thomas Edison: electric light destroyed the sanctity of night. Given more to do and more opportunity to do it, we gave sleep shorter and shorter shrift. But the sleep that we're now trying to reclaim may never have been ours to begin with. ''It's a myth,'' A. Roger Ekirch, a professor of history at Virginia Tech, told me. ''And it's a myth that even some sleep experts today have bought into.'' 
 Ekirch's 2005 book, ''At Day's Close,'' described just how frenetic night in preindustrial times was. People slept, or tried to, in poorly insulated buildings that let in the weather and noise. Livestock huffed and mewled and stank just outside -- if not inside. Generally, you slept beside a chamber pot of your own excrement, staggering across the room every few hours to keep your fire alive. With physical health comparatively poor, night was when people simmered most acutely in their discomfort. In 1750, one writer described London between the hours of 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. as a ghastly encampment of ''sick and lame people meditating and languishing on their several disorders, and praying for daylight.'' 
 Because there was inadequate bedding, if there were beds at all, three family members and the odd houseguest might sleep on a single mattress -- sharing in all the usual annoyances of tossing, blanket-hogging and snoring. Beds were not always, or even often, seen as having much impact on sleep. Another book, ''Warm and Snug: The History of the Bed,'' by a scholar named Lawrence Wright, suggests that they were valued primarily as furniture, settings for public rituals around birth, death and courtship. Beds did raise you up off the floor, away from the bugs and vermin, and kept you warm. But warmer bedding also created a new vector for mites. And when comfort was a consideration, preferences were just as idiosyncratic as today. Mattresses were stuffed with hair, moss, feathers, wood shavings, seaweed or straw. Louis XI had an uncannily Sleep Number-esque mattress, filled with air and inflated to his liking with a royal bellows. 
 More surprising still, Ekirch reports that for many centuries, and perhaps back to Homer, Western society slept in two shifts. People went to sleep, got up in the middle of the night for an hour or so, and then went to sleep again. Thus night -- divided into a ''first sleep'' and ''second sleep'' -- also included a curious intermission. ''There was an extraordinary level of activity,'' Ekirch told me. People got up and tended to their animals or did housekeeping. Others had sex or just lay in bed thinking, smoking a pipe, or gossiping with bedfellows. Benjamin Franklin took ''cold-air baths,'' reading naked in a chair.
 Our conception of sleep as an unbroken block is so innate that it can seem inconceivable that people only two centuries ago should have experienced it so differently. Yet in an experiment at the National Institutes of Health a decade ago, men kept on a schedule of 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness -- mimicking the duration of day and night during winter -- fell into the same, segmented pattern. They began sleeping in two distinct, roughly four-hour stretches, with one to three hours of somnolence -- just calmly lying there -- in between. Some sleep disorders, namely waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep again, ''may simply be this traditional pattern, this normal pattern, reasserting itself,'' Ekirch told me. ''It's the seamless sleep that we aspire to that's the anomaly, the creation of the modern world.'' 
 In fact, many contemporary, nonindustrialized cultures contentedly pass portions of the night in the same state of somnolence, says Carol Worthman, an anthropologist at Emory University who is one of the first to look at how other societies sleep. Sleep and wakefulness are rarely seen as an either/or, but rather as two ends of a wide spectrum, and people are far more at peace with the fluidity in between. Among the Efe in Zaire, and the !Kung in Botswana, for example, someone who wakes up in the middle of the night and cannot sleep ''may begin to hum, or go out and play the thumb piano,'' Worthman and a colleague have written. Others might wake up and join in. ''Music or even a dance may get going.''
 Worthman says, ''In our culture, quality sleep is going into a dark room that is totally quiet, lying down, falling asleep, doing that for eight hours, and then getting up again.'' She calls it the ''lie down and die'' model. ''But that is not how much of the world has slept in the past or even sleeps today.'' In some cultures sleep is more social, with crowds crammed together on little or no bedding, limbs entangled, while a steady traffic comes and goes. And while it all sounds unbearable, Worthman notes that science has never looked empirically at whether our more sophisticated arrangements actually benefit us. For children, learning to sleep amid all that stimulation may actually have developmental advantages.
 Still, we can't afford the same equanimity about not sleeping through the night as the Efe and !Kung; the flipside is that men and women in those cultures are content to pull a cloth over their faces and doze off during the day if necessary. Our peculiar preference for one well-organized hunk of sleep likely evolved as a corollary to our expectation of uninterrupted wakefulness during the day -- as our lives came to be governed by a single, stringent clock. Eluned Summers-Bremner, author of the forthcoming ''Insomnia: A Cultural History,'' explains that in the 18th century, ''we start overvaluing our waking time, and come to see our sleeping time only as a way to support our waking time.'' Consequently, we begin trying to streamline sleep, to get it done more economically: ''We should lie down and go out right away so we can get up and get to the day right away.'' She describes insomniacs as having a ruthless ambition to do just this, wanting to administer sleep as an efficiency expert normalizes the action in a factory. Certainly all of us, after a protracted failure to fall asleep for whatever reason, have turned solemnly to our alarm clocks and performed that desperate arithmetic: If I fall asleep right now, I can still get four hours. 
 Nevertheless, while it may be at odds with our history and even our biology, lie-down-and-die is the only practical model for our lifestyle. Unless we overhaul society to tolerate all schedules and degrees of sleepiness and attentiveness, we are stuck with that ideal. Perhaps the real problem is that we still haven't come to terms with the unavoidable imperfection of this state of affairs.
 Electric light didn't obliterate nighttime so much as reinvent it. Our power to toggle between light and dark encouraged us to see night as an empty antithesis to day -- an unbroken nothing-time that begins the instant we flip off the switch. And this significantly reshaped and rigidified our expectations of how we ought to be spending it. All of this leaves us -- regardless of the circumstances or how poor our sleep hygiene is -- insisting that we go out, and stay out, like a light. 
 Our expectation of perfect sleep may not always be biologically feasible. But it is indisputably reasonable, and thus a failure to fulfill it can be maddening. Difficulty sleeping, it turns out, is often inseparable from and heightened by anxiety about sleep itself.
 Charles Morin, the Laval University psychologist, told me that it's not uncommon to discover that a particularly implacable case of insomnia snowballed out of a single stretch of poor sleep -- even one with a clear, unavoidable cause, like stress over a new job. While most people eventually shrug off their trouble, the insomniac ''forgets what brought about the sleeping problem in the first place,'' Morin said. ''They worry about not sleeping and how it will impact their daytime functioning, and they start to do things that make sleep more difficult.'' 
 They take naps, throwing their schedule out of whack. Or they become too determined -- Morin described patients taking a bath or getting into their pajamas at 7 o'clock, ''just to get ready'' -- and that anticipation turns into performance anxiety. Lying there, they may monitor their progress too vigilantly or worry about the ramifications the next day of not falling asleep right away. This can produce a physiological reaction. Body temperature and blood pressure rise. Metabolism speeds up. Heart rate and brain waves quicken. In other words, the body can respond to the threat of not getting a good night's sleep the same way it does to most threats: by becoming hyperaroused. ''It's a vicious cycle,'' Morin said. 
 Those who get snared in it may share an unknown, physiological predisposition to insomnia. But whatever its cause, this feedback loop of agony, effort and failure plays out like an escalation of the kind of self-sabotage we've all probably experienced when we felt pressure to sleep well and be sharp the next day. ''Most of the beliefs these people develop and strategies they employ are very logical and sensible,'' Jack Edinger, a psychologist at Duke University and the V.A. Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, told me. But ''unlike most things in life where, the harder you try, the better you do, with sleep the harder you try the worse you do.''
 Edinger and Morin have been influential in the use of cognitive behavioral therapy, or C.B.T., to treat chronic insomnia. Studies have arguably shown it to be the most successful treatment for the problem and an astonishingly effective method of weaning insomniacs from sleeping pills -- even those who have taken them every night for decades. C.B.T. Therapists work to establish good sleep habits but also to rewrite an insomniac's unhelpful beliefs about sleep. One of the most typical and debilitating ones, Morin explained, is ''that eight hours of solid, uninterrupted sleep is a must every night -- and otherwise, without it, you can't function during the day.'' Fixating on that as a requirement only undoes a person. Besides, Morin added, a universal need for eight hours is simply ''untrue.'' 
 This is exactly the kind of admission other sleep experts I spoke with seemed not to want to make. They may worry that they'll cause people to take sleep even less seriously than they already do. But C.B.T. seems to succeed by stripping away a crippling sense of urgency with respect to sleep. How powerless one feels over the quality of his sleep; how realistic his expectations; and whether he exaggerates the consequences of sleeping poorly -- these have all been shown to correlate with the severity of an insomniac's complaints. Morin has developed a scale to measure these beliefs. In a study utilizing this scale and led by Edinger, a person's score emerged, with other measures of anxiety and mood, as a better predictor of his satisfaction with a night's sleep than objective measures made in the lab -- including how long he slept and how quickly he fell asleep. In fact, these objective measures didn't seem to correlate to people's sense of how well they slept at all. 
 Because sleep deprivation may exact a host of severe tolls on the body over time -- which is to say nothing of exhaustion-related car accidents and other dangers -- Edinger warns that there are people with appallingly disturbed sleep who ''roll with the punches a little better and don't seem to mind or complain -- but maybe they should.'' Still, C.B.T. suggests that, in certain cases, creating a purely subjective satisfaction with your sleep can have actual value, even if the sleep itself hasn't yet objectively improved. While undermining the appeal of sleeping pills by positing the self-evident seeming role of amnesia, Morin noted that C.B.T. tries to foster a kind of amnesia, too. ''After a poor night of sleep we're asking people to forget about it and go about their business as usual,'' he says. ''Because if you wake up and think, Wow, what a terrible night of sleep, I'm going to have a lousy day, you're setting yourself up for failure.'' 
 This is not to say that a person who is more tolerant and less threatened by sleep's inherent imperfections will suddenly get eight uninterrupted hours. But he might be less likely to start down that long, miserable road of perfectly sensible but damaging efforts to control sleep. And that could trigger a quantifiable improvement. If he establishes good habits and puts sufficient faith in his body to get the job done, he might stop trying, stop scrutinizing his progress and thereby stop perpetuating his own hyperarousal. He'd just lie there and wait. ''The placebo effect may actually not just be a placebo,'' Morin said. ''It may produce a physiological predisposition to better sleeping.'' 
 With that in mind, I decided to go see some more mattresses.
 Twice a year, at the Las Vegas Market, furniture and mattress manufacturers fill 3.8 million square feet of showrooms in two titanic towers so that 50,000 retailers from around the world can see their wares. The mattress people I met there in August were affable, relaxed and, as always, frank about their industry's challenges. At a seminar on creating ''SleepSperiences'' at the retail level, the speaker kicked things off by asking the room full of mattress salespeople what they thought shoppers most often compare them to. Everyone groaned, ''Used-car salesman'' at once, except the woman seated in front of me. She said, ''Like going to the dentist.''
 Pete Bils did not attend. He was getting ready to introduce the Sleep Number 9000 at a media event in New York, an upbeat counterpunch to the company's recent announcement that same-store sales and net earnings had dropped in the previous quarter. There was significant buzz about Tempur-Pedic, though, specifically its new television commercials. The spots, which explained the beds' even pressure distribution over montages of all things tranquil -- tide pools, redwoods, yoga -- were emerging as early masterworks of the new, selling-better-sleep genre. They ended with an invitation to ''learn more about our science and experience our soul.'' ''I mean, what an awesome combination of words,'' Furniture Today's David Perry told me.
 When I visited Serta's Las Vegas showroom, an executive named Andrew Gross was eager to show me that a traditional innerspring company like his was just as capable of selling better sleep. Right off the bat, he pointed me to the Serta Perfect Day mattress, noting its emphasis on the mattress as a facilitator of perfect days. Eventually, he led me to an all-foam bed conceived with the participation of the clothing designer Vera Wang and sold under the Vera Wang by Serta label. Gross reached down and picked an almost invisible black speck of something off the top of the bed, then began describing its specifications. In conclusion, he told me that, like all of Serta's products, this particular mattress was designed to ''relieve stress.'' I asked him how it did that. We stood there for a second, side by side. Then he said, ''Well, it's a combination of the sleep surface materials and the peace of mind that comes from it being a Vera Wang.''
 I looked around the showroom. A man painted white, wearing a toga, stood on a podium, changing statuesque positions every few minutes. In the corner, a harpist played ''Desperado.'' I began to wonder if much of the hyperrational mattress talk I'd been hearing also provided this kind of emotional, Vera Wang benefit. The hard-to-follow, layer-by-layer tours of each bed's many patented technologies; the scientific studies and pressure maps; the frequent invocations of NASA engineers; and even the outsize, sleep-obsessed persona of Pete Bils, senior director of sleep innovation and clinical research, himself -- they reassure us that a mattress maker is serious and capable; that, given how precarious a thing we've turned sleep into, their bed will give us the best shot of succeeding when we climb into it. Even our relationship with the mattress, then, appears muddled up in the same mysterious space between a subjectively good night's sleep and an objectively good one -- how we feel and whether or not we can prove it. And whether the industry realizes it or not, its fledgling campaign to sell better sleep is grappling with the question of which is actually more important to us and which we're willing to pay for.
 If ramping up messages about sleep science and technology while bombarding us with medical incentives helps sell more beds, it will be because it speaks to our view that better sleep is primarily a requirement for better wakefulness -- that we ''sleep to succeed,'' as a recent industry-financed release puts it. (This same report notes that ''sleep deprivation currently costs U.S. businesses nearly $150 billion annually in absenteeism and lost productivity.'') And yet it's this very view -- that sleep is a bothersome means to an end, like eating enough Omega-3's -- that problematized sleep in the first place. It encouraged us to power through sleep as efficiently as possible or look for shortcuts.
 We all might be better off if the industry sold sleep as something to be savored for its own sake, if it just sold sanctuaries and not sanctuaries that are also clinically proven ''sleep systems.'' That might help us shed an anxiety about sleeping correctly for a more tolerant love of sleeping well, in whatever form sleeping well might take. Oddly, in some cases, that may be the most efficient way of getting empirical results anyway. That is, the industry may only be able to truly offer the kind of life-changing mattresses it sometimes claims to if it fixes the people sleeping in them first. 
 But that may be just too big a job. When I carried on about this to David Perry in Las Vegas, he told me that enjoying sleep is wonderful but it, by itself, is a hopeless way to move mattresses given how results-oriented the American consumer is. ''Remember,'' he said, ''the key benefit is what happens the next morning.'' To make sure I understood, he tossed off a few slogans in the direction he thought the business ought to be heading: ''Sleep better, lose weight.'' ''Sleep better and live longer.'' ''Sleep better and be more productive the next day.'' 
 Ultimately the Las Vegas Market wore me out. Everywhere I went people were selling me mattresses -- if not a particular mattress, then the mystique of mattresses in general. I left exhausted, making my way down the tower's endless segments of escalators. When I got halfway, I started to find, on each of the landings, a man strumming a ukulele and a woman in a grass skirt and coconut bikini, hula dancing.
 The ''Polynesian Dreams'' luau was getting under way. Below, in the atrium, the staff was rolling thatched-roofed tiki bars into place and stocking them with ice and mugs with totemic faces painted on them. A massive sea horse rose from an hors d'oeuvres table. The same salesmen I'd been seeing around the showrooms turned up wearing leis, loosening up for what looked like a late night. I caught a shuttle back to my hotel, set two alarms for seven the next morning and eventually drifted off watching ''Knocked Up'' on pay-per-view. As far as I know, I slept well enough.

 BODY:
Bariatric Surgery
 Deborah Kattler Kupetz is a Los Angeles businesswoman and mother of three who tries to watch her weight. That's why she recently bought two lifelike plastic models of human body fat from a medical-supply company, a one-pound blob and a five-pound blob, and put them on display in her kitchen. 
 By doing so, Kattler Kupetz wouldn't seem to have much in common with Han Xin, a legendary Chinese general who lived more than 2,000 years ago. But she does.
 Upon entering one battle, Han assembled his soldiers with their backs to a river so that retreat was not an option. With no choice but to attack the enemy head-on, Han's men did just that. 
 This is what economists call a commitment device -- a means with which to lock yourself into a course of action that you might not otherwise choose but that produces a desired result. While not as severe as Han's strategy, Kattler Kupetz's purchase of those fat blobs was a commitment device, too: every mealtime, they force her to envision what a few extra pounds of fat looks like.
 It is hard to think of anyone who employs commitment devices as avidly as the overweight American. Perhaps you once bought a yearlong gym membership or had a three-month supply of healthful meals delivered to your doorstep. Maybe you joined friends in a group diet or even taped your refrigerator shut. The popular new weight-loss pill Alli, which partly blocks the body's absorption of fat, is a commitment device with real consequences: a person who takes Alli and then eats too much fatty food may experience a bout of oily diarrhea.
 So how are all these commitment devices working? Not very well. According to the Centers for Disease Control, one out of every three American adults is obese. Which is why so many people have begun to embrace a far more drastic commitment device, one that Han Xin himself would probably applaud: surgery. This year, more than 200,000 weight-loss, or bariatric, operations will be performed in the United States, a nearly ten-fold increase in just a decade. The most prominent types are gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (or ''Lap-Band''), although there are a few others. Each one works a bit differently, but the general aim is to reduce the stomach's capacity and thereby thwart the appetite. If all goes well, bariatric surgery leads to substantial weight loss, especially among the morbidly obese.
 Marc Bessler, director of the Center for Obesity Surgery at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, is an innovator in the field who personally performs about 200 bariatric operations a year. Because his own father was morbidly obese, Bessler brings a personal zeal to his work. ''The whole time I was growing up, he was so overweight he couldn't play ball with us,'' he says. ''He died at age 54 from colon cancer. It may have been picked up late because of his obesity.''
 Bessler acknowledges that bariatric surgery has a checkered history. ''In the past, it killed people, and it didn't work,'' he says. ''In the late 1950s and early 1960s, even though it was effective for weight loss, there was lots of complications and mortality. Then in the late '70s and early '80s, there were much better surgeries, but they didn't really work that well. The weight would start coming back.''
 Technological innovations, especially the use of laparoscopic procedures, have made for considerable gains in safety and efficacy. While the operation is still dangerous in some circumstances -- one study found that for a surgeon's first 19 bariatric operations, patients were nearly five times as likely to die than patients that the surgeon later operated on -- the overall mortality rate is now in the neighborhood of 1 percent. 
 But even if bariatric surgery doesn't kill you, there are things to worry about. The operation often produces complications -- physiological ones, to be sure, but also perhaps psychological ones. A significant fraction of postbariatric patients acquire new addictions like gambling, smoking, compulsive shopping or alcoholism once they are no longer addicted to eating. In certain cases, some people also learn to outfox the procedure by taking in calories in liquid form (drinking chocolate syrup straight from the can, for instance) or simply drinking and eating at the same time. Surgery is also a lot more expensive than even the most lavish diet, with a Lap-Band procedure costing about $20,000 and a gastric bypass about $30,000. 
 But Bessler and other bariatric advocates argue that the upsides outweigh the downsides, especially for a morbidly obese patient whose quality of life is already suffering. While asking a bariatric surgeon if bariatric surgery is a good idea might seem akin to asking a barber if you need a haircut -- in fact, Bessler does consult for companies in the industry -- the data seem to back up his claims: not only do most patients keep off a significant amount of weight but the other medical problems that accompany obesity are also often assuaged. One recent analysis found that 77 percent of bariatric-surgery patients with Type 2 diabetes experienced ''complete resolution'' of their diabetes after the procedure; the surgery also helps eliminate hypertension and sleep apnea. From an economic standpoint, research suggests that the operation can pay for itself within a few years because a postbariatric patient now requires less medical care and fewer prescriptions. That's why some insurance companies cover bariatric surgery -- as more do, it will likely lead to a further spike in the volume of operations. This is especially good news for the hospitals that have already grown dependent on the significant cash flow that bariatric surgery generates.
 There are at least two ways to think about the rise in bariatric surgery. On the one hand, isn't it terrific that technology has once again solved a perplexing human problem? Now people can eat all they want for years and years and then, at the hands of a talented surgeon, suddenly bid farewell to all their fat. There are risks and expenses of course, but still, isn't this what progress is 
 all about?
 On the other hand, why is such a drastic measure called for? It's one thing to spend billions of dollars on a disease for which the cause and cure are a mystery. But that's not the case here. Even those who argue that obesity has a strong genetic component must acknowledge, as Bessler does, that ''the amount of obesity has skyrocketed in the past 30 years, but our genetic makeup certainly hasn't changed in that time.''
 So the cause is, essentially, that people eat too much; and the cure is, essentially, to eat less. But bariatric surgery seems to fit in nicely with the tenor of our times. Consider, for instance, the game shows we watch. The old model was ''Jeopardy!,'' which required a player to beat her opponents to the buzzer and then pluck just the right sliver of trivial knowledge from her vast cerebral storage network. The current model is ''Deal or No Deal,'' which requires no talent whatsoever beyond the ability to randomly pick a number on a briefcase.
 Maybe the problem is that despite all the diets and exercise regimes and gimmicks that have been put into play during our national bout of obesity, the right nonsurgical solution simply hasn't yet been found. So here's a suggestion: Hang around your neck a small Ziploc bag containing a towelette infused with an aroma of, well, of something deeply disgusting. (In the interest of not offending anyone who happens to be reading this over breakfast, we won't offer specific suggestions, but you can surely conjure a horrid odor on your own.) Every time you're about to open the refrigerator or look over a menu, unzip the bag and take a whiff. Now that's a commitment device.

HEADLINE: Forty Acres and a Gap in Wealth

BYLINE: By HENRY LOUIS GATES Jr.. 
Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor at Harvard, is the author of the forthcoming ''In Search of Our Roots.''

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 LAST week, the Pew Research Center published the astonishing finding that 37 percent of African-Americans polled felt that ''blacks today can no longer be thought of as a single race'' because of a widening class divide. From Frederick Douglass to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., perhaps the most fundamental assumption in the history of the black community has been that Americans of African descent, the descendants of the slaves, either because of shared culture or shared oppression, constitute ''a mighty race,'' as Marcus Garvey often put it. 
 ''By a ratio of 2 to 1,'' the report says, ''blacks say that the values of poor and middle-class blacks have grown more dissimilar over the past decade. In contrast, most blacks say that the values of blacks and whites have grown more alike.'' 
 The message here is that it is time to examine the differences between black families on either side of the divide for clues about how to address an increasingly entrenched inequality. We can't afford to wait any longer to address the causes of persistent poverty among most black families. 
 This class divide was predicted long ago, and nobody wanted to listen. At a conference marking the 40th anniversary of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's infamous report on the problems of the black family, I asked the conservative scholar James Q. Wilson and the liberal scholar William Julius Wilson if ours was the generation presiding over an irreversible, self-perpetuating class divide within the African-American community.
 ''I have to believe that this is not the case,'' the liberal Wilson responded with willed optimism. ''Why go on with this work otherwise?'' The conservative Wilson nodded. Yet, no one could imagine how to close the gap.
 In 1965, when Moynihan published his report, suggesting that the out-of-wedlock birthrate and the number of families headed by single mothers, both about 24 percent, pointed to dissolution of the social fabric of the black community, black scholars and liberals dismissed it. They attacked its author as a right-wing bigot. Now we'd give just about anything to have those statistics back. Today, 69 percent of black babies are born out of wedlock, while 45 percent of black households with children are headed by women. 
 How did this happen? As many theories flourish as pundits -- from slavery and segregation to the decline of factory jobs, crack cocaine, draconian drug laws and outsourcing. But nobody knows for sure.
 I have been studying the family trees of 20 successful African-Americans, people in fields ranging from entertainment and sports (Oprah Winfrey, the track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee) to space travel and medicine (the astronaut Mae Jemison and Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon). And I've seen an astonishing pattern: 15 of the 20 descend from at least one line of former slaves who managed to obtain property by 1920 -- a time when only 25 percent of all African-American families owned property. 
 Ten years after slavery ended, Constantine Winfrey, Oprah's great-grandfather, bartered eight bales of cleaned cotton (4,000 pounds) that he picked on his own time for 80 acres of prime bottomland in Mississippi. (He also learned to read and write while picking all that cotton.) 
 Sometimes the government helped: Whoopi Goldberg's great-great-grandparents received their land through the Southern Homestead Act. ''So my family got its 40 acres and a mule,'' she exclaimed when I showed her the deed, referring to the rumor that freed slaves would receive land that had been owned by their masters. 
 Well, perhaps not the mule, but 104 acres in Florida. If there is a meaningful correlation between the success of accomplished African-Americans today and their ancestors' property ownership, we can only imagine how different black-white relations would be had ''40 acres and a mule'' really been official government policy in the Reconstruction South.
 The historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination, by itself, would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction. We also need intervention to promulgate a middle-class ethic of success among the poor, while expanding opportunities for economic betterment.
 Perhaps Margaret Thatcher, of all people, suggested a program that might help. In the 1980s, she turned 1.5 million residents of public housing projects in Britain into homeowners. It was certainly the most liberal thing Mrs. Thatcher did, and perhaps progressives should borrow a leaf from her playbook.
 The telltale fact is that the biggest gap in black prosperity isn't in income, but in wealth. According to a study by the economist Edward N. Wolff, the median net worth of non-Hispanic black households in 2004 was only $11,800 -- less than 10 percent that of non-Hispanic white households, $118,300. Perhaps a bold and innovative approach to the problem of black poverty -- one floated during the Civil War but never fully put into practice -- would be to look at ways to turn tenants into homeowners. Sadly, in the wake of the subprime mortgage debacle, an enormous number of houses are being repossessed. But for the black poor, real progress may come only once they have an ownership stake in American society.
 People who own property feel a sense of ownership in their future and their society. They study, save, work, strive and vote. And people trapped in a culture of tenancy do not. 
 The sad truth is that the civil rights movement cannot be reborn until we identify the causes of black suffering, some of them self-inflicted. Why can't black leaders organize rallies around responsible sexuality, birth within marriage, parents reading to their children and students staying in school and doing homework? Imagine Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson distributing free copies of Virginia Hamilton's collection of folktales ''The People Could Fly'' or Dr. Seuss, and demanding that black parents sign pledges to read to their children. What would it take to make inner-city schools havens of learning? 
 John Kenneth Galbraith once told me that the first step in reversing the economic inequalities that blacks face is greater voter participation, and I think he was right. Politicians will not put forth programs aimed at the problems of poor blacks while their turnout remains so low. 
 If the correlation between land ownership and success of African-Americans argues that the chasm between classes in the black community is partly the result of social forces set in motion by the dismal failure of 40 acres and a mule, then we must act decisively. If we do not, ours will be remembered as the generation that presided over a permanent class divide, a slow but inevitable process that began with the failure to give property to the people who had once been defined as property.

HEADLINE: A Private Club Where the Privileged Can Play With Cars

BYLINE: By TED WEST

DATELINE: Monticello, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 FOR most anyone who has thrilled to the notion of driving fast in powerful cars, a wishful thought has visited at least briefly: I may not be a Mario Andretti, but I could've been.
 Proving anew that commerce has a knack for anticipating unfulfilled needs, chances to prove those unrealized driving skills are emerging in the form of members-only racing clubs. Such clubs -- some giving access to an existing track, others with their own courses -- are popping up across the country. 
 Aspiring Andrettis can buy a membership in Alpine Motorsports or BeaveRun Motorsports, both in Pennsylvania; New Jersey Motorsports Park in Millville; High Rock Raceway in North Carolina; Miller Motorsports Park in Tooele, Utah; or closer to home, Lime Rock Park in Connecticut. Many others are on the drawing boards. 
 Private racing clubs are a logical corollary to the run-up in values of collectible cars -- especially vintage racecars with credentials -- to prices that border on self-satire. For speed seekers among America's most affluent, it is not always enough that they can afford a car of distinguished racing pedigree; now they can test the limits of the car (and themselves) without having to wait for an organized track event. 
 And with the hot laps happening away from the public's eye, no one's the wiser if the driver's talent is not as heroic as imagined. Nor is it a problem if the well-heeled driver has no clear idea where the clutch pedal is: private clubs offer professional instructors to help.
 While the club concept has been adopted at many existing racetracks, the most exclusive are purpose-built facilities like the Monticello Motor Club being developed here, two hours northwest of Manhattan. The track is scheduled to open around Father's Day next June. 
 The club is taking shape in the economically stagnant Catskills, where the decline of Borscht Belt resorts has made job-creating projects a priority. Earth-movers have cleared 200 acres of the 700-acre property on the grounds of the former Monticello Airport and sculptured vast expanses of terrain. The developers say they have moved a half million cubic yards of earth.
 But that's just the beginning. The club -- a $50 million endeavor, according to the president and managing member of the Monticello club, William H. McMichael -- will focus on the most elite of recreational drivers. Hedge-fund moguls, communications barons and Wall Street lions are paying an initiation fee of $100,000 for the privilege of bringing their own racecars -- some multimillion-dollar mementos of history, others less precious -- to the track. There is also an annual $7,500 membership fee. Discussing the new circuit, Mr. McMichael, 40, beamed. ''I've driven on lots of tracks,'' he said. ''Friends of mine and I rent them whenever we can. And some tracks -- Mont Tremblant in Quebec, for instance -- are special. But our track is going to be special, too -- a track with soul.'' 
 A few twists in the road are to be expected in such an ambitious venture, of course. Mr. McMichael, who has sold his health care business, Trinity Homecare, said that he and two wealthy investment bankers had recently bought out Michael J. Kaplan, the developer who began the project. 
 Membership is not limited to novices; skilled amateur racers are expected to join as well. Still, club officials say the project's ''sweet spot'' is the person who, like Mr. McMichael, has been to a track and just wants to enjoy driving his cars. There will be three levels of driving: touring, or driving individually; lapping, or driving individually at high speeds; and racing. Members can hone their skills at their own comfort level. 
 Safety and comfort are priorities. There will be two-way communications with drivers on the track and a light system to warn if a car ahead has had a problem. The lights can also be used to keep cars separated during individual-lapping sessions. Putting just 12 cars on the 3.7-mile track affords ample solo driving room for everyone.
 James M. Glickenhaus, a general partner in his family's investment firm who also owns some priceless historic racecars, sees practical benefits to the individual lapping sessions. ''If I'm dialing in the fuel injection of my 1966 Ferrari P3/4,'' he said, ''I don't have to worry about some yahoo from the BMW Club putting me off,'' referring to a possible misstep by a less-skilled driver. 
 For Carlos J. Conde, an investment banker in Scarsdale, N.Y., and a veteran of the Ferrari Challenge series of competitions for production Ferraris, membership has other advantages: ''I joined because, at three-plus miles long, it's a very large track -- and it's within easy driving or helicopter distance.''
 A helicopter pad is among the promised amenities. The track is a complex blend of 12 shorter track segments that can be combined in different configurations and can be run clockwise or counterclockwise. It can also be segmented into three discrete circuits, allowing simultaneous lapping. ''The one thing I was afraid of is building a track where the same old corners and straightaways get boring,'' Mr. McMichael said. ''We'll have enough variety to keep members interested for 20 years.'' 
 But make no mistake -- the main 3.7-mile circuit will be a thrill ride. It will include replicas of the famous diving corkscrew turn sequence from Laguna Seca in California and the high-speed rising Eau Rouge curves from the Spa circuit in Belgium. 
 In carving out the course, the huge earth-moving exercise has also been directed toward reducing safety hazards. Wide paved runoff areas will be built on the borders of the corners; if the car slides far enough, the surface becomes increasingly grippy, restoring control. 
 Brian Redman, a professional racer with many wins to his credit, has helped with this aspect of the track design. ''Safety is just so important these days,'' Mr. Redman said in a telephone interview. ''Crash barriers keep the car on the track -- and the closer the better. That way, impacts with them will occur at a mild angle.'' 
 Including the racing veteran has another benefit. In addition to a full-time professional driving staff, Mr. Redman will be on hand 30 days a year to dispense instruction, wisdom and caution. 
 State-of-the-art electronics called autometrics and biometrics will be available at the club to monitor both the car and its driver. 
 Autometrics refers to a telemetry system that records the car's engine speed, braking points, acceleration, throttle position and other measures of performance and driving technique. Biometrics refers to the monitoring of a driver's physical exertion, including blood pressure, heart rate and even the pressure of his or her grip on the steering wheel. Monitoring physical condition in this high-stress activity (and taking into account the stressful lives members may lead), is a vital component of the experience. 
 Like luxury suites in sports stadiums, the Monticello club will cater to its members' comfort. The design for the main clubhouse -- think country club, not a grass-roots track from racing's early days -- is a five-story glass-enclosed structure that includes a fancy restaurant, social rooms and overnight accommodations for members.
 Robert J. Sechan, a Wall Street asset manager from New Canaan, Conn., sees an aspect of the club that reaches beyond cars. ''We're extremely busy people, and we aren't home a lot, so if I was going to spend time at the track, I want a bunch of friends there with me,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Housing May Dim Retail Hopes

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE holiday season begins this week, but if you expect Champagne corks to pop on Wall Street, prepare to be disappointed.
 Further depressing news from the housing market is likely to curb the urge to make merry, and nervousness among retailers could also damp the mood, said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance, the fund manager in Boston. The two factors are related, he said. 
 ''Quite clearly, the housing sector is in a recession,'' he said, ''and that's taking a big chunk out of the ability of people to have cash to spend.'' 
 The snapshot on Tuesday of housing-market conditions ''is probably going to tell us more of the same,'' he predicted. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts that the report on October housing starts will show a decline to an annual rate of 1.170 million from 1.191 million in September. A decline is also seen in building permits, to a 1.190 million annualized rate from 1.226 million.
 Mr. MacIntosh anticipates numbers that are at least that bad. ''Housing is pretty grim,'' he said. ''I don't think there will be any surprises there. The numbers always seem to come in a little worse than expectations.''
 The weakness in housing is making retailers lose sleep -- literally. Black Friday -- as the day after Thanksgiving is called because it was, historically, the time when stores turned a profit, or went into the black, for the year -- will have an early start. Some chains plan to open at midnight rather than at 6 a.m.
 ''That tells me they're pretty worried about sales this season,'' Mr. MacIntosh said. He noted that chain stores have been reporting annualized sales gains around 1.5 percent instead of the more typical 3 percent to 4 percent.
 Mr. MacIntosh harbors some apprehensions of his own as he contemplates the short-term outlook for the stock market. The weak conditions in two such important segments of the economy are likely to put a lid on share prices, he warned.
 ''I have a hard time seeing huge rallies,'' he said. ''This just isn't a period here in our economy where we're going to get good earnings growth.''
 DATA WATCH If Americans are becoming gloomier, another sign of it may arrive Friday, when the University of Michigan issues its final reading of consumer confidence for November. The Bloomberg poll calls for no change from the earlier reading this month of 75. Mr. MacIntosh points out, however, that the number has been eroding steadily over the last few months.

HEADLINE: Markets as Both Feast and Spectacle

BYLINE: By MIMI SHERATON

 BODY:
IT is a given that no serious traveler would forgo visits to museums, cathedrals, castles, monuments and legendary streets. Yet food markets deserve equally high billing on a must-see list. For as inspiring as the more standard sights can be, they do not rival the ebullience of modern-day markets and their colorful links to the economy, customs and even dialects of a city. 
 In a world ever more homogenized, food markets afford visitors one of the few opportunities to glimpse locals going about one of their essential daily chores. 
 The most dramatic of these sprawling, jumbled indoor or outdoor markets sell wholesale, generally between midnight and dawn, when one feels vaguely conspiratorial watching the alert trading action while much of the city sleeps. There's an instant spirit of camaraderie as strangers mingle among the lights and shadows, shouting, banging and clanging, inhaling whiffs of hot coffee and bracing alcohol that combine with scents of damp night air, gasoline, fish, spices, herbs and fruits that have so much more aroma elsewhere than they ever seem to at home. 
 Although I have enjoyed many night markets, none quite lives up to my first visit, in 1953 -- about 20 years before it was taken down -- to Les Halles, the famed old wholesale food center in the glass and iron pavilions in the heart of Paris, where grilled pigs' feet and cheese-mantled onion soup rounded off a night of high living. The most obvious and practical reason for such forays is to discover unfamiliar edibles so they can be spotted on menus and ordered with some idea of what to expect. But good luck to anyone who learns what to expect of the dried snakes, tortoise shells, insects and bones offered as cures amid the exotic herbal markets of Chengdu in Sichuan, China, or who can get close enough to taste one of Bali's stinking durian fruits when displayed cut open so their quality can be judged. 
 For instant satisfaction, most of these veritable fairs -- whether the Borough Market in London, La Merced in Mexico City or our own breathtaking Green Dragon Market in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania -- have ready-to-eat treats to be tasted on the spot or carried off to a park bench or to a hotel room, making a knife-fork-spoon set handy for furtive tastings. Most such impromptu picnics have ended happily for me, but an exception was a cold Melton Mowbray pork pie from an outdoor market in Leicestershire, England. Seated in a park, I anxiously unwrapped my treasure and sank my teeth into stiff white fat, and felt as though I had bitten into a candle. 
 Many markets serve some of the deep sea's most tantalizing treasures like the briny barnacles -- percebes -- at La Boqueria in Barcelona, also the spot to taste Jabugo ham, the world's best air-cured pork. Budapest's Central Market Hall offers de facto crash courses in the wonders of paprika, peppered pork and the soothing biscuits called pogasca. 
 But such practical pleasures may be the least of the lures. Attending this living theater, one can assess the local economy by noting the quality and variety of foods available and compare prices to our own. One can observe how locals treat one another. Are sellers and buyers polite and trusting as they deal under intense pressure -- the first to sell out highly perishable merchandise, the second to get the best value for family, shop or restaurant?
 Is there much bargaining, as in the vociferous 700-year-old Vucciria and even older Ballaro markets of Palermo where giant swordfish heads are displayed swords up on fish counters, or in the seductively fragrant spice markets like the exotic 17th-century Misir Carsisi (Egyptian Bazaar) in Istanbul, or in Khan el-Khalili in Cairo or the Levinksy in Tel Aviv, where oiled, claylike paprika is sculptured into towering cones that defy both breezes and the exuberant hand-waving of haggling buyers and sellers? (Theoretically passe, bargaining endures, an entertaining game few habitues would relinquish.)
 Or might the mores dictate truly one-price-only with no fear of heavy thumbs on scales, as at Helsinki's romantic morning harbor market, where you can find tiny almond-flavored potatoes, golden cloudberries, varieties of fresh herring, and smoked reindeer tongue, depending on the season. Or in Munich's outdoor Viktualienmarkt. Bordered by shops selling meat, fresh, smoked and pickled fish, this is a nosher's haven with many a schnell imbiss, or quick snack stand, for the hot liver pate, leberkase and morning weisswurst washed down with potent, lemon-sparked Munich weissbier.
 In my experience, the world's most spectacular market is in Tokyo, the Central Wholesale Market, a k a Tsukiji, or, more accurately perhaps, Fish City. This cavernous sprawl, indoors and out, is on the banks of the Sumidagawa River, and is curtained with mist as action begins at about 3 a.m. Raining or not (and it often is) boots and slickers are in order, for if the morning dew doesn't dampen you, the hoses that continuously keep concrete floors and counters airily fresh surely will. At outdoor entrance stands, small live mollusks and crustaceans bubble and sizzle in running aerated water, and piles of gnarled octopus look like so much amethyst quartz.
 Among the staggering aquarium array of brain food -- some five million pounds daily -- the star is tuna. The less flavorful varieties from such warm waters as the Indian Ocean are frozen whole and laid out like snowy fighter planes on an airfield. Tails are sliced off so potential buyers can examine cut ends to judge the quality mark of fat, all suggesting piscatorial proctologists diligently at work. Bluefin tuna is the prize at the auction, held around 5 a.m. The lightning-fast, voiceless bidding relies on rock-paper-scissors sort of hand movements.
 ABOUT 15 years ago I witnessed a 500-pound bluefin flown in from Montauk fetch $50,000 wholesale and watched it being cut with a lengthy sabrelike steel blade into tapering vertical quarters. Generously, I was offered bits of the meat clinging to the frame, a sort of lagniappe for good customers -- and no wonder! Still warm at the center, the moistly roseate flesh tasted like the most sublime, sweetly meaty filet mignon. Then there was the no-frills Daiwa sushi bar right in the market, where prices for the unadorned sushi of the pearliest fresh fish and live ''dancing'' shrimp were one-third of those in town.
 Anyone who doubts that meat can be so visually, viscerally stunning as fish, need only step into the butcher's hall in the Agora, Athens's central market. Prepare to be a bit unhinged at the vista of dripping, hacked cuts of all sorts and garlands of innards and organs. This wholesale and retail center just might be a warehouse for those who have committed bloody mayhem or, less violently, for a Rembrandt or a Soutine, painters who were intrigued by the brutal beauty of freshly slaughtered animals. Walk down row after row across the wide aisles and end at a steamy crowded cafe featuring tripe soups and stews. 
 Among markets that sell all sorts of comestibles to both the trade and the public, one of the most diverse and captivating is Borough Market in London. Said to be the city's oldest food market, established on the south bank of the Thames when the Romans built the first London Bridge, the Borough Market has been on its present site for 250 years. On Friday and Saturday its gates open to the retail public, and what a festive cornucopia it is. Not only are the stands overflowing with temptations, but there are also innumerable spots for snacking on free or paid samples. 
 Travelers might best skip imports in favor of such British specialties as various cockles, mussels and icy North Sea oysters, then compare Keen's and Quickes earthily complex Cheddar cheeses. There are Cornish pasties, jams, buns and biscuits galore, and crunchily fried fish (snowy thick cod and haddock are best) and chips, at the open stand called fish! Join the walking eating, or squat on chairs spotted around or, better yet, decamp to benches just five minutes across the road in the garden of Southwark Cathedral, a charmer of mixed architectural styles dating back to the 13th century.
 In Mexico City, La Merced is a vast fiesta of a central market, with several huge buildings. Stepping into each is a shock no matter how many times this rabid food lover does it. There are chilies, of course, in every shade of purple-black, green, orange, yellow and red, with fiery flavors from hot to inflammable. Piles of the nopales (cactus leaves) and prickly cactus pears, with or without needles, rainbows of corn and fragrantly inviting tacos, quesadillas and tamales are just a few of the enticements.
 My own pet sight here is the huge hanging sheets of chicharrones or pork cracklings, these made of whole pig skins opened flat and fried to resemble thick sheets of hammered gold leaf.
 In the United States, few if any farmer's markets can compare to the truly epic Green Dragon Market held every Friday in Ephrata, Pa. Nested in the peaceful, abundant farmlands of the Amish and the Mennonites, the seven main halls spread around 30 acres, hold all sorts of local provender with distinct Pennsylvania Dutch overtones. Scrapple, German-style sausages and cured pork, sauerkraut and glass jars of pickled hard-boiled eggs reddened with beet juice are featured at butcher stands. Bakery cases display Moravian cookies and pies called moon, Sunday, schnitz, love and the molasses-rich wet-bottom shoofly. Outside in good weather, funnel cakes are deep-fried in giant vats before being sprinkled with powdered sugar. Books, household goods, junk and antiques are on hand, but don't be sidetracked from the Mennonite celery.
 Having never imagined I could get excited about that banal salad vegetable, I was surprised to find upon tasting these tender, pale ivory stalks that I felt no need for salt -- a first and, perhaps, a last unless I can find that celery again. 
 In addition to food for people, the Green Dragon has feed for animals. Each Friday in a separate part of the field, open-back trucks packed with bales of hay, clover, alfalfa and grass line up so bearded, straw-hatted Amish farmers can inspect for mold or damp rot before rat-a-tat bidding tobacco-auction style.
 Most alluring now because they are so little known are the food markets of sub-Saharan Africa, most especially the Merkato in Addis Ababa, one of the largest food markets on the continent described most alluringly by Marcus Samuelsson in his cookbook ''The Soul of a New Cuisine: A Discovery of the Foods and Flavors of Africa'' (Wiley, 2006). Others on an African agenda should include the orderly, prosperous, covered Nairobi City Market in Kenya and, for contrast, the teeming, poorer wholesale Saidiyeh market in Zanzibar, Tanzania, where bright fruits and rooty vegetables are scattered on the cloth-covered ground.
 And, at this time of year, how could any market buff bypass a glorious Christkindlmarkt, held from the first Advent Sunday (this year, Dec. 2) until midday on Christmas Eve. A festive event throughout Austria, Germany, parts of Switzerland and Alsace, these daily fairs offer all sorts of gifts, ornaments and creche figures, along with dazzlements of food. Sputtering holiday sausages and silken goose liver, Christmas confections in marzipan, chestnuts and quince paste, St. Nicholas figures of wired prunes, pungent gingerbreads and cookies, and steaming hot clove-scented mulled gluhwein -- all fortify body and spirit against the dry, frosty night air.
