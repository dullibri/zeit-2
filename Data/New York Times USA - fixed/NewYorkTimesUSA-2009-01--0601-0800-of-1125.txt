HEADLINE: For the Brave, The Moment Is Now

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
WHILE the Titans of Wall Street now tremble at the thought of buying an apartment in this faltering real estate market, an emerging group of buyers is brave enough to look the Cyclops of uncertainty in the eye and begin shopping and even sign purchase contracts.
 Many of these buyers have never received a fat bonus check, so they don't miss it now. They did not suffer huge stock market losses, because they didn't have huge stock market investments. They aren't mourning the loss of value in their existing co-ops or condos, because they have never owned one. 
 They have jobs and good credit ratings, and they are looking to buy.
 And now, brokers say, these mostly first-time homeowners are taking advantage of reduced apartment prices and interest rates that have fallen to the lowest levels in a generation. They're making deals -- sometimes far below asking price -- on apartments marketed for under $1 million, and especially under $500,000. Still, the hard number of transactions remains depressed; in the fourth quarter of 2008, they were more than 30 percent below levels of a year earlier, according to a market report by the Corcoran Group. 
 But after months of uncertainty, when showrooms were all but empty and open houses largely ignored, would-be buyers have begun to emerge in the last few weeks, brokers said. They are looking from East Harlem to downtown Brooklyn for what may turn out to be bargain-priced apartments.
 Last weekend, in the midst of a blustery snowfall and National Football League playoff games, a steady stream of prospective buyers visited Observatory Place, a new condominium at First Avenue and 104th Street. They stroked the stone kitchen counters, glided across on the bamboo floors and gazed out of the large glass windows at views that include glimpses of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, formerly the Triborough, at least from the upper floors.
 Paul Hennessee, a music teacher at the Spence School, toured several one-bedroom apartments, a sleeping baby in the carrier on his chest. Mr. Hennessee and his wife, Rebecca Weis, an adolescent psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital, were priced out of their Manhattan rental a few years ago, and have been renting half of a two-family house in Astoria, Queens, a long commute for them both.
 They expected to have to wait a few more years until they could afford to buy, but with mortgage rates now so low (as low as 4.75 percent last week for a 15-year fixed mortgage on a condominium, with no points) the family of four decided to look for a modest one-bedroom.
 The couple were willing to sleep in the living room if they had to. ''We will do the Murphy bed,'' Dr. Weis said. ''We are looking while the mortgage rates are good.'' 
 Jessica Armstead, a broker at the Corcoran Group, showed the couple a two-bedroom apartment whose floor was lined with blue painter's tape, evidence of the developer's plan to divide it into two apartments, a $466,000 one-bedroom and a $340,000 studio, since small one-bedrooms had already sold out. 
 As they toured that Saturday afternoon, Ms. Armstead's cellphone kept ringing as the doorman announced other buyers arriving to look at the apartments. The Hennessees drifted away, but said they had plans to keep looking for apartments the next day.
 ''Our traffic has turned around,'' Ms. Armstead said, adding that agents had seen higher turnouts in the last two weeks than in pervious months. 
 At three tenement buildings on West 107th Street last weekend, buyers shuffled past one another as they climbed the narrow staircases, often up to the fifth floor, to look at newly renovated two-bedroom apartments in otherwise unrenovated buildings.
 The buyers, some of whom said they had been priced out of the market in the boom years, were drawn back by low prices and the promise of deals. 
 ''It is price, price, price,'' said Jason Haber, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''We get five to 15 inquiries a day.'' 
 At the buildings, Nos. 63 through 67 West 107th Street, between Manhattan and Columbus Avenues, prices for two-bedrooms range from $395,000 to $440,000, extraordinarily low for two-bedroom apartments in Manhattan. But the units were often narrow and small, typically 615 square feet.
 The apartments are among a number that Mr. Haber and his group are marketing on the West Side and Harlem in noneviction conversions of rental buildings owned by the Pinnacle Group, which has been embroiled in disputes with tenant groups over evictions in its buildings in the last few years. 
 ''There will be some room for negotiations,'' Henry Orenstein, a broker in Mr. Haber's group, told several buyers. 
 While brokers used to cater to financiers and hedge fund managers, they are now singing the praises of the common worker of far more modest income.
 ''The meat-and-potatoes buyers are coming out right now,'' said Kristina Leonetti, a broker at the Corcoran Group.
 Inge Colsen, who works in music marketing, went into contract a few days before Christmas with Ms. Leonetti's help on a corner one-bedroom on the 10th floor of a new 14-story building at 358 Grove Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, with sweeping views over the surrounding low-rise apartment buildings. 
 Her parents, who live in the Netherlands, had been pressing her for years to get her own apartment, sending her e-mail messages with listings from brokers and Craigslist. They wanted her to buy because they were not keen on the sometimes roommate-packed rentals she has lived in, some in Northside Williamsburg when it was considered dangerous, she said.
 When she finally decided to buy, with the help of her parents, she said they found ''the market was on their side.'' With Ms. Leonetti's help she was able to negotiate the price from $353,000 to about $270,000, a 24 percent discount. She closed on Wednesday.
 Another would-be Brooklyn buyer, Tarsha Carvey, an executive assistant in a lobbying and consulting firm, Reiter/Begun Associates, had been in the market for a studio. But she is now angling for a deal on a one-bedroom condominium, at be@schermerhorn, a new development in two buildings on Schermerhorn Street, near Hoyt Street in downtown Brooklyn. 
 The fifth-floor apartment has an asking price of $389,000. But she is hoping to get it for less, ''with the market being where it is.''
 ''At this moment it is totally favorable,'' she said. Like many other buyers active in this segment of the market, she said she preferred a condominium over a co-op because condos place fewer financial requirements on buyers. And her broker, Ms. Leonetti, is working with the developer to make sure the project qualifies for F.H.A. loans that could allow her to put less cash down. 
 There is no question that buyers are firmly in charge.
 Barbara Rellstab, a real estate broker and former actress, is expecting a baby in May. She fell in love with the first apartment that she looked at. It is a 1,352-square-foot one-bedroom apartment with a den and a private rear garden on the first floor of an elegantly restored former church at 2056 Fifth Avenue and West 127th Street in Upper Manhattan. 
 The asking price was $699,000, but she bought it for $9,000 less. The final price was $270,000, or 28 percent, below its asking price as of March 2008. Prices might fall further, she said, but she bought it late last month. ''I need the apartment now,'' she said.
 Some buyers are driven to buy in the current market because they feel rents have not fallen as fast as sale prices. 
 Two years ago when his lease was up, James Bobrowski, an accountant, looked for apartments with Lawrence Rich, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. But the market was over his head.
 With his lease up again, Mr. Bobrowski went looking again and at the end of October signed a contract to buy a one-bedroom apartment in a high-rise at 240 East 40th Street, for $700,000, Mr. Rich said, 5 percent off the $740,000 asking price. He closed last month.
 Still, a great uncertainty for buyers in the current market is whether prices will fall further, as Ms. Rellstab fears.
 In the slowdown of the 1980s, prices continued to fall over several years, especially for smaller, less desirable apartments. But that was at least in part because a construction boom had created a glut of studios and one-bedroom apartments. 
 In recent years, many developers have concentrated on larger, more expensive apartments.
 But it isn't clear when a market hits bottom until after it happens. ''The minute everyone feels the market has leveled off, you are going to see people coming out of the woodwork to buy,'' Mr. Rich said. 
 As for Mr. Hennessee and Dr. Weis, after exploring Observatory Place on Saturday, they ventured out to visit six other apartments on Sunday. 
 On the way, they came across an open house at another new condominium, the Mirada, at 161 East 110th Street at Lexington Avenue, much closer to the subway than Observatory Place. Now they hope to buy a one-bedroom there.
 ''We are pretty set on it,'' Mr. Hennessee said.

HEADLINE: 12 Break-Ins After City Made Him Remove Barbed Wire

BYLINE: By JENNIFER V. HUGHES

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
 FOR years, James Lawson said, his small used-car lot in Newark's West Ward was rarely hit by thieves. 
 But last summer the city told him to remove the barbed wire atop the fence protecting JL Auto Sales because it violated a seldom-used 1966 ordinance. Since then, he said, burglars have struck more than a dozen times, swiping $25,000 worth of car parts. 
 Mr. Lawson raised the fence from 8 to 13 feet to no avail. The break-ins continued, so he has taken to sleeping in his car, parked on the street, to keep an eye on the lot. 
 ''It's very frustrating,'' Mr. Lawson said. ''All that I have put in here? To lose it? It's discouraging.'' 
 Mayor Cory A. Booker said his administration had begun enforcing the ordinance as part of his crackdown on quality-of-life issues. No property owners have been fined, but about 130 were told last year to take down their barbed or razor wire. 
 Because of complaints from business owners like Mr. Lawson, however, Mr. Booker said he was now looking into options, including revising the ordinance. He said that while business owners have ''a legitimate gripe,'' his objection to barbed wire remains strong. 
 ''I don't want Newark to look like a prison,'' Mr. Booker said recently after a news conference about 2008 crime statistics. 
 Other cities in New Jersey have grappled with the issue of barbed wire fencing. 
 While Jersey City does not specifically ban it, there are housing and fencing ordinances that code officers can use to cite property owners and about a dozen are cited each year, said Jennifer Morrill, a spokeswoman for the city. 
 In Camden, barbed wire is permitted only in the city's industrial zones, but Iraida Afanador, the director of code enforcement, said no businesses had been cited in the past two years. 
 In Newark, the use of barbed and razor wire is widespread; more than a dozen auto shops, parking lots and other properties use it in the blocks surrounding JL Auto, including a lot owned by the city's water department. 
 ''It's not fair,'' said Mr. Lawson. ''If we have to take it down, then everyone in the city should, too.''
 The mayor agreed that uneven enforcement needs to be addressed. Stefan Pryor, deputy mayor for economic development, said one method might be to create an easier way for businesses to win exemptions from the law. 
 Once a final decision is made, Mr. Booker said, the city will follow whatever rules are set. 
 West Ward Councilman Ronald C. Rice said that he hoped to have a legislative proposal to address the problem by the end of the month and that he also planned to get better lighting in the area and increase police patrols. 
 While Newark has seen a recent drop in violent crime, burglaries rose 13.7 percent from 2007 to 2008.
 John DeSantis owns the land where JL Auto leases space. Although he has not personally lost property, he is helping his tenant fight the ordinance. 
 ''I can understand the city wants a different image,'' he said. ''But since the Police Department does not have the manpower to patrol the area sufficiently, it's ludicrous to remove a business owner's ability to protect their property.'' 
 Even the ordinance in question is not completely clear. 
 United Parcel Service, which has a parking lot ringed with barbed wire, also on Central Avenue, received the same warning letter as JL Auto. A U.P.S. spokeswoman, Kristen Petrella, said the company had not removed its barbed wire because it believes the fence is permitted under the ordinance, which refers at one point to ''sharp projections facing outward.''
 U.P.S. argues that because its wire faces inward, it can remain. But the company has not heard back from the city. Mr. Lawson's barbed wire also faced inward, but, he said, he was still told to remove it. 
 Balancing a desire for security and aesthetics is a conundrum many cities are facing, said Stephanie Bush-Baskette, director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers Newark. Aesthetics are far from a lofty goal, she said. 
 ''When you look at barbed wire, how does that make the general person feel? How does it make the person who lives in that community feel?'' she said. ''Does it make them feel like they have a vested interest? Does it make them feel like they like where they shop? What do people think of when they think of barbed wire? 
 ''It's cold and painful. In a community that you want to thrive, you want to make people feel good about that community.''

HEADLINE: With Stimulus On Horizon, Race Begins

BYLINE: By DIANA MARSZALEK

DATELINE: MAMARONECK 

 BODY:
 A WASTEWATER treatment project may not pique public interest the way building a new Tappan Zee Bridge would, but backers of the sewage project are already lobbying for it to be a priority in Westchester when federal economic stimulus money comes through.
 With the economy in tatters, the potential infusion of federal dollars to finance local infrastructure projects has government leaders eagerly anticipating the possibilities. But there is a long list of competing projects in the state, officials say. 
 Updating sewage treatment plants to help clean up Long Island Sound, buying hybrid buses and reducing Westchester's toll on the environment by replacing energy systems, lights and windows in county buildings are on federal, state and local officials' wish lists should there be enough stimulus money to go around. So are smaller-scale projects, like upgrading traffic signals from Cortlandt Manor to Bronxville, sprucing up downtown Peekskill and covering part of a $36 million Pleasantville High School expansion.
 Before the spending begins, however, planning experts are urging decision makers not only to consider projects that meet the short-term goals of creating jobs and fixing what already exists, but also to focus on projects that look to future needs.
 ''Don't spend the money the same old way, because the same old way is what has gotten us into the problems we are in, to a great degree,'' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association, based in New York City. 
 Fixing deteriorating infrastructure is an obvious priority, Mr. Zupan said. In order for stimulus dollars to have a lasting effect, however, not all projects should be tackled at once, he said. Rather, they should be done in phases so planners can make sure they promote long-term change in transportation systems, be environmentally sound and develop a skilled workforce through job training, he said. 
 It is also essential that there be accountability of transportation projects to gauge their long-term ramifications, Mr. Zupan said. For such projects to have a meaningful effect, he said, they must address the larger issues of creating transit systems that reduce not only congestion but also environmental concerns. 
 Such merits will have to be considered before money is disbursed, particularly because New York officials, including those from Westchester, will probably get only ''some fraction'' of their requests, he said.
 More than 100 Westchester projects are among the 1,900-plus statewide that will vie for federal dollars once Barack Obama and Congress decide how much money will be available and how exactly it should be spent, said Marissa Shorenstein, a spokeswoman for Gov. David A. Paterson. 
 Two of the few known qualifications are that projects seeking funding should be ''shovel-ready'' -- ready to go once money is secured -- and that they should help create jobs, officials said. That precludes some of the biggest Westchester projects on the horizon, like building a new Tappan Zee Bridge, because they are too early in the planning stages.
 While Westchester officials said they were anxiously awaiting word on what would qualify for federal funds, they were wasting no time in getting priority projects in front of state and Congressional leaders.
 Take, for example, proponents of rehabilitating sewage treatment plants in New Rochelle and Mamaroneck, which would curb the amount of pollutants discharged into Long Island Sound, the officials said. Supporters of the work, which has a $235 million price tag, include Representative Nita M. Lowey and Andrew J. Spano, the county executive. 
 The benefits of upgrading the treatment plants, they said, are clear: cleaner water and the creation of about 450 jobs to get it done.
 ''We can't dillydally,'' Ms. Lowey said last Monday at a news conference at the Mamaroneck plant. ''This has to do with jobs. This has to do with the environment. And this has to do with getting the economy moving.''
 Mr. Spano, also at the news conference, agreed. ''A $235 million project to get nutrients out of the Sound is a perfect project for what they are talking about it Washington,'' he said. 
 The project is in keeping with other green projects that Mr. Spano hopes to get financed. That includes replacing existing energy management systems in county buildings. At a cost of $8 million, it would save the county $800,000 a year, according to the proposal. Upgrading the Westchester County Center's energy systems would cost $1.5 million but save $162,000 a year, according to Mr. Spano's office. Other proposals include replacing the windows in the county's Michaelian Office Building in White Plains, a $6 million endeavor that would save $300,000 a year, according to the proposal.
 County leaders also hope to replace 20 buses, each with a capacity for 18 passengers, with hybrid vehicles that would carry twice as many people and burn less fuel. That would cost $7.2 million.
 Officials said they were looking to the future in other ways as well. 
 Chuck Lesnick, the Yonkers City Council president, said that even municipalities that do not get economic stimulus money directly may ultimately benefit from the program. For instance, a regional plan to ease Westchester traffic, particularly near communities along the Hudson River, is nowhere near being shovel-ready in time to receive federal dollars, he said. However, that plan could become feasible when state money becomes available because the state will have a smaller backlog of projects once the stimulus money finances some of them. 
 Mary Ann Crotty, a transportation consultant, agreed. At a time when the state is facing staggering budget shortfalls, the availability of economic stimulus money could breathe new life into projects that would otherwise be dead, Ms. Crotty said. 
 Meantime, county officials said they were eager to get stimulus money moving to make necessary improvements. But doing so must meet both Westchester's immediate and long-term goals. 
 ''We want to do it quickly,'' said Matthew Dennis, a spokesman for Representative Lowey. ''But more importantly, we want to do it right.''

HEADLINE: Dream Cars Meet Harsh Reality

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
DETROIT
WHEN times get tough, auto designers get wild. Or at least they used to.
During previous economic downturns, either for the nation at large or for individual companies, flaunting exotic concept cars at auto shows has been a way for automakers to show defiance in the face of adversity and to assert hope for the future. Bold dream cars are visual pep talks, helping to build morale.
But this year, dark economic clouds seem to have cast a shadow even over the designers displaying their ideas at the Detroit auto show. Concept cars are expensive to build and budgets are tight. Furthermore, automakers gathered here last week under the stern eye of the government -- and a public that has put its own money on the line to help them. So no company, and certainly not the hometown teams seeking a helping hand from taxpayers, wanted to be perceived as wasting money on show-biz glitz or sci-fi fantasy. 
''We now have a special bond with the American public,'' said James E. Press, vice chairman of Chrysler, as he presented his company's concept cars. Since Chrysler has received some federal money and is hoping for more, it surprised no one that the smallest of the Detroit Three, which in previous years staged elaborate theatrics at the show -- crashing Jeeps through windows and herding cattle through the streets -- kept its introductions somber and low-key.
The concept cars this year were mostly versions of production models that will be in salesrooms in a couple of years -- if their companies survive.
''You see fewer blue-sky concepts this year,'' said Bryan Nesbitt, General Motors' vice president for North American design. ''You can no longer just throw a wild concept out there. You have to have a story.''
A concept that lacks a context is simply confusing. For instance, in 2004 Chrysler showed the ME Four-Twelve, a midengine supercar with a V-12 engine. Though it excited horsepower-hungry showgoers, it had no place in the company's business plan and didn't mesh with the image that the Chrysler brand was trying to project.
Mazda has drawn attention in recent years for some of the most provocative concept cars, but it did not display any concepts at all this year. Laurens van den Acker, general manager of Mazda's design division, said that was because the company was now busy applying to production cars the themes it had developed in design studies.
Despite the auto industry's current troubles -- dark humor at the show included puns about Kar-trina, Carmageddon and Carpocalypse Now -- the Detroit Three may now have their best designs in years. There is more conviction and identity in the lines of cars from G.M., Ford and Chrysler.
Chevrolet's dual-port (''twin grin'') grille presents a new face to the world for that nameplate, an identity that is versatile enough to go in front of models from the Malibu family sedan to the Spark minicar, which was introduced at the show. Cadillac's design language showed continued versatility on two new cars, the SRX crossover and the Converj concept, a luxury version of the Volt extended-range electric car.
Ford's vice president for design, J Mays, has been talking about brand consistency for years. At last he has achieved that with a four-bar grille and a family look from the bottom of the line, with the Fiesta and Focus, through the boxy Flex and midsize Fusion to the new Taurus sedan unveiled here.
Even Chrysler exuded confidence with its 200C concept car, offered not just as an electric-car concept, but as a new design path for the embattled company. It is easy to envision the 200C as a future Chrysler flagship.
Ralph Gilles, who is Chrysler's vice president for design, sees the 200C as a sign of impending revival. ''It shows that a car can be art again,'' he said.
Mr. Gilles compares the situation of Chrysler today with some difficult past periods: in the early 1990s, when the company developed its successful, spacious LH cars, like the Dodge Intrepid, and even in the 1930s, when the radical Airflow appeared, a precursor of streamlined cars to come. More recently, there was the daring Chrysler 300, which Mr. Gilles designed. He is ready to repeat the process.
''I can't wait,'' he said. ''We are at the bottom of the sine curve.''
Sine curves are wavy lines that, among other things, chart economic indexes. They also show up in the profile of the Volvo S60 concept car, which may be the boldest design study at the show, even though it presages a production model. The car takes its shape from the interplay of two curving lines: the roof and the shoulder.
''This is a new design DNA for Volvo,'' said Steve Mattin, senior vice president for design, while standing beside his car. He said the lines were inspired by the coastline and cliffs of Sweden. Inside, a center console -- made of Orrefors crystal -- resembles a waterfall.
The liquid shape of the car will no doubt be firmed up when the production version appears in a year or so. But the fact that Volvo, of all brands, should have one of the most far-out cars in Cobo Center suggests how tame the 2009 Detroit show really was.
The Volvo is another take on the ''four-door coupe'' genre pioneered by the Mercedes-Benz CLS. So is one of the cars that beat it for the Eyes on Design award for best concept car, the Audi Sportback. While electric drive systems were so abundant that the show's mascot could have been the Energizer bunny, few concept cars gave explicit external evidence of their electric innards. The Converj is an example: at first glance it could be a small crossover. The message of the Converj, according to G.M.'s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, is that it showed ''electric can meet the expectations of even a luxury-car audience.''
The Mercedes Concept BlueZero looks unconventional, if not outright ''electric.'' The stubby city car appeared to wear side surfaces borrowed from BMW, while its shape echoed Mercedes's Boxfish car, derived by computer analysis from nature, but so homely that it was almost hidden in a screened box hung above the company's display.
Mr. Nesbitt of G.M. said that companies used concept cars in several ways. One is to reshape public perceptions of a brand, and another is to guide designers in shaping the evolution of a brand's vehicles.
''We have to do that, whether we show the results or not,'' he said. Designers have to project an idealized future to guide their efforts, even if the work is out of view. Design studios are still full of dream cars, even if the public doesn't see them at car shows.

HEADLINE: Can the Go-To Site Get You to Stay?

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
K. C. ESTENSON, the new general manager of CNN.com, has a thought or two about most news sites on the Web: they're predictable and homogeneous. Seen one, seen 'em all.
 Even his own site, he says, could use more of a ''unique signature.'' 
 While traffic to the home page of CNN.com is higher than ever, ''my hunch is that people go to it more out of habit than they do out of love,'' he says. Love, in fact, is exactly what Mr. Estenson is pursuing.
 Online ardor will get a test on Tuesday, with the inauguration of Barack Obama. Because millions of Americans will be at their desks for the noon-hour swearing-in, the event is expected to set new records for live Web video watching -- a moment that CNN.com is well positioned to exploit. 
 As newspaper revenue collapses and television revenue stagnates, every media company is rushing to reformat news for the digital generation. To that end, they are placing expensive bets in the hope of answering two pointed questions: How will news organizations continue to sustain themselves? And what will the digital newsroom of the future look like?
 To a greater degree than most other media companies, CNN, the cable news channel of record, has figured it out. Using page views as a metric, Nielsen ranked CNN.com as the No. 1 current events and global news Web site last year, with a monthly average of 1.7 billion -- half a billion views more than its nearest competitor, MSNBC.com.
 Analysts say the Web site represents the fastest-growing part of CNN's revenue, reflecting the sharp increase in online consumption. 
 For decades, ''What channel is CNN?'' was a recurrent query when a jury reached a verdict, when the towers burned, and when war broke out. Now, people also ask: ''Where do I log on?'' In fact, the emergency landing of an airliner last week in the Hudson River generated one of the biggest traffic spikes ever for news Web sites.
 This transition, of course, has been happening for years, and it continues today, a headline at a time. Last year, for the first time, more Americans said they received most of their national and international news from the Internet than from print, according to the Pew Research Center. 
 Television remains the leading outlet for news, but the trend favoring the Internet is undeniable. Richard D. Parsons, the former chief executive of CNN's parent Time Warner, alluded to it in 2007 when he told investors, ''I worry more about CNN now than I do about CNN.com.''
 Television continues to account for a vast majority of CNN's revenue. But the Web is becoming more than just another ancillary revenue stream for CNN, according to Greg D'Alba, the company's head of ad sales. 
 Until early 2008, most online ads were sold in conjunction with television advertising packages, adding incremental revenue. 
 ''What we saw early last year was an appetite for digital-only,'' says Mr. D'Alba, acknowledging that the shift surprised him. ''We knew then that our digital product could stand on its own.''
 WHEN people boot up their computers in the morning or browse Web sites while at work, they tend to check one of a handful of sites for news headlines. While news choices on the Internet are seemingly endless, the ''Web news wars'' are concentrated among a few top competitors. 
 Mr. Estenson says that in addition to CNN.com, he focuses on four other sites: those of MSNBC, Yahoo News, AOL News and The New York Times. Of those, MSNBC is his primary challenger. 
 For a decade now, MSNBC and CNN have traded places at the top of the online news heap. To win bragging rights and a bigger share of online advertising revenue, the two sites are constantly seeking the No. 1 spot. On a monthly basis during 2008, MSNBC.com's network of sites received more visitors than CNN.com's network, according to Nielsen -- though CNN.com's visitors still viewed substantially more pages. 
 ''Neither is the No. 1 cable news network, which is ironic,'' notes Merrill Brown, a former editor in chief of MSNBC.com who now consults for Internet companies. (That honor belongs to Fox News.)
 Indeed, popularity on TV and in print has not necessarily translated to the Web. Fox News draws more viewers than CNN and MSNBC, but it lags far behind both online. Other TV news organizations, including ABC News and CBS News, are essentially also-rans on the Web.
 CNN got a head start. The site, which made its debut in 1995, ''wasn't a promotional site for TV; it was actually a news platform for a news-consuming audience,'' says Susan Grant, the executive vice president of CNN News Services, an umbrella for the company's Internet businesses. And Time Warner has lavished attention and money on the site. Years ago, while other media companies treated the Web as a distraction, CNN's executives set the network on an interactive course. Tom Johnson, a former chairman of the CNN News Group, said in 2000 that the Web would be ''one of the most -- if not the most -- important parts'' of the brand's future. ''We will be a ubiquitous service,'' he said.
 Traffic grew gradually for CNN.com. On Election Day in 2000, CNN.com recorded 100 million page views, a monumental number at the time. On the same day last year, the site had 282 million page views, also setting a record.
 CNN now is as close as any news entity is to achieving ubiquity, with an array of television channels, Web sites, a radio network, airport TV sets and magazines. It is even signing up newspapers for a wire service -- fed by CNN.com -- that will compete with The Associated Press. 
 The challenge, for Mr. Estenson and others, is to make CNN.com more distinctive. At the end of a long day recently, he showed a visitor screen grabs of four Web pages on his Macbook Air. 
 ''When you look at the top news sites, they often look almost identical,'' he says, gesturing to the home pages of CNN, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and Yahoo News. Down to photo choices and color schemes, the four sites look practically interchangeable and utilitarian, he says -- hence his emphasis on the power of ''unique signatures.''
 An unusual choice for his new job, Mr. Estenson was tapped to run CNN.com in July after spending seven years at the Walt Disney Company, where he oversaw entertainment sites. 
 Propelled by what he calls the ''constant positive dissatisfaction'' of his bosses, Mr. Estenson is acting as CNN.com's in-house optometrist, constantly trying to improve the site's vision. 
 To that end, he wants to ensure that CNN.com's success doesn't cripple innovation. ''Fear of change can send you to a very conservative place,'' he says, rolling up his shirt sleeves. ''We want to redefine the news experience.''
 Already, CNN.com is a well-oiled news machine. With headquarters in Atlanta, the site has about 125 staff members. Producers on the news desk post ''breaking news'' banners and select stories to highlight on an ever-changing home page. 
 The site is well known for sometimes offbeat headlines. A recent sampling included ''Teen sends 14,528 texts in one month'' and ''Co-ed's virginity selling for over $3.7M.'' A T-shirt icon next to some stories lets users order a shirt with the headline on it.
 On the more traditional side, CNN.com holds morning meetings to discuss the day's priorities and to divvy up assignments. The work is coordinated with CNN's television channels and other platforms, allowing the company's journalists to ''produce in parallel,'' says Rena Golden, the executive producer of CNN.com.
 Creating such collaboration wasn't easy. For years, the site was largely independent of the television network. CNN.com would receive video from TV crews, for instance, but only after the made-for-TV segment had been pieced together. 
 All of that has changed. Now, production is concurrent for each platform and stories often appear first online. Alex Wellen, an editor on the politics site of CNN.com, said that integration was a struggle.
 ''It's a very complicated thing to integrate newsrooms, to change people's job descriptions, and to establish trust across multiple platforms,'' he says. ''The challenge is herculean.''
 While CNN's various platforms haven't completely converged, they are far more integrated than they once were.
 Tracking audience sweet spots is also a juggling act. CNN's television arm exerts much of its pull during the prime-time hours of 8 to 11 p.m., when advertising rates and audience levels are highest. But for the Web news desk in Atlanta, prime time is the lunch hour, when users log on during work breaks.
 More broadly, Ms. Golden defines ''Web prime'' as 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. During those hours, the home page will feature six or seven lead stories, on average, so no one headline lingers too long.
 Feeding the home page are a growing number of reporters who are assigned to the Web, and pointedly not to television or radio. CNN.com counts two Pulitzer Prize winners on its staff. 
 In October, CNN.com posted a memorable story about Ann Nixon Cooper, a 106-year-old in Atlanta who intended to vote for Mr. Obama. He ended up referring to her in his victory speech on election night. Mr. Estenson said that to his chagrin, that story was highlighted on the home page for only two hours. 
 Mr. Estenson says he wants CNN's most distinctive content on the home page because he believes those stories keep readers on the site longer. Every week, he studies a pie chart that shows the ''bounce rate'' for CNN.com. It measures how many users view one Web page and then leave the site, akin to a shopper who browses without buying. 
 Right now, more than half of CNN.com's visitors are just browsing. Last year, MSNBC drew more users but CNN kept them on the site longer. If Mr. Estenson can lower the bounce rate, he can further increase page views, potentially reaping millions more in ad dollars.
 WHICH brings us to a pivotal issue: money. While audiences for online news sites are growing, ''revenue is everyone's billion-dollar question,'' Mr. Brown says.
 CNN.com formally achieved profitability eight years ago, the company said; Time Warner doesn't break out separate revenue figures for the unit. In an era when ''monetization'' is a buzz word among news organizations migrating to the Web, CNN.com has been able to capitalize on its traffic surge by keeping visitors on the site longer, thus exposing them to more ads.
 It's also trying to make money from more experimental forays. During the inauguration coverage on Tuesday, for the first time, CNN.com Live, the Web site's video arm, will include TV-style commercial breaks. Until now the only ads on the streaming service have been snippets that play before the main clip, and small sponsorship banners.
 Amid a recession, advertising sales are sluggish on television and online, putting a damper on CNN's growth plans. But CNN.com is expected to remain flush; while Web revenue doesn't match TV's, the costs aren't nearly as high. 
 Mr. Estenson and other executives expect that the digital operation will one day surpass television in revenue, echoing predictions of other executives confronting the Internet revolution. 
 And his estimate of when that day might come is sobering, despite CNN.com's financial buoyancy: 10 to 20 years from now.
 EXTENDING CNN.com's reach, in part through partnerships with other Web brands, is a priority for Mr. Estenson. In Washington last week, he huddled with staff members at YouTube, the Google platform that is the world's biggest video-sharing Web site, to discuss a collaboration. 
 The week before, CNN announced a deal with another Web darling, Facebook, to allow users to update their Facebook status messages while watching CNN's video stream of the inauguration. CNN.com's coverage of the event is now marked on the online calendars of hundreds of thousands of Facebook users.
 Still, success has its burdens, as the inauguration will test. While television easily digests a sudden swelling in its audience, the Internet isn't as stable. 
 Mr. Estenson notes that one of the Web's biggest live streams occurred last March, when an Oprah.com event was streamed by more than 500,000 users. It was plagued by technical problems. 
 For Inauguration Day, CNN has reserved racks of extra server space. Not knowing how many people will watch the swearing-in online, Mr. Estenson says, ''is nerve-racking.''

HEADLINE: A Mixed Market as Auction Season Begins

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
THE collector car market, on the eve of the six auctions that take place in January in and around Phoenix, defies generalization. Some sectors of the market are down measurably, while others are not. 
 Muscle cars with production numbers greater than 1,000 or so have perhaps retreated to 2005 prices, according to Colin Comer, a Milwaukee dealer and author of ''Million Dollar Muscle Cars'' (Motorbooks, 2007).
 ''But those with lower production numbers, with the exception of Hemi-powered Dodges and Plymouths, don't seem to be down at all,'' Mr. Comer said. Here are a few examples of the cars being auctioned:
 1963 CHEVROLET CORVETTE FUEL INJECTED COUPE. At Barrett-Jackson. This is the most celebrated of the second-generation Corvettes, produced from 1963-67, because of the split-rear-window design. This same car sold in 2001 at Barrett-Jackson for $45,360. It seems a certainty that this car should do 30 to 50 percent better.
 FERRARI 250GT TOUR DE FRANCE BERLINETTA At RM Auctions. The last reported public offering of this beautiful competition Ferrari was in Monte Carlo in November 1991. The Ferrari bubble had recently burst, and while the car might have brought $1.5 million or more in 1990, it was bid to just $781,676 in Monte Carlo and failed to sell. Even adjusted for inflation, at RM's presale estimate of $2 million-$2.5 million, the car appears to have regained its former value and then some. 
 1964 AMPHICAR At RM. Amphicars are rather clever vehicles that were designed to function as both a car and a boat. But not unlike the all-in-one fax, copier, printer and scanner, it functioned particularly well neither as a car nor a boat. Amphicars are prone to the whims of the crowd at an auction, and this one, which sold in Florida for $61,600 a year ago, will probably sell in land-locked Arizona for around that amount, perhaps plus or minus $5,000.

HEADLINE: Suburban Spirit to the Rescue

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

DATELINE: PELHAM 

 BODY:
 THE current film ''Revolutionary Road'' paints a dismal picture of suburban life. 
 Right from the early shots of Leonardo DiCaprio standing on a 1950s-era train platform with an army of buttoned-down commuters -- all men, all wearing fedoras -- and then flowing with them through Grand Central as if he were part of a column of lemmings, the film depicts suburbia as regimented, vapid, conformist, with an ambience that drives its inhabitants crazy or into deep despair. The desperation is not quiet, but noisy: Mr. DiCaprio's character squabbles regularly with his aproned wife, played by Kate Winslet, as she unhappily tends her streamlined kitchen.
 The movie, as some reviewers have said, is powerfully affecting, well directed and well acted. Nevertheless, it is useful to remind urban chauvinists that even if the suburbs were like this in the 1950s, they have undergone a sea change. Practically no one wears a fedora, and there are almost as many women as men on the platforms during rush hours. More than a few artists, eccentrics, iconoclasts and, yes, revolutionaries of a sort have settled along the suburban roads and cul-de-sacs. (Remember that the suburbs voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama, not for the candidate of the party in power.) 
 Whatever its flaws, suburbia often continues to reflect its small-town origins, and a communal spirit that can reveal itself in surprising, even lyrical ways, as it did when a fire on New Year's Eve burned out the Pelham Manor home of a family of six and the community responded in breathtakingly generous ways. 
 Such outpourings should remind people who see ''Revolutionary Road'' that the suburbs it portrays are principally a setting for the story of a marriage gone sour as its partners blindly flail around trying to figure out how they want to live their lives. 
 Indeed, the film's martini-sipping Manhattan residents, though briefly glimpsed, are just as conformist and just as unhappy, and have also made bad bargains with their destinies. 
 That awful Pelham Manor fire started when the Bradys -- Betsy and Grant and their four children, Carter, 10; Mason, 8; Lance, 6; and Leila, 3 -- were at a party at the local country club. Someone rushed in to inform them their home was burning. By the time they got there, the 106-year-old, three-story gabled house, on the graceful Esplanade, was engulfed in flames and unsalvageable. Practically everything they owned was destroyed.
 But the community -- right on the border of the Bronx -- came together with an enthusiasm and vigor reminiscent of pioneer barn raisings. The crisis wasn't just left to the Red Cross. On New Years's Day, when much of America was busy nursing hangovers or hopping cocktail parties, neighbors started dropping off clothes and supplies at the doorstep of a relative's house where the Bradys had taken refuge. 
 Their friends Stacey Gaine and Alix Dunn sent out a mass e-mailing, and soon pots and pans, linens, towels, laundry baskets, toys, and school and cleaning supplies arrived. Much of the stuff was new.
 By the weekend, a local real estate agent, Betty Bucher, had found the Bradys a fully furnished rental house a half-mile from their home's charred shell. DeCicco, a local supermarket, filled the Bradys' pantry and refrigerator, and a restaurant, La Fontanella, sent over a dinner. 
 Another good friend, Roland Rogers, who owns a computer business in New Rochelle, set up the Brady Family Support Site, kirkor.com/bradys. It updated neighbors on what the Bradys still needed and what they needed no longer.
 ''In four days, the community replaced almost every single thing they needed to get a home started,'' said Melissa Ronan, a neighbor.
 Hundreds of people have pitched in. Neighbors who played on Pelham sports teams with the Brady boys brought them trophies to replace those that had burned.
 Others brought class pictures and other photographs containing shots of the Bradys so the family could have the kinds of pictures that remind us of the lives we have led. 
 ''I know of at least two people who had the Bradys' Christmas card on their bulletin boards and framed it and gave it to the Bradys,'' Ms. Ronan said. ''Someone replaced the boys' Cub Scout uniforms.''
 By Jan. 5, a Monday, three of the children were back in Siwanoy Elementary School, where teachers and students collected 75 books so the Brady children could have something to read in their displaced state.
 And if all that were not enough, Lorraine White and Carmen Hartigan set up a schedule for volunteers who would feed the Bradys as dinner guests every other evening. Don't rush to volunteer: The Bradys are booked until March.
 This cascade of benevolence occurred during a corrosive economy where people are thinking twice before buying anything. 
 ''This town is unbelievable,'' Ms. Ronan said. ''Whenever something happens, someone gets sick, or there's a death, people take care of each other's kids. There's no reluctance to step in -- no sense that it's private and the people wouldn't want us to step in.''
 Through friends, the Bradys begged off an interview, saying they wanted to keep their lives private. But they wrote a letter of gratitude to The Pelham Weekly.
 ''Everybody should be as fortunate as us to be able to experience such a true outpouring of love and support at some point in their lifetime,'' it said.
 Seems that the suburbs are not as fragmented and cold as the stereotypers would have it.

HEADLINE: Detroit Show: Revved Down but Charged Up

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
DETROIT
FOR decades, the marketing phrase ''Sell the sizzle, not the steak'' aptly described the scene at auto shows. Reporters flocked to gawk at glamorous space-age concepts or thundering sports cars, leaving more humdrum, and practical, machines to the tire-kicking public.
But new realities were on center stage at last week's press previews of the North American International Auto Show. As car companies spoke grandly of the ''electrification'' of the automobile, it often sounded like the same-old sizzle, best taken with grains of salt. Yet the atmosphere in Cobo Center felt changed. While some of the show's plug-in cars and pure electric vehicles will surely turn out to be hokum, the variety and scale of the offerings suggest that change is afoot -- new, leaner meat will be added to the automotive menu.
Whether enough consumers are ready to have their habits and appetites changed is still a question. So, too, is whether the Detroit-based automakers can survive to be part of the revolution. 
General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Honda and Toyota showed various hybrids, plug-in hybrids or pure E.V.'s and pledged to bring the technologies to market in 2010-12. Underdog start-ups did the same, including Fisker Automotive, a California company whose $88,000 Fisker Karma sport sedan, a plug-in hybrid, is scheduled for production this year.
But the return of cheap gasoline has already dampened hybrid sales. Throughout the show, auto executives emphasized that stable fuel prices, or a coherent government energy policy, would help them anticipate what consumers would buy next. Because of wild swings in fuel prices, ''Every six months we get called stupid for having the wrong products,'' said Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman.
''Far be it for me to be the first auto executive to call for a gas tax,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''But right now, it's like fighting obesity by requiring clothing manufacturers to make nothing but small sizes.''
Electric cars did generate the show's central irony: the models that will most impress Detroit's new overseers in Washington will also drag down the automakers' bottom lines for several years. Companies are deep in the costly research-and-development phase -- G.M. says it plans to invest more than $1 billion to develop the Chevrolet Volt's technology, and that car, Detroit's first plug-in, is nearly two years from market and unlikely to be made in large numbers.
Still, if the Detroit Three can muddle through the economic crisis, developing new alternative-fuel technologies might end up being a smart investment in their long-term fortunes.
With its chief executive, Alan Mulally, serving as host, Ford showed here-and-now machines including the Fusion Hybrid sedan whose city economy rating of 41 miles a gallon beats the Toyota Camry Hybrid by an impressive 8 m.p.g. (If Ford returns to hearings in Washington, Mr. Mulally might consider driving the Fusion Hybrid onto the Senate floor.)
The 2010 Taurus might be Ford's best shot to restore the name of a family car that used to outsell the Camry. On sale this summer, the Taurus seems a big step up, with sophisticated styling and an optional twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V-6.
Toyota unveiled the third generation of its hybrid heavyweight, the Prius. Toyota expects the more frugal Prius to achieve a 50 m.p.g. rating, preserving its title of the highest-mileage car in America. And if Honda can't beat the Prius's mileage, it will beat its price: the 2010 Insight hatchback goes on sale this spring as America's lowest-cost hybrid, offering 41 m.p.g. for around $18,000.
With no-shows like Nissan, Infiniti, Ferrari, Porsche, Mitsubishi and others opening up main-floor vacancies, Chinese automakers were let out of the Cobo Center basement. BYD (Build Your Dreams, backed by Warren Buffett) and Brilliance showed their latest potential threats to the automotive order. These included plug-in and electric models from BYD, vehicles that executives said would be sold in the United States in two years.
These were among the future showroom models introduced in Detroit:
MERCEDES-BENZ E-CLASS The latest edition of Mercedes' well-regarded sedan goes on sale in July with V-6 and V-8 engines and technology features that include Attention Assist. The Benz monitors 70 parameters and flashes a coffee-cup icon and ''Take a Break'' warning when it senses that the driver is getting drowsy.
LEXUS HS 250H Lexus' first hybrid-only model (no gasoline-only version will be offered) goes on sale in late summer. The conservatively styled sedan has a sleek cabin, the latest safety and convenience gadgets and a roughly 33-m.p.g. hybrid system adapted from the Camry.
BMW Z4 Ditching its fabric roof for a two-piece powered hardtop, BMW's taut two-seat convertible grows bigger and heavier but the controversial design has evolved handsomely.
CADILLAC SRXThe current SRX has impressive driving dynamics, but many potential customers didn't embrace its styling. The new model, based on Chevy Equinox architecture, aims at putting Cadillac on stronger footing in luxury crossovers.
LINCOLN MKT MKT must not stand for ''marketing,'' or Lincoln would abandon its confusing nomenclature that includes MKS (big sedan), MKZ (midsize sedan) and MKX (crossover). On sale later this year, the MKT is a luxury take on the well-received Ford Flex.
FORD MUSTANG SHELBY GT500 Fuel prices may be down, but the economy has sunk with it. Financial jitters could dampen the desire of blue-collar boomers for a $45,000, 540-horsepower Mustang.
BUICK LACROSSE A joint Chinese-American design aimed in part at the Buick-loving Chinese, this low-key midsize sedan goes on sale this summer with a choice of V-6 engines and optional all-wheel drive.
MINI COOPER CONVERTIBLE On sale in March, the 2009 Mini convertible will start at $24,550. The convertible adopts the platform and technology of the second-generation Mini hardtop, with added features including pop-up rollover bars.
AUDI R8 5.2 FSI QUATTRO This upgraded version of Audi's sensational midengine sports car produces 518 horsepower from a detuned version of the Lamborghini Gallardo's V-10. Able to reach 60 m.p.h. in under 4 seconds, it comes to America in 2010.
Automakers also highlighted several concept cars, from barely disguised versions of future showroom models to fanciful projects that may never see the light of day:
CHRYSLER 200C Chrysler's electric-car technology still seemed less market-ready than its competitors. But whether the 200C sedan gets an alternative powertrain or not, the design has the look of a potential mass-market home run -- one that Chrysler desperately needs. And it offered a hopeful glimpse at what Chrysler's future might look like under the eye of Ralph Gilles, the company's new design chief.
AUDI SPORTBACK CONCEPT Audi continued its streak of auto-show stunners with this stretched, creamy eclair of a four-door, which will be called the A7 when it goes on sale in 2010. A modified hatchback, the Sportback disguises its practicality with a hatch opening integrated into the roofline.
VOLVO S60 The current S60 is getting old, but this glimpse at its replacement is sleek and Scandinavian-modern. An efficient turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder produces 180 horsepower.
LINCOLN CONCEPT C In a show light on whimsy, the Concept C recalled happier times. A bustleback ode to the Renault Megane, the cute hatchback offers hints of a future small Lincoln based on the Ford Focus.
CADILLAC CONVERJ Its name may be the show's silliest, but the Converj appears serious. The four-seat luxury car adopts a modified version of the Chevy Volt plug-in system, now called Voltec.
SUBARU LEGACY The current Legacy is a slick-driving all-wheel-drive sedan that's often overlooked. With that in mind, Subaru unveiled a larger restyled Legacy with an Audi-esque front end, styling expected on a 2010 showroom model.
VOLKSWAGEN CONCEPT BLUESPORT VW's handsome midengine convertible was its vision of a more socially responsible sports car. The turbocharged 2-liter diesel engine is said to be capable of 50 m.p.g. on the highway.
DODGE CIRCUIT EV With Chrysler pinching every penny, the chances of the Circuit reaching dealerships seem low. But the all-electric Circuit, based on the Lotus Europa, was the raciest of four electric prototypes by Chrysler.
TOYOTA FT-EV This stubby two-seat muffin is the first taste of a battery-powered commuter car with a 50-mile range that Toyota hopes to offer in 2012. Toyota said it would lease small numbers of a plug-in Prius late this year to commercial customers.
The North American International Auto Show runs through Jan. 25.

HEADLINE: Loan Fraud Seen on the Rise

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
MORTGAGE volume may have fallen last year, but not incidences of fraud.
 In fact, according to a recent report from the Mortgage Asset Research Institute in Reston, Va., occurrences of fraud among loan officers, brokers and other industry professionals actually outpaced 2007 levels by 45 percent in the second quarter of 2008, the most recent reporting period.
 The Research Institute, a consulting firm, does not release specific figures, which it compiles from surveys of lenders that make most of the nation's mortgages each year. 
 The report, released in early December, found that 36 percent of the fraudulent mortgage activity involved loan professionals' misrepresenting borrowers' incomes, while another 20 percent involved misrepresentations of borrowers' employment.
 Lenders did not specify how much of this activity was simply stretching of the truth by loan professionals on the applications, categorized as ''fraud for property,'' as opposed to ''fraud for profit'' schemes, in which bogus loans are taken out to defraud lenders of money. Fraud for property is far more common.
 Jennifer Butts, the Research Institute's director of operations, said the survey results surprised her. Some industry executives had believed that the more unscrupulous mortgage brokers and loan officers had fled the industry or lost their jobs in the recent downturn, once lending standards tightened and loan volumes dropped. 
 ''But we have people in the industry who didn't get weeded out,'' Ms. Butts said. ''And now they have fewer transactions on which to make a profit, so they're just a little more desperate.'' 
 Rachel Dollar, a lawyer from Santa Rosa, Calif., who specializes in mortgage fraud, said that many of the fraud incidents had probably occurred in 2006 and early 2007, when lending restrictions were far more lenient than they are now. ''Lenders don't always discover that until later,'' she said, ''when they see clusters of foreclosures in areas, which causes a lender to look more closely at the loans.''
 Borrowers may also contribute to the trend, because they are often desperate enough to encourage loan officers to help them exaggerate facts on their applications and stretch for a loan for which they may not otherwise qualify.
 Ultimately, mortgage fraud affects all borrowers, industry experts say, because lenders will eventually have to recoup their losses through additional fees or higher interest rates. Lenders rarely pursue legal action, they say.
 Borrowers should resist any temptation to fudge a mortgage application, or to allow loan officers or brokers to do so, and not simply because it is against the law to submit false information. The real danger to borrowers is that they can end up with a loan they can't truly afford to repay.
 To help keep real estate or mortgage professionals from steering you toward a bigger loan than you can afford, Ms. Dollar suggested hiring your own appraiser during the mortgage process, rather than relying on the word of an appraisal that is ordered by the lender's representative.
 ''It's worth the extra $300 or $400 to have a professional on your side to tell you how much the house is worth,'' Ms. Dollar said. ''Otherwise, you just don't know, because the seller, the real estate agent, the loan officer -- they all want that loan to close.''
 Other, less expensive options include checking Web sites like Zillow.com or HomeGain.com, for help in determining a home's value. Or borrowers may also ask another real estate agent for a ''broker's price opinion.''

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds, Unhinged

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
 LAST summer, Kenneth C. Griffin and his wife, Anne, hedge fund managers both, were so rich that they did something most wealthy couples don't do until much later in life. 
 Still in their 30s, they hired a Ph.D. student in economics to help dole out their money to charities.
 Fast-forward six months, and Mr. Griffin, who built the Citadel Investment Group into one of the largest hedge funds in the world, has seen the value of his funds plunge by roughly $10 billion -- one of the biggest amounts lost in the hedge fund carnage last year.
 He was down 55 percent while the average fund was down 18 percent. For Mr. Griffin, it is a failing as personal as they come. Sitting back in his chair, gazing uneasily at the skyline here, he points to a new patch of gray hair when asked about the toll of his losses. 
 ''Last year was a dramatic year for the world's largest financial institutions,'' he says. ''We were not immune.''
 Mr. Griffin has basked in praise -- whiz kid, wunderkind, the next Warren Buffett -- ever since he began trading from his Harvard dorm room 20 years ago and then moved to Chicago to start his hedge fund. In recent years, his firm handily took in more than $1 billion annually.
 But now, the whiz kid has lost so much money that it is unclear whether he can make it all back. That reality is playing out among thousands of troubled hedge funds drowning in losses. 
 Two out of three hedge funds lost money last year, and according to agreements with investors, their managers are supposed to recoup all losses before they start skimming fees from their profits again. That could take years.
 And it's unclear whether these traders, so accustomed to flush times, will stick it out long enough to make investors whole again.
 Their decisions will reverberate beyond Greenwich, Conn., the New York suburb that is a haven for hedge fund honchos. Pension funds, endowments and charities -- not just wealthy individuals -- all invest in hedge funds. 
 Assets held by hedge funds surged to nearly $2 trillion as of the start of last year, from $375 billion in 1998, according to estimates from Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago firm. Along the way, hedge funds -- once so few in number that they represented a boutique industry populated by a rarefied group of specialists -- sprang up like kudzu.
 Today, there are around 10,000 hedge funds, compared with around 3,000 a decade ago and just a few hundred two decades ago.
 Little other than money unites hedge funds, which invest in areas as varied as bonds, aircraft and small-business loans. They even make bets on the weather. 
 What they have in common are lucrative fees: managers typically charge 20 percent of profits and 2 percent of total funds under management -- the latter of which they earn regardless of performance. 
 The wealth and power of hedge funds, and those handsome fees, were predicated on what now sounds like a hollow promise: to make money year in and year out. 
 But the years of easy money are over.
 Banks, pinioned by their own enormous mistakes and the economic slump, have cut back on hedge fund lending -- essentially turning off a financial spigot that the funds relied upon to goose their returns. 
 Economic uncertainty makes it harder to predict market movements. And investors, burned by big losses in 2008, are either questioning hedge fund fees or simply avoiding putting more money into the funds.
 The regulatory vise, meanwhile, is tightening around an industry that long enjoyed the freedom to trade and operate without the constraints imposed on more traditional firms.
 On Thursday, Mary L. Schapiro, Barack Obama's nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, said during a confirmation hearing that she plans to more tightly regulate hedge funds as part of an effort to ''bring transparency and accountability to all corners of the marketplace.''
 Lawmakers are already considering new taxes and regulations that would require hedge funds to disclose more information about their secretive trading strategies. 
 Add it all up, and managing a hedge fund looks much less attractive than it used to. 
 ''The magnitude of this current crisis and its effect on their business was a real shock for hedge fund managers,'' said William N. Goetzmann, a professor who studies hedge funds at the Yale School of Management. ''It will be a long-lasting effect because it's caused customers to question the basic model.''
 Mr. Griffin, fiercely competitive, says he is firmly in the camp of those trying to stay open. But he acknowledges that for several years, he will be working mostly for ''psychic income.''
 NOT everyone is rooting for Citadel. Call up nearly any hedge fund manager, and you will hear the stories about Mr. Griffin, now 40, poaching workers, landing a trade on the cheap and stalking wounded peers for deals. Mr. Griffin declined to comment on such stories.
 His aggression has earned him admirers but has also created enemies. In the low-profile hedge fund industry, people shuddered at his brash claims that Citadel would become as powerful as investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. 
 His firm has become the fortress that many would love to see broken. Mr. Griffin knows that, but he chalks it up to his success. ''Over the last 10 years we have been innovative and bold,'' he says.
 But in July, his magic touch deserted him. After reviewing the trading books at Kensington and Wellington, the two largest funds that Citadel manages, he decided to trim some holdings while bolstering an asset class he had traded since his early days: convertible bonds.
 But the value of convertibles plummeted as banks, large issuers of such shares, went into a tailspin after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the venerable investment bank.
 Citadel made another large bet that the gap between corporate bonds and insurance bought on those bonds, known as credit-default swaps, would narrow. In essence, Mr. Griffin was betting that the economy would strengthen and that the price of insurance on debt would cheapen.
 Others in the industry backed away from that particular gambit. Paul Touradji, who runs a fund associated with the veteran trader Julian Robertson, said his own digging indicated that more people would need to sell their bond positions than the number that were likely to buy in. 
 Still, Mr. Griffin stuck to his guns, even as his funds fell 16 percent in September. The loss put Citadel in the spotlight and generated speculation about its survival. 
 One day, the rumor was that Federal Reserve officials were trolling his Chicago headquarters; the next, that his funds were selling off troubled assets, or that banks were pulling credit. (Federal Reserve officials did in fact check up on Citadel. But since last spring, such inquiries have become routine at all large financial institutions. The other rumors were unfounded.)
 Mr. Griffin says Citadel came under attack because it was a large and easy target -- not because it was about to collapse. 
 By late October, Citadel was fighting for its life. At the end of the month, its funds were down an additional 20 percent and nearing 40 percent losses for the year. Mr. Griffin met with all of his employees and held a public conference call to reassure the world about Citadel's financial footing.
 Mr. Griffin calls that period ''surreal'' but says he never went to bed worried that Lehman's fate would become his own. The difference with Citadel, Mr. Griffin says, is financing. He says he has arranged for credit lines at dozens of banks with durations as long as a year, buying him time. ''Any firm that is a lasting, permanent institution goes through rough times,'' he says. ''In three years, they'll write the story about how we came back, much like Goldman Sachs came back after 1929.''
 Citadel, in fact, is different from many hedge funds that specialize only in trading. Mr. Griffin reinvested profits over the years into new service-based businesses. The management company, which is controlled solely by Mr. Griffin, also owns a firm that provides administrative services to other hedge funds, as well as the Citadel Derivatives Group, a major player in the options and stock markets. And Citadel recently hired a former Merrill Lynch executive to build a capital markets business, a mainstay of investment banking.
 ''Citadel is a diverse platform,'' says Matt Andresen, who runs the Derivatives Group. ''Our clients do not interact with the asset management side of the firm, and they've come to know us in an entirely different capacity.''
 Mr. Griffin has full discretion over how much money he uses to subsidize his struggling funds. Last year, Citadel shouldered some of the funds' operating costs, which are known to be among the largest in the industry. 
 At the same time, though, Citadel blocked investors in its two troubled hedge funds from withdrawing money at the end of last year. The company has told investors that they might be allowed to withdraw money at the end of March.
 Mr. Griffin explains these decisions by saying that ''it was the right thing to do,'' because withdrawals by some investors might have disadvantaged other investors who remained in the funds. Citadel also canceled its holiday gathering because it was not ''right,'' he says, to celebrate last year.
 But right and wrong in hedge fund land is a matter of debate. Industry veterans have been loudly criticizing fund managers who blocked investors from retrieving money. Leon Cooperman, for instance, who runs Omega Advisors, is suing another hedge fund, contending that it didn't allow him to make withdrawals; he said his own fund would never block redemptions.
 ''You'd have to lower me into the ground before I'd put up a gate,'' Mr. Cooperman says. ''Clients deserve to be able to withdraw their money.''
 Orin Kramer, another hedge fund manager, who also helps oversee the New Jersey pension fund, says that what bothers him most is that managers who are freezing their funds are still charging 2 percent management fees on money they have trapped.
 ''It's like telling someone at a hotel that they can't check out and then charging them for the privilege of staying,'' Mr. Kramer says.
 IN November, five of the country's richest hedge fund managers filed solemnly into a Congressional hearing room to be grilled by lawmakers. 
 They made up a Who's Who of their industry. In addition to Mr. Griffin, the group included James Simons, of Renaissance Technologies; Philip A. Falcone, an activist investor who has bought a large stake in The New York Times; John Paulson, who earned billions of dollars betting against mortgages before the crisis; and George Soros, the Hungarian trader who rode to fame on prescient currency trades in the early 1990s.
 Unlike banks or brokerages, hedge funds do not have to reveal information on their financial condition to the government. That means the government has no way to know the value of funds' assets, how much money they borrow, or even how many funds there are. 
 For years, the industry has argued that hedge funds should be allowed to operate under the radar because they serve sophisticated investors. 
 But by November, it had become apparent that too many hedge funds, crammed into too many of the same trades, had been forced to sell -- and that they did not operate in some distant universe. Like mutual funds, they can roil the markets.
 At the hearing, four of the managers surprised lawmakers and their peers by saying that more regulation of their business was needed.
 Mr. Griffin was the lone holdout. He argued for private market solutions, but as the hearing proceeded, he conceded that he would ''not be averse'' to greater disclosure to the government, provided that it was not made public. He says now that he is working on providing more transparency to his investors.
 Lawmakers proclaimed the day a victory.
 ''I believe there's been a near-consensus that hedge funds can cause systemic risk,'' said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York and a member of the House Financial Services Committee.
 Even without government intervention, the days of working behind a curtain may be ending. Investors are already demanding more information about hedge funds' operations.
 Eiichiro Kuwana, president of Cook Pine Capital, a firm in Greenwich, Conn., that helps wealthy people invest in hedge funds, says that investors once had so much money to invest that they became less circumspect -- with many of them investing in hedge funds that refused to provide much information.
 No longer.
 ''Why would I trust a fund with my money if they won't trust me with information?'' Mr. Kuwana says.
 HEDGE FUNDS tend to close by choice; outright collapses are less common. Sometimes banks pull funds' credit lines and managers are forced to shut down. But by and large, the end comes when a manager no longer sees a financial upside for himself or herself. 
 Few funds have actually shut their doors. The number of funds peaked early last year at 10,233, according to Hedge Fund Research, and fell just 4 percent during the year. And they still manage $1.6 trillion. 
 Of the funds that lost money last year, the average loss was 29 percent, according to estimates from HedgeFund.net, a research firm. It will take a few years of fairly robust gains -- no easy feat in these markets -- for funds to simply recoup those losses.
 Until then, managers would earn only their 2 percent fee, chump change to most hedge funds. Some managers are already paying talented employees out of their own pockets to persuade them to stay, but it's apparent that surviving this turbulence isn't in the cards for scores of funds. 
 Mr. Touradji of Touradji Capital was one of the few managers to make money last year, up 13 percent. He says that most firms that call themselves hedge funds never really deserved the title.
 ''There's any number of good violinists, but how many people are good enough to be considered to conduct the Philharmonic?'' he says. ''The whole concept of hedge funds was always and still is this very high bar, that you were never allowed to say it was a tough market. Come rain or shine, you were supposed to do well -- even in tough markets.''
 But he predicts a slow death for the poseurs. Hedge fund managers, he says, may behave like restaurateurs who keep the doors open long after losses mount, largely because they don't want to work in someone else's kitchen. 
 For his part, Mr. Griffin is not likely to be job-hunting any time soon. 
 While there is no way to calculate his net worth, it is thought to be at least hundreds of millions of dollars. In May, a monument to his riches will be unveiled at the Art Institute of Chicago. He and his wife donated $19 million for Griffin Court, part of a new modern wing that connects the museum to Millennium Park. And they are hoping they will have plenty of money for their Ph.D. graduate to give out by 2010. 
 As for Mr. Griffin's troubled hedge funds, their survival will pivot on successful trading -- they are up 6 percent this year -- and on his willingness to use Citadel's other units as a safety net. 
 Whatever happens, Mr. Griffin says he can handle the shakeout in the hedge fund industry. ''It's going to be fairly significant, '' he says, then pauses and grins. ''It's part of capitalism.''

HEADLINE: Bernie Madoff, Frat Brother

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
A LONG time ago, they knew him for a very short time. 
 A half-century ago, Bernard L. Madoff, accused of masterminding one of the world's largest Ponzi schemes, attended the University of Alabama as a freshman, and then, after a year, transferred.
 Like a lot of Jewish young men from New York who headed to the South for an inexpensive education in the 1950s, he joined a Jewish fraternity, in his case Sigma Alpha Mu, known as the Sammy house. 
 My father, Jay Salkin, was in the house, too. ''The main thing I remember is that we had a big dance, and he invited a girl all the way from New York,'' he recalled. ''She was a looker. All the way from New York she came.''
 There are probably better ways to learn about Mr. Madoff than to ask his former fraternity brothers. But you could do worse.
 Here is a short oral history of Bernie Madoff, fraternity boy. (Some quotes are condensed.)
 Martin Schrager, plastics recycling industry consultant, Boca Raton, Fla.: He was my roommate. There was nothing nefarious about the guy. When I heard years later that he was who he was, I was astonished. He never seemed like the kind of guy who could move millions on Wall Street. 
 I did hear about him some years later in Florida. My accountant was his accountant. I invested a small amount with him. But those were the years we had a president named James Earl Carter. Interest rates were like 18 percent. So I figured that if you put your money in the bank they gave you 18 percent and a toaster. So I took my money and got 18 percent and a toaster, too. Then he went on to infamy.
 Tell your dad I remember the good old days. Someone in the house decided that when we all went into the business world, Jay was going to manufacture cream cheese. The slogan was ''Whaddaya mean this ain't good cream cheese?''
 Martin Brill, retail apparel consultant, Jersey City: ''There isn't much about Bernie that stands out in my mind. He was a low-key sort of guy who stayed out of trouble but also lacked any outstanding personality trait.''
 Malcolm Lindy, retired owner of Popeyes chicken franchises in northern Alabama and author of the comedic novel ''The Temple President'': He wasn't an outstanding athlete or outstanding with girls. I just don't remember anything outstanding about him. Nice enough, not a particularly good student as I recall.
 How is Jay doing?
 Nancy Daar, widow of Arthur Daar, a former Boeing engineer, Bellevue, Wash.: Arthur never, ever mentioned Bernard Madoff. But he did not talk about the past very much. He was such an adventurer he wanted to live for today.
 Leonard E. Indianer, retired optometrist and author of ''A Bridge to Elne: Novel of a French Family's Struggle Against the Nazi Occupation,''Ormond Beach, Fla: I don't recall him at all.
 Jay Salkin, manufacturer of baby accessories, Los Angeles:
 He was a pledge. Maybe I had him shine my shoes or get me a soda or something like that. On Saturday the pledges' job was to wash, wax and buff the floor. If you were in the Army R.O.T.C. you could send them to clean your rifle.
 I used to use a lot of cream cheese.

HEADLINE: This Man Is an Island

BYLINE: By LOIS-ANN YAMANAKA. 
Lois-Ann Yamanaka is the author of, most recently, ''Behold the Many.''

DATELINE: Honolulu 

 BODY:
 AT Punahou, Hawaii's most exclusive private school, the class of 1979 would have been mostly uber rich ''kama aina haole'' (land-owning whites with missionary blood), filthy-rich Chinese (the first immigrant group to arrive as contract workers, leave the plantation and become business owners or marry into Hawaiian families with land) and descendants of plantation Japanese workers who rose to political and economical power after statehood in '59. 
 Then there was Barack Obama -- a scholarship student with a single mother and an absent African father raised by his grandparents. No missionary ancestors, no wealthy Chinese popo and goonggoong giving him $100 lee see for being No. 1 grandson, no powerful government official Uncle Kazu who could pull strings for an easy state job counting bridges on the civil engineers' planning maps. The other students probably called him ''the popolo guy in student gov,'' popolo being the word for black nightshade. 
 In diverse, stratified Hawaii, we all designate each other by race, using references that evolved from sugar plantation pidgin dating back to the late 1870s. When I was young I was the Japanee girl with the big mouth and the Dorothy Hamill hairdo. (Japanee is pidgin for Japanese). And the white guy who ate Rice-A-Roni with butter was the haole who didn't speak pidgin or eat real rice. There was the pake (Chinese) girl who took calculus at the community college senior year. The hapa (half-blooded) babies fathered by military guys who promptly left. The kuro-chan (literally, black man) who lived across the street. He had green eyes, blond-tipped hair and caramel skin. The bukbuk (Filipino), the yobo (Korean), the borinque (Puerto Rican), the portagee (Portuguese). 
 In those days, I lived on the Big Island, where pop-culture-wise we were always five years behind Honolulu and 10 years behind the mainland. But we had words, our own words for everything, for what we wore, what stink foods we ate, our idiosyncrasies, what cars we drove, what parts of town we inhabited, what bad habits we had or what pagan rites we practiced. Words for the whole list of who we are, and they go on and on. 
 Even in these politically correct days, we locals still laugh at ourselves, because these pidgin designations taught us to grow thick skins and take punches. (To haoles new to the islands I often say, ''If I call you haole, I'm trying to tell someone who you are, i.e. 'the haole boy with the cowboy boots.' If I say, 'the haole with the stupid cowboy boots,' then you can get offended.'')
 I define locals, for the record, as those of us who have been here for a few generations and plan to stay. So my definition does not include Barack Obama. He was not local. At least to me he wasn't. 
 He wasn't until I saw that photograph of him body surfing a break-neck barrel from last August. He had that local-boy reach of the arm as he glided down a huge summer swell, the grace of his relaxed face, proud, turned into the tidal force of current, the way only a local boy can take a real wave and make it his very own ride, sleek and easy. A natural local boy.

HEADLINE: North Korea Claims Nuclear Gains, U.S. Scholar Says

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Edward Wong contributed reporting from Beijing, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
The North Korean military declared an ''all-out confrontational posture'' against South Korea on Saturday as an American scholar said North Korean officials told him they had ''weaponized'' enough plutonium for roughly four or five nuclear bombs.
 American intelligence officials have previously estimated that the North had harvested enough fuel for six or more bombs, although it has never been clear whether the North constructed the weapons. The scholar, Selig S. Harrison, said the officials had not defined what ''weaponized'' meant, but the implication was that they had built nuclear arms. 
 The North conducted a test of a nuclear device in 2006, but it appeared to result in a fizzle and experts concluded the explosion was relatively small. While the country has often claimed to possess a ''deterrent,'' this appears to be the first time it has quantified how much plutonium it says it has turned into weapons. 
 After the threats on Saturday, South Korea ordered its military to heighten vigilance along the heavily fortified border with North Korea, according to a spokesman for the South Korean military joint chiefs of staff.
 North Korea's saber-rattling toward the South has increased in intensity since President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul a year ago with a vow to take a tougher stance on North Korea, reversing 10 years of his liberal predecessors' efforts to engage the North with economic aid. But what made the threat on Saturday unusual, and more worrisome to some South Korean analysts, was the way it was delivered: in a statement read on North Korean television by a uniformed spokesman for the North's joint chiefs of staff.
 ''Strong military measures will follow from our revolutionary armed force,'' the spokesman, a colonel, said, according to Yonhap, South Korea's national news agency, which monitors North Korean broadcasts.
 Usually the North Korean government issues written statements that are delivered by the state-controlled media; sometimes the statements are read by press officers, not by a uniformed member of the military. 
 The spokesman warned of a clash along a disputed western sea border between the Koreas. Their navies fought skirmishes there in 1999 and 2002. It is always difficult to decipher the messages that North Korea's government is trying to send with its often bombastic statements. In times of crucial bargaining, North Korea often tries to drive a wedge between Washington and South Korea and raises the stakes by increasing demands and issuing threats.
 With President-elect Barack Obama about to take office and negotiations over the North's nuclear program expected to resume, it is possible that the North is merely setting up its negotiating position. But analysts said the North's remarks could also be an indication that it was intending to hold onto its arms despite an agreement it signed with five countries including the United States in 2005, in which it committed to eventually giving up any nuclear weapons. The exact conditions under which it would do so were left vague. 
 Questions over the health of the country's leader, Kim Jong-il, also complicate any attempts to understand North Korea's aims. In August, there were reports that Mr. Kim suffered a stroke, and since then rumors have swirled about whether he is still making important decisions.
 Mr. Harrison, the scholar, presented North Korea's claims of weaponization on Saturday in Beijing after returning from North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.
 Mr. Harrison, a former journalist who is the director of the Asia program at the Center for International Policy, has traveled several times to North Korea to meet with senior officials there.
 ''They've raised the bar and said, 'We are a nuclear weapons state, and deal with us on that basis,' '' Mr. Harrison said at a news conference in the St. Regis Hotel.
 Mr. Harrison acknowledged that North Korea could be bluffing to use the claim of having nuclear weapons as a negotiating tactic. 
 North Korea had declared to the United States last year that it possessed 37 kilograms of plutonium; officials told Mr. Harrison on his trip that they had weaponized almost 31 kilograms.
 Despite that news, he said all the officials he met with seemed eager to open discussions with the incoming Obama administration. ''All the statements about Obama were very helpful, very respectful,'' he said.
 Mr. Harrison said the North Korean officials had several proposals for Mr. Obama, including allowing North Korea to have access to long-term, low-interest credit to buy food.
 South Korea had no immediate reaction to Mr. Harrison's report.
 Earlier Saturday, North Korea had appeared to toughen its stance toward Washington, saying that reopening diplomatic ties would not be enough to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons. It said it would maintain its ''status as a nuclear weapons state'' as long as there was a nuclear threat from the United States.
 ''We can live without normalizing ties with the United States, but we cannot live without a nuclear deterrent,'' a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry told its official news agency, KCNA.
 In the past, the North had said it would not dismantle any weapons until the United States changed what it termed its ''hostile attitude.''
 In the spokesman's comments, and his similar statement last Tuesday, North Korea laid out its demands as it prepared for a new series of negotiations with Mr. Obama, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday.
 In its Tuesday statement, North Korea indicated that the removal of an American nuclear threat meant the removal of South Korea from the American nuclear umbrella, the introduction of a verification mechanism to ensure that no American atomic weapons are deployed in or pass through South Korea, and even simultaneous nuclear disarmament talks among ''all nuclear states,'' including itself.
 Six-nation talks on ending North Korea's nuclear programs, which include the United States, stalled in the last months of the Bush administration as the United States and North Korea bickered over how much nuclear inspection the North should accept.

 BODY:
ONCE you went to a spa when you felt tense. Now you feel tense going to a spa.
 Is it really right to lie around in sunny Florida, at the opulent Canyon Ranch Miami Beach, getting an oil-drizzle four-handed massage when the grandfatherly grifter Bernie Madoff has left large chunks of Palm Beach and New York -- not to mention Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick -- tapped out? (Six Degrees of Depression?)
 Isn't it obnoxiously self-regarding to focus on ''Your Transformation'' -- a phrase Canyon Ranch has somehow trademarked -- when America has undergone a transformation into a place where vain fripperies and vulgar extravagances are met with a gimlet eye?
 Over New Year's, Paris Hilton garnered worldwide headlines for ''callous excess'' when she spent nearly $4,000 in a 40-minute shopping spree in Sydney. At Christmas, Kathy Fuld, wife of the Lehman Brothers barbarian Dick Fuld, led the way in ''stealth shopping,'' asking Hermes sales clerks to put purchases in plain white shopping bags rather than the labeled orange ones. A sheathing practice once reserved for men's magazine pornography is now used to mask the pornography of spending. And Hollywood makeup artists report that $500 handmade mink eyelashes are definitely out. 
 With our Ponzi-scheme economy collapsing, can primping be justified? With America so busy detoxifying from its toxic greed, hubris and overreaching, is there still room for the more aesthetic form of detoxifying? Will our depleted nation finally learn the existential lesson that eyebrow plucking can be done at home?
 The willowy Barack Obama, the perfect president for an ascetic age, has demonstrated that you can stay supremely fit and eat healthily no matter how crazy your schedule, without a lot of pampering and Sanskrit mumbo jumbo, if you are willing to get up at dawn to exercise and eschew fattening foods -- even, as his daughter Sasha pointed out with amazement, ice cream.
 Besides, in the 21st-century Depression, toxifying may be the tonic we need. The Washington Post's New Year's ''Out-In'' list predicted that ''drinking like 'Mad Men' '' will be the rage in 2009.
 Americans are suffering from ''luxury shame,'' as it's called, sacrificing overpriced indulgences and spurning high-end brand names, trying belatedly to channel the thriftiness and prudence of the last generation that endured an economic collapse.
 My mom always warned me that there was something immoral about a $5 cup of coffee, a $1.75 bottle of water, a $27 fifth of bourbon and a $40 candle. I'm sure the $500 pizhichil massage (without tip) offered by Canyon Ranch would have appalled her. It made my friend Alessandra, who had the ''body ritual,'' featuring two masseuses squeezing pieces of linen dipped in ''medicinal oil'' all over her body for 80 minutes, cringe a bit as well. ''I felt like a fat Mafioso being serviced by Thai hookers,'' she confessed afterward.
 The shhhhh is in shopping, as The Times of London put it. Is the ax falling on extravagant relaxing?
 To find out if spa guilt is rampant, Alessandra and I spent a long weekend at the new Canyon Ranch in the old Carillon Hotel in Miami Beach, which bills itself as the first condo, luxury hotel and wellness spa ''of its kind!''
 Like other spas, Canyon Ranch hopes to alleviate spa guilt by stressing the holistic benefits of ''a deeper wellness,'' ''a healing energy,'' ''a Shamanic journey'' -- rather than simple exfoliating, waxing and cycling. It boasts a sensual 70,000-square-foot spa ''where body meets soul'' (while money leaves wallet).
 In December, the spa had been open a few weeks and was offering most, but not all, of the services it will eventually have. It was pretty deserted, and Miami itself had a weird deserted feel as well, with cab drivers grousing that business in this normally peak time was at a nadir.
 It was hard to tell if the paucity of guests and the unsure, nervous attitude that floated through the place were due to the soft opening or the jolt of hard times. Staff members privately fretted about the economy and about whether, amid all the bling-y temptations and splashy spas of Miami, people would flock to -- or even fathom -- the lofty Canyon Ranch philosophy about utilizing your internal energy, unleashing your potential, balancing your dosha and expanding your chi to find ''the most amazing you.''
 I overheard one of the managers, who was discussing the issue of whether people would pay for health spas in this economy, sum it up fortune-cookie style to a colleague: ''The first half of your life, you spend your health to get your money; the second half, you spend your money to get your health.''
 I wondered if spas were a bit out of date. Shouldn't they be offering more cutting-edge fare than the usual back rubs, rock-wall basics and lectures on ''The Secret to Perfect Posture'' and ''Understanding Chakras''? What about face transplants instead of face cleansing? Social climbing in the Obama era rather than rock-wall climbing? Cure you of a man rather than a manicure?
 Nevertheless, it was nice to have the glamorous spa largely to ourselves. Perched on the ocean, with gorgeous shimmering mosaic designs, gentle lighting, sumptuous rooms, a sybaritic spa, a state-of-the-art gym overlooking the blue-green water, an exceptionally charming group of exercise instructors, delicious (if suspiciously salty-tasting) food, and raspberry-vodka-and-hibiscus-tea martinis on the room service menu, this instantly ranked as the most alluring -- if not slimming -- spa I'd ever been to.
 It's the only Canyon Ranch that allows alcohol, even though the snazzy wine list comes with an earnest philosophy entitled ''Canyon Ranch Beverage.''
 ''Our beverage offerings are reflective of our beliefs,'' the drinks menu intones. ''Research indicates that alcohol, when consumed in moderation, can help people live long and well.'' Al Gore will be happy to know that their alcoholic beverages are better for the environment: ''100% organic spirits and beer, along with sustainable, organic and biodynamic wines free of artificial pesticides and fertilizers.''
 While you may like your red wine green, the real rationale for having alcohol at this spa is surely that the owners figure that, because this Canyon Ranch is in the heart of sybaritic Miami Beach and not out in the remote countryside like the other Canyon Ranches in Arizona and the Berkshires, it might be better, because, as Oscar Wilde put it, ''I can avoid everything except temptation.''
 They say they want to merge ''Miami style with natural tranquillity.'' But that seems like an impossible contradiction since the whole point of Miami is to salsa and jangle, not to do stress-reducing pranayama breathing techniques or go on ''Intention Walks'' to ''enjoy and notice all that is around you.''
 That explains why, even in this new age of austerity, this is the least ascetic spa ever. The menu is chockablock with yummy items denied at stricter retreats: mochaccinos and macchiatos, coffee cake, banana bread, veal bacon, chicken sausage patties, breakfast potatoes, Caribbean French toast, banana nut pancakes. No need to desert desserts; the charming cafe has plates of scones and muffins and cookies out on the counter all day. Still, it's all so organic that the smoothies come with cardboard straws. 
 The five-part breakdown of every morsel ingested -- how many calories and how many grams of carbs, protein, fat and fiber each item contains -- give fair warning that, unless you apply your own rigorous self-discipline, you probably won't be coming home from this spa any thinner. (Oatmeal raisin cookies weigh in at 75 calories apiece, with 13-1-2-1 grams; chocolate chip at 86, 13-1-3-1, and brownies at 169, 30-2-5-1.)
 Sprinkled with the senior citizens starting to buy the Canyon Ranch condos next door to the hotel (with 90 percent already sold), the exercise classes sometimes have the feel of a retirement community. This might bother those interested in turbo-charged workouts, but I liked it. It was a refreshing change to be the most agile skeleton-stretcher in a qi gong class that was a fusion of yoga and martial arts, a sorty angry yoga.
 I tried to get in the Canyon Ranch frame of mind. (In the literature, they like to italicize Canyon Ranch, as though New Age music were playing.)
 I went to a lecture called ''Let Me See Your Tongue,'' with Jim Rohr, an attractive young expert on Chinese medicine. He explained how the color, coating, shape and moisture of the tongue can give signals about the health of the spleen, kidney and other organs.
 It was terrifying. ''Blue and purple tongues,'' he explained, ''are not good for anything.'' Same with white, yellow, gray or black tongues, or thick and greasy tongues, or swollen, cracked, deviated, flaccid, sticky and tooth-marked tongues, or quivering tongues, which signify a yin deficiency or chi stagnation. We had a brief discussion on the wonder of Gene Simmons. The only other person in the room, a dental hygienist, asked Mr. Rohr to examine our tongues. We stuck them out. ''Nothing jumps out about them,'' he reassured us. ''They're not 'Oh my God!' tongues.''
 In meditation class, I found myself in deep reflection on more entertaining things to do in Miami. Overhearing exercise instructors talking about some concerts and dance clubs they'd been to, I was overcome by the temptation to escape from my odyssey of self-discovery. All the tasty options at the spa had created a slippery slope, making me hungry for even more options. Mere moments away, all of Miami's sparkle awaited.
 I'd seen someone execute a daring escape from a spa once. Many years ago, when she was single, Nicole Miller, the pretty red-headed clothing designer, had broken out one night from the puritanical Golden Door in Escondido, Calif., and shown up the next morning with a cute guy and a satisfied smile.
 At some spas, going AWOL produces a Mother Superior scowl from management. Here, the easygoing staff seems to expect it, even enable it. There's a hair salon that will wash the massage oil out of your hair, give you a great blow dry and reasonably priced sun streaks, and send you on your way out into the warm night with some cheap dangly earrings.
 I called the only person I knew in Miami and asked him to bust us out of there on Saturday night. Fortunately, he was chief of police, my pal John Timoney, so the great escape from Canyon Ranch went flawlessly in his white getaway S.U.V.
 Chief Timoney took us over to the most over-the-top spot in this over-the-top city: the leopard-skin-swathed, stained-glass-filled, Medusa-head-branded Versace mansion, a testament to what one man accomplished by reducing antiquity to a throw pillow.
 The mansion, Casa Casuarina, had been turned into a private club but is now open to the public, with a restaurant on its patio that started out in September, and tours of the mannerist upstairs suites. We had a drink in the ornate bar with the owner, Peter Loftin, a mountain of Southern charm, a retired telecommunications mogul who bought the house for $19 million in 2000. Then we ate a sampling from the kitchen: a mound of succulent Kobe beef, fried pork belly, sea scallops with osetra caviar, black grouper, blue prawns cooked at the table on a salt block, foie gras with a riesling-pineapple-coriander emulsion and Meyer lemon tart and crushed amaretti mousse with vanilla-bean meringue, washed down by Champagne (Krug, Clos de Ambonnay 1995), at one of the outdoor tables under a tent by the elaborately tiled pool.
 We met the talented chef, Dale Ray, toured the ornate guest suites (with 10-by-9-foot beds) and watched from the balcony as tourists drove by on Ocean Avenue, still taking their ghoulish memento photos of the spot outside where Gianni Versace died after he was shot by the drifter serial killer Andrew Cunanan.
 As at the spa, it was hard to tell if the lack of a crowd signified that tourists just don't know this ravishingly rococo spot is open or if real austerity abhors faux antiquity.
 Beefed up, literally, I waddled back to Canyon Ranch, more in need of the relatively spartan life than ever. I had jasmine oil poured on my third eye. I sprawled in heated chaise longues by the hydrospa. I tested the array of sound, smell and light caverns in the ladies' room: an igloo, a crystal sauna, a scented sauna called an ''herbal laconium'' and ''experimental'' showers in the spa, including Cool Fog, Tropical Rain and Caribbean Storm (in which parrots squawk and the lights go on and off imitating lightning).
 I had a massage where a woman walked on my back while holding on to rails in the ceiling -- not relaxing -- and another where I was rubbed down by a cute young Latino massage therapist wielding a mushroom-shaped ball wrapped in linen.
 Afterward, he presented me with the ball.
 ''Thai hair ball,'' he said, with a heavy accent.
 ''Hair ball?'' I said in alarm. ''Human hair from Thailand?''
 ''Yes,'' he replied. ''Hair ball.''
 Finally, realizing he had said ''herbal,'' I accepted the oily pouch.
 After three days, I felt good but certainly not purified or even streamlined. When I thought about the Canyon Ranch motto, the Power of Possibility (also, improbably, trademarked), it infused me with the powerful possibility of hitting the town once more before we left.
 Alessandra and I headed off to Joe Allen, with the aqua neon sign gleaming out front and the little silver surfers decorating the walls inside. We sat at the bar, behind a row of vintage Deco cocktail shakers, and shared a martini with lots of olives -- what Frank Sinatra would dismissively call a salad -- and a heaping plate of French fries.
 I felt my anxiety ebbing. 401(k) values come and go. Wealth distribution can be as unfair and upsetting as fat distribution. But there will always be French fries.

HEADLINE: Leslie Parks and Alan Harding

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE

 BODY:
''WHEN I roll back the tape of our marriage, I think I was ill-prepared,'' said Alan Harding, whose wife, Leslie Parks, and he are separated pending their divorce. ''I had to wear so many hats. I had to be the daddy. I had to bring home money. I had to be the husband and I had to be the best friend. I wasn't ready for that.''
 Mr. Harding and Ms. Parks, a daughter of the late photographer, filmmaker and musician Gordon Parks, were married in August 1998. 
 By the time they took their vows, they had known each other for four or five years, first as employer and employee, when Mr. Harding, then the chef de cuisine at Nosmo King in Manhattan, hired Ms. Parks as a line chef. Over time they became friends as they commiserated with each other about their respective love lives. Finally they became a couple.
 ''I was attracted to her humor and soulful spiritual sense of who she was,'' said Mr. Harding, 46, who, along with his business partner, Jim Mamary, has sprinkled Brooklyn with popular restaurants in recent years. 
 Ms. Parks, 41, said she admired him for his ''passion for life'' and his hunger for ''thinking outside the box.'' 
 Neither felt pressed to marry. 
 ''We had a kid,'' Mr. Harding said, referring to their elder son, Campbell, who was 9 months old when they married. ''We had a family and we were going to be together forever. Why not do what everybody does?'' 
 In the hospital room on Dec. 22, 1997, shortly after Campbell was born, Ms. Parks received a gift from her husband, but not a proposal, she said. 
 ''He gave me his grandmother's engagement ring,'' she said. Six months later, she remembered saying to Mr. Harding, ''We have to start planning the wedding.''
 Their union seemed to go smoothly for years before his sense of responsibility began to change, he said. They now had to pay a mortgage and support a growing family -- their second son, Satchel, was born in March 2000. When the World Trade towers were destroyed, the New York economy tanked, hurting Mr. Harding's restaurant businesses and exacerbating his sense of burden, he said, at being the family's sole provider. 
 For Mr. Harding, the situation and his marriage, gradually became ''like having my shoulders creep up to my ears.'' 
 ''When we were living together, when I would write out the bills, I never really gave a thought to how much money was going into the mail,'' he said. As a husband, he said, ''I'd write out bills, total them up and go to the bank to make sure the amount I totaled up was in the bank.'' He threw himself into his work, as much for self-affirmation as to make sure the family's expenses were covered.
 ''In marriage there's no measure for how well you're doing,'' he said. ''But if you open a restaurant and suddenly have lines around the block, you get a real good sense of accomplishment.''
 While Mr. Harding's success as an entrepreneur grew, Ms. Parks became increasingly frustrated with her life. She said for a couple of years during the winter months she had attempted to exercise her creativity by running an informal restaurant in their home. But she was essentially a stay-at-home mother. 
 ''I had no career anymore,'' she said. ''I had lost myself. I thought, 'I'm a mother, but the kids are off at school.' I was upset and angry. I had no role.''
 Her feelings came to a head one summer afternoon a few years ago. He says 2005, she says 2006.
 ''One thing led to another, and she made the announcement that she can't do this anymore,'' he recalled about the argument that became a turning point in their relationship. ''I was happy to have my head in the sand. I didn't have to realize, 'God, we haven't gone out to dinner together in three months.' ''
 Shortly after that argument, he moved to the parlor floor of the brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, they bought in 2001. In 2007, they sold the house and divided the proceeds.
 They now live a few blocks apart in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, but their proximity is a coincidence. Ms. Parks was the first to buy a house there. Mr. Harding moved in later when he found a good deal on a distressed house that was in foreclosure. ''When he moved to the neighborhood I said, 'What are you doing that for?' '' Ms. Parks said. ''But it works for us. In case of an emergency the children know where to go and how to get there.''
 Their sons split their time living with each parent. 
 Asked what she has learned about marriage, Ms. Parks said, ''I think when people get married, they think something magical is going to happen. It doesn't. You have to make it happen.''
 Mr. Harding said, ''Life is a balancing act. You have to balance, otherwise something's going to fall apart.''

HEADLINE: Washington

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON is suddenly hip again, infused with the heady double-barreled combination of a new crowd of idealistic young political worker bees, who actually believe they can change the world, and the arrival of America's first black president. It's even cool to wave the Stars and Stripes. And in the honeymoon months of the Barack Obama presidency, before the country's marriage to its new president undergoes the usual souring, a trip to the nation's capital is just the ticket. Why, it would almost be unpatriotic not to visit.
 Friday
 6 p.m. 1)EARLY HOUSE PARTY 
 Hobnob with the Beltway arrivistes at Eighteenth Street Lounge (1212 18th Street NW; 202-466-3922; www.eighteenthstreetlounge.com). Enter through the door next to the Mattress Discounters -- there's no sign outside -- take the stairs and voila! A multilevel row house, with room after room of velvet couches and fireplaces, awaits you. There's a back deck for spring and summer after-work cocktails, and the crowd is a mix of Yes We Can activists and Middle Eastern and European World Bank types.
 8 p.m. 2)EAT LIKE OPRAH
 Take a taxi to Capital Hill, to Art and Soul Restaurant in the Liaison Hotel (415 New Jersey Avenue NW; 202-393-7777; www.artandsouldc.com). Oprah Winfrey's former chef, Art Smith, owns this restaurant, and it is command central for big inauguration parties. Yes, you've already had a cocktail, but you're not driving, so be sure to try the margarita, Perfected at the bar before sitting down to eat. The menu will remind you that, yes, Washington is a Southern city -- don't even think of missing the Chesapeake Bay fry to start. It's a combination of deep-fried seafood -- clams, calamari, shrimp, oysters with, of course, okra. Land and Sea hoecakes (with blue crab, beef and brie) are ridiculously good. If you're still hungry, then go for the pork chop with red-eyed gravy. And the babycakes -- miniature coconut and chocolate cupcakes. Dinner for two, with cocktails, wine and dessert, is about $140.
 10 p.m. 3)FREEDOM WALK
 With luck, you did not wear the five-inch Prada heels tonight, because you're about to walk off that pork chop as you head down the National Mall. Your destination is the Lincoln Memorial (www.nps.gov/linc), with ole Abe backlit at night. Washington's monument row is always best viewed at night, when the tourists are gone and the romantics are strolling arm in arm. On election night, the Lincoln Memorial was an emotionally charged spot: Illinois was sending another of its sons to Washington. Since then, the monument -- long the first destination for African-American visitors to Washington -- has become almost a retreat, as residents and visitors alike come to read the inscription ''With malice toward none, with charity for all'' and to ponder America the Beautiful.
 Saturday
 9 a.m. 4)MORNING SIT-IN
 Breakfast at Florida Avenue Grill (1100 Florida Avenue NW; 202-265-1586), a soul food institution, is a dip into the past, evoking the feel of lunch counter sit-ins and the civil rights movement. The place has been serving greasy and delicious Southern cooking since 1944. Buttery grits, Virginia ham, biscuits and gravy, even scrapple -- all surrounded by photos of past Washington bigwigs as various as Ron Brown, the former Commerce Secretary, and Strom Thurmond, the former South Carolina Senator. Mr. Obama might have to keep his shirt on if he follows his predecessors here.
 10 a.m. 5)1600 PENNSYLVANIA
 We know. It's the ultimate in touristy. But come on, it's the White House (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; 202-456-7041; www.whitehouse.gov). To schedule a public tour, first you'll need to find nine friends to come with you. Then call your Congressional representative to schedule. (Not sure who? Go to writerep.house.gov.) These self-guided tours -- which are allotted on a first-come-first-served basis about one month before the requested date -- allow you to explore the public rooms and the gardens. Sorry, you won't be able to check out the indoor basketball court Mr. Obama might put in, but you will get to see the East Room, the Diplomatic Reception Room and the dining room where they have those swanky state dinners.
 Noon 6)HELLO, BETSY
 No, not that Betsy ... there are no star-spangled banners at Betsy Fisher (1224 Connecticut Avenue NW; 202-785-1975; www.betsyfisher.com). This stylish and funky boutique is port of call for those deputies in the new Obama administration. (Mr. Obama's transition spokeswoman, Stephanie Cutter, gets her Diane von Furstenberg dresses there.) The owner, Betsy Fisher Albaugh, always has cocktails and wine on hand to occupy the men who invariably are dragged into the store.
 2 p.m. 7)GO REPRESENT
 It took six years to complete, but the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center (Capitol Hill; at the east end of the Mall; 202-225-6827; www.visitthecapitol.gov) finally opened last month. The subterranean center is meant to relieve the bottleneck that used to serve as the entryway for visitors to the Capitol. It does that and more, although the reviews have been mixed; some critics say it assumes a life of its own that is too separate from the Capitol itself. See for yourself -- you can book a tour via the Web site, or just show up and wander around. The center has a rotating display of historic documents that can range from a ceremonial copy of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery to the speech President Bush delivered to Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 7 p.m. 8)PARTY CHASER
 O.K., enough with the federal touring, it's time to hang out with the real Washingtonians. Head to the always hopping U Street Corridor, and plop yourself on a stool at Local 16 (1602 U Street NW; 202-265-2828; www.localsixteen.com), a popular Democratic hangout. There are multiple lounges and, best of all, a roof deck, where you can see the city lights while you sip your predinner watermelon martini. A lot of Democratic fundraisers habituate the place, so don't be surprised if there's a private party in one of the rooms.
 8:30 p.m. 9)POLITICAL DISH
 Have dinner a few blocks away at Cork Wine Bar (1720 14th Street NW; 202-265-2675; www.corkdc.com), which might have the best fries in town. The owners, Khalid Pitts and Diane Gross, are friends of Barack (well, Mr. Pitts is director of political accountability with the Service Employees International Union, which endorsed Mr. Obama, and Ms. Gross has worked with the Democratic political establishment for years). The menu includes both small and big bites, from marinated olives and cheeses to duck confit and sauteed kale. And for goodness' sake, don't forget those fries! They are tossed with garlic and lemon. In fact, order two helpings. Dinner for two with wine, around $60.
 10:30 p.m. 10)SMOKE-FILLED ROOM
 Puff away the rest of your evening at Chi-Cha (1624 U Street NW; 202-234-8400; www.latinconcepts.com/chi-cha), a hookah lounge where you can smoke honey tobacco out of a water pipe and sip late-night cocktails. The eclectic crowd dances to rumba and slow salsa into the wee hours, and there's always a diplomat in a corner couch doing something inappropriate -- avert your eyes, enjoy your hookah and sway to the beat. You could be in Beirut. O.K., let's try that one again. You could be in Marrakesh. Well, maybe Marrakesh with Brazilian music. If you want to keep the night going, stop by Ben's Chili Bowl when it's at its busiest.
 Sunday
 8 a.m. 11)RIVER IDYLL
 Washington is known for beautiful mornings along the Potomac River, and a perfect way to see it is from a canoe. Thompson Boat Center (2900 Virginia Avenue NW; 202-333-9543; www.thompsonboatcenter.com), just where Georgetown meets Rock Creek Parkway, offers canoe rentals starting at $8 an hour and $22 a day. Paddle up the river, and you might catch a Senator (or a Saudi prince) having coffee on the patio of his stately home.
 12:30 p.m. 12)LIFT YOUR VOICE
 St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church (1419 V Street NW; 202-265-1470; www.saintaugustine-dc.org), which calls itself ''the Mother Church of Black Catholics in the United States'' is one of the oldest black Catholic churches in the country. The 12:30 Sunday Mass combines traditional black spirituals with gospel music. The place has been rocking with particular fervor since Election Day 2008. 
 THE BASICS
 Hotel Palomar (2121 P Street NW; 202-448-1800; www.hotelpalomar-dc.com) is a Kimpton boutique hotel in the heart of Dupont Circle. Rates start at $150.
 Hotel Monaco (700 F Street NW; 202-628-7177; www.monaco-dc.com), also a Kimpton hotel, is in the Penn Quarter neighborhood across from the National Portrait Gallery and near the International Spy Museum. Rooms from $180.
 Hotel Tabard Inn (1739 N Street NW; 202-785-1277; www.tabardinn.com) is a budget alternative (some rooms share a bathroom) filled with charm; think Old England not far from the White House. Rooms with shared bath start at $113; with private bath, $158.

HEADLINE: Fighting the Recession, With Plenty of Pasta

BYLINE: By KARLA COOK

 BODY:
WARM is the word for Enzzo's Trattoria, a peach-hued snuggle of a restaurant that is battling the recession with platters of reasonably priced Italian comfort food. The approach seems to be working -- in two visits, this Short Hills place was packed, and Perri Urso, 41, co-owner with her husband, Vincenzo, 45, the chef, was continually kissed and hugged by regulars whom she greeted by name.
 Enzzo's is now in its 15th year, and though it expanded from 35 seats to about 80 in the late '90s, the real action still occurs in the tiny, original storefront dining room along a busy street of shops that are deserted by dinnertime. 
 The menu is a laminated affair with predictable categories, supplemented by a longish specials list, the details of which can get lost in hubbub and plate clatter. Pay attention if chicken Murphy is mentioned. Do not miss this dish, with its tender slabs of sauteed meat dressed with caramelized onions, both sweet and hot cherry peppers, roasted potatoes and a sprinkling of pasta, all drenched with a brown house-made demi-glace. 
 But before the main dishes, there are the appetizers -- antipasti, salads and soups. The sauteed garlic shrimp on focaccia was a luscious knife-and-fork dish moistened by a lemon-and-white-wine sauce and garlic-olive-oil base, though its generous size pushed the dish from appetizer to appetite suppressant; it was difficult to stop eating it. Antipasto was a vinaigrette-drizzled mix of typical components -- marinated artichokes, house-made mozzarella, provolone, prosciutto, house-roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes, with, oddly, canned, sliced black olives.
 The orange salad, with its sparkling slices of fruit juxtaposed against anchovy fillets and drizzled with olive oil, approached alchemy, but the spinach leaves and more of those mundane olives seemed out of place. I wished for another green -- maybe arugula, watercress or Belgian endive -- and nearly any other kind of olive. A Caesar salad (anchovies optional) was credible, though overdressed. 
 Pastas are the foundation of Enzzo's (a whimsically-spelled diminutive of Mr. Urso's first name), and the restaurant has worked out the formula: huge portions and too much sauce, but plenty of flavor. Pasta Romano, a blend of bow ties with white beans, escarole, black olives, marinated artichokes and house-roasted red peppers, benefits from having bits of pancetta through the dish. The rigatoni Bolognese, also from a family recipe, looks festive with its sprinkling of green peas, though the sauce was somewhat sticky. The same was true of the gnocchi, though it was the potato pasta, and not the pleasant ricotta cheese and tomato sauce, that did the sticking.
 Among the main courses, a fresh slab of cod, broiled in tomato-herb sauce with capers, onions and more of those black olives, was simply delicious. Veal saltimbocca was beguilingly flavored, with its surfeit of brown sage sauce mixing with prosciutto and truly too much mozzarella; the raw spinach in the dish would have been better cooked, though, and in more generous quantities, and the meat had an occasional bit of gristle. The slim eggplant cutlets were over the top -- stuffed with ricotta, pecorino and prosciutto and buried under too much tomato sauce and mozzarella -- but the leftovers were eaten and appreciated. On another night, the shrimp oreganata was my favorite: exceedingly tender jumbo shrimp atop a too-generous bed of thin spaghetti, all swimming in a sauce of lemon, white wine and oregano that threatened to flow over the side of the plate and into my lap. 
 That's where the bread came in -- the restaurant's rolls, served hot, with a shatteringly crisp crust surrounding an innocuous center, worked as a foil to any extra sauce, but when I think of Italian bread, I wish for something more interesting. I wish, too, for Italian-style vegetables -- broccoli, broccoli rabe, cauliflower, cabbage and kale, Swiss chard, radicchio, zucchini and other squash. They are in short supply here, unfortunately. 
 Enzzo's slips on desserts -- they were unremarkable, as were the coffees, and not worth the wait. But no matter: The sweetness at this restaurant is simply good and plenty, warmly delivered.

HEADLINE: And How Do I Know You? Oh, the List

BYLINE: By JOANNE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
LAUREN CANGIANO'S got your number. And, come to think of it, your address, too, if your children have ever attended school with any one of her three children in Manhattan. 
 ''From the time my older son was in preschool and I was in the early years of my career, I used every one of their student directories and plopped every single name into my mailing list,'' said Ms. Cangiano, a real estate agent on the Upper East Side. Over the years, she has harvested the class lists and directories of Park Avenue Christian Church Day School, Public School 6, the Beekman School and York Preparatory School, where her oldest child is a senior. 
 ''I still have all these people on my mailing list,'' said Ms. Cangiano, who uses her stash of names when she sends out postcards about a new residential listing or an offer to appraise a property.
 ''There are times,'' she said, ''when someone will call me and say, 'How did you get my name?' and I'll have to say: 'Do you have a child who's a high school senior? It must have been the preschool directory. And congratulations on your child getting into college. Are you looking for a smaller apartment?' '' 
 Schools in New York City often provide class lists and school directories so that parents and students can schedule play dates, send birthday party invitations or phone one another about school-related matters. These booklets generally carry a warning that they are solely for the personal use of the school community, never to be used for commercial purposes without the administration's approval.
 But as parents can attest, that admonition is often ignored, which is why schools like St. Bernard's, an all-boys school on the Upper East Side, decline to provide a student roster at all. At schools that are populated by the offspring of celebrities, artists and Wall Street moguls, the temptation to hit up the rich and famous can be just too great.
 When Art Garfunkel and his wife, Kim, had a son at the Allen-Stevenson School on the Upper West Side, ''other parents there tried to get in touch with us all the time,'' said Mrs. Garfunkel, an actress. ''Both Artie and I ducked. We've avoided so many efforts to reach us. I don't answer my phone, Artie doesn't answer his phone and we're not reachable by e-mail.'' 
 (Full disclosure from the author: the Garfunkels' son was one of my son's classmates at Allen-Stevenson, whose directory I continue to find shamelessly useful.) 
 AT New York public schools, the administration cannot release parents' names and phone numbers because they are part of students' confidential records, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Education. Thus it is up to parent volunteers to decide if they want to put together a schoolwide directory, something P.S. 6, an elementary school in a high-income neighborhood on the Upper East Side, is doing for the first time.
 It is a project that has been long resisted because of the size of the task and ''concerns that people would take the listings and use them unscrupulously,'' said Julie Hubert, co-chairwoman of fund-raising for the school's PTA. She added that parents had no obligation to be included and that ''a lot of them chose to leave out information like e-mail addresses, business or cellphone numbers.'' 
 Abuses are difficult to monitor, but complaints from parents tend to make their way to the top. ''I'm aware that parents use the list to solicit for nonprofits, but I think people understand that we can't police every single thing,'' said Linda MacMurray Gibbs, head of the Hewitt School, a girls' preparatory school on the Upper East Side. ''I've gotten complaints, which is why we publish our policy -- 'For reasons of privacy and safety we don't permit its use for any purpose not approved by the school' -- in the back of the directory.
 ''At the least, if someone misuses it and it's brought to our attention,'' Ms. Gibbs said, ''we can bring it to the offender's attention.''
 This happened recently at Allen-Stevenson, an all-boys school. ''Someone sent a partisan e-mail -- I don't remember for which candidate,'' said the headmaster, David Trower, ''and I got three e-mails from parents saying it was inappropriate. So I sent a reminder that the policy was the policy and that they should follow that.'' 
 Elsewhere, misbehaving parents help themselves to the directories to network, share news of sample sales, beef up attendance at political fund-raisers and drum up new business. Until several years ago, York Prep had never had a schoolwide directory, said Claire Pellegrini Cloud, former co-chairwoman of the school's parents group. ''So to improve the sense of community, we took it upon ourselves to assemble one,'' she said. 
 Despite customary warnings about proper and improper use, the booklet was barely back from the printer before a parent who was a photographer appropriated the listings to send out promotional material about his service. ''It was one of the things that contributed to York's stopping publication of the schoolwide directory,'' Ms. Cloud said. 
 One Upper West Side mother who requested anonymity so as not to antagonize the administration at Horace Mann, where one of her children is a student, admitted to using the school directory while fund-raising for Barack Obama. ''But in my own defense,'' the woman said, ''these were people I knew or who were the parents of friends of my kid. And if anyone asked to be removed from my mailing list, I always did so promptly.'' 
 And, she added, ''There were many people who were delighted to be contacted and who then went on to become fund-raisers and community builders.'' (Perhaps aided by directories from their own children's schools.) 
 IT is impossible to gauge how warmly such solicitations are received. ''I think many people believe they're sending their fellow parents information about worthy causes,'' said Cynthia Bing of the Parents League of New York. ''But no one wants to hear from a cast of thousands.'' 
 Hell-raising, not fund-raising, seemed to be the intention of a parent at Allen-Stevenson. ''I got a letter that apparently went to everyone in the directory,'' said Wendy Levey, an Allen-Stevenson parent who is also the director of Epiphany Community Nursery School on the Upper East Side. ''It said something like: 'My child is in the third grade. I've been transferred to a firm in California and would you believe it, Allen-Stevenson will not return the deposit. So I don't think you should give to the annual fund.' ''
 Such communiques help explain why, when Mr. Trower became headmaster 19 years ago and the school had no directory, ''I was hesitant to create one,'' he said. But he has found ''that people honor the spirit and letter of our privacy policy. And I believe the sense of community that the directory fosters far outweighs whatever risks it creates.'' 
 Michele Sola, head of Manhattan Country School, often hears from parents who want to publicize high-minded political gatherings and who remind her that the school was founded by social activists who were inspired by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ''They'll ask whether it's appropriate to use the e-mail list to let people know about antiwar and civil rights rallies,'' she said. ''Always my position is that's not the purpose of the e-mail list.''
 Unfortunately, she had no jurisdiction over the parents who moved their son to a public school but held on to their directory -- and used it to e-mail all the families at Manhattan Country Day about a concert in which their son was a dancer. Ms. Sola responded with her own e-mail message: ''I said, 'I'm glad he's dancing, but be careful how you use the old list.' '' 
 Some school administrators can count on their parent body to deal with infractions. ''They're very good at self-monitoring here,'' said Gabriella Rowe, head of the Mandell School on the Upper West Side. ''They'll explain that it's not cool to someone who's sent an e-mail to the class about a trunk show or about real estate they're trying to sell.'' 
 Still, many parents persist. ''Directory abuse is very hard to guard against, but it's at the lowest level it's ever been at,'' said Sandra R. Bass, editor of Private School Insider, a newsletter for the independent school community. ''A lot of people, like camp directors and real estate brokers, are eager to get their hands on the lists. And maybe a lot of tutoring services get your name, but I'm not sure that's a bad use for the directory.''
 Mrs. Levey, the head of Epiphany, said the difficult economic climate had relaxed her attitude about the sanctity of the directory. ''Several years ago, a parent was moving and she e-mailed the entire school the specifics of her co-op,'' she said. ''We thought it was a completely inappropriate use of people's personal information. But now in these difficult times, I see some of these things as people trying to help one another.''
 A family at Epiphany has a business selling stationery and gifts, and Mrs. Levey has allowed them to put a notice about their services in the students' cubbies. Other parents who recently lost the lease on their store reopened at a new location where business was down, and a teacher was permitted to e-mail parents about a portfolio at the store that is ideal for holding students' artwork.
 ''I feel our parents are really good to the school,'' Mrs. Levey said, ''and when I can help them, I try to.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about parents who misuse the class lists and directories from their children's schools referred incorrectly to the location of the Allen-Stevenson School in Manhattan. It is on the Upper East Side, not the Upper West Side.

HEADLINE: White Like Me

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
I cannot testify to what black Americans feel as our nation celebrates the inauguration of our first African-American president. But I can speak for myself, as a white American who grew up in the segregated nation's capital of the 1960s. Barack Obama's day is one that I never thought would come, and one that I still can't quite believe is here.
 Last week I joined a group of journalists at an off-the-record conversation with the president-elect, a sort of preview of the administration's coming attractions. But as I walked some desolate downtown blocks to the standard-issue federal office building serving as transition headquarters, ghosts of the past mingled with hopes for the future. The contrast between the unemployed men on Washington's frigid streets and the buzzing executive-branch bees inside was, for me, as old as time. 
 My particular historical vantage point is a product of my upbringing as that odd duck, a native Washingtonian whose parents were not in government. The first presidential transition of my sentient lifetime, Kennedy's, I remember vividly. Even an 11-year-old could see that the sleepy Southern town of the Eisenhower era was waking up, electrified by youth, glamour and the prospect of change. 
 But some of that change I didn't then understand. J.F.K.'s arrival coincided with Washington's emergence as the first American city with a black majority. Many whites responded by fleeing to the suburbs. My parents did the opposite, moving our family from the enclave of Montgomery County, Md., into the city as I was about to enter the fifth grade. 
 Our new neighborhood included the Sidwell Friends School. My mother, a public school teacher, decreed that her children would instead enroll in the public system that had been desegregated a half-dozen years earlier, after Brown v. Board of Education. In reality de facto segregation remained in place. Though a few African-Americans and embassy Africans provided the window dressing of ''integration,'' my mostly white elementary, junior high and high schools had roughly the same diversity as, say, today's G.O.P. 
 I wish I could say we were all outraged at this apartheid. But we were kids -- privileged kids at that -- and out of sight was out of mind. Except as household help, black Washington was generally as invisible to us as it was to the tourists who were rigidly segregated from the real Washington while visiting its many ivory marble shrines to democratic ideals. 
 Gradually we would learn more -- from our parents and teachers, from televised incidents of violent racial confrontations far away, and from odd cultural phenomena like the 1961 best seller ''Black Like Me.'' In that book, a white novelist darkened his skin for undercover travels through deepest Dixie, whose bigotry he then described in morbid firsthand detail to shocked adolescents like me. 
 Surely such horrific injustices could not occur in our nation's capital. 
 But as an unintended consequence of Washington's particular brand of Jim Crow, white public school students got a tiny taste of what racially mandated second-class citizenship could mean. In those days, the city didn't even have the bastardized form of ''self-government'' it has now; it was run as a plantation by Congressional District panels led by racist white Southerners (then Democrats). These overseers didn't want to lavish money on an overwhelmingly black school system, and they didn't. By the early 1960s, per-student spending in Washington was less than that of any state, impoverished West Virginia and Mississippi included.
 If Washington's white schools received a larger share of that meager budget, as they no doubt did, it was still obvious that our teachers had far fewer resources than their suburban and private school counterparts. Extracurricular activities could be curtailed by the costs of light and heat. The curriculum was also abridged, lest anyone get too agitated by America's racial inequities. In my history class, the Civil War was downsized to a passing speed bump. In English, we read ''Tom Sawyer,'' not ''Huckleberry Finn.''
 Now that we were teenagers, we had both the curiosity and mobility to investigate the strangely undemocratic city that dealt us this hand. In the words of Constance McLaughlin Green, a Pulitzer Prize-winning urban historian, the District's black population had long occupied ''a secret city all but unknown to the white world round about.'' We wanted in on the secrets.
 There was so much we didn't know, so much Americans still don't know. Take the Lincoln Memorial, to which the Obama family paid so poignant a nocturnal visit this month. If you look up coverage of the memorial's 1922 dedication ceremonies in The Times, you can read of President Harding's forceful oration commemorating the demise of slavery. You also learn that Dr. Robert R. Moton, the president of the Tuskegee Institute, was invited to pay tribute to Lincoln ''in the name of 12,000,000 Negroes.''
 Here's what The Times did not report about Moton: ''Instead of being placed on the speaker's platform, he was relegated along with other distinguished colored people to an all-Negro section separated by a road from the rest of the audience.'' So wrote Green in ''The Secret City,'' her landmark history of race relations in Washington. This was no anomaly. A local Ku Klux Klan had been formed months earlier, with no protests from either Congress or the white press, and the young Harding administration had toughened the exclusion of blacks from the city's public recreation facilities. 
 The eye-opening ''Secret City'' recounting this secret history was not published until 1967, some four years after the Lincoln Memorial served as a backdrop for ''I Have a Dream.'' It was also in 1967 that I graduated from Woodrow Wilson High. As a valedictory, a bunch of us on the school paper voted to publish an editorial in favor of home rule for D.C. ''Washingtonians have to beg, plead and cajole members of Congress for funds to renovate slums and slum schools,'' it read. That was putting it mildly; we still had much to learn. But the editorial was enough of an irritant that our principal tried to censor it, which prompted a brief civic kerfuffle (''Student Editorial Banned at Wilson'' read the headline in The Washington Post) and jump-started a few starry-eyed careers in journalism and political activism.
 It was one year later that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and Washington's secret city exploded. The fires and riotscame within a block of the building where the Obama transition set up shop.
 One would like to say in the aftermath of the 2008 election that everyone lived happily ever after. But the American drama, especially when it involves race, is always more complicated than that. 
 Looking back at my high school years, I'm struck by how slowly history can move. The great civil rights legislation of the Johnson administration had been accomplished in 1964and 1965, but by the time of my graduation the impact was minimal -- even in the city where the laws were written and passed. Today the nation's capital still has no voting representation in Congress and is still a ward of the federal government, reduced to begging, pleading and cajoling for basic needs. Some 19 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and that 19 percent remains a secret city to many who work within the Beltway.
 Washington is its own special American case, but only up to a point. For all our huge progress, we are not ''post-racial,'' whatever that means. The world doesn't change in a day, and the racial frictions that emerged in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general election didn't end on Nov. 4. As Obama himself said in his great speech on race, liberals couldn't ''purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap'' simply by voting for him. And conservatives? The so-called party of Lincoln has spent much of the past month in spirited debate about whether a white candidate for the party's chairmanship did the right thing by sending out a ''humorous'' recording of ''Barack the Magic Negro'' as a holiday gift. 
 Next to much of our history, this is small stuff. And yet: Of all the coverage of Obama's victory, the most accurate take may still be the piquant morning-after summation of the satirical newspaper The Onion. Under the headline ''Black Man Given Nation's Worst Job,'' it reported that our new president will have ''to spend four to eight years cleaning up the messes other people left behind.'' 
 Those messes are enormous, bigger than Washington, bigger than race, bigger than anything most of us have ever seen. Nearly three months after Election Day, it remains astonishing that the American people have entrusted the job to a young black man who seemed to come out of nowhere looking for that kind of work just as we most needed him.
 ''In no other country on earth is my story even possible,'' Obama is fond of saying. That is true, and that is what the country celebrates this week. But it is all the tragic American stories that came before him, some of them still playing out in chilly streets just blocks from the White House, that throw both his remarkable triumph and the huge challenge ahead of him into such heart-stopping relief.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths COLON NEVARES, JORGE

 BODY:
COLON NEVARES--Jorge. June 4, 1935, to January 9, 2009. The family of ''Georgie'' Colon Nevares records with sorrow and desolation the sudden passing of our patriarch. His coronary attack in San Juan deprives us of his charm and companionship and deprives his 5,000 employees across Puerto Rico of what Governor Luis Fortuno calls his vision and wise counsel. 
He is deeply mourned by his wife of 50 years, Toni Gerena, his three daughters, Yaz (and Valentin) Hernandez of New York City, Yazmin (and Nito) Cortizo of Panama City, and Yovani Colon of San Juan; his son Jorge (and Mari) Colon Gerena of San Juan; and eight grandchildren. The definition of a selfmade man, Georgie rose from credit manger at Hotel San Juan International to founder and CEO of a conglomerate of fast food companies including the franchises of Wendys, Longhorn, Sizzlers, Ap plebee's plus a portfolio of real estate. In 1960, he founded Commonwealth Loan Corporation, a consumer finance company, which was sold in 1972 to First Pennsylvania Bank. He was president and CEO of Banco Economias and chairman of the company operating El Comandante Racetrack. For the past 25 years, he has been Chairman of the Board of Trustees of School of Medicine, Universidad Central del Caribe. Since 1994, he has served as Consul General of the Republic of Panama in Puerto Rico. A gregarious host, Georgie and Toni constantly opened their home to Puerto Rican singers and musicians. He was renowned for his hospitality, humanity, egalitarianism, talent for friendship and passion for history. In business, he was ambitious, competitive, and scrupulously fair. For his family, friends and employees, Jorge Colon Nevares will forever fill a place in the pantheon of la isla del encanto.

HEADLINE: Helping Keep a City Clean, and Maybe Safer

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

DATELINE: ROSEVILLE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Gary Garcia probably knows the early-morning rhythms of the streets here in this city just north of Sacramento better than anyone besides his fellow garbage truck drivers. Anything that breaks the morning pattern is obvious to them, which makes it easy for the garbage collectors to perform an added job -- eyes for the police.
 ''See, here's an odd vehicle here,'' Mr. Garcia said, gesturing toward a red Ford sedan parked by itself, far from the nearest house, on a street where every other vehicle sat neatly in a driveway. He drove by slowly, peering down into the car but seeing nothing on the seats. ''It's an odd place to be parked.'' 
 It is a low-tech approach to surveillance, relying not on satellite cameras, space-age radiation detection devices or even neighborhood Webcams. In more and more towns, drivers and garbage collectors are helping the police keep up with what is happening on the streets. 
 Some of the nation's biggest waste collection companies, including Waste Management and Republic Services, have been participating in the program for several years, allowing police departments to train their workers on what to look for. 
 The program is now operating in 96 municipalities nationwide, including Londonderry, N.H.; Salt Lake City; Denver; and Fort Worth. ''The program has really, I would say, caught fire in the last couple of years,'' said Zachary T. Lowe, a former F.B.I. agent who was an early proponent of the program as vice president and chief security officer at Waste Management. ''We have not advertised it.''
 The company's ''Waste Watch'' program suggested the idea to officials of Roseville, whose garbage collectors are municipal employees. Local police officers trained the drivers, who are not paid extra for participating, last summer.
 Most mornings, Mr. Garcia says, are loud -- as his big truck rumbles to the curb, and its mechanical arm picks up, empties and repositions 90-pound plastic trash bins -- and predictable. Once in a while, though, he spots something that seems out of place -- that red car near Bill Santucci Park, for example, or on another day a man walking aimlessly at 7 a.m. in a neighborhood that rarely has foot traffic. 
 About once a month, Mr. Garcia says, he sees something unusual enough to merit a call to a special police number. 
 Police officers say they appreciate the drivers' tips, especially as budgets shrink. Over the last two years in Roseville, the police department has left 10 positions unfilled. Having the garbage trucks on patrol may not take the place of a police car, but it helps.
 ''It's a huge benefit for us,'' said Lt. Michael Doane, watch commander for the Roseville police. ''Obviously we're not increasing law enforcement staff right now, because of budget issues.''
 Lieutenant Doane recalled a tip from a driver who had spotted a man walking down a street, peering into parked cars. ''We went out and investigated, and sure enough the person had done some auto burglaries,'' he said.
 Apparently the man never noticed the passing garbage truck, Lieutenant Doane added. ''Everybody is used to seeing garbage trucks and public street workers and electric meter readers out every day,'' he said. ''Nobody pays any attention to them.''
 Drivers are told not to intervene when they see something suspicious, said Aric Henschen, general manager for Republic Services in Aurora, Ill. They are asked instead to ''make sure you get a license plate number, try to get as much physical information as you can.''
 Drivers' tips have led to drug-trafficking arrests, Mr. Henschen said, and to the discovery of a corpse in a home that had gone so long without having any trash that a driver grew suspicious. 
 Toby August, a senior driver in Roseville, said he often reported people he suspected of being drunken drivers. ''Three guys got in a Jeep, all with beers, the driver talking on a cellphone,'' he said. ''I called that one in.''
 Riding high in the cab of a garbage truck, it is impossible not to notice things. Signs of family life are evident in trash: a birth is announced by a crib's big cardboard box, the aging of children shown in the abandonment of a kiddie pool. Garbage collectors are also informal, hands-on economists, Mr. Garcia said, explaining that when times are good, everyone produces more garbage and that the absence of trash is often a sign of a foreclosed home.
 ''You can tell how well a particular restaurant is doing from the amount of trash,'' he said. 
 Having a recognized, official reason to notice and analyze is a source of pride, Mr. Garcia said, something that helps make up for the obscene gestures and angry honks from impatient drivers trying to pass his truck. 
 ''They have no idea what we do,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Urged to Move Swiftly to Rescue Banks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A growing chorus of officials and Wall Street executives have urged President-elect Barack Obama to move immediately to shore up the banking industry as its crisis deepens.
 With Citigroup, Bank of America and many other large financial institutions continuing to hemorrhage billions of dollars, the central issue Mr. Obama faces is how to relieve banks of rapidly deteriorating assets.
 In a speech last week at the London School of Economics, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised three proposals that Obama transition officials are said to have been considering to cleanse the largest banks of their biggest problems. One would involve the purchase by the government of troubled assets. A second would provide guarantees and agreements to absorb some of the losses in exchange for warrants or other compensation. A third would involve the creation of ''bad banks'' that would buy the declining assets for cash or stock in the new entity. 
 Mr. Obama has vowed in generalities to move swiftly. In an interview last week on ''This Week'' on ABC, he said he had asked his team ''to come together, come up with a set of principles around how we are going to maintain transparency, what are we going to do in terms of housing, how are we going to target small businesses that are under an enormous business crunch.''
 Likewise, advisers to Mr. Obama have provided few details about how they will attack the banking crisis. 
 The financial meltdown is the most serious to confront a new president since Franklin D. Roosevelt entered the White House in 1933.
 On March 5 of that year, a day after he became president, Roosevelt responded to the devastating string of bank failures by declaring a bank holiday that closed all banks and halted all financial transactions, allowing the start of the arduous process of restoring public confidence in the system. 
 None of Mr. Obama's advisers are suggesting a bank holiday. But like Roosevelt's move, the details of the Obama administration's rescue efforts are expected to begin to emerge quickly after the new president takes office. 
 On Wednesday, the day after the inauguration, Timothy F. Geithner, the nominee for Treasury secretary, is certain to be asked about the administration's plans at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. 
 In the House, lawmakers are preparing to take action soon on legislation outlining the conditions for spending the final $350 billion of the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Last Friday, the Senate handed Mr. Obama an early legislative victory when it voted 52 to 42 to defeat a measure to block the final disbursement of the money. 
 The idea of segregating the deteriorating assets at troubled institutions as part of a rescue effort is not new. In 1984, the government engineered the rescue of Continental Illinois National Bank, which was the seventh largest bank in the United States, by taking such an approach. And some institutions, notably Citigroup, are in effect trying to do the same thing to avert a government takeover. The idea is that by relieving the banks of their bad assets, the institutions might be able to regain some market confidence and attract more badly needed capital from investors.
 A plan by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to have the government buy the worst assets was abandoned last fall after its efficiency was questioned by many experts. They said that it would take too long to implement and that it would be extremely difficult for the government to price the declining mortgage-backed securities that the banks have been unable to unload on the markets.
 Hoping to ease the freeze of credit, the government has embarked on a program to buy billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities on the markets. A bailout that sops up many of the remaining bad bank assets presents a host of practical and political difficulties. In protecting taxpayers, the government would seek to pay the lowest price possible for the assets. But financial institutions, disinclined to post bigger losses on their books, would be reluctant to sell at low prices. 
 While Democrats will control both the White House and Congress beginning on Tuesday, Mr. Obama is likely to face more Congressional constraints on how to spend the bailout money than President Bush has. 
 Many Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been sharply critical of the Bush administration's management of the first $350 billion from the Troubled Assets Relief Program, to recapitalize banks and other institutions as a bailout of negligent executives and shareholders, and would be reluctant to see an even broader bailout of the same institutions. There is significant outrage on Capitol Hill that the $250 billion slice of the program that has gone to recapitalize the banks might not be enough.
 In legislation introduced last week to guide the administration's spending of the final $350 billion in the troubled assets program, Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, had no provision involving the use of the money to relieve the banks of their worst assets. The bill would require that at least $40 billion be spent on foreclosure relief.

HEADLINE: A Historic Moment, Through One Prominent Brooklyn Family's Perspective

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Three generations of Thompsons gathered around the patriarch's dining room table in Brooklyn Heights the other day and gave three varied perspectives on the inauguration of Barack Obama. 
 This prominent black political family from Brooklyn is headed by Harlem-born William C. Thompson. Known as Willie, he is 84 and served in a segregated infantry unit in Italy during World War II. His father worked for a furniture store, was a city marshal and remembered hearing Marcus Garvey preach his Back to Africa gospel on a Harlem street corner. 
 Willie Thompson is a former state senator -- elected in 1964, the last time the Democrats controlled the Senate in Albany -- a former City Council member and a state appellate judge. 
 In 1968, he lost a Congressional race by 200 votes to Shirley Chisholm, the Brooklyn-born daughter of immigrants, who was the first black woman elected to Congress. Four years later, she became the first black candidate for a major party's presidential nomination. 
 Justice Thompson's son, Bill -- William C. Thompson Jr. -- is 55. He worked for a congressman one summer, was appointed deputy borough president and later was president of the Board of Education.
 ''I don't know that I ever said I wanted to go into politics,'' he said, ''but public service was all around me.''
 Bill Thompson is completing his second term as city comptroller. Instead of seeking re-election, he intends to enter the Democratic mayoral primary to challenge Michael R. Bloomberg next November. He would not be the first black mayor of New York, but he faces daunting odds against a fairly popular billionaire incumbent. 
 ''Everything is possible,'' Justice Thompson says. 
 Bill Thompson's daughter, Jennifer, is 29. She lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant house that her great-grandparents bought in the late 1930s. They were the second black family on the block in a neighborhood that is slowly becoming integrated again, this time by white homeowners. 
 Her father remembers some white students taunting him with racial slurs when he attended junior high school in Flatbush. He also recalls the stunned reaction when, as deputy borough president, he appeared before a mostly white audience of Brooklyn homeowners. His daughter says she has never felt the sting of racial discrimination. 
 Jennifer Thompson majored in political science at Wellesley but has no desire to be a politician. So grueling, she said. So taxing. So she took on a different challenge: She is a fifth-grade special-education teacher at Public School 256 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. 
 All three Thompsons expressed concern about one potential consequence of Mr. Obama's victory: that Americans who are not black will figure racism and its legacy have finally been defeated. 
 Decades ago, Judge Thompson's mother had trouble getting a mortgage for their house on Putnam Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Bill Thompson talks about enduring economic injustice and points out that the foreclosure crisis falls disproportionately on blacks. Jennifer teaches in Bedford-Stuyvesant, but interned in Park Slope and says, ''I can see the disparity in resources.'' 
 Do they think blackness, in particular, is indelible? Will it ever entirely fade as a factor?
 ''Eventually, it won't be,'' Bill Thompson said, ''but I won't be alive then and I'm not sure Jennifer will be.''
 ''Nobody will get upset when anyone runs for office,'' Justice Thompson said. It may be a factor, but not a determinative one. ''No, not any more,'' he said.
 ''It makes it that much easier,'' Jennifer Thompson said, ''for the next person running.'' 
 Two generations say they voted for Mr. Obama in New York's Democratic primary nearly a year ago. (Bill Thompson will not say, describing his own vote as a personal matter and reaffirming that he publicly endorsed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton). 
 All three are going to President-elect Obama's inauguration. 
 All three are surprised. None expected to see a black president elected in their lifetime. 
 ''I thought maybe there was an outside chance of an African-American vice president,'' Bill Thompson said.
 Jennifer Thompson, raised in liberal Park Slope, said she was shocked that Mr. Obama was even nominated.
 ''I could envision my friends voting for Obama,'' she said, ''but not the rest of the country.''
 Justice Thompson contrasted Mr. Obama with Ms. Chisholm, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who each experienced a presidential candidacy defined by race -- both by Americans in general and by the candidates themselves. He figured that a majority of Americans still could not rise far enough above the ''quiet racism'' that many still believe prevails to vote for a black candidate. 
 ''Obama didn't surprise me,'' Justice Thompson said. ''The American people did.''

HEADLINE: Lest We Forget: Ferrell Keeps W. Onstage

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
IN late December, a CNN/Opinion Research poll disclosed that 75 percent of Americans were glad President Bush was leaving office, while 23 percent said they would miss him. Among those who, somehow, find themselves after all these years in that 2 percent ''undecided'' is the actor and comic Will Ferrell.
 Not unlike Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather: Part III'' (''Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in''), Mr. Ferrell has looked forward to the end of his portrayals of the president, which he made famous as a regular on ''Saturday Night Live,'' yet says he has also felt drawn to return to the role at times. He hopes to make his last pronouncement on the Bush era with nothing less than a one-man show on Broadway, ''You're Welcome America. A Final Night with George W Bush,'' which begins previews on Tuesday and marks Mr. Ferrell's theatrical debut. 
 ''There are people who are going to be, 'Enough already, leave him alone.' Or, 'I don't care if it's funny, I don't want to even think about that guy anymore.' Or -- and I hope this is the case -- people who think, 'This is cathartic, this is good,' '' Mr. Ferrell said over tea in the Soho House dining room one recent morning. ''At first I thought, I don't know about a Broadway show. I don't want to be just known as the guy who did Bush. But then I thought, what am I talking about? This is a great way to hang that character up, not even so much as a political statement, but to send him off into the sunset.''
 Since leaving ''SNL'' and New York, Mr. Ferrell has kept busy with movies, playing a leading role in nearly a dozen 10 major releases, including ''Elf,'' ''Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy'' and ''Step Brothers''; he has a big-budget remake of ''Land of the Lost,'' the onetime children's television series by Sid and Marty Krofft, coming out this summer, and he is mulling a sequel to ''Anchorman.'' At 41, though, Mr. Ferrell said he was ''hitting the pause button slightly right now'' on his career, as he mulls future projects and new risks -- like this entry into theater.
 ''This is one of the biggest flying leaps I've ever taken,'' said Mr. Ferrell, who is far more low-key and deadpan in person than his often-manic characters are. ''The only thing it compares to is auditioning for 'Saturday Night Live' in Studio 8H with a camera on me, a couple of people watching in the darkness, no one laughing, and me thinking, 'Oh my God, what's happening!' But it feels good right now, to take a leap.''
 Last summer he expressed regret to his manager, Jimmy Miller, about never having tried his hand at theater. It was Mr. Miller, Mr. Ferrell said, who suggested dusting off President Bush for a final go-round. And who better than liberal New York theatergoers, they hoped, to appreciate a cutting post-mortem on the Republican president?
 ''The only thing I am really curious about is the tourist family from Des Moines who is coming to New York, and they might be: 'Will Ferrell! That's the guy from 'Elf'!' '' he said. ''As long as we keep the house lights down, I won't know if anyone walks out.''
 ''You're Welcome America,'' an intermissionless 75 minutes, features Ferrell-as-Bush reminiscing about the last eight years and mounting an impassioned defense of his administration. The first preview is timed to coincide with Inauguration Day; the evening begins with Mr. Bush dropping onto the stage, apparently from the Marine One helicopter after it carries him away from the lawn of the new Obama White House. The limited run at the Cort Theater ends March 15.
 With Broadway bracing for a possible decline in ticket sales because of the recession, ''You're Welcome America'' has a financial cushion: HBO is a producer of the show and will carry a live performance in March. Mr. Ferrell's well-regarded humor might also provide a lift at the box office, in spite of any ambivalence over the subject matter. (Jeffrey Richards, one of the show's producers, said advance ticket sales were ''doing well,'' but declined to provide a figure.)
 ''This is definitely a time when people will want to laugh if they're coming to the theater,'' Daryl Roth, a theater producer not involved with the show, said. ''While I'm not sure people really want to spend more time with George Bush at this point, Will is a very appealing talent.''
 Mr. Ferrell, who grew up in Irvine, Calif., didn't see much theater in New York during his seven seasons on ''SNL.'' His sharpest memory of Broadway was from a 1990 visit with his father, Lee (who had played keyboards for the Righteous Brothers), packing in four shows, including August Wilson's ''Piano Lesson'' and the jazz-and-blues revue ''Black and Blue.'' 
 Early on in his ''SNL'' tenure, though, he had a conversation with the actor Alec Baldwin, whose voice Mr. Ferrell nailed perfectly as he recounted their exchange.
 ''Alec said to me this one night: 'You know, I want to tell you something. You're very, very good. Have you thought about doing stage?' '' Mr. Ferrell pointed out that he'd been on ''SNL'' only two years. ''You can't stay with the show forever,'' Mr. Baldwin replied.
 ''I took it as such a nice compliment: 'You could do stage,' '' Mr. Ferrell said.
 He is by no means overconfident about his first turn on Broadway. Mr. Ferrell said it took five years to overcome his stage fright on ''SNL''; though this is his first extended stay in New York since leaving for Los Angeles in 2003, he said he has spent most of his time memorizing 35 pages of material. 
 He wrote the script with his longtime creative partner, Adam McKay (who is the play's director), and mastering it has been nerve-racking, he said -- though he's already thought of one gimmick to save himself if he loses his place.
 ''Since I'll be up there as George W. Bush, I can always just start walking offstage and tell the audience, 'I forgot my line!' And come back with the script and say, 'So where were we?' '' he said.
 As Mr. Ferrell recalls, his Bush impersonation was ''kind of a fluke.'' The 2000 election calendar was gearing up when Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of ''SNL,'' asked the cast's master impersonator, Darrell Hammond, to select Al Gore or Mr. Bush as his target for the season ahead. 
 Mr. Hammond opted for Mr. Gore, upon which Mr. Michaels turned to Mr. Ferrell and said: ''Do you want to do Bush? You're tall.'' Mr. Ferrell readily agreed, though he, like many at the ''SNL'' shop, did not think his Bush duties would last beyond the 2000 primaries, then certainly not beyond Election Day (or the Florida recount).
 ''It was just the craziest thing in modern political history,'' Mr. Ferrell said, ''and then the crazy stuff kept going for eight years. Most administrations have a domestic problem, an overseas problem. Ethics. But these guys covered it all.''
 Or, as Mr. McKay describes the show's overarching theme: ''It really gets to the question of how Americans covered their eyes and ears for the last eight years, how cowed the media was. I think America got caught at its fattest and laziest, and I say that as someone who is fat and can be lazy.''
 Since leaving ''Saturday Night Live,'' Mr. Ferrell has performed as President Bush on occasion. Last year Jon Stewart interviewed Ferrell-as-Bush during a fund-raiser for autism education, and their exchange, Mr. Ferrell said, gave a flavor of the humor in ''You're Welcome America.''
 Q: Former presidents have worked on their memoirs; have you thought about how you're going to tell your story, when you're going to begin writing it?
 A: I actually finished mine, Jon. They will be sold only as a book on tape narrated by Vin Scully and Joe Morgan. I don't want to ruin the ending, but let's just say, Osama gets what's coming to him.
 Q: Sir, you wrote your memoirs, and they're fiction? It's a work of fiction?
 A: Yes, yes, it's fiction, Jon. If people want to read what actually happened, they can go to the library and read the micro-fish.
 Q: Uh, I believe, sir, fiche. Microfiche.
 A: Are you cursing at me in Jewish? Listen, Jon, just shut up. This book is going to make a great movie. It's like a cross between 'Harry Potter,' 'Die Hard' and 'Forrest Gump' -- only with e-mails being deleted, and torture.
 Both Mr. Ferrell and Mr. McKay said they were initially concerned that they might not have enough material for 75 minutes, since Mr. Ferrell had never played President Bush for longer than a 10-minute segment. 
 ''We very quickly discovered we could do a three-hour show with this character -- the more you dig into who he is, where he comes from, it's really shocking and extremely interesting at the same time,'' Mr. McKay said. ''We can't help but fail in portraying the scope of how much of a disaster the last eight years have been.''
 Mr. Ferrell said he had never received any feedback from Mr. Bush, which comes as a relief: ''Not for fear that he would punch me in the face or anything, but more just to help me stay unbiased about how I play him.'' Mr. Ferrell's sense of Mr. Bush's personality is neither one-dimensional nor ideological; as he describes it, it sounds somewhat complicated.
 ''I kind of feel like he's someone who -- and I think this is documented -- he is someone who is seeking acceptance throughout his entire life, and finally got into the most prominent position of power in the world, and then thought 'My way or the highway,' '' said Mr. Ferrell, who paused as he discussed Mr. Bush, choosing his words carefully rather than cracking jokes that might seem demeaning. ''There are times when I was doing him and I thought, 'I kind of feel sorry for him.' But then I'd think, 'No, he's a grown man, he needs to be held accountable for what happened.' ''
 It is not, of course, too late for President Bush to offer his own review of Mr. Ferrell's performance, or his Broadway debut.
 ''He does have free time now to see the show,'' Mr. Ferrell noted. Maybe, he said, he'd leave a ticket for Mr. Bush at the box office.

HEADLINE: For Many, a Day to Celebrate, at Home or in Washington

BYLINE: By PAT WIEDENKELLER

 BODY:
SOME Long Islanders are taking the plunge, heading to the National Mall in Washington to see Barack Obama's inauguration in person with a couple million of their fellow citizens. Others are just celebrating with loved ones in front of the TV on Tuesday. 
 But even some of the stay-at-homes are breaking out black tie and evening gowns for their living-room parties, intending to match the grandeur of the moment with formal wear and Champagne. In dozens of interviews, people across the Island said they were planning to celebrate the inauguration in the biggest way possible, given the realities of hard economic times and the expected crush at the capital. 
 Judy Faraone, 60, a retired teacher, said she was planning to have 15 friends, all women, come in black tie or evening gown to a soiree at her home in Babylon while her husband, a Republican, made himself scarce. 
 Marvin Kreutzberger, 64, board president of Yes We Can! Long Island, a political action committee that campaigned vigorously for Mr. Obama in the Third Congressional District, planned to wear his tuxedo to a formal house party with fellow campaign workers on Tuesday night. He said he was working on his toast.
 ''You can believe it's going to have 'Yes We Can' in it, and 'Yes We Did,' '' he said.
 A crowd of about 200 campaign volunteers and community members is expected for a formal inaugural ball at the Carltun banquet hall at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, said Rodney Brown, chairman of the Nassau County Commission on Human Rights, who is planning the celebration. 
 ''This is all really a reflection of who people envision Barack Obama and his family to be,'' Mr. Brown said. ''A class-act, black-tie family.'' 
 Frances Reid, 51, whose Great Neck home turned into a makeshift phone bank for the Obama campaign on Election Day, said she would watch at home with her teenage son and celebrate later at a cocktail party with other members of Reach Out America, a 200-member grass-roots political organization that she helped form. ''I'm not one for huge crowds,'' she said. 
 But others were determined to witness the moment. 
 ''There is nothing -- from the crowds to the shortage of restroom facilities to the weather -- there is nothing that would prevent me from being there,'' said Julie Dade Howard, president of the Garden City-based Long Island chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women. Her group is sharing a chartered bus with the Long Island contingent of the Tuskegee Airmen, the group of black World War II pilots whose members have been invited to an inauguration day breakfast with Mr. Obama.
 Jon D. Cooper, a Suffolk County legislator who as chairman of Mr. Obama's Long Island operation raised nearly a million dollars for his campaign, said he was booked for so many events surrounding the inauguration that he had lost track. ''Three inaugural balls, pre-inaugural balls the day before, breakfast with cabinet officials, something at the Lincoln Memorial,'' he said. 
 ''I invested 21 months of my life in this effort -- I want to see it through to fruition,'' Mr. Cooper added. ''But it's going to be a madhouse.''
 That prospect, and the tight economy, appeared to be putting off some Long Islanders who had been expected to crowd charter buses and Amtrak trains for the event.
 In the days after the election, ''the phones never stopped ringing,'' said Jim Manas, manager of Metro Coach New York in Massapequa, a bus company that is running a few inaugural charters.
 ''Then people started calling to cancel,'' he said. ''They couldn't raise the money.'' 
 Four buses of students and staff members heading down from SUNY College at Old Westbury were scaled back to two. Organizers decided to make the trip educational, with teachers on board to lead discussions on the historical implications of the day, said Suzanne McLoughlin, director of student activities. 
 And by early last week James A. Garner, the former mayor of Hempstead -- and the first African-American mayor on Long Island -- had filled only one of three Amtrak train cars he had booked for members of local churches and civic organizations. Undaunted, he was holding out for last-minute takers for the one-day, round-trip tickets, going for $275. 
 Long Island's colleges and universities, mostly emptied out for the winter holiday break, were expected to be relatively quiet, but politically energized students were still making plans. 
 At Stony Brook University, Da'Nashja Davis, 19, the coordinator for the winter student activities board, had reserved an auditorium for students and staff to watch on a projection TV. Ms. Davis, who helped students register to vote during the campaign, has posted fliers for Tuesday's event around campus and sent out about 500 messages on Facebook in hopes of drawing a crowd. 
 And at SUNY Old Westbury, Albert Addison, a senior and a native of Ghana, expressed elation at the prospect of riding the bus with classmates and professors to see the new president sworn in. ''I think I'm going to wear a suit,'' he said. ''I have a black suit, a white shirt. I'm thinking a black tie.''
 Mr. Addison, 22, who said he became a United States citizen last year, cast his first vote as an American for Mr. Obama.
 ''I don't even know how to express it,'' he said. ''Since I come to America, it's like everything is easy. I have a chance to do what I have to do. Anything is possible here as long as you put your mind to it.''

HEADLINE: Bailout Is a No-Strings Windfall To Bankers, if Not to Borrowers

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
At the Palm Beach Ritz-Carlton last November, John C. Hope III, the chairman of Whitney National Bank in New Orleans, stood before a ballroom full of Wall Street analysts and explained how his bank intended to use its $300 million in federal bailout money.
''Make more loans?'' Mr. Hope said. ''We're not going to change our business model or our credit policies to accommodate the needs of the public sector as they see it to have us make more loans.''
As the incoming Obama administration decides how to fix the economy, the troubles of the banking system have become particularly vexing.
Congress approved the $700 billion rescue plan with the idea that banks would help struggling borrowers and increase lending to stimulate the economy, and many lawmakers want to know how the first half of that money has been spent before approving the second half. But many banks that have received bailout money so far are reluctant to lend, worrying that if new loans go bad, they will be in worse shape if the economy deteriorates. 
Indeed, as mounting losses at major banks like Citigroup and Bank of America in the last week have underscored, regulators are still searching for ways to stabilize the banking system. The Obama administration could be forced early on to come up with a systemic solution, getting bad loans off balance sheets as a way to encourage banks to begin lending, which most economists say is essential to get businesses and consumers spending again.
Individually, banks that received some of the first $350 billion from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, have offered few public details about how they plan to spend the money, and they are not required to disclose what they do with it. But in conversations behind closed doors with investment analysts, some bankers have been candid about their intentions.
Most of the banks that received the money are far smaller than behemoths like Citigroup or Bank of America. A review of investor presentations and conference calls by executives of some two dozen banks around the country found that few cited lending as a priority. An overwhelming majority saw the bailout program as a no-strings-attached windfall that could be used to pay down debt, acquire other businesses or invest for the future.
Speaking at the FBR Capital Markets conference in New York in December, Walter M. Pressey, president of Boston Private Wealth Management, a healthy bank with a mostly affluent clientele, said there were no immediate plans to do much with the $154 million it received from the Treasury.
''With that capital in hand, not only do we feel comfortable that we can ride out the recession,'' he said, ''but we also feel that we'll be in a position to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves once this recession is sorted out.''
The bankers' comments, while representing only a random sampling of the more than 200 financial institutions that have received TARP money so far, underscore a growing gulf between public expectations for how the $700 billion should be used and the decisions being made by many of the institutions that have taken part. The program does not dictate what banks should do with the money.
The loose requirements in the original plan have contributed to confusion over what the Treasury intended when it abruptly shelved its first proposal -- to buy up bad mortgages -- in favor of making direct investments in individual banks in return for preferred shares of stock.
The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said in October that banks should ''deploy, not hoard'' the money to build confidence and increase lending. He added: ''We expect all participating banks to continue to strengthen their efforts to help struggling homeowners who can afford their homes avoid foreclosure.''
But a Congressional oversight panel reported on Jan. 9 that it found no evidence the bailout program had been used to prevent foreclosures, raising questions about whether the Treasury has complied with the law's requirement that it develop a ''plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners.''
The report concluded that the Treasury's top priority seemed to be to ''stabilize financial markets'' by simply giving healthy banks more money and letting them decide how best to use it. The report also said it was not clear how giving billions to banks ''advances both the goal of financial stability and the well-being of taxpayers, including homeowners threatened by foreclosure, people losing their jobs, and families unable to pay their credit cards.''
For the banks, fearful that the economic downturn could deepen and wary of risking additional losses, the question of what to do with the bailout money comes down to self-preservation.
Mark Fitzgibbon, research director at Sandler O'Neill & Partners, which sponsored the Palm Beach conference, said banks seemed to be allocating the bailout money for four general purposes: increased lending, absorbing losses, bolstering capital and ''opportunistic acquisitions.'' He said those approaches made sense from a business perspective, even though they might not conform to popular expectations that the money would be immediately lent to consumers.
''For the banking industry, this isn't a sprint, this is a marathon,'' Mr. Fitzgibbon said. ''I think over time there will be pressure to lend that capital out and get a return for their shareholders. But they're not going to rush out and lend all that money tomorrow. If they did, they could lose it.''
For City National Bank in Los Angeles, the Treasury money ''really doesn't change our perspective about doing things,'' said Christopher J. Carey, the bank's chief financial officer, addressing the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference in November. He said that his bank would like to use it for lending and acquisitions but that the decision would depend on the economy.
''Adding $400 million in capital gives us a chance to really have a totally fortressed balance sheet in case things get a lot worse than we think,'' Mr. Carey said. ''And if they don't, we may end up just paying it back a little bit earlier.''
In addition to wanting more lending, members of Congress have said TARP should not be used to fuel mergers and acquisitions, although Treasury officials say the financial system would be strengthened if healthy banks absorbed weaker ones. To that extent, bailout money has been useful for improving capital ratios -- the amount of money available to absorb losses -- for banks that merge.
On Friday, Bank of America said it would receive $20 billion more from the Treasury to help it digest losses it took on by acquiring Merrill Lynch, a process begun in September.
At least seven banks that received TARP money have since bought other companies, including one that had been encouraged to do so by federal regulators. That one, PNC Financial Services, took $7.7 billion from the Treasury and promptly acquired the struggling National City Bank for $5.2 billion in stock and $384 million in cash.
Among the others, PlainsCapital Bank of Dallas announced in November, not long after the bailout program began, that it planned to merge with a healthy investment bank, First Southwest. PlainsCapital received $88 million from the Treasury on Dec. 19, and the all-stock merger was completed two weeks later. PlainsCapital's chairman, Alan B. White, insisted in an interview that the two events were not connected.
He said the bank had not yet decided what to do with its bailout money, which he called ''opportunity capital.'' Increased lending would be a priority, said Mr. White, who did not rule out using it for other acquisitions, adding that when regulators invited PlainsCapital to apply for federal dollars, there were no conditions attached.
''They didn't tell me I had to do anything particular with it,'' he said.
None of the bankers who appeared before recent investor conferences offered specific details about their intentions, but recurring themes emerged in their presentations. Two of the most often cited priorities were hanging on to the money as insurance against a prolonged recession and using it for mergers.
At the Sandler O'Neill East Coast Financial Services Conference in Florida, bankers mingled with investment analysts at an ocean-front luxury hotel, where the agenda featured evening cocktails by the pool and a golf outing at a nearby country club.
During his presentation, John R. Buran, the chief executive of Flushing Financial in New York, said the government money was a way to up the ''ante for acquisitions'' of other companies.
''We can get $70 million in capital,'' he said. ''So, I would say the price of poker, so to speak, has gone up.''
For Mr. Hope, the Whitney National Bank chairman, ''the main motivation for TARP'' was not more loans, but rather to safeguard against the ''possibility things could get a lot worse.'' He said Whitney would continue making loans ''that we would have made with or without TARP.''
''We see TARP as an insurance policy,'' he said. ''That when all this stuff is finally over, no matter how bad it gets, we're going to be one of the remaining banks.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Offers Self as Remedy for Fiscal Health

BYLINE: By DUNSTAN McNICHOL

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
 IN his State of the State address to lawmakers in Trenton last week, Gov. Jon S. Corzine avoided the broad promises and sweeping initiatives that are the hallmarks of the annual rite.
 Instead, Mr. Corzine outlined what could only be a major theme of his re-election campaign this year, which is that he is the candidate prepared to make the tough decisions to help the state ride out this economic storm.
 Mr. Corzine's supporters say the theme is appropriate given the economic anxiety causing so much concern among New Jersey residents as the unemployment number rises and portfolios continue to decline. It is also a message to remind them of the governor's financial management credentials as he embarks on a re-election campaign, possibly against a popular opponent known largely for his success in jailing corrupt politicians. 
 ''I think he was setting it up for making sure people know what he has accomplished,'' said Ingrid Reed, of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ''He said: 'Look, I've been governing for three years, we've made real strides. I've been on the job.' ''
 In contrast to the typical State of the State address, which often presents a governor's top initiatives and strategy for the coming year, Mr. Corzine focused on past accomplishments in his address and used it to sound warnings of the tough times ahead. 
 One section of the address was simply a list of 11 accomplishments from Mr. Corzine's three years in office. The rest were constant reminders of how tough times will be.
 The governor's Democratic supporters said it was not surprising that Mr. Corzine would forgo any bold, and potentially costly, initiatives in a year that has already featured a $1.7 billion slide in tax revenues, home foreclosures and rising unemployment.
 ''How can you discuss big initiatives when this year's budget is $2 billion in the hole?'' asked Richard Codey, the Senate president and an Essex County Democrat.
 In his speech, Mr. Corzine also touted his efforts at fiscal reform, making special mention of the elimination of special Legislative ''Christmas tree'' grants in the annual state budget.
 The abuse of those grants featured prominently in the high-profile prosecution of Wayne Bryant, a former state senator from Camden County, on corruption charges two months ago. The charges were brought by the office of the former United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, a Republican who recently filed to be a candidate for governor. Many Republicans in the state believe that Mr. Christie, who racked up a reputation as a tough crime fighter, will present Mr. Corzine's toughest challenge.
 ''I think it was very much a campaign speech, full of 'Look at all our great work,' '' said Tom Wilson, the chairman of the Republican State Committee. 
 ''I think he's very cognizant of Chris's credentials, and whenever he gets an opportunity to say 'hey, I'm a good guy too,' which isn't very often, he's going to highlight it,'' he said.
 Another Republican candidate for governor, Assemblyman Richard A. Merkt, of Morris County, was in the audience for the State of the State address and said Mr. Corzine's remarks lacked substance.
 ''He still hasn't projected a vision for New Jersey that's credible,'' he said.
 Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, the Republican minority leader of the Assembly, derided the speech. ''Middle-class families don't need a pep talk,'' said Mr. DeCroce, a Morris County Republican. ''It won't put bread on their table or put a roof over their heads.''
 Senator Barbara Buono, a Middlesex County Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, said Mr. Corzine's message of confidence and support spoke to the personal anxiety that is gripping her constituents.
 ''His speech reflects the reality of the fiscal turmoil we're in,'' she said. ''The fact that people are still panicked about the impact this financial crisis has.''
 It did not take long for Mr. Corzine to see the pitfalls that await as he tries to administer his prescription for fiscal health in a campaign season.
 At a meeting of the Assembly Budget Committee on Thursday, Republicans unanimously opposed a measure that would let Mr. Corzine postpone his budget presentation until March 12, a three-week delay the administration hopes will let it know how much relief it may get from a new federal stimulus plan.
 The measure passed 8 to 4 on a straight party-line vote, prompting Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, a committee member who is also chairman of the state Democratic Committee, to remark, ''I guess you can tell what kind of a year it's going to be.''
 Mr. Corzine reminded lawmakers two days earlier as he wound down his somber assessment of the state of the state: ''We don't choose the circumstances in which we govern. But let me repeat, my first priority, my second priority and my third priority is to get our state through these challenging economic times.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Indonesian Classroom

BYLINE: By ENDY M. BAYUNI. 
Endy M. Bayuni is the chief editor of The Jakarta Post.

DATELINE: Jakarta, Indonesia 

 BODY:
 WHEN Barack Obama and his mother arrived in Jakarta in 1967, Indonesia was just emerging from major political upheaval and a deep economic crisis that had made it one of the most impoverished nations in Asia. The city's few high-rise buildings only highlighted the poverty around them. Those who had cars, perhaps more for status than for transport, competed for space on asphalt roads with public buses, motorcycles, three-wheeled rickshaws, pedestrians and hawkers peddling food, cigarettes and whatever else they could sell. 
 The Indonesia that Barack Obama found was a densely populated country that could barely feed its own people and had to be propped up with huge infusions of foreign aid. Not long before his arrival, hundreds of thousands of people accused of membership in the Indonesian Communist Party had been massacred, and the staunchly pro-American General Suharto had seized power from the left-leaning President Sukarno.
 Under Suharto, the army took firm control of the government, and increasingly every facet of people's lives. Anyone suspected of harboring even the slightest sympathy for the communists risked incarceration. Some of the more serious offenders were sent to a remote prison island named Buru. 
 Mr. Obama's family was not exactly poor, but they were not rich either. He lived on the outskirts of Jakarta, and not in the exclusive district where American expatriates mingled with Jakarta's high society. Instead he lived in a neighborhood that was not particularly affluent but did have houses with gardens. Barry, as he was called by friends back then, went to Indonesian schools. He learned the local language and culture through playing and running in the streets with his Indonesian friends. His height may have drawn some attention, but otherwise he could have easily passed as an Indonesian from the Molucca archipelago, where people have dark skin and curly hair. 
 Anyone going to a public school in Jakarta would have had early exposure to a vast array of cultures. These schools were microcosms of Indonesia, a nation of many different races, ethnic groups and religions. Indonesia has certainly had its share of religious extremism (and terrorism), but its religious tolerance remains a point of pride. The Muslim-majority nation would have ceased to exist long ago if bigotry got the better of its people. 
 Sadly, this openness did not extend to politics. By the time Barry left Indonesia at age 10, military control was widespread. Students attended indoctrination classes where they would profess their loyalty to the state. Dissent and criticism were not tolerated in public life. There was barely freedom of thought.
 In 1971, Barry's mother wisely sent him back to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents. His childhood years in Indonesia served him well; growing up respecting cultural and religious differences probably helped prepare him for his return to the United States, a society still divided by race.
 Indonesians wish him ''selamat'' (congratulations) in his new job.

HEADLINE: Obama Faces Different World 2 Years After Campaign Began

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The world looked very different on the frigid Saturday in February 2007 when Barack Obama stood in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., and declared himself a candidate for president of the United States.
 The ''surge'' in Iraq was in its first weeks, and it seemed hard to imagine that by the time the next president took office, in 710 days, there would be a consensus about the pace of an American withdrawal. The two Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, were talking about a peaceful power-sharing agreement. 
 The Dow was at 12,580, on the way to 14,000 that summer. General Motors was making money selling cars even while reporting some concerns about ''nonprime mortgages'' held by its financing division. And the greatest worries about China and India were that their economies were growing so fast they could overheat. 
 The challenges that Mr. Obama will begin to confront on Tuesday afternoon, in short, bear only a passing resemblance to those on the table on the day two years ago when he conceded that ''there is a certain presumptuousness in this -- a certain audacity -- to this announcement.'' 
 The agenda he is setting out to enact now is significantly altered from what he had in mind then, partly by choice but mostly by circumstance. Over the past two years, and especially in the two and a half months since his election, he has spoken less and less about Iraq and more and more about stabilizing the world economy. Behind the scenes, his national staff has raced to reassess strategies for Afghanistan, Gaza, Iran and Pakistan, even before logging on to their secure computers in the West Wing. 
 ''He's facing the classic problem of having to handle a number of crises before he's really got time to set out a long-term architecture,'' G. John Ikenberry, a Princeton professor who co-wrote a detailed study of the national security agenda for whoever became the next president. Former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright recently called Mr. Obama's task analogous to ''redesigning the airplane while you're flying it.'' 
 But the shifting reality has done more than force a change in focus. It also led Mr. Obama to re-examine his assumptions about a range of issues, hone his thinking and reach out to new advisers, some of them drawn from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign, some of his aides said.
 When it comes to national security in particular, some of his aides see a subtle but distinct shift over the last several years, opening him to the influence of advisers who sound significantly more hawkish than he did two years ago.
 So while the world has changed, Mr. Obama has changed with it. But how much?
 Aides to Mr. Obama since his arrival in the Senate say his views have not changed as much as some liberal supporters and commentators contend. From the day in 2002 when he stated opposition to the Iraq war, he has said he is not against all wars. And on some issues, including that of striking at terrorism targets in Pakistan, he has sometimes been to the right of both Democratic and Republican rivals. 
 Yet while he might have been less ideological all along than his initial campaign positioning suggested, his emphasis since the election has been on pragmatism. It is particularly striking that he has signaled, without saying so, that his breaks with the Bush administration will not be as complete as many liberals are hoping. In response to Vice President Dick Cheney's admonition not to turn his campaign rhetoric into policy until he has taken office and learned ''precisely what it is we did and how we did it,'' Mr. Obama told ABC News last week that it was ''pretty good advice.'' 
 At home, Mr. Obama is confronting an economic and financial crisis that is sure to demand evolving thinking and some trial and error. He has already increased the size of his economic stimulus package. With some of the nation's big banks under intense strain, he will immediately face tough decisions about redesigning the strategy even as more money is being poured in.
 Two years ago, Mr. Obama's views on Iraq dominated the headlines as he began his campaign by emphasizing his differences with Mrs. Clinton.
 That day in Springfield, Mr. Obama animated his supporters with talk about how Iraq was the wrong war. ''It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war,'' he said.
 Then, it would have been hard to imagine that in less than two years he would ask President Bush's defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, to stay on, along with the White House ''war czar'' for Iraq and Afghanistan. Or that he would choose a secretary of state who portrayed herself as more hawkish than himself and a national security adviser who is a former Marine commandant.
 In March, as it was becoming increasingly evident that he would prevail over Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Obama began talking about Iran as the nation that ''poses the greatest challenge to American interests in the Middle East in a generation,'' and he vowed a few months later never to let the country obtain a nuclear weapon. 
 His openness to a broad range of viewpoints on national security has become more pronounced with each daily presidential briefing and with deeper dives into National Intelligence Estimates, which his staff says he reads with some skepticism. That is not only because of what the intelligence agencies got wrong in the run-up to the war in Iraq. 
 ''He approaches the intelligence reports the same way he approaches a lot of the things he reads, whether it's a story in The New York Times or a report from the ground,'' said Denis McDonough, a longtime foreign policy aide who is often charged with finding answers to questions Mr. Obama raises. He contends that those who think Mr. Obama has drifted toward more hawkish views were not listening to what he said during the campaign about Iran or Pakistan or Hamas. 
 One official who is widely reported to be headed for a senior position in the administration and would not talk on the record until his appointment was confirmed said: ''Everyone focused on his willingness to engage the Iranians in direct talks, and that was the right thing to do. But they don't listen to the part that says that if the Iranians don't come to the table, he's prepared to talk about cutting off their gasoline and squeezing them on sanctions.''
 As his inauguration has approached, Mr. Obama renewed his pledge to engage directly with the Iranians, something Mr. Bush permitted only at the end of his presidency and only at a low government level. Mrs. Clinton, who once cast Mr. Obama's calls for high-level engagement as an example of his inexperience, will now be in charge of the effort. 
 But the enterprise is bound to be complicated by the fact that Mr. Bush is handing off to his successor an expanded, covert effort to undermine the Iranian nuclear program, one of many secret programs that Mr. Obama has been briefed about recently and will soon have the opportunity to reauthorize, modify or terminate. 
 Mr. Obama made clear on Saturday, just before boarding a train in Philadelphia that was supposed to evoke Lincoln's sweep into Washington in 1861, that he was ready to make good on his promise to increase troop levels in Afghanistan. ''Two wars,'' he said, ''one that needs to be ended responsibly, one that needs to be waged wisely.''
 His views on Afghanistan are likely to be heavily influenced by Gen. James L. Jones, his national security adviser, who wrote an influential report a year ago making the case that American and NATO forces were not winning the war and needed a revamped strategy to confront Taliban forces coming over the border from Pakistan. General Jones, in turn, has asked Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, the war czar for Iraq and Afghanistan, to stay on. 
 General Lute has prescribed a much greater focus on Pakistan and the sanctuary areas along the border, a place Mr. Obama has said he would be willing to send military forces if that is the only way to hunt down members of Al Qaeda and other insurgents. 
 No one knows where the first crisis of Mr. Obama's term will erupt. It could be in North Korea, which declared on Saturday that it had ''weaponized'' much of its nuclear fuel and threatened South Korea. More likely it will be the battle in Gaza that will confront Mr. Obama on Tuesday afternoon. It appears likely that he will be greeted by an Israeli willingness to declare a cease-fire, one that appears partly intended to ease Mr. Obama's Inauguration Day. No one on his team expects that to last for long.

NOTHING TO FEAR
 FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America

 The Court-Packing Fight and the Triumph of Democracy
 By Burt Solomon

 His chin jutting upward, his cigarette holder poised between his teeth, his broad grin radiating confidence -- illustrations in both Time and The New Yorker last November rendered Barack Obama as Franklin Roosevelt redivivus. With the financial system imploding and doctrinaire conservatism roundly discredited, the comparisons in the news media between the two presidents-elect at their inaugural moments are as predictable as they are ubiquitous. Great expectations, too, will hover over Obama during his much awaited first hundred days. 
 It might seem a stroke of luck that Adam Cohen, an editorial writer for The New York Times, has just written ''Nothing to Fear'' -- the third history in three years of what's often called Roosevelt's ''first New Deal.'' But that luck is an illusion. The idea that any president's first hundred days form his window of opportunity to accomplish bold things has been an article of faith since Roosevelt's dazzling debut in 1933. Every subsequent president has seen the interval as his best chance to set the tone for his administration. 
 Publishing a book so soon after two other fine introductions to the same topic -- one by the journalist Jonathan Alter, one by the historian Anthony Badger -- creates an obvious challenge. But ''Nothing to Fear'' meets it. Cohen covers a shorter time-span than Alter, who delves into the 1932 campaign and transition, and he cedes to Badger the task of in-depth economic analysis. And if Cohen doesn't stake out a new position in the old debate about whether Roosevelt's agenda was radical, liberal or conservative, neither do the others. All three hail the pragmatic but heroic Roosevelt, with sensible qualifications. 
 Cohen breaks from the pack with his disciplined focus on the spate of legislation that Roosevelt pushed through Congress after his inauguration -- 15 major laws, from banking reform and securities regulation to industrial production codes and relief for the destitute. Though these new programs, taken together, lacked ideological coherence, and though a conservative Supreme Court soon struck down some of them, and though Roosevelt often proved an opaque and mercurial leader, the inspired improvisation did set the nation on the road to recovery -- and forged a new relationship between people and government. 
 Cohen's well-told story belies the cliche about legislation and sausage-making: his narrative is absorbing and enjoyable to read. Admirably game to tackle the heavy-going details of policy making, ''Nothing to Fear'' is nonetheless decidedly nonacademic, sparing the lay reader the even heavier-going theorizing found in books like Badger's. One might say it's the kind of history you would expect from a newspaper editorialist. 
 Cohen also finds a niche by concentrating on five key presidential aides. These biographical portraits enliven the policy discussions, so that we're eased into the rigors of the Economy Act through the penny-pinching zeal of the budget director Lewis Douglas, and reconciled to a lesson in ''domestic allotment'' for farmers through the messianic agrarianism of Henry Wallace. This resort to biography is mainly a device. These five New Dealers -- the other three are the labor secretary Frances Perkins, the relief administrator Harry Hopkins and the charter ''Brain Truster'' Raymond Moley -- were neither Roosevelt's five closest advisers nor even a closely knit unit; they represent only a sampling of the many planets orbiting Roosevelt's sun. 
 Chronicling the discrete period of a hundred days makes for an appealingly taut narrative. But it can overstate the historical importance of a figure like Douglas, who wielded great clout early on but soon fell from Roosevelt's favor. And suggesting that Roosevelt's first efforts defined the New Deal diminishes both the more radical legislation of the ''second New Deal'' that began in 1935 (and included the Social Security Act and the pro-labor Wagner Act) and the later turn toward a consumption-oriented liberalism that Alan Brinkley described in ''The End of Reform.'' 
 Cohen's slice-of-history approach, finally, can inhibit the exploration of central themes of the period. Roosevelt's first Inaugural Address, remembered today for the famous quotation that suggested the title for this book, drew the heartiest applause, Cohen reminds us, for its call for ''broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency,'' which Cohen calls an ''understated suggestion of autocracy.'' Although some warned of incipient dictatorship, the desperate times led most citizens to accept if not bless an arrogation of power to the presidency. 
 Cohen rightly pays serious attention to the talk of benign dictatorship, so odd to today's ears. Yet a wider historical lens would also reveal that the public's appetite for executive power had firm limits. In ''FDR v. the Constitution: The Court-Packing Fight and the Triumph of Democracy,'' the journalist Burt Solomon's new account of Roosevelt's failed 1937 gambit to expand the Supreme Court with friendly justices, the specter of Roosevelt as dictator returns. Though Solomon's title is more shrill than his actual argument (the court-packing bill wasn't unconstitutional, just injurious to the separation of powers), the book nonetheless flattens some complexities of the story. It sometimes reads like a morality tale pitting a hubristic president, fresh off a landslide re-election, against a devoutly principled nemesis in Burton Wheeler, a crusading Montana progressive. 
 In truth, the court-packing bill -- born of legitimate frustration with the ''nine old men'' overturning key New Deal enactments -- lacked broad support all along, and Wheeler's tendencies were demagogic as well as democratic. Wheeler, who would later oppose the war against Nazism, saw fit to liken Roosevelt to Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and other despots who ''usurped the power of the legislative and judicial branches of the government in the name of the necessity for haste to promote the general welfare of the masses -- and then proceeded to reduce them to servitude.'' Fiery rhetoric like that showed the robustness of the antimonarchical strains in American political culture dating back to the Revolution. But no book spotlighting just a few months' events can explain the shifting popular dispositions toward Roosevelt's accrual of presidential power throughout the 1930s -- dispositions that remained alive and fluid through his bid in 1940 for an unprecedented third term. 
 Yet if Congress's rebuke in the court-packing battle checked Roosevelt's power after 1937, it hardly voided what Cohen calls the ''greatest impact'' of the hundred days: that ''in just over three months, the federal government changed from being a nearly passive observer of its citizens' problems to an active force in solving them.'' Indeed, fears of dictatorship proved overblown. Far from acting by fiat, Roosevelt had to seek, and usually got, the cooperation of not just Congress but also the key constituencies whom his policies affected: bankers, businessmen, farmers. Without their consent, he could not have triumphed. 
 ''I cannot go any faster than the people will let me,'' Roosevelt once said, expressing his belief in the centrality of public opinion to modern democratic governance. It was a piece of realism that he deployed in 1933, forgot in 1937 and returned to when he pressed for American involvement in what began as an unpopular European war. Our new president would do well to keep this wisdom in mind well beyond his own first hundred days.

THE SEARCH FOR AL QAEDA
 Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future
 By Bruce Riedel
 180 pp. Brookings Institution Press. $26.95
 THE DUEL
 Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power
 By Tariq Ali
 288 pp. Scribner. $26
 One lesson from Vietnam was that the United States should not go to war without broad public support. One lesson from Iraq might be that we should not go to war without a vigorous public debate in which an administration's claims are carefully examined and challenged. Yet we are on the verge of significantly expanding the war in Afghanistan, which will inevitably affect Pakistan as well. Unfortunately, there has been little or no debate about President-elect Barack Obama's plan to send in more troops. 
 The pros and cons of continuing or escalating the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan can be gleaned from two recent books, ''The Search for Al Qaeda,'' by Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst and adviser to three presidents, and ''The Duel,'' by the Pakistani writer and filmmaker Tariq Ali. One thing they agree on -- and which was underscored by the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai -- is that Pakistan is going to be at the forefront of foreign policy concerns for the Obama administration. 
 It's hard to get more apocalyptic than Riedel. ''Pakistan is the most dangerous country in the world today, where every nightmare of the 21st century -- terrorism, nuclear proliferation, the danger of nuclear war, dictatorship, poverty and drugs -- come together in one place.'' It is, he adds, the country most critical to the development and survival of Al Qaeda. 
 The importance Ali attaches to Pakistan can be found in his subtitle: ''Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power.'' The United States thinks it needs Pakistan now, he says, in order to fight Al Qaeda and the insurgents who are carrying out attacks on the NATO troops in Afghanistan (a recent attack on a 100- vehicle convoy was launched from Peshawar), just as it needed Pakistan as a base for fighting the Soviet Union during its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. 
 The two men also agree that the threat presented by Al Qaeda has been exaggerated. ''Its importance in the general scheme of things is greatly overstated by the West,'' Ali writes. ''It unleashes sporadic terror attacks and kills innocents, but it does not pose any serious threat to U.S. power.'' Although Riedel calls Al Qaeda ''the first truly global terrorist organization in history,'' he also says that it does not have ''a mass following in the Muslim world'' and that it is ''not on the verge of taking over even a single Muslim country.'' 
 Where the authors part company is over what to do now. Expand NATO forces in Afghanistan, Riedel says. Withdraw all NATO forces from Afghanistan, Ali counters. 
 Riedel manages to distill the essence of Al Qaeda in just 150 pages. Among other things, he notes that the Islamic fundamentalists do not hate America's values, only its policies. For Al Qaeda theorists like Ayman al-Zawahiri, ''the goal of the West today is virtually identical to that of the original Crusades a thousand years ago, which is to dominate the Islamic world.'' But Riedel's analysis creates something of a problem for him. He acknowledges that enlarging the war in Afghanistan is exactly what Al Qaeda wants, just as it wants the conflict in Iraq to continue. ''In its view, the 'bleeding wars' offer the best opportunity to defeat the United States.'' 
 Ali's book is more uneven than Riedel's. He argues that Afghans recoil against the presence of foreigners and that even Afghans who have no truck with the Taliban will support Islamic fundamentalists over NATO. But Ali's writing ranges from the poetic to polemical left-wing rant, and his detailed history of Pakistan will be hard for a non-Pakistani reader to follow. That said, his discussion of Afghanistan is highly valuable because of the questions it raises. 
 If the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan, would that present a security threat to the United States? What if the Taliban were in power but did not allow Al Qaeda to operate in their country? (Both books make clear that they are not natural allies.) And what about the ill treatment of women? Liberating the women of Afghanistan was a justification that Cherie Blair and Laura Bush gave when the war was launched in 2001. Had this been true, Ali says sarcastically, the American invasion of Afghanistan would have been a ''path-breaking conflict: the first imperial war in human history to liberate women.'' 
 Ali and Riedel agree that the United States wants and needs a stable and democratic Pakistan and Afghanistan. It's called nation building. This is a laudable goal, of course, but is it achievable? Not, they say, unless the United States is prepared for a lengthy commitment. It cannot abandon the project halfway through as it did with Afghanistan and Pakistan after the Soviets were routed. 
 America may have succeeded in nation-building in Germany and Japan after World War II, but the task in Afghanistan and Pakistan is herculean, if not Sisyphean. Ali describes Pakistan as a ''dysfunctional state,'' adding that it ''has been for almost four decades.'' Predictably, given his left-wing views, he says the United States ''bears direct responsibility.'' At the same time, he notes that Pakistan's elite and political leaders, past and present, have done almost nothing for the country's poor. Almost a third of the population live below the poverty level. The educational system is appalling, which often means that parents send their children to madrasas, where they are indoctrinated by extremist clerics. ''Corruption,'' he says, ''envelops Pakistan like a sheet of water.'' 
 Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with one of the lowest literacy rates. It is riven by ethnic divisions that make Iraq look like a rainbow coalition -- just over half are Pashtuns (including the Taliban), about a quarter are Tajiks, with Uzbeks and Hazaras making up most of the rest. Warlords have led them all. These groups fight over control of the drug trade as much as they do over religion. 
 After seven years and billions of dollars in aid, Ali argues, nation-building in Afghanistan has produced ''a puppet president dependent for his survival on foreign mercenaries'' -- Ali's language for NATO troops -- ''a corrupt and abusive police force, a 'nonfunctioning' judiciary, a burgeoning criminal layer and a deepening social and economic crisis.'' Even allowing for hyperbole, the picture in Afghanistan is not pretty. ''It beggars belief to argue that more of the same will be the answer to Afghanistan's problems,'' he writes. 
 Riedel, on the other hand, wants an enhanced American commitment to Afghanistan on many fronts -- ''military, political and economic.'' And while urging NATO to remain, he also calls for bringing in troops from Muslim countries, ''especially Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.'' 
 Which man is right, which one wrong? Whatever the case, their books are a starting point for a much-needed debate.

HEADLINE: Hartford Hears Health Care Proposal

BYLINE: By TRACY GORDON FOX

DATELINE: Hartford 

 BODY:
 IN a sign of the growing public clamor for a solution to the state's ailing health care system, more than 1,000 residents packed a downtown meeting space here Tuesday night as a new universal program that promises to cover 98 percent of Connecticut residents by 2014 was unveiled.
 The plan, presented in the lobby of Union Station in downtown, would create an extensive health insurance purchasing pool that would include state employees, retirees, people covered by state assistance and the public. It would provide all residents access to their choice of health coverage and care regardless of their employment status, age, or pre-existing conditions, according to the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut, which presented the proposal after two years of planning. 
 The proposal is one of several that state legislators will examine during this session as they work to develop a statewide health care plan. 
 The idea for the proposal took root in 1997 when a coalition of labor organizations and advocacy groups sued the for-profit Anthem Insurance Company over its merger with the nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield of Connecticut. In 2006, the group, by then calling itself the Universal Health Care Foundation, began a statewide campaign for universal health care.
 Proponents have touted the foundation's proposal as a model that could be used nationally and that would fit in with the new administration's plan to provide better and cheaper access to health care.
 During Tuesday night's gathering, the speeches were at times drowned out by the crowd's chants of ''Yes, we can!'' and ''health care now!'' The program has the support of some major Democratic leaders, including Donald E. Williams Jr., the Senate president pro tem and Christopher G. Donovan, speaker of the House.
 ''I am here on behalf of the more than 7,000 Connecticut physicians who know first hand that our health care system needs change,'' said Dr. Michael M. Deren, chairman of the Connecticut State Medical Society, which advised the foundation on its proposal. ''We believe today's proposals match many of the concerns expressed by physicians across the state. And we urge our lawmakers to embrace these concepts and make them reality.''
 Juan Figueroa, president of the foundation, said: ''This is in essence a public plan designed to compete in the private market place. You are using the purchase power of the state to create a pool.''
 The plan could save individuals and employers $1.7 billion by 2014, the foundation said. The state would need to spend an additional $950 million in 2014 when the program becomes fully operational.
 According to the proposal, enrollees in the program would be charged premiums on a sliding scale based on their ability to pay. The insurance pool would be open to individuals, small businesses, nonprofit organizations and municipalities as an alternative. Or residents could choose to stay with their existing plans.
 In addition, the program would provide a coordinated system in which each patient would have a ''medical home,'' or regular source of primary, preventive care to reduce unnecessary visits to the emergency room, according to the proposal.
 But opponents of the program say it may be unrealistic and too costly, particularly in the current economic climate. They say Connecticut officials need to look no further than their neighboring state of Massachusetts, which adopted a similar program, to see the downside.
 In its first full year, universal health coverage in Massachusetts cost the state $153.1 million more than was budgeted, according to a budget report released recently.
 ''This idea that a magic wand can be waved and at the end everyone will have health insurance is not going to happen,'' said Keith Stover, a lobbyist and spokesman for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans. 
 Mr. Stover said universal health care proposals ''are cumbersome, expensive and politically difficult.'' He said universal health care could negatively affect Connecticut residents who have jobs in the insurance industry.
 ''I think sophisticated minds on health care have reached the conclusion it is likely going to be different solutions for different uninsured populations,'' he said.
 Those arguments did not sway those who support universal heath care. They said something must be done now before more residents lose their insurance and are denied basic health care.
 ''We can't be intimidated by the insurance companies,'' Mr. Figueroa said during an interview earlier Tuesday. ''It's the 21st century. Let's face it, our economy is based a whole lot more than on the insurance industry.''
 The foundation will formally present the policy proposal to Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the State Legislature and ask for it to be voted on this session.

HEADLINE: The End of Banking as We Know It

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE concept of the financial supermarket -- the all-things-to-all-people, intergalactic, behemoth banking institution -- bit the dust last week. 
 The first death notice came on Tuesday, when Citigroup, Exhibit A for the failure of the soup-to-nuts business model, said it was dismantling. Just over a decade after the deal-maker Sanford I. Weill tried to meld insurance, investment banking, mortgage lending, credit cards and stock brokerage services, the dissolution began. 
 Citigroup, it turned out, was too big to manage, too unwieldy to succeed and too gigantic to sell to one buyer. 
 A few days later, Bank of America, another serial acquirer of troubled institutions --Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial most recently -- fessed up that its deals now need taxpayer backing. The United States government invested an additional $20 billion in Bank of America (after $25 billion last fall) and agreed to guarantee more than $100 billion of imperiled assets. 
 Clearly, the entire financial industry is in the midst of a makeover. And while no one wants to call it nationalization, perhaps we can agree on this much: The money business as we have come to know it over the last two decades -- with its lush salaries, big-swinging risk-takers and ultrathin capital cushions -- is a goner. 
 Got that? Toast. Toe-tagged.
 And that's a good thing, because maybe we can go back to a banking model that is designed to do more than simply enrich the folks at the top of the enterprise while shareholders and taxpayers absorb all the hits.
 Banking, because it oils the crucial wheels of commerce, has a special standing in our world. That will always be the case.
 But in exchange for that role, our country's leading bankers might have approached their jobs with a sense of prudence and duty. Instead, a handful of arrogant greedmeisters blew up their institutions and took our economy off the cliff along the way.
 It's too soon to say how much taxpayer money will be spent trying to rebuild banks hollowed out by bad lending practices. Paul J. Miller, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, thinks that the nation's financial system needs an additional $1 trillion in common equity to restore confidence and to get lending -- the lifeblood of a thriving and entrepreneurial free-market economy -- moving again. 
 That $1 trillion would come on top of funds disbursed through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which has tapped $700 billion, and the president-elect's stimulus plan, clocking in at $825 billion. 
 Larger capital requirements, beefed up to serve as a proper buffer when lenders misfire, will be one change facing banks when we emerge from this mess, Mr. Miller said. He thinks regulators will require banks to hold tangible common equity of 6 percent of assets. Now many institutions hold under 4 percent. 
 Such a requirement will cut into earnings, of course. Toning down the risk-taking will also reduce the profitability -- or the appearance of it -- at these institutions. 
 ''This industry made a lot of money by taking a business line with 20 percent return on assets and levering it up 30 times,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But no more. Banks are going back to being the boring companies they should be, growing roughly in line with gross domestic product.'' 
 Clearly this means that the rip-roaring performance of financial services companies and their stocks isn't likely to return anytime soon. Because these companies' earnings fed both the economy and the stock market in recent years, a more muted performance has considerable implications for investors, consumers and the economy.
 FOR example, since 1995, according to Standard & Poor's, earnings of financial concerns have accounted for 22 percent of profits, on average, among the S.& P. 500 companies. That performance is almost double that of the next largest contributor -- the energy industry. In 2003, earnings among financial companies peaked at 30 percent of total profits generated by the S.& P. 500; back in 1995, financial company earnings accounted for 18.4 percent of the total. 
 Of course, many of these earnings were ephemeral and have since turned to losses. But while the companies were reporting the profits, their stocks roared. 
 Between 2003 and the peak in 2007, the American Stock Exchange financial services index essentially doubled. At the peak, financial services companies dominated the S.& P. 500 index, accounting for 22 percent of its market value in 2007. With many of these stocks in free fall, that figure is now just 12.5 percent. 
 Will valuations on financial services stocks bounce back soon? Not in Mr. Miller's view. ''They are going to look more like the insurance industry, trading at book value or 1.5 times book,'' he said. ''That is, if you are really good.''
 For financial services workers, of course, the inevitable downsizing has already begun. But there will be more. ''The industry was way too big; too many people were not producing anything,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Jobs will be lost and not replaced. And financial industry salaries won't be anywhere close to where they have been.''
 The bright side is that all those displaced financial services professionals can now set their sights on doing something, well, truly useful. 
 Still, this adjustment will be painful for all those who have to carve out new careers, as well as for New York and other places these companies call home. 
 Finally, what will a humbled financial services industry mean for consumers? Higher borrowing costs, Mr. Miller said. 
 ''The leverage that these companies were using allowed them to lower their rates,'' he said. ''Rates have to go higher for the banks to operate in a safe and sound manner and make money.''
 Credit is also likely to remain tight, in Mr. Miller's opinion. A result is that consumer spending won't recover to bubble levels. 
 ''It is going to be difficult to get credit, and that is something the system has to adapt to,'' Mr. Miller said. ''That is where the government is going to have to step in and replace that debt growth to make sure there is a smooth transition.'' 
 In other words, Barack Obama's first stimulus plan is not likely to be his last. 
 When a driving economic force takes a big dive, the ripples are far-reaching. Change is painful, there is no doubt. But American business can be awfully good at reinventing itself when it needs to. 
 And does it ever need to now.

HEADLINE: Christie Lays Out Theme For Fellow Republicans

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: HACKENSACK 

 BODY:
 LAST Tuesday morning, just before Governor Jon S. Corzine delivered his State of the State address, Assembly Republicans met in caucus to hear a talk about the good old days when it was still morning in America for the Republican Party, and Ronald Reagan was their president.
 That evening, when Republicans met again, at the Bergen County party headquarters here, some were convinced they had heard echoes of the Great Communicator as they listened to Christopher J. Christie, the former United States attorney for New Jersey who recently filed papers to enter the race for the Republican nomination for governor. 
 ''I think we have someone who is a lot like Reagan again,'' said Assemblyman Scott T. Rumana, a North Jersey Republican.
 Mr. Christie, 46, is still in the honeymoon glow of his candidacy. He said he would not offer specifics about his positions on the nettlesome issues facing the state -- from gay marriage to school funding to the state's $2.1 billion budget gap -- until his formal announcement later this month.
 But in his half-hour talk to a standing- room-only audience of some 250 cheering Republicans on Tuesday, Mr. Christie sounded the theme that is certain to be one of the building blocks of his campaign -- the idea that the man who puts criminals behind bars can get things done.
 ''There were people who said the problem of corruption in this state was intractable, and that not only could nobody make a difference, but nobody cared,'' he said, speaking to his rapt audience without notes. ''The 130-plus elected and appointed officials who now have the opportunity to have federally subsidized housing at the expense of all of you now have had a very clear lesson that justice is for everyone.'' 
 He added, ''So when I look to the future now and people ask me, what kind of governor would you be, I answer, look at the kind of U.S. attorney I was, and that's the kind of governor I would be.''
 Mr. Christie, who built a record successfully prosecuting dozens of public officials involved in corruption cases, may appear to be the choice of the state Republican establishment looking back with nostalgia to the days when its party seemed on the ascendancy. But his path to the nomination, let alone the governorship, is far from clear. He faces two very conservative opponents for the June primary, and conservatives have a history in New Jersey of winning the June primaries, when the most motivated Republican voters -- meaning the most conservative ones -- often turn out in force, only to see their candidate lose in the fall.
 That scenario played out most recently in 2001, when Bret D. Schundler, the more conservative candidate, defeated Representative Bob Franks for the Republican nomination for governor, despite the endorsements Mr. Franks received from 19 of the state's 21 Republican county chairmen.
 Mr. Schundler, true to the pattern, went on to lose to James E. McGreevey, the Democrat, in the general election.
 One of Mr. Christie's opponents in this primary is Steve Lonegan, who established his conservative credentials as mayor of Bogota by saying he would refuse to perform civil union ceremonies for gay couples. He also leads an anti-tax group, Americans for Prosperity, and has some statewide recognition from his unsuccessful campaign for the nomination four years ago.
 Another Republican in the race is Richard A. Merkt, a seven-term assemblyman from Morris County, who has pledged to reduce the weight of state government, in part by abolishing the Council on Affordable Housing, which enforces the state's low-income mandate. Mayor Brian D. Levine of Franklin Township is also exploring a bid for the Republican nomination.
 Even if Mr. Christie makes it past the primary, the tough economy will present another challenge to his candidacy, said Ben Dworkin, Director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.
 ''The big question about Chris Christie is, will he have something more than corruption to talk about?'' Mr. Dworkin said in an interview. ''Talking corruption is like McCain taking about earmarks -- it's part of the problem, but it's not the whole thing, so he is going to need specifics. Because Jon Corzine is going to go out and hit on themes that's it's a lousy time to be governor but he's making the tough decisions, he's telling people where he is going to cut and that's leadership.''
 But for now, Mr. Christie clearly has the support of the party leaders in Bergen County, where Republicans have been pushed out of nearly every important office in recent years.
 ''Taxes and the economy are the most important issues with our members,'' Robert B. Yudin, the party chairman, said in an interview. ''The No. 2 concern is corruption, and it's not a distant No. 2 -- it's very close to No. 1. So in Chris Christie I think we have an example of someone who could be very, very helpful to the Republican slate in Bergen County.''
 Mr. Christie was born in Newark. When he was a toddler, his family moved to Livingston, where his father, now retired, worked as an accountant and his mother worked for the Livingston School Board.
 He became a Republican at 14, he said in an interview, not because of some burning political or cultural issue, but because a young assemblyman named Thomas H. Kean visited his junior high school class. 
 ''He was a Republican, so I was going to be a Republican,'' Mr. Christie said, in an interview before his speech. Mr. Kean went on to be one of the state's most popular governors.
 After graduating from the University of Delaware and Seton Hall University law school, Mr. Christie joined a politically well-connected law firm, where he quickly rose to partner. He came to the attention of the current Bush administration as a tireless fund-raiser for the president's first race for the White House. The announcement that President Bush had appointed Mr. Christie to the United States attorney's job in 2002 met with derision from Democrats and members of the news media on the grounds that he had no law enforcement or prosecutorial experience -- no experience, the critics held, beyond party fund-raising.
 Mr. Christie has said he will avail himself of public campaign funding to run against a wealthy incumbent governor with an unlimited personal campaign budget.
 ''I'm going to be drastically outspent no matter what I do,'' he said, ''so it doesn't really matter in the end.''

HEADLINE: Why the Arabs Splinter Over Gaza

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon 

 BODY:
-- On Thursday, nearly three weeks into Israel's war on Hamas, reporters gathered here to ask whether the Lebanese president would be attending a proposed Arab summit meeting to address the issue. 
 The answer, delivered by the Lebanese information minister, Tarek Mitri, was that Lebanon would follow ''Arab consensus'' in deciding whether to attend.
 No one laughed, but the comment could have passed for black humor. Arab leaders remain cripplingly divided on how to respond to the crisis, which has left more than 1,100 dead in Gaza. Despite a rush of diplomatic meetings -- two simultaneous ones on Friday in Qatar and Kuwait, and two more expected next week -- there was still no agreement on convening the Arab League, the body that is meant to bring Arabs together on issues of mutual concern. 
 In the end, the Lebanese president, Michel Suleiman -- having struggled to find a balance between the conflicting demands of his country's own factions -- attended the meeting in Doha, Qatar, on Friday. But leaders of three of the most important Arab countries -- Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- refused to attend, and so the meeting did not qualify as a league summit and only underscored the region's divisions. 
 ''The boat is sinking,'' said Amr Moussa of Egypt, the Arab League's secretary general, in unusually dire comments during a news conference in Kuwait, where foreign ministers met Friday afternoon. ''I'm very frustrated regarding the stance of Arab countries.''
 The inability of Arab governments to take any collective or decisive action on Gaza is rooted in two basic trends, said Rami Khoury, the director of the Issam Fares public policy institute in Beirut. Most Arab regimes are terrified of Islamist movements like Hamas, which represent the greatest threat to their legitimacy. Many, including Egypt and Jordan, face challenges at home from their own popular versions of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas's ideological parent. Most Arab leaders are also reluctant to provoke the United States and Israel (with which Egypt and Jordan have peace treaties).
 For those reasons, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have refused to endorse a meeting of the Arab League. They do not want to be embarrassed by figures like Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, who -- like his Iranian allies -- has won points with an angry Arab public by supporting Hamas and inveighing against the passivity of other Arab leaders. 
 On Friday, Mr. Assad took his attacks a step further at the Doha gathering, deriding the Saudi-sponsored proposal for a peace plan with Israel as ''already dead,'' and calling for all Israeli embassies in Arab countries to be closed. Soon after he made his comments, Qatar and Mauritania announced they were cutting their economic and diplomatic ties with Israel, in another sign that countries like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, who support a diplomatic approach with Israel, could become isolated if the violence does not end soon. 
 Mr. Assad's broadside was also a reminder that the perennial fractiousness of Arab politics goes deeper than disagreements on politics and religion. Syria's differences with Saudi Arabia, which stem from Syria's ties with Iran and its suspected role in an assassination in Lebanon in 2005, have been exacerbated by a personal feud between the Saudi king and Mr. Assad that began with Mr. Assad publicly insulting the king two years ago and is likely to be worsened by the bitter accusations of the past few weeks. Even where two countries share the same ideology and politics, personal differences between leaders have sometimes maintained a rift. Syria and Iraq were ruled for decades by the Baathist leaders Hafez al-Assad (Bashar's father) and Saddam Hussein, whose rivalry kept their countries bitterly divided.
 ''One of the problems with Arab politics is that it remains tribal and personal and that is why Arabs cannot agree about anything,'' said Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University in Beirut. 
 Yet today's inter-Arab tensions are not just about Gaza, or relations with the West, or even personal disputes. Many Arab leaders believe that Iran is aiming to become the dominant power in Middle East, and is using the Palestinian issue to batter its rivals through Hamas, its client. 
 ''What's happening in Gaza is dangerous on its own, but also dangerous in its implications,'' said a Jordanian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue. ''Iran is interested in prolonging the violence, because that would help it to mobilize the Arab street and turn people here against their governments.''
 That broad political threat to moderate Western-leaning governments may outweigh the sectarian anxieties provoked by Iran's Shiite theology as its national power rises. Iran, after all, has now helped empower a Sunni Islamist movement, Hamas, as well as a Shiite Islamist movement, Hezbollah, and together the movements can claim a popular following across theArab world. 
 To many on both sides of the Arab divide, the battle in Gaza is a kind of replay of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. Then, as now, Israel mounted vastly more destructive attacks in response to the Islamists' launching of rockets into populated Israeli areas. In a sense, the strategy worked: the Israel-Lebanon border has been quiet ever since. Even after the Gaza war began, Hezbollah restrained its militia from any attacks, knowing it could lose much of its political support within Lebanon if it were to draw the country into another devastating war. Now Israel, in Gaza, clearly hopes to limit Hamas's future military options as well, mainly through agreements that could choke off its weapons supply network.
 Yet the 2006 war strengthened Hezbollah politically, and the group now seems likely to win a majority in the parliamentary elections later this year, a pivotal development. Many people in Lebanon fear that the current war could bring similar new strength to Hamas, even as it inflicts political damage on its foes in the Arab world. 
 ''It may take some time, but Hamas will take over the West Bank,'' said Sarkis Naoum, a political columnist for the Beirut newspaper Al Nahar. 
 That, Mr. Naoum added, would put Hamas's patrons, Syria and Iran, in a much stronger position vis-a-vis the other Arab countries. It may also -- not coincidentally -- put Syria and Iran in a stronger position vis-a-vis the United States, should Barack Obama follow through on his proposal to talk directly with them.
 Some Western-leaning Arabs fear that Lebanon, with its welter of competing factions, could be an indicator of where the broader Arab world is heading. The president, Mr. Suleiman, has struggled to steer a neutral course between the country's two major political camps, one allied with the West, the other with Iran. But his efforts to find an ''Arab consensus'' have become more and more difficult.
 On Thursday, Hezbollah arranged street demonstrations, as if to remind Mr. Suleiman who wears the pants in Lebanon. Mr. Suleiman got the message. He got on a plane and went to Doha, alongside the Syrian president and the leader of the Hamas military wing.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Faith In Obama, Mixed With Patience

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama is riding a powerful wave of optimism into the White House, with Americans confident he can turn the economy around but prepared to give him years to deal with the crush of problems he faces starting Tuesday, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
While hopes for the new president are extraordinarily high, the poll found, expectations for what Mr. Obama will actually be able to accomplish appear to have been tempered by the scale of the nation's problems at home and abroad.
The findings suggest that Mr. Obama has achieved some success with his effort, which began with his victory speech in Chicago in November, to gird Americans for a slow economic recovery and difficult years ahead after a campaign that generated striking enthusiasm and high hopes for change. 
Most Americans said they did not expect real progress in improving the economy, reforming the health care system or ending the war in Iraq -- three of the central promises of Mr. Obama's campaign -- for at least two years. The poll found that two-thirds of respondents think the recession will last two years or longer.
As the nation prepares for a transfer of power and the inauguration of its 44th president, Mr. Obama's stature with the American public stands in sharp contrast to that of President Bush.
Mr. Bush is leaving office with just 22 percent of Americans offering a favorable view of how he handled the eight years of his presidency, a record low, and firmly identified with the economic crisis Mr. Obama is inheriting. More than 80 percent of respondents said the nation was in worse shape today than it was five years ago.
By contrast, 79 percent were optimistic about the next four years under Mr. Obama, a level of good will for a new chief executive that exceeds that measured for any of the past five incoming presidents. And it cuts across party lines: 58 percent of the respondents who said they voted for Mr. Obama's opponent in the general election, Senator John McCain of Arizona, said they were optimistic about the country in an Obama administration.
''Obama is not a miracle worker, but I am very optimistic, I really am,'' Phyllis Harden, 63, an independent from Easley, S.C., who voted for Mr. Obama, said in an interview after participating in the poll.
''It's going to take a couple of years at least to improve the economy,'' Ms. Harden added. ''I think anyone who is looking for a 90-day turnaround is delusional.''
Politically, Mr. Obama enjoys a strong foundation of support as he enters what is surely to be a tough and challenging period, working with Congress to swiftly pass a huge and complicated economic package.
His favorable rating, at 60 percent, is the highest it has been since the Times/CBS News poll began asking about him. Overwhelming majorities say they think that Mr. Obama will be a good president, that he will bring real change to Washington, and that he will make the right decisions on the economy, Iraq, dealing with the war in the Middle East and protecting the country from terrorist attacks. Over 70 percent said they approved of his cabinet selections.
What is more, Mr. Obama's effort to use this interregnum between Election Day and Inauguration Day to present himself as a political moderate (he might use the word ''pragmatist'') appears to be working. In this latest poll, 40 percent described the president-elect's ideology as liberal, a 17-point drop from just before the election.
''I think those of us who voted for McCain are going to be a lot happier with Obama than the people who voted for him,'' Valerie Schlink, 46, a Republican from Valparaiso, Ind., said in an interview after participating in the poll. ''A lot of the things he said he would do, like pulling out the troops in 16 months and giving tax cuts to those who make under $200,000, I think he now sees are going to be a lot tougher than he thought and that the proper thing to do is stay more towards the middle and ease our way into whatever has to be done.
''It can't all be accomplished immediately.''
While the public seems prepared to give Mr. Obama time, Americans clearly expect the country to be a different place when he finishes his term at the end of 2012.
The poll found that 75 percent expected the economy to be stronger in four years than it is today, and 75 percent said Mr. Obama would succeed in creating a significant number of jobs, while 59 percent said he would cut taxes for the middle class.
The survey found that 61 percent of respondents said things would be better in five years; last April, just 39 percent expressed a similar sentiment.
The telephone survey of 1,112 adults was conducted Jan. 11-15. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll suggests some of the cross-currents Mr. Obama is navigating as he prepares to take office, and offers some evidence about why he has retooled some of his positions during this period.
For example, 60 percent said it was a good idea to raise taxes on people making over $200,000 to expand health insurance coverage, as Mr. Obama proposed during the campaign. But support for that idea dropped when voters were asked if they would still back the tax increase if it would hurt the economy. And in recent weeks, he has signaled that he might delay his campaign pledge to roll back tax cuts on the wealthy put in place under Mr. Bush.
Similarly, support for decreasing or removing all troops from Iraq slipped when respondents were asked if they would still support that policy even if it resulted in Iraq becoming a base for terrorists, an argument raised by Mr. Bush in calling for a sustained troop presence there.
The poll found overwhelming support for a large stimulus package to rescue the economy. Americans were divided, though, about whether Mr. Obama's spending plan was too big, as some Republicans in Congress have argued, or not big enough, as some liberal economists argue. In the poll, 23 percent said his plan went too far, while 28 percent said it did not go far enough.
The poll also demonstrated one clear way the economic decline was molding American opinion. Given a choice between stimulating the economy and protecting the environment, 58 percent of Americans said it was more important to stimulate the economy, compared with 33 percent who chose protecting the environment. In April 2007, 36 percent said it was more important to stimulate the economy, compared with 52 percent who chose the environment.
In addition, 53 percent said they would oppose an increase in the federal tax on gasoline, even if it was intended to help reduce dependence on foreign oil.
By a number of measures, Mr. Obama appears to enjoy more good will from the American public than did his recent predecessors as he prepares to assume the presidency.
For example, 68 percent of respondents said Mr. Obama would be a very good or good president. At this point after the disputed 2000 presidential election, just 43 percent of respondents said that about Mr. Bush.
There were signs of distress about the economy: 60 percent of respondents said that they were very or somewhat concerned about being able to pay their home costs, and 39 percent said that the decline in home prices had affected them personally.
Slightly over half said that their household income provided them with just enough money to pay their bills.

HEADLINE: In Step With History, Golden Eagles Soar

BYLINE: By FRAN SILVERMAN

DATELINE: TRUMBULL 

 BODY:
 THEY have marched down the Red Carpet in Hollywood. They have won state championships. And they have stacked up trophies from competitions throughout the nation. But nothing can compare to Tuesday, they say, when the Trumbull High School Golden Eagle Marching Band will be parading down Pennsylvania Avenue for President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration.
 ''There are many parades we have to do, but for many people this is the first parade they are really excited to do,'' said Dan Connolly, 17, a senior at Trumbull High School and the band's drum major.
 Though it is not the first time a Trumbull High School band has marched in an inauguration -- Golden Eagle students played for George W. Bush's first inaugural ceremony in 2001 -- students say the historical significance of the nation's first African-American president makes this event unique. 
 Dan was such an avid supporter of Mr. Obama that during the campaign, he said, his mother was starting to get frustrated by how much time he was spending on the Internet reading up on the race.
 ''This has a whole different significance because it is for someone he believes in,'' said Myra Connolly, about her son's trip to Washington.
 ''To be there on his Inauguration Day,'' Dan said, ''will be incredible.''
 Trumbull, a suburban town of about 34,000, is a Republican enclave. It was one of the few towns in Fairfield County where George W. Bush won in 2000 and 2004. Its population is overwhelmingly white, with African-Americans making up 1.9 percent of the total. But in this election, Mr. Obama closed the gap between Democrats and Republicans, losing to the Republican John McCain by just under 200 votes.
 Many students in the marching band are, like Dan, enthusiastic about Mr. Obama.
 ''He represents change, a time for a new beginning,'' said Nicole Tallian, 17, a junior who plays the flute. ''My mom is a huge supporter of his. She asked me if she could go with us.''
 Richard Schlatter, 17, who plays tenor sax, said he will be witnessing history. ''People will ask what have you done in high school and I'm going to say I was in Barack Obama's inaugural parade.''
 Jenine Entwistle, 16, who is the drum captain, said she isn't that politically involved, but that she was moved by the historic nature of the event and that the band will be representing Connecticut.
 ''I've been playing the flute since the fourth grade and my whole marching band career has been fun, but this will definitely be memorable,'' Jenine said. ''I hope we get to see him when we march by.'' 
 The inaugural trip has been the talk of the town since band members were notified on Dec. 6 that they had been one of about 90 selected from among 1,300 applications.
 ''When I learned that the band was going to be picked, I couldn't talk for five minutes,'' said Tom Foth, a band parent. ''We thought it was a longshot.''
 The invitation capped a season of high-profile events for the band. In the past two months alone, the band has participated in the Hollywood Christmas parade and appeared on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' after collecting more than 3,000 winter coats for the poor.
 But nothing compares to the trip to Washington. It has brought the band unprecedented attention from all quarters, including the news media.
 ''I'm so jealous of the drum major this year,'' said Nick Ferreri, who graduated last year after serving as the band's drum major. Referring to Dan, this year's drum major, during a visit to a recent band practice, he said: ''He gets to walk by and salute the president. I'm amazed by it. It's cool.''
 Now a freshman at Boston University studying physics, Mr. Ferreri said he was hoping the band might invite some alumni to Washington to help out, like, well, him? 
 At one recent practice, Peter Horton, the band director, asked, ''Is there anyone who hasn't talked with the press yet?'' When a few hands went up, he sent the students outside the room to share their comments with a local newspaper reporter.
 Mr. Horton said the news media attention doesn't distract them though.
 ''The kids take it in stride,'' Mr. Horton said. ''They are hams. When it comes time to play, they perk right up.''
 Mr. Horton, 59, said the team's national reputation and recommendations from state officials helped improve their chances of being chosen. In past years, the band has marched in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Citrus Bowl and the New Orleans Mardi Gras Parade and has won numerous competitions including first place in the state Musical Arts Conference in 2007. 
 As soon as the band, which is an incorporated nonprofit organization, learned the inauguration committee had accepted its application, parents swung into action trying to secure transportation and hotel rooms. But finding a hotel with enough rooms for 101 musicians, 25 color guard members, a drum major and parent chaperones proved difficult. The band finally found a hotel in Delaware where they had to book rooms for three nights. To get to Washington, which is three hours away from Delaware, the band will have to leave before dawn in time to get through security checks. The cost of the trip is going to top $55,000 and parents and students are working to cover costs through fund-raisers and corporate sponsorships. The economic downturn has slowed donations, parents said, and the band has raised only half of what it needs for the trip.
 ''A lot of our corporate donors are not able to give this year,'' Mr. Foth said. ''Companies that are facing layoffs are uncomfortable making donations.''
 The school is hoping to keep student costs to $100 each. Mr. Foth said the band would continue to take donations after the event to pay off the total costs.
 The band practices every day and after school on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays -- sometimes eight hours on a Saturday alone. This has been their regular routine. But now since they were picked to march in the inaugural parade, Mr. Horton, a Greenwich resident who has been directing the Golden Eagles in Trumbull for 20 years, said he has been preparing the students for every aspect of the day, including the hurry-up-and-wait delays before the march, the need for valve oil in case the instruments freeze up, and the long security checks before they finally get to hit the street. He has also been gently reminding them of what to say and what not to say when they are surrounded by security, national figures and cameras.
 One recent morning as the band gathered in the freezing temperatures of the high school's garage where they practice -- students and teachers like to refer to the Golden Eagles as the best garage band in the country -- the details of the trip bubbled up among the talk between students.
 ''I'm nervous,'' Jessie Delvecchio, 15, a 10th-grade clarinet player, said to Abby Whitmoyer, a ninth-grade trumpeter. ''I am too,'' Abby said. 
 Over in the flute section, Nicole was swapping comments with Jacqueline Hesse, 15, a sophomore, about security measures.
 ''Military people have to escort us to the bathroom,'' Nicole said. 
 The girls wrinkled their noses.
 ''I'm worried about friends opening their mouths and getting us sent home because they are saying stupid things,'' said Eliza Durfee, 16, a sophomore.
 The band is preparing three pieces for its march: ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' ''Espana'' and ''Inaugural,'' a special inaugural piece written for the band when it marched for George W. Bush's swearing-in ceremony.
 On this morning two weeks before the event, the students get right to work. After some warm-ups led by Dan, Mr. Horton asks the students to stand.
 ''This is what is going to happen when you go down Pennsylvania Avenue to the reviewing stand and past the president,'' he told them. ''Roll into the 'Inaugural' and 'Battle Hymn.' The whole street has to be music.''
 As the drummers in the back of the room start their beat, and the front rows of students put their instruments to their lips, they all start to bend their knees up and down, ever so slightly moving in place.
 ''And we are marching, we are marching in time,'' Mr. Horton told them. ''We are all marching.''

 For most of the last eight years, and indeed for much of the last three decades, American liberals have been on the defensive -- so much so that many have renamed themselves ''progressives'' as if to ward off the taint of their beleaguered past. Political books from the left have flourished since 2001, but almost all of them have been critiques of the Bush administration, interrupted briefly and halfheartedly by the Kerry campaign of 2004. But with astonishing speed during the 2008 campaign, and largely in response to the rise of Barack Obama, the liberal-progressives have begun to mount a full-throated revival. 
 In the absence so far of an actual Democratic presidency, hopeful liberals have focused on the extraordinary success of Obama's campaign and on a highly optimistic interpretation of his rhetoric. Three of the books discussed in this review were written and published (with great speed) before or just after the election, and the other is a recently republished agenda for liberals that first appeared shortly after the 2006 Congressional elections. Together, they offer a portrait of how liberals have come prospectively to envision the Obama presidency as a transformative moment in American history. 
 For sheer speed and competence, the most impressive of these recent books is Evan Thomas's '' 'Long Time Coming,' '' compiled from the reporting of the political writers of Newsweek (a magazine for which I occasionally write). A perceptive, smoothly written and generally fair-minded account of both presidential campaigns, it is, nevertheless, a contribution to the creation of the superhero image that has surrounded Obama over the last six months. In describing his important speech on race in March 2008, for example, the Newsweek writers (who are far from alone) describe a ''tour de force,'' the ''sort of speech that only Barack Obama could give.'' Afterward, ''he found everyone in tears -- his wife, his friends, hardened campaign aides. Only Obama seemed cool and detached.'' 
 Reporters following McCain, most of whom appear to like and admire the candidate, focus nevertheless on the lurching, ad hoc and often self-destructive quality of the Republican campaign. They write with slightly disguised scorn of the reckless choice of Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, and about McCain's own seemingly desperate efforts to find an issue, any issue, that might work. The Democrats had enormous advantages entering the 2008 campaign, and almost any candidate they might have chosen would probably have defeated the Republicans. But Newsweek makes a persuasive case both for the exceptional quality of the Obama campaign and for the ways in which it displayed skills that will be of value in the White House. 
 In many respects, ''The Plan,'' by Rahm Emanuel and Bruce Reed, a blueprint for a revived progressive agenda, is the most interesting of the recent policy books, largely because one of its authors is soon to be the White House chief of staff. In other ways, it has a dated, almost quaint, quality -- a book written in 2005, first published in 2006 and quickly republished in 2008 without revision and thus without reference to the epochal financial crisis that will undoubtedly dominate the first years of the Obama presidency. It includes a de rigueur critique of the Bush administration's policies and an intelligent, if predictable, laundry list of policies that a Democratic presidency might make possible. Among them are the unachieved Clinton-era idea of mandatory national service, a watered-down proposal for universal health care for children only, a plan for supporting college costs for middle-class families. It promotes ''fiscal responsibility and an end to corporate welfare as we know it,'' which largely translates into repealing the Bush tax cuts and strengthening corporate and financial regulation. It proposes a more multilateral approach to the war on terror and a ''hybrid economy that cuts America's gasoline consumption in half over the next decade.'' Obama, of course, has proposed bolder plans -- among them universal access to health care for all citizens and an expanded vision of a green economy with a more aggressive timetable (proposals that may have rough sledding during a historic recession). Emanuel and Reed strongly support the controversial Clinton welfare reform of 1996, which the authors call ''the most successful social policy experiment in a generation.'' They reject what they consider the sterile choice between ''more risk, more reward'' (the conservative prescription) and ''no risk, just reward'' (the liberal prescription). Their prescription -- which they call ''a new theory based on old American values'' -- is ''more responsibility, less risk,'' and ''more work, more reward.'' What has been lost, they fear, is ''the quiet unshakable faith in progress'' that shaped American hopes for generations. 
 In the turbulent years since the publication of Emanuel and Reed's book, a sudden and powerful shift has occurred in the goals of hopeful liberals. The financial catastrophe of the last year has strengthened their belief in the need to challenge the apparently discredited ''trickle-down'' economic orthodoxy that has dominated much of the last three decades and to create an economy that strengthens the working and middle classes. The importance of a ''bottom-up'' economy is the central argument of John R. Talbott, a former investment banker turned writer and commentator. His faith in Obama's commitment to Talbot's own economic beliefs is almost without limit. The book weaves excerpts from Obama's speeches and writings into an implausibly specific and coherent set of policies that Talbot insists are the core of the new president's agenda. It includes many of the same proposals that liberals and progressives have been promoting for years, but at its heart is Talbot's belief that Obama will fundamentally transform economic life to serve the needs of the less affluent majority of American citizens. 
 Robert Kuttner, an accomplished economics writer and a founding editor of the liberal magazine The American Prospect, is more skeptical. Obama, he argues, is a ''work in progress,'' at times an embodiment of the most expansive progressive hopes, at other points a moderate centrist moving cautiously and politically through the thickets of his time. Kuttner sees great potential in Obama's leadership and rhetorical skills, but he worries that he will not act boldly enough to attack a financial crisis that has grown considerably more serious since his book went to press. Kuttner's call for a $600 billion recovery program (startling at the time of its writing) now seems at the low end of the likely response, as he himself would probably now admit. But he is equally concerned about the longer-term future. That future will, he argues, require a major restructuring of the American financial markets through a significantly enhanced federal regulatory regime and ''structural reforms in labor-market and trade policy as well as health and energy.'' And it will require not just a short-term stimulus but a long-term investment in institutions and infrastructure. The current crisis will, he insists, require a truly transformative presidency -- no less transformative than the New Deal. His thoughtful, hopeful and apprehensive book is a particularly valuable guide to what the progressive left hopes to see in the Obama presidency. 
 Running through almost all the recent literature from liberal-progressive writers in 2008 is a long-deferred concern of the left: inequality. Thirty-five years ago, the American economy -- for decades before a great engine of growth and an effective vehicle of upward mobility -- began to move onto a different path. Instead of providing growth more or less evenly across the population, it began to concentrate income and wealth in the upper brackets. This was not a product solely, or even primarily, of government policy, but part of a global shift in the ways markets worked. But American public policy through most of the subsequent years not only tolerated, but actively promoted, this growing inequality. Over time, the new concentration of wealth came to be seen by its beneficiaries, and by much of the political world, as a great source of investment and growth; and those who challenged that claim were often accused of ''class warfare.'' 
 The progressives who have hitched their wagons to Barack Obama's star want many things from him. But among the most important of their hopes is for a shift in how wealth and income are distributed. There are many vehicles available for pursuing this goal -- tax policy, minimum wage, public support for education and health care, and a wide range of other programs eagerly supported by newly mobilized liberals. But undoing the forces that have created a generation of mounting inequality will not easily give way to incremental solutions. One of the great triumphs of Obama's campaign and election is that he has made it possible to believe that such accomplishments are within the nation's reach. One of the great dangers of his victory is that it may have created expectations far beyond what any one man, or even any one nation, can realistically hope to achieve.

HEADLINE: The Past as a Guide for an Inaugural Address That Frames the Moment

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On a family outing to the Lincoln Memorial last weekend, President-elect Barack Obama was starkly reminded by an unlikely adviser of what is at stake in his Inaugural Address.
As his family studied Lincoln's inaugural words, carved into the memorial's stone, they began discussing Mr. Obama's own inaugural speech, he told CNN. His 10-year-old daughter, Malia, then turned to him and blurted out: ''First African-American president. Better be good.''
That special burden just adds weight to a task that is already daunting -- following his eloquent predecessors as he marks the peaceful transfer of power on Tuesday with an Inaugural Address, only the 56th in the nation's history.
Mr. Obama has called Lincoln's second inaugural speech ''intimidating'' and John F. Kennedy's ''extraordinary.'' (Otherwise, he has said, ''Some of the others are not so inspiring.'') 
But since his 2004 keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Obama has shown that he, too, is comfortable in the inaugural idiom. He writes with sweep, clarity and an eye toward history and in a style that Bob Shrum, a longtime Democratic consultant, calls a rare combination of the rhetorical and conversational.
Mr. Obama, who rose to prominence on his power as a speechmaker, has discussed his Inaugural Address with a certain detachment. He and his chief speechwriter, Jonathan Favreau, have been trading drafts back and forth for almost two months.
His primary goal, Mr. Obama says, is to define this moment in history.
''I think that the main task for me in an inauguration speech, and I think this is true for my presidency generally, is to try to capture as best I can the moment that we are in,'' he told ABC News, adding that he would explain the ''crossroads'' where the country finds itself.
After that, he said, he wants to ''project confidence that if we take the right measures, that we can once again be that country, that beacon for the world.''
Many inaugural speeches follow a somewhat classic formula of laying out the challenges before the nation and calling on basic American ideals to meet them.
But historians have high expectations for Mr. Obama, who, they say, is especially adept at framing the moment and reaching for a larger context.
''That's one of the secrets of his success, rhetorically,'' said Stephen Lucas, a professor of communication arts at the University of Wisconsin. ''He seems very focused on the purpose of the moment.''
His victory speech on election night in Grant Park in Chicago provides a good example: ''It's been a long time coming,'' Mr. Obama said, ''but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.''
''Obama loves defining the moment, setting the scene,'' said Mr. Shrum, who penned the ''dream shall never die'' speech for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1980. ''That's what the great Inaugural Addresses, the ones that last, do.''
Mr. Obama's primary themes are unity and hope, and they recur frequently, as does a call to service and a reliance on American ideals.
''He goes back to those fundamental themes of American greatness and the fundamental principles, like fairness,'' said Shel Leanne, author of ''Say It Like Obama,'' a primer on his rhetorical technique. ''He always tries to create common ground. He immediately starts building a bridge.''
Mr. Obama takes office in the first transition of power since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and it will be the first wartime transition in 40 years. Despite the nation's economic woes, Theodore C. Sorensen, who was John Kennedy's speechwriter and longtime adviser, said Mr. Obama should keep his focus on the country's international standing.
''That Inaugural Address is going to define his presidency in the eyes of the rest of the world,'' Mr. Sorensen said. It should be ''bipartisan in tone and global in reach,'' he added, while leaving prescriptions for most domestic matters, like health care, for an address to Congress next month.
''If I were to fault him,'' Mr. Sorensen volunteered, ''I would say that occasionally his sentences and words are not always short.''
Analysts said Mr. Obama needed to create a sense of urgency, especially about the economy, to bring the public along with him and make Congress feel compelled to work with him.
Some of his tasks are inherently contradictory: give a realistic assessment about the perils facing the country without portraying them as overwhelming; raise hopes and instill confidence without overpromising what he might be able to accomplish; and represent the change he has promised without insulting his predecessor.
''He doesn't want to create the feeling that he will magically solve all of these pretty difficult problems right away,'' said Ted Widmer, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and now a historian at Brown. ''At the same time he does want to create the feeling that the problems are ultimately solvable.''
In a recent speech at George Mason University that may prefigure the style and substance of the inaugural, Mr. Obama gave a bleak assessment of the economy but found seeds of hope within the American spirit.
''Now, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it is not beyond our ability to solve,'' he said. ''Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for future greatness.''
Mr. Obama also posited the duality of his job with near-inaugural sweep in his speech in Grant Park.
''The road ahead will be long,'' he said. ''Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you, we as a people will get there.''
Some analysts say that Mr. Obama's best speeches are not remembered for specific lines but for their power over his audience.
''Not too many of us can spin out a quick Barack Obama sound bite that we've all memorized,'' Mr. Widmer said. ''But we all do feel mesmerized by his speeches. We do something that's completely uncharacteristic for Americans -- we listen to the entire speech.''
Mr. Obama's speech in March in Philadelphia on race, for instance, was not instantly quotable, but was memorable for the fact of it and praised by supporters as honest and nuanced; it was one of the most watched political speeches on YouTube.
''We all stopped to listen to him as he explained this extremely complicated, sensitive topic,'' Mr. Widmer said. ''It was a teaching moment. He's been unusually good at that. Not all presidents are good teachers, but he has shown great potential for that.''
And on Inauguration Day, many willing students will be listening.

HEADLINE: The Edge of the Mystery

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai, who covers politics for the magazine, is the author of ''The Argument: Inside the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics.''

 BODY:
Weeks before the election of 1960, Norman Mailer, already an accomplished novelist, sat down to write his first major work of political journalism, an essay for Esquire in which he argued that only John F. Kennedy could save America. In an unruly, haunting and somewhat self-indulgent piece running nearly 14,000 words, Mailer submitted that a mechanized America, with its bland and automated politics, was on the verge of stamping out individuality and randomness and artistic spirit; the only kind of leader who could rescue it, who could sweep in an era of what Mailer called ''existential'' politics, was a ''hipster'' hero -- someone who welcomed risk and adventure, someone who sought out new experience, both for himself and for the country. In Kennedy, Mailer saw a man of ''not quite describable intensity, a suggestion of dry pent heat perhaps,'' with ''the eyes of a mountaineer'' and a penchant for risking his life. 
 ''Indeed, there could be no politics which gave warmth to one's body until the country had recovered its imagination, its pioneer lust for the unexpected and incalculable,'' Mailer wrote. ''It was the changes that might come afterward'' -- meaning after Kennedy's election -- ''on which one could put one's hope. With such a man in office the myth of the nation would again be engaged, and the fact that he was Catholic would shiver a first existential vibration of consciousness into the mind of the White Protestant.'' 
 As it happened, ''Superman Comes to the Supermarket,'' as Mailer's article was titled, had more of an impact on magazine journalism than it did on the politics of the era. With a few clicks -- O.K., more than a few -- on his electric typewriter, Mailer essentially created a new genre for a generation of would-be literary philosophers covering politics (most of whom, sadly, lacked for anything approaching Mailer's gift for social commentary). By 1963, Mailer and other idealists were crushed to discover that Kennedy was in fact a fairly conventional and pragmatic politician, more Harvard Yard than Fortress of Solitude. In an introduction to a collection of his essays and letters to Kennedy titled ''The Presidential Papers,'' published shortly before Kennedy's death, Mailer vented his bitterness at the general lack of hipsterism in the White House. Kennedy had ''the face of a potential hero,'' he wrote, ''but he embodies nothing, he personifies nothing, he is power, rather a quizzical power, without light or principle.'' In a remarkable postscript to his original Esquire essay, Mailer repudiated the article as ''propaganda'' and said he felt like a traitor for having written it.
 No Democrat since Kennedy has rekindled the hipster flame like Barack Obama. (Substitute ''African-American'' for ''Catholic,'' and there isn't much in that passage about ''the myth of the nation'' that couldn't have been written -- or hasn't already been -- by a left-leaning writer today.) The advance sentry for the post-'60s generation, Obama is the first Northern Democrat to win the presidency since 1960, the first whose very election seems to mark the opening of a new chapter in the culture. Unlike Jimmy Carter, whose squarish tendencies reassured post-Watergate voters, or Bill Clinton, whose agility as a candidate dazzled and delighted them, Obama seems to his admirers like something apart from politics altogether, as much a social phenomenon as an elected one. 
 In a sense, the search for Obama -- or at least for an Obama-like figure -- has been at the center of American politics ever since Kennedy's death, which came at the tail end of the postwar era, a moment when the glow and shared sacrifice of heroic wars was fading, when the nation's industrial centers were on the verge of a wrenching transformation, when government was about to grow exponentially in size but shrink immeasurably in prestige. For the next four decades, the dominant narrative in both parties would revolve around outsiders who vowed to remake Washington and its moribund political culture, transcending what Mailer called ''the deadening verbiage of its issues, its politics, its jargon.'' Both Goldwater conservatives and McGovern liberals grew out of this ideal, and a succession of governors turned presidents -- Carter, Ronald Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush -- made this notion of transformation their central theme. In every case but one (Reagan being the exception), they left Washington more or less unchanged from the way they found it, disappointing both their most ardent followers and all the other reform-minded Americans who had fervently hoped for systemic change. 
 On a surface level, the modern presidential transition is mostly about bringing order to the minutiae of government and public life -- packing boxes and choosing schools, preparing for the immediate policy choices that await and filling some 3,300 federal appointments, including some so obscure that only the people who hold them know they exist. In his chronicle of the Kennedy years, ''A Thousand Days,'' the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. described the president's despair at the number of people he had to find to fill 1,200 so-called Schedule C positions. ''People, people, people!'' Kennedy barked. ''I don't know any people. I only know voters. How am I going to fill these 1,200 jobs?'' 
 In a more symbolic way, however, the transition is also very much about this process of forestalling reality, perpetuating the notion of the outsider who has arrived with pick and chisel to breach the ancient crypt of Washington and release its musty air. It is an interregnum of suspended hopefulness, the period after the outsider has asserted his dominance over the system but before he has had the opportunity to become identified with it. His power lies in being perceived, for as long as possible, as a transitional figure, a reformer among insiders; once the transition ends, so, fairly or not, does his lack of accountability for chaotic situations and intractable bureaucracy. 
 Transitions, in this less literal sense, can end well before a president actually takes the oath of office, or they can last for years afterward. Bill Clinton's transition, for instance, was probably cut short when he lost the fight over Zoe Baird, whose nomination for attorney general was derailed because she hadn't paid taxes for her domestic help, or perhaps when a fight erupted in his first days as president over his pledge to allow gays to serve in the military. Liberal ideologues lost whatever faith they still had in Clinton's purity, independents in his ability to bend government to his reformist will. He had squandered his outsider cachet. 
 By contrast, Ronald Reagan's transition was lengthened by the nearly fatal attempt on his life less than three months after his swearing in. (The gunman, John Hinckley Jr., shot Reagan and three other men as they exited the Washington Hilton.) How could such an incident not have added credence to Reagan's outsider legend? He had, after all, arrived in the fetid capital as a symbol of popular resistance and renewal, only to have a criminal try to repel him at gunpoint. Reagan's spiking approval ratings in the wake of the assassination attempt afforded him influence over moderates in Washington as well as maneuvering room with some of his most strident backers, enabling him to negotiate a series of significant legislative victories -- including tax cuts and changes to Social Security -- during his first months in office. He remained a president effectively in transition, more a cultural hero (though perhaps not the kind of hero Mailer had in mind) than a practicing politician.
 Already, in the weeks since the election, Obama has endured the moans of disgruntled constituencies in his own party whose ideal of the outsider is difficult for any breathing politician to fulfill. Progressive activists online and inside the party have complained bitterly about Obama's turning to so many pragmatic insiders -- that is, public servants who ran Washington in the Clinton years -- to populate his cabinet, rather than reaching out to more academics or state-level politicians whose political instincts have not yet been corroded by Washington's penchant for incrementalism. Then, too, have come the inevitable protests from identity-based interest groups: Latinos and African-Americans in Congress who weren't satisfied with the number of senior appointments, as well as gay activists lamenting the omission of a gay cabinet nominee. That sound you hear is the last wheezing gasp of boomer-age politics, the cataloging of individuals according to their areas of oppression, the endless process of tallying cultural differences rather than aggregating common objectives. It is a political philosophy that probably made sense 30 years ago but that seems sort of baffling at the dawn of the Obama era, when such interest groups are among the most powerful in the Washington establishment -- and when the Man himself is black.
 More strenuous tests of Obama's bond with liberal activists are certain to follow. The insurgent nature of his campaign and the sad, spiraling crash of the Republican opposition have now raised expectations for the sort of transformative agenda that no Democrat has dared pursue since the Great Society. Elated Democrats aren't just envisioning a more progressive energy policy; they want an entirely new economic engine built around eco-friendly technologies and a commitment to scrap the internal combustion engine before Obama's daughters get to college. They won't be satisfied with expanding a few existing health care programs; after decades of talk, they want the national overhaul Obama promised, and sooner rather than later. Closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay won't be enough for liberals who want to see investigations and maybe even prosecutions for torture. And yet, in all of these cases, Obama will be tempted -- and probably even required -- to accept some odious compromises. The bills that emerge from Capitol Hill committees will almost certainly be weighed down with the pet projects of congressmen groveling before their constituents and contributors. The legislative process is like Kryptonite to the existential hero; it is designed, somewhat ingeniously, to expose even the most powerful president for the mortal that he is.
 If Obama's improbable career to this point tells us anything, however, it is that he is more than simply a brilliant orator and writer with the killer instinct of a born politician; he is also supremely, even confoundingly, lucky. An d as the formal phase of his transition draws to a close and this next, less-defined phase begins, he once again finds himself wielding some significant advantages over those who have come before. 
 First, of course, Obama has inherited a genuine crisis in the impending economic calamity. This might not seem terribly fortuitous, but in fact, nothing extends the outsider's transition or rallies his supporters like a crisis, which is probably why, by mid-December, Obama's approval rating was running north of 80 percent. The potential collapse of banks and automakers, while certainly demanding more of his nascent administration than Obama might have hoped, may also allow him to remain aloof from the smallness of governing. Obama doesn't really have to invent an agenda to transform the way Washington operates, nor does he have to concern himself with Mailer's ideal of hipsterism. He simply has to react, ably, to events not of his own making. 
 In a perverse way, Obama has also been given a Christmas gift that no Democrat of recent decades has enjoyed. Because the nation seems to have reached a Keynesian consensus around the need to spend public dollars to stave off ruin (and because Bush himself has already directed hundreds of billions of dollars in bailout money to the private sector), Obama can propose significant new expenditures without being immediately pilloried as a stereotypical profligate liberal. In other words, he stands to become the first president since the 1970s to unapologetically spend the taxpayers' money -- and, more likely than not, he won't have to raise anyone's taxes to do it. No liberal born after Roosevelt could ask for more.
 And then there is the technological revolution that has left Obama -- the first president to know the narcotic bliss of the BlackBerry -- better equipped than any predecessor to maintain his outsider aura and to marshal popular support for his legislative program. The 20th century was shaped by mass media -- first radio, then television -- that enabled leaders like Roosevelt, Kennedy and Reagan to help frame the national conversation. What they couldn't do was to enlist their supporters, literally overnight, as a personal army of lobbyists, free from the interference of local party bosses or news editors. This is what the Internet gives Obama. Among the myriad ways in which he has benefited from good fortune, one is to have stepped onto the political stage as the theater itself was undergoing a thorough renovation. 
 The intensely personal nature of Obama's high-tech presidential campaign suggests that his supporters may stick to him with more adhesive force than those liberals who found themselves disillusioned with Kennedy or Clinton. It is one thing to vote for a man or even to attend one of his campaign events; it is quite another to have literally invested in him a small chunk of your weekly paycheck -- not just once, but repeatedly. (In the end, Obama raised roughly $750 million on his way to the presidency, or enough to cover the Yankees' payroll for nearly four years.) Those Americans who gave money to the campaign feel more bound to Obama than to any politician in their lifetimes. According to a survey conducted after the election by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, more than half of Obama's online supporters expect to hear directly from the president or his administration in the months ahead, and 62 percent of Obama voters expect that they will urge other people to support his policies. This suggests an intimacy between president and voter that surpasses anything born of the broadcast age.
 This is what technology does, after all -- it closes distances. It's not a coincidence that the Democratic convention in Denver last August felt more like a celebration of a personality than of a political party, in the way that conventions normally do. Everywhere you walked in the city, Obama's face -- rendered in the now-iconic red, off-white and blue -- seemed to follow like the moon, staring down from banners and the sides of buildings, stenciled onto T-shirts, grafted onto the faces of dolls and watches. To a striking degree, voters seem to feel a personal connection with Obama. This is why they refer to him in interviews, routinely, using only his first name. And it's why millions of them are planning to converge on Washington for this week's inauguration, despite the probability that they will never even glimpse the man, despite the cold and the chaos and the lack of changing tables or porta-potties. They feel as if this is as much their victory, as much their inauguration, as it is his.
 This new kind of political relationship comes with not only potential but also peril, and you have to imagine that Obama's technology advisers are trying to figure out how to tap the one without inviting the other. On one hand, they have an opportunity to make this president more immediate and more influential than his predecessors; you can imagine Obama, in the months ahead, video-conferencing with voters or mobilizing them by the millions to flood Capitol Hill with virtual petitions. At the same time, Obama's team has to figure out a way to put the presidency online without somehow making the office seem smaller and less regal. This was the lesson -- or one of them anyway -- from the shrunken presidency of Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer with the soft voice and the cardigan sweaters who insisted on carrying his own suitcase: Americans like the idea of a people's president, but in practice they prefer him to keep a kind of Olympian remove. We demand that the president know the price of a gallon of milk; we just don't want to imagine him actually standing in the express checkout line. 
 Even during the transition, Obama's team has struggled with how to make its online ethos relevant to this next phase of his journey, sometimes with painful results. E-mail messages from David Plouffe, Obama's otherwise-reclusive campaign manager, and others on the campaign have asked supporters to send in $5 for the inauguration in exchange for entry in a raffle (you and a guest could win an all-expense-paid trip to Washington!) or buy holiday scarves with the soon-to-be-president's logo embroidered on them. These kinds of offers are just fine if you're selling the ShamWow on late-night TV, but they strike a discordant tone for the American president at an hour of urgency. Obama's formidable challenge will be to settle on an optimal distance for the digital-age commander in chief, a task requiring him to be more accessible than his predecessors and yet more imperial than he was during his campaign.
 After all, it is in no small part his basic elusiveness that makes Obama captivating to so many Americans -- not so much the things we know about him as the things we still don't. Obama represents something enigmatic in a political arena where everything before had come to seem trite and depressingly predictable; it's the very newness of him, the lack of familiarity, that makes us wonder if perhaps he signals not only a political departure but also a transformed society. Just maybe, we think, a country that can elect a president as unlikely and untested as Obama is actually less intolerant and less socially stagnant than many Americans had long assumed. ''The edge of the mystery'' is how Norman Mailer described John Kennedy in 1960, and it may be an apt way to look at Obama too, as he rides up Pennsylvania Avenue obscured by a pane of bulletproof glass. The unfolding years will reveal much more about the man we have elected, and perhaps even something of ourselves.

HEADLINE: At Defining Moment, Stories of Injustice

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Roselle 

 BODY:
 HOW do you measure the distance traveled by a nation that once believed one race of humans should hold dominion over another? 
 In the weeks since the election of Barack Obama, the members of the Second Baptist Church here -- where the news was greeted, as it was at so many other African-American churches, with a mixture of joy and astonishment -- have been assembling an answer to that question, one story at a time.
 ''Each story just brought me to tears,'' said the Rev. James E. Moore, 56, the pastor, who grew up in Second Baptist, the oldest African-American church in town, a pristine, gray-shingled building that has occupied the same corner since 1890. ''It's given us a very deep appreciation of what our progenitors have gone through.''
 The Sunday after the election, Mr. Moore gave his blessing to an idea proposed by Shauna Jamieson Carty, 37, a church member who had worked as a newspaper reporter before she became a full-time mother. She wanted to interview some of the 400 other members about what had just happened. He had one suggestion: Start with the oldest, who had seen the most. 
 Events have moved so quickly since November that the historic dimensions of Mr. Obama's victory have sometimes seemed overshadowed by the news of the moment: economic collapse at home, war abroad. Not here, though. Not among the church members whose stories Ms. Carty has been collecting, and has published on the church's Web site and in a series of weekly pamphlets. 
 ''I had no idea there would be such powerful stories,'' Ms. Carty said.
 Most of the members had an answer like Dinah White's when asked when they thought the day would come that the United States would choose an African-American as its president. ''Never, never,'' said Ms. White, 88. ''The kids today, I look at them and I just shake my head. They just don't understand.''
 To get them to understand -- to get everybody to understand -- just how much had changed within the span of her life, just how impossible Mr. Obama's ascent would have been to imagine when she was their age, she told Ms. Carty a story she had never even told her pastor before. It was about what she remembered seeing outside her grandmother's house in rural South Carolina when she was a girl of 6. 
 She was playing in the yard when her grandmother suddenly hustled her out of sight, into a hole that had been dug beside the porch. ''She said, 'Come, child, come hurry up and hide now, take your brother and don't make a sound,' '' Ms. White said, recalling her grandmother's warning on the day the men came looking for her Uncle Charlie, a story she tells haltingly, and with tears. ''She gave us each a piece of cornbread -- I'll never forget that.'' 
 As she remembers it, her grandmother's house had a grove of trees around it, and she peeked out of her hiding place to see what the men had done to her uncle. ''They left him there hanging,'' she said. ''Stripped his clothes off.''
 Ms. Carty's initial intention was to capture the congregants' reactions to the election itself, but she soon found that there was no way to talk about the present without talking about the past. The stories she heard reached back through the decades: epithets and insults endured; ambitions thwarted; jobs denied; a chasm between the races that sometimes felt unbridgeable. But there was faith, too, a belief that one generation's struggles would secure another generation's rewards.
 ''It was a stressful time to make ends meet, and I gave it up,'' said Josephine Taylor Evans, 92, who was born in a one-room sharecropper's cabin in North Carolina and wanted to become a teacher but could only afford to stay at Fayetteville State College for two years. Her daughter, Delores Whitehead, who also belongs to Second Baptist, earned a master's degree and had a career as a librarian. Her great-granddaughter is a college student in Florida, and plans to attend the inauguration on Tuesday.
 Edith McIntyre, 72, was born in North Carolina and went to Fayetteville State, too, graduating and becoming a teacher. But after she came north and earned a master's degree, she had to switch careers, to social work. ''I couldn't get a job as a teacher,'' she said. ''They wouldn't even interview me. When I would walk in, it was as if I was a nonperson.''
 She voted for Mr. Obama at a polling station at the high school here. ''I was so interested in the young people who were voting for the first time that I let some of my excitement for myself go and kept looking at them,'' she said.
 Merlin Bragg, 77, started the campaign season as a Hillary Clinton supporter; her husband of 57 years, Theodore, was for Mr. Obama, and she eventually came around to her husband's side. ''I really didn't think the country was ready for an African-American president, but they fooled me, for which I'm glad,'' she said. ''We have really come a long way, but we still have a long way to go. We instill that in our children and our grandchildren -- what this really means, what our parents and grandparents have come through to bring us to this point.''
 And nobody here had come further than Ms. White, whose uncle was walking to the general store with his head down one day when he bumped into a white couple he hadn't seen. ''He said he jumped up and he fell and his hand touched the lady's shoe,'' Ms. White said, and the man then told him: '''You're out of your place, we'll get you for this,' and that's what they killed him for.''
 They laid her uncle out in the parlor of her grandmother's house. ''She called us all in there after everything was over, I'll never forget,'' Ms. White said about her grandmother, ''and she said, 'Now, listen -- life is for the living, not the dead.' My father came and she said, 'Will, take your family and leave here.' ''
 They did leave -- going back to Baltimore, where they had been living before her mother came home, as she always preferred, to give birth. Ms. White didn't return for decades, but her grandmother's message followed her, about pressing on in the face of death. She still hears her grandmother's words -- ''every day,'' she said.
 Ms. White's daughter, Linda Glein, plans to be in Washington on Tuesday for the inauguration, and promises to call with reports of what it's like there, thick in the crowd of the living.

HEADLINE: Echoes of the New Frontier

BYLINE: By JACK ROSENTHAL. 
Jack Rosenthal, former editor of The New York Times editorial page, served in the Kennedy and , Johnson administrations, 1961-67.

 BODY:
For weeks, the political world has been looking at the Obama Inaugural through historical filters. Some observers see parallels with Lincoln. Others, moved by the present economic upheaval, look for a new New Deal. And others, who like me streamed into Washington 48 years ago excited by John F. Kennedy's exhortation to ''get this country moving again,'' see a new New Frontier.
 Washingtonians say they haven't experienced anything like the present surge of enthusiasm since 1961 when J.F.K. took his oath in the pale sun and icy wind. We came full of confidence that a generous America could rise to new heights, escaping what one orator called ''the broad fairways of indifference'' of the Eisenhower years. We wore dark suits and A-line dresses, ate at Chez Odette in Georgetown, drove Triumph TR3s to work and, once there, put in zealously long hours. 
 The parallel is nevertheless slight. Much more instructive are the monumental differences between then and now. The most obvious, of course, is race. Almost as striking is the transformed role of women. The very words ''national security'' now mean something dramatically different. The digital revolution has altered both the media and the message. And what may have changed most of all is America's standing in the world. 
 Race
 Barack Obama's election epitomizes a remarkable evolution. Like most of us who came to Washington then, I had grown up outraged by events like the murder of Emmett Till and was determined to work for racial justice, sure that civil rights could be promptly imposed by fiat. Civil righteous, you could have called me.
 It didn't take long to collide with the realities of Capitol Hill. Then, Solid South meant solid Dixiecrat. There were not enough Northern Democrats and moderate Republicans to get strong, new civil rights bills through the House, let alone to defeat a filibuster in the Senate. As tomorrow's Martin Luther King Jr. celebration will remind us, climbing the next steps of racial justice took yet more years of bravery and blood. 
 In any case, our passion was largely abstract. When I first went to work in the Justice Department, the only blacks I encountered were clerks and chauffeurs. There were virtually no blacks in New Frontier social circles. Black friends and neighbors like Cliff Alexander and Roger Wilkins hadn't yet come to Washington. It's all the more touching that on Tuesday, Cliff and Adele's daughter Elizabeth will be the Inaugural poet.
 In the early 1960s, the division between the parties had not yet grown poisonous. But even then, it took endless negotiation on Capitol Hill, the March on Washington, global images of violence in Birmingham and Selma, the J.F.K. assassination, Lyndon B. Johnson's legislative skill and the massed efforts of civil rights workers, churches, unions and others to create the momentum for action.
 Women
 This remarkable contrast can be encapsulated in a trivia question: Other than Esther Peterson, head of the Women's Bureau in the Department of Labor, can you name a single woman President Kennedy appointed to an important position? 
 That's not a knock against J.F.K.. As Marilynne Robinson writes in her novel ''Home,'' in that era, ''Women were creatures of a second rank, however pious, however beloved, however honored.'' In that era, Madeleine Albright gave dinners as the wife of a reporter. Women were wives or girlfriends or secretaries, not secretaries of state.
 Now, Hillary Rodham Clinton is hardly a token woman at the top of the Obama administration. The new cabinet includes Hilda Solis at the Labor Department, and Susan Rice at the United Nations. Elena Kagan is to be the first woman solicitor general. Women rank high in the new economic and environmental policy lineup.
 National security
 In the cold war, security was just as much on one's mind but not so much in one's face. Secrets and papers were protected; places were not. No pass was needed to enter most government buildings. To board the new Eastern Air Lines shuttle to New York, all you needed was $9.95. No need to display your driver's license and your socks.
 The only truly strict security I encountered was during the Cuban missile crisis. It concerned a secret government relocation site, buried in a Virginia mountainside. Those eligible to go there in event of an attack were issued a color picture pass striated with gold threads. 
 The late Edward McDermott, head of the Office of Emergency Planning, told about going to give Chief Justice Earl Warren his pass. The chief listened patiently while Mr. McDermott described how the facility would handle 2,200 high officials. Then he asked, where was the pass for Mrs. Warren? Um, there was, ah, no provision for family. Well then, the chief said, gently sliding the pass back, now you'll have room for another high official.
 Media
 That secure facility had space for 50 reporters, mostly from newspapers. The evening television news then was still just 15 minutes, and still black and white. Newton Minow, who as Kennedy's chairman of the Federal Communications Commission famously decried TV as ''a vast wasteland,'' says that he thinks the communications revolution is what would have amazed J.F.K. most. Technology had not yet made the BlackBerry a prized presidential possession.
 The message, not just the medium, was different. John D. Hawke, then a young Washington lawyer and later the comptroller of the currency, recalls that ''alcoholics and womanizers were pretty much ignored.'' Pre-Watergate, ''it was a landmark expose'' when Walter Pincus and Don Oberdorfer wrote in Life magazine about Congressmen cheating on their expense accounts.
 America's Standing in the World
 In 1961, America stood at a pinnacle of power and prestige. In retrospect, for all our hot impatience, President Eisenhower had left America in peace and prosperity. With our youthful idealism, we wanted to bring both to the world. Contrast that with the prospect for young people today. No peace: two wars. No prestige: Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib have become ugly shorthand for torture and Kyoto shorthand for environmental arrogance. And no prosperity: America has become the contagious source of global economic upheaval.
 Nevertheless, there is a hopeful parallel between then and now. In the 1960's, conservatives derided the Keynesian belief that governments had to engage in deficit spending sufficiently massive to send a downward spiral back up. Now Republicans not only accept Keynes but urge stimulus, offering the possibility of consensus.
 The great Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 finally passed only because of brave bipartisanship by principled conservatives like Representative William McCulloch of Ohio and Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois -- and that was a time when, deep down, everyone knew the right thing to do. There is no such certainty about today's economic crisis. That makes all the more relevant a message echoing forward from the old New Frontier to the new one, one that Barack Obama has urged from the start: shared risk, collective wisdom, unity.

HEADLINE: When the Action Moves On

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
THIS week, the eyes of the world will be on Washington as perhaps two million people descend to bask in the Obama glow. City officials expect more than 10,000 tour buses to roll into the area. Hotels 150 miles away have been booked for months. Even campsites are booked.
Washington suddenly has the stars -- Halle Berry, Steven Spielberg, Jamie Foxx -- who are coming to rub elbows with the biggest star of all.
But it also has control of the money: cowed and battle-scarred Wall Streeters are now at the mercy of the federal government, whose cash infusions are keeping their storied institutions afloat. The new administration in Washington has lured some of New York's best and brightest, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, formerly the state's biggest political star; and Timothy Geithner, once of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who is on the verge of being assigned to save the entire economy. 
The sudden downturn has affected the very industries that give New York its identity -- finance, media, advertising, real estate, even tourism -- with extreme prejudice.
The result is that some New Yorkers feel that the city is losing, along with many jobs, its swagger and its sense of pre-eminence, which is no small matter in a town where many feel like it takes an outsize swagger to survive.
Dan Geiger, a journalist for a real estate trade publication, said he left a meeting on Sixth Avenue and 55th Street at 10 a.m., on a recent Tuesday and was alarmed to find the customary Midtown bustle absent. ''The place was deserted, I mean dead,'' he recalled. ''I've never seen Sixth like that at that time of day before. It had a strange feeling to it, like a holiday almost.''
The swift reversal of fortune feels even more painful for having come on the heels of one of the most colorful epochs in the city's history, marked by a skyrocketing economy and an expanding global profile, by championship sports teams and hit television shows that sold the world a vision of life in New York as the Emerald City.
Meanwhile, some other cities around the country -- cities that never made any claim to being the capital of the world -- can find at least some cause for solace in the current climate. Los Angeles keeps spinning out hits (''Gran Torino,'' ''Bride Wars''), proving that some kinds of entertainment really do seem recession-proof. In New York, meanwhile, nine Broadway shows closed on a single day this month.
While the New York region's unemployment has climbed to 5.6 percent as of October, from 4.8 percent the previous year, the metropolitan areas of Seattle, Houston, Washington and Dallas actually saw net gains in employment over the last year.
No less a New Yorker than Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg conceded a loss of verve last week when he said the city was ''shaken'' (but ''not broken'') as he put forward an ambitious jobs-creation plan.
Even Portland, Ore., seems to have borrowed New York's smugness. Recently, one civic group's television spot was picked up and circulated as a YouTube video portraying blissful bicyclists pedaling past tree-lined streets and frame houses behind a graphic reading, ''Is Portland the most European city, or is Europe the most Portlandian continent?''
Isn't that supposed to be New York's line?
''It feels as if a layer has been peeled back on New York,'' Haley M. Rubin, 23, an advertising assistant account executive in Manhattan, said in an e-mail message. ''When I'm out in bars and restaurants, there is a sheen that is missing. Not to say New York isn't still exciting and fun, but it feels a little grittier; there is a sense that the thrill of paying $20 for a cocktail is over. I find that my friends are still going out and want to have fun but their tolerance for the 'price of exclusivity' has waned.''
One possible reason it feels like a mood has been lost is something called ''emotional contagion.''
A few years back, when everyone seemed flush, even those who never received a seven-figure bonus enjoyed the ride because success is infectious, said Michael R. Cunningham, a psychologist and a professor at the University of Louisville. That's what psychologists call ''emotional contagion'' -- someone else's optimism becomes yours, if they stand close enough.
''People are influenced by the mood of the time in which they live,'' Dr. Cunningham said. The problem is, emotional contagion also works the other way.
In other words, a friend of yours gets laid off and you bask in his ambient bummer.
Todd Rosenberg, an animator who lives in Brooklyn, said that he finds himself sharing in the psychic pain of the city when neighborhood businesses go into their death throes. In recent months, he recalled, one local bar attempted desperately to transform itself from velvet-upholstered Asian cocktail lounge to a rugged, taxidermy-filled hunting lodge to a gay bar, all to no avail. It closed soon after. A local bakery that seemed to specialize in stale pastries met a similar fate, he said. As of yet, no one has moved into either space.
''Now they're just sitting there empty, so I'm actually missing the stale baked goods,'' said Mr. Rosenberg, 39.
The overall result, he added, is a city that feels like it is ''definitely shedding whatever New York was a few years ago.''
Also being shed are some of those colorful and slightly absurd microindustries -- de-cluttering consultants, aroma therapy for pets -- that sprouted in recent years by catering to the well-heeled, said Caitlin Zaloom, an assistant professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University who studied the culture of the Wall Street boom.
''All those high-end services are a sign of financial froth,'' Dr. Zaloom said, and are also the first thing to go when times get tough. The city, she added, loses a degree of its boomtown air of specialness, its grandiosity.
Massive development projects like Brooklyn's Atlantic Yards, with its planned Frank Gehry-designed sports arena and 60-story skyscraper, appear stalled. There's no sign the New Jersey Nets will be moving to the borough any time soon.
''I think the city that never sleeps definitely needs a nap,'' Michael J. Petruzzello, a prominent Washington public relations consultant, said in an e-mail message. ''Washington, not Wall Street, is where all the action is right now. We have the money, power and the celebrities. We own all of the banks and financial giants. The Obamas are the hottest power couple on the planet.''
Can a city be considered ''over,'' like Pete Doherty? Unless the city in question is Ephesus, the Ionian metropolis that was sacked by Goths in third century A.D.; or La Corona, the lost Mayan city in what is now Guatemala; or possibly Detroit, cities don't stop being cities. Even Pompeii, buried for centuries under ash and pumice, still attracts its hordes (albeit, to pick through the bones).
Ray Cha, 35, a trend consultant who lives in Manhattan, said, ''New Yorkers love to complain,'' and one of the things they ''most love to complain about is that the city isn't as good as it used to be. When the city is flush with Wall Street cash or dot-com I.P.O.'s, people complain about $20 cocktails or $300 bottle service.''
In fact, some New Yorkers feared their city was past its peak in the early '90s recession. And in the bankrupt '70s. And as long ago as the late 19th century, when New York felt compelled to annex Brooklyn in part to keep pace with its booming rival, Chicago, which at the time was enjoying the attention of the world as the site of the 1893 World's Fair, said Mike Wallace, an author of ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898.''
Indeed, in a city with a considerable taste for overstatement, residents have perennially declared it past its prime. ''New York is over -- O-V-E-R,'' sneered Lexi Featherston, the party-girl character from ''Sex and the City,'' in an episode from Season 6, simply because some health-conscious partygoers forced her to aim her cigarette smoke out an open window (which she later fell from). The episode was broadcast in February 2004, a year when Manhattan residential real estate values gained 14 percent and Wall Street paid nearly $15.9 billion in bonuses.
Also that year, Thomas Keller opened Per Se, with its $270, nine-course tasting menu (with wine pairings), in the towering new Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle -- where one apartment had sold for a then-record $45 million.
A phone call to Per Se for a reservation earlier this week revealed an opening for two that same night, and another one the next night.
To some, New York's cyclical sense of having lost its swagger even serves as muse. Joan Didion famously declared New York, at least her New York, over in the essay ''Goodbye to All That,'' which was published when she was 32.
''The last time I was in New York was in a cold January, and everyone was ill and tired,'' she wrote. ''Many of the people I used to know there had moved to Dallas or had gone on Antabuse or had bought a farm in New Hampshire. We stayed 10 days, and then we took an afternoon flight back to Los Angeles.''
That was 1967. She didn't stay in Los Angeles. At press time, Ms. Didion was still living in a red-brick prewar building on East 71st Street.
In Manhattan.
Correction: January 25, 2009, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the perceived reduction of New York City's power and prestige referred incorrectly to the character Lexi Featherston in ''Sex and the City,'' who said ''New York is over -- O-V-E-R.'' She fell from an open window; she did not jump from it.

 BODY:
44 AND NO. 1: As we await the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States, let us pause to remember the books that once ruled the best-seller list in the most powerful country on earth only to be dumped into the remainder bin of history . . . or not. Here are the top fiction and nonfiction titles on the eve of the inauguration of the last seven presidents. O tempora, o mores! 
 George W. Bush (2001)
 ''The Brethren,'' by John Grisham. ''Empty Promises,'' by Ann Rule. 
 Bill Clinton (1993)
 ''Dolores Claiborne,'' by Stephen King. ''The Way Things Ought to Be,'' by Rush H. Limbaugh. 
 George H. W. Bush (1989)
 ''The Sands of Time,'' by Sidney Sheldon. ''All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,'' by Robert Fulghum. 
 Ronald Reagan (1981)
 ''The Covenant,'' by James Michener. ''Cosmos,'' by Carl Sagan. 
 Jimmy Carter (1977)
 ''Trinity,'' by Leon Uris. ''Roots,'' by Alex Haley. 
 Gerald Ford (1974)
 ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,'' by John le Carre. ''All the President's Men,'' by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. 
 Richard Nixon (1969)
 ''The Salzburg Connection,'' by Helen MacInnes. ''The Money Game,'' by ''Adam Smith.'' 
 READER IN CHIEF: George W. Bush has been very good to the book industry, fueling such hits as Michael Moore's ''Dude, Where's My Country?'' and Bob Woodward's quartet of on-the-scene histories, as well as novelties like ''Goodnight Bush'' (probably the last Bush best seller of the actual Bush era, last appearing at No. 6 on the advice list back in September). But apparently Bush himself has been a major driver of book sales. Last month in The Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove gave the scoop on his reading contest with his former boss, which climaxed in the titanic literary death match of 2006, when Rove supposedly polished off 110 books while Bush finished a whopping 95, including such doorstops as ''Team of Rivals'' and Andrew Roberts's ''History of the English Speaking Peoples.'' As some incredulous commentators pointed out, that was the wonk-politico equivalent of the Year of Reading Proust, Several Times. Will it take a Freedom of Information Act request to uncover Bush and Rove's alleged tally of the ''Total Lateral Area'' of printed pages consumed? The reading public deserves to know. 
 NOTES: There are finally some new titles on the hardcover list. W .E. B. Griffin's ''Black Ops'' claims the top fiction spot, while Paul Krugman's ''Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008'' enters the nonfiction list at No. 11.

HEADLINE: Two Stars, Meeting Across a Bible

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE. 
Linda Greenhouse, former Supreme Court correspondent for The Times, is a senior fellow at Yale Law School and author of ''Becoming Justice Blackmun.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- A few pairings stand out in the history of chief justices swearing in presidents.
 Roger B. Taney swore in Abraham Lincoln four years after writing the Supreme Court's opinion in the Dred Scott case, the pro-slavery ruling that Lincoln denounced and that inflamed the passions that were leading to civil war.
 William H. Rehnquist swore in Bill Clinton for a second term a week after the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether Paula Jones could pursue her sexual harassment suit against the president. (''Good luck,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist murmured audibly. Is it fanciful to suppose that he had to bite his tongue to keep from adding, ''You'll need it''?)
 Chief Justice Rehnquist also swore in George W. Bush -- six weeks after the court's decision in Bush v. Gore effectively handed Mr. Bush the presidency. 
 When Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administers the oath on Tuesday to Barack Obama, the fleeting personal intersection between these two late-baby-boom superstars may not appear equally fraught. But there will be electricity in the encounter nonetheless.
 For a start, Mr. Obama was one of 22 Democratic senators to vote against the confirmation of Judge Roberts to the Supreme Court in 2005. In his remarks at the time, Senator Obama said his decision had not been an easy one. Judge Roberts had a stellar record and ample qualifications, he said. But the nominee's ''overarching political philosophy'' troubled him, Mr. Obama continued, adding, ''It is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak.''
 Tough words, but that is not where the real drama on the inaugural platform lies. After all, Chief Justice Roberts had the last laugh in that first encounter, and at 53 can look forward to a tenure that could easily far outlast the Obama presidency. 
 What is most striking about the two men who will meet at arm's length, the Lincoln Bible between them, is the difference in the paths that brought them to this moment. In this tableau, they represent two faces of a generation that grew to adulthood after Vietnam, after the fantasies and tragedies of the 1960s, after the civil rights marches were over, when the cities were still smoldering but no longer burning. 
 Those who set out on their adult journeys in the 1980s, as both John Roberts and Barack Obama did, inherited an ambiguous legacy that required them to assign their own meaning to the unfulfilled promises of the era that faded with their adolescence. 
 Their early years had little in common: John Roberts was raised in suburban Indiana and sent to a small Catholic boys' boarding school that was started five years earlier by Chicago and Indiana businessmen much like his own father, a steel company executive; Barack Obama, fatherless, struggled to construct a personal identity at a famous school in Hawaii founded in 1841 to educate the children of white missionaries and where no one looked quite like him.
 Still, their intelligence and drive took these two, from such different beginnings, to the same place, Harvard Law School. They did not overlap there, but their shared experience was one of achievement and recognition: both were named to the law review, where John Roberts served as managing editor and Barack Obama was elected president, and both graduated magna cum laude.
 Having gone directly from college to law school, John Roberts continued on what could be seen as the conventional path to success in the law: a clerkship for an esteemed federal appeals court judge, Henry J. Friendly; followed by a Supreme Court clerkship for William Rehnquist, then an associate justice; followed by responsible staff positions in the Justice Department and White House counsel's office as well as partnership in a large law firm. For the government and private clients, he argued 39 Supreme Court cases and was considered by both justices and competitors to be one of the very best. 
 Doing well in all the right places -- a huge achievement but in some ways a career path without risk to a sense of identity -- offered great rewards and appears to have left him with few doubts about how the world works, or should work, if his legal writings are the measure. ''The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,'' was his uncomplicated explanation in a 2007 opinion on why Louisville and Seattle could not constitutionally use student assignments to keep their public schools from resegregating after finally having achieved a measure of integration.
 Mr. Obama's path, more circuitous, led him to spend five years between college and law school working as a community organizer, and to return to community development work, along with part-time law teaching, after he left Harvard and before he finally migrated to electoral politics. It was an unconventional path full of risk, driven in no small part by the search for ''a workable meaning for his life,'' as ''Dreams From My Father,'' the memoir he published at 34, describes his journey.
 With the economic wreckage of the last year, with major law firms shrinking or disappearing and business institutions that once seemed destined to last forever lying in ruins, a number of the old conventional paths can no longer be considered particularly safe for talented young graduates. An unconventional path, on the other hand, might offer something of a template for those half a generation behind the chief justice and the president-elect: a new Democratic member of Congress from Virginia, Tom Perriello, 34, a Yale Law School graduate, spent a career in community service before going into politics and winning improbably against a longtime Republican incumbent. In a recent interview, he described himself and a growing number of young politicians with similar biographies as ''the service generation.''
 Inaugurations are about the future, not the past, of course, and after they leave the inaugural platform, John Roberts and Barack Obama will be very much entwined with each other's future. The Obama administration has some immediate decisions to make about cases pending in or on their way to the Supreme Court, and the court itself has hardly been reticent in recent years about speaking back to both Congress and the president. And Chief Justice Roberts must know that Mr. Obama's choices to fill any Supreme Court vacancies in the next four years are most unlikely to bolster the fragile conservative majority that the chief justice can most often -- although not always -- call upon. For Chief Justice Roberts, the current alignment may be as good as it gets for the foreseeable future.
 Perhaps the chief justice and the new president can wish each other good luck, until their paths cross again. When the two met Wednesday in the Supreme Court's west conference room at Chief Justice Roberts's invitation, they were dwarfed by a huge portrait of Chief Justice William Howard Taft -- the only president ever to become a Supreme Court justice. Even if President-elect Obama were to serve two terms, he would be only 55 when he left the White House. Is it completely implausible to suppose that the Roberts Court lies in this one-time constitutional law teacher's future in more ways than one?

BYLINE: By GRAHAM T. BECK

 BODY:
THE old New Deal helped shape today's New York. Its dollars financed the construction of such enduring building blocks of the city as La Guardia Airport, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the Lincoln Tunnel, along with countless schools, hospitals, courthouses, post offices, police stations and firehouses throughout the five boroughs.
 What lies ahead for the city and the nation has been called a new New Deal, and with good reason. The economic stimulus package proposed by Barack Obama, whose inauguration is on Tuesday, calls for the creation of at least three million jobs by investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the nation's aging infrastructure. 
 People from around the country have been offering suggestions on what they hope to see from this and other aspects of an Obama presidency, and New Yorkers too are weighing in. 
 Will today's New York see the same kind of transforming changes from this new New Deal as it did from Roosevelt's? Only time will tell. But to get a sense of what items are on local wish lists, The City asked a sampling of New Yorkers about what they think the city needs most from President-elect Obama's stimulus plan.
 One wants a new Federal Writers' Project; another, better schools and hospitals in neighborhoods like Bushwick, Brooklyn. Several people defined infrastructure in the broadest possible way -- to include, for example, Wi-Fi zones.
 These are the needs of New York, as New Yorkers see them. GRAHAM T. BECK

 I drive a bus for a living, but I've got two kids, and I'm a dad for life. So I'd say we need bigger and better schools and hospitals, especially in neighborhoods like Bushwick in Brooklyn, where I live. Roads and bridges, they have other chances to get fixed, but kids get only one chance to go to school.
 If they asked me, maybe I might say, ''Obama, pave Atlantic Avenue.'' But that's for me, and it's peanuts compared to all the additional stuff we need to do, which is to invest in the schools and hospitals.

 New York built itself in the 20th century as a magnet for what economists call FIRE (Finance, Insurance and Real Estate). In the 21st century, the great idea capitals will have substituted ICE -- that's Intellectual, Cultural and Educational -- for FIRE.
 If I were shaping a new New Deal, I'd have ICE in mind. I would want to build an infrastructure appropriate for that kind of city. I'd be wary of the temptation to build nothing except roads and bridges. They're important, but if you build only that, you might be doing yesterday's New Deal, not today's. Today's New Deal is about ICE.

 Let's assume, just for a minute, that we've learned a lesson: that amassing billions is no longer seen as a road to happiness and the enjoyment of life. Security, it may be dawning on us, lies elsewhere.
 The educational system needs a huge influx of money. Schoolteachers should all be paid twice what they get now, as they are the ones who will make this city financially and socially livable in the future. An educated generation will create, will be employed, will be healthier and more involved. Crime will diminish, so money will be saved there as well as on welfare and unemployment (assuming there will be any jobs out there to be had). After a while, I think, the benefits will outweigh the costs.
 A make-work policy that focuses on education, health, parks, public transportation and quality of life will make this city secure, safe and sexy.

 City hospitals need a society where budget concerns don't take precedence over the health of citizens. More practically, we need more hospital beds, bigger budgets and more staff. How's that for improved infrastructure?
 I also like the digital medical records idea a lot. It would save lives, time and money. When we don't have basic information, simple things can become so complicated. It's a lot easier to treat a person with a documented history than an unknown patient in distress. Sure, it will be a lot of work initially, but in a few years people won't be able to imagine it any other way.

 I can imagine how to put painters to work on beautification. What about post office murals? Architects, musicians, I can imagine work for them. 
 But writers in this day and age? What can they do? Another Federal Writers' Project? The W.P.A.'s guides to the states are these tremendously compact collections of knowledge put together by crack crews of historians and the best writers. John Cheever and Richard Wright worked on ''New York Panorama,'' the guide to New York City. They are objects of beauty. They remain useful to this day, as well as being wonderful examples of public writing, anonymous, civic writing. 
 Our legions of unemployed writers need it, but is there an essential need for something like those guides today? I hope so.

 If wireless technologies covered the city as ubiquitously as street lighting, students, teachers and parents would be connected to each other and to all the world's information resources 24/7. 
 Small businesses could compete fully in the global economy, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Access to government data would create more transparency, making elected leaders more accountable. Subways and buses could provide information telling riders when they'll actually arrive. Hospitals could monitor patients with weak hearts from home, reducing unnecessary trips to the doctor. And New Yorkers could band together in all kinds of new ways, sharing their ideas and creating solutions to the problems we face together.

 Forget about what needs to be built. What the city needs most is jobs. I've been driving these streets for 20 years, and it's the same thing now as it was then. Changes to the streets don't make a big difference. Jobs do.
 Obama needs to make consumers. That's the American way. If people aren't consuming, no one is going to make money. Get people jobs. I don't care how. Get people back in my cab. That means they have money, and I do, too.

 We need new plazas in neighborhoods like the meatpacking district. We need a car-free Broadway that extends from Central Park to Union Square, then down University Place to Washington Square. That could be our emerald boulevard. It would give us a livable city -- we have such density, such small homes. People have to be in the street looking at each other, and so we need to make the most of what we have and build streets for people.
 Most important, we need to get rid of our provincial mindset. We beg to be connected, and this is what Washington should help us do. Washington should put everyone in a room until they stop crying about boundaries.

 We're not going to build another La Guardia Airport. We're going to fix what we've got and finish what we've got going on. If you go back to the New Deal, to the 1930s, there was a need for huge, visible projects, but what we need now are equally huge, but much less visible projects.
 We need to fix up what's old, apply new technology and fill the gaps. That means repairing a century-old subway system and a highway network built long before the interstate system. That means figuring out how to retrofit those networks with new technologies that allow for boothless tolling and faster commutes. And that means adding the connections where they're needed: the Second Avenue subway, rail service to La Guardia, extending the Long Island Rail Road to the East Side.
 We're not building a city this time around. We're fixing, updating and filling in the gaps.

 I teach in a trailer in the back of a building. My school is built for 1,800 kids, and we have over 4,500. They build a wall in the middle of the room and say we have two rooms. It's unconscionable. 
 There's an entire school in the Bronx made of trailers. Meanwhile, we're building more seats in stadiums down the street. What do you think will happen if we build stadiums and not schools? Kids get it. They're smart.
 DIANE VON FURSTENBERG

 Whether you're an artist, a writer, a designer, whatever, you come to New York to sell things. In a sense, it's the center of trade. We need to maintain that. 
 When you leave London, Shanghai or Paris and arrive at the airport here, it seems charmingly third world. The streets, too. So, for culture we need infrastructure: the Hudson Yards as a new center, a pedestrian city, bicycles as popular as they are in Paris. 
 The 20th century is finished. Now is the time to fix what needs to be fixed, but also draw new measurements. I'm unbelievably optimistic. I must be drinking some kind of special water.
 VARTAN GREGORIAN

 In the middle of the Civil War, 1863, Abraham Lincoln established our public higher education system, the land grant universities. These helped the United States emerge as an industrial power. In the middle of the Civil War, Lincoln established the National Academy of Sciences. This has shaped our future in immeasurable ways. 
 I'd like to see this kind of long-term thinking. It's not a moment for earmarking or selfishness, but time to think of the future of our economy.
 The infrastructure of tomorrow's New York cannot be neglected. When I hear ''deferred maintenance,'' I think ''planned neglect.'' From the M.T.A. to roads, to sewage, to water, to Internet, to bridges, everything -- they all need attention.
 New Yorkers always talk of the superstructure -- perhaps it's more romantic -- but we need infrastructure.

 Remaking 42nd Street, New York's most famous crosstown thoroughfare, into an energy-efficient and people-friendly artery could deliver a major boost to the faltering economy. A river-to-river light rail line on a car-free 42nd Street would link ferry, rail and bus terminals with office buildings and cultural and tourist attractions.
 It would cost one-tenth as much per mile to build as a subway and serve as a pilot for what could become a citywide network of light rail lines.

 Let's think big, really big. Let's take $100 million of the new funds to draw up plans for 2030 and beyond.
 The Staten Island subway was started in 1923 and abruptly halted. Let's finish it, and finally bring rail service from our most overlooked borough to Brooklyn and Manhattan.
 Let's run trains from Grand Central and Penn Station through Sunnyside Yards with a transfer via bus or light rail to the La Guardia shuttle.
 Freight transport, long neglected in New York, must move to the front burner. Let's advance Congressman Jerrold Nadler's tunnel from New Jersey to Brooklyn. But, simultaneously, we need to figure out what to do once the freight gets to Brooklyn.
 Let's rebuild the anachronistic Belt Parkway, make it an expressway and get trucks off Caton Avenue, Linden Boulevard, Parkside Avenue and much of central Brooklyn.
 AARON NAPARSTEK
 Editor in chief, Streetsblog.org
 New York's surface transportation system needs a green makeover. We need to redesign our streets to put buses, bicycles and pedestrians first, and to handle curbside parking and deliveries more effectively. 
 The top priority has to be the creation of a citywide bus rapid-transit network, known in transportation circles as B.R.T. This is, essentially, a ''surface subway'' -- it moves passengers quickly by giving buses their own dedicated express lanes, collecting fares before boarding and using real-time information to manage routing. A successful pilot project is already speeding up bus trips on Fordham Road in the Bronx. 
 A citywide network would cost less than subway expansion, reduce traffic congestion and emissions, extend the transit system into underserved neighborhoods and spread opportunities for economic development throughout the five boroughs. And it would quickly put thousands of New Yorkers to work building and running the system. Driving a bus is a green job.
 DIONNE MACK-HARVIN 
 Executive director, Brooklyn Public Library
 The library systems in New York are aging; about a quarter of the branches in the five boroughs are over 100 years old. It would be wonderful to invest in those buildings -- to make them available for another 100 years. 
 I work in a building with W.P.A. artworks, and I would love to see more of those in libraries and in the city.
 ROBERTA BRANDES GRATZ
 Author of ''The Living City: Thinking Small in a Big Way''
 A really viable transit system is the lifeblood of an urban economy. That's why we need rail, not roads, from this stimulus bill. And not just the big, glamorous, capital investments, but the multiple, smaller, less-visible infrastructure investments that allow the system to function well and get local people to work.
 Whatever is necessary for the transit system -- whether it's new cars, mores cars, new rail, new switches -- that's what New York needs. The M.T.A. knows, and it's not always visible or thrilling, but to me it's usually a wiser investment than the big-bang capital projects that are easier to win support for.

HEADLINE: Emotion Vs. Intellect

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Ben Stein astutely observes that highly intelligent advisers in past administrations often did not have the foresight to make sound policy decisions in unusually tough situations (''Ordinary People vs. Extraordinary Problems,'' Everybody's Business, Jan. 11). He also wonders whether the team of President-elect Barack Obama will similarly fail. 
 In so doing, he touches on an issue that psychologists have grappled with: the importance of emotional versus intellectual ability. The true gift of Franklin D. Roosevelt was his ability to grasp the fear of the American people and inspire them to endure as he experimented with different economic programs.
 Let us hope that the very intelligent people in the Obama administration can similarly understand the emotional components of this crisis.

HEADLINE: The Long, Lame Goodbye

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 As Barack Obama got to town, one of the first things he did was seek the counsel of past presidents, including George Bush senior.
 As W. was leaving town, one of the last things he did was explain why he never sought the counsel of his father on issues that his father knew intimately, like Iraq and Saddam.
 When Brit Hume did a joint interview last week with Bush father and son, dubbed ''41st guy'' and ''43rd guy'' by W., the Fox anchor asked whether it was true that ''there wasn't a lot of give and take'' between them, except on family matters. 
 ''See,'' the Oedipally oddball W. replied, ''the interesting thing is that a president has got plenty of advisers, but what a president never has is someone who gave him unconditional love.''
 He talks about his father, the commander in chief who went to war with Saddam before he did, like a puppy. ''You rarely have people,'' he said, ''who can pick up the phone and say, 'I love you, son,' or, 'Hang in there, son.' ''
 Maybe he wouldn't have needed so many Hang-in-there-sons if he had actually consulted his dad before he ignorantly and fraudulently rammed into the Middle East.
 When W. admits the convoluted nature of his relationship with his father, diminishing a knowledgeable former president to the status of a blankie, you realize that, despite all the cocky swagger we've seen, this is not a confident man.
 That is vividly apparent as we watch W. and Obama share the stage as they pass the battered baton. One seems small and inconsequential, even though he keeps insisting he's not; the other grows large and impressive, filling Americans with cockeyed hope even as he warns them not to expect too much too soon.
 Even Obama's caution -- a commodity notably absent from the White House for eight years -- fills people with optimism. 
 W. lives in the shadow of his father's presence, while Obama lives in the shadow of his father's absence. W.'s parlous presidency, spent trashing the Constitution, the economy and the environment, was bound up, and burdened by, the psychological traits of an asphyxiated and pampered son. 
 The exiting and entering presidents are opposite poles -- one the parody of a monosyllabic Western gunslinger who disdains nuance, and one a complex, polysyllabic professor sort who will make a decision only after he has held it up to the light and examined it from all sides.
 W. was immune to doubt and afraid of it. (His fear of doubt led to the cooking of war intelligence.) Obama is delighted by doubt.
 It's astonishing that, as banks continue to fail and Americans continue to lose jobs and homes, W. was obtuse enough to go on TV and give a canned ode to can-do-ism. ''Good and evil are present in this world,'' he reiterated, ''and between the two of them there can be no compromise.'' 
 He gives the good-and-evil view of things a bad name. Good and evil are not like the Redskins and the Cowboys. Good and evil intermingle in the same breath, let alone the same society. A moral analysis cannot be a simplistic analysis.
 ''You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made,'' he said Thursday night. ''But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions.''
 Actually, no. His decisions have been, for the most part, disastrous. If he'd paid as much attention to facts as fitness, 9/11, Iraq, the drowning of New Orleans, the deterioration in Afghanistan and the financial deregulation orgy could have been prevented.
 Bush fancied himself the Decider; Obama fancies himself the Convener. Some worry that a President Obama will overdo it and turn the Situation Room into the Seminar Room. (He's already showing a distressing lack of concern over whether his cherished eggheads bend the rules, like Tim Geithner's not paying all his taxes, because, after all, they're the Best and the Brightest, not ordinary folk.) 
 W., Cheney and Rummy loved making enemies, under the mistaken assumption that the more people hated America, the more the Bushies were standing up for principle. But is Obama neurotically reluctant to make enemies, and overly concerned with winning over those who have smacked him, from Hillary and Bill to conservative columnists?
 If W. and Cheney preferred Fox News on the TVs in the White House because they liked hearing their cheerleaders, Obama may leave the channel on Fox because he prefers seducing and sparring with antagonists to spooning with allies.
 Right now, though, it's a huge relief to be getting an inquisitive, complicated mind in the White House. 
 W. decided there was no need to be president of the whole country. He could just be president of his base. Obama is determined to be president of as much of the country as possible.
 We're trading a dogmatic president for one who's shopping for a dog. It feels good.

THE CASE FOR BIG GOVERNMENT
 By Jeff Madrick
 205 pp. Princeton University Press. $22.95
 In his first Inaugural Address in 1981, Ronald Reagan asserted, ''Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.'' In his 1996 State of the Union speech, Bill Clinton acknowledged, ''The era of big government is over.'' But when Barack Obama takes office he is much more likely to call for great national endeavors than to condemn the government that makes such projects possible. 
 Since the credit crisis plunged a declining economy into a deepening recession, the era of bashing big government has been over. A Republican administration has pushed through a $700 billion bailout of the financial industry, the domestic auto industry is receiving $13.4 billion in emergency loans and the conservative commentator William Kristol advises his allies not to present themselves as antigovernment. 
 In this new economic, political and ideological environment, ''The Case for Big Government'' shows how yesterday's contrarianism can become today's consensus. A leading economist, a former financial columnist for The Times and an adviser to Senator Edward Kennedy, Jeff Madrick makes the case that the nation faces social and economic challenges requiring higher taxes, increased public investment and more rigorous regulation of corporate conduct. Researched and written before last summer, this fact-filled and well-reasoned book reads like an artifact from a time capsule. Before the financial crisis, most policy makers and opinion leaders smugly assumed that the economy would remain on an even keel, so Madrick felt he had to make a vigorous argument that economic problems required government action. Now, his book seems almost too logical and levelheaded to attract a large audience in this time of anger and anxiety. 
 To those who ask whether any country has ever taxed and spent its way to prosperity, Madrick offers two answers: the United States and its major competitors. In America, the greatest growth in public spending came during the most prosperous period in American history, the 25 years after World War II, when the federal, state and local government budgets ''reached roughly 30 percent'' of gross domestic product ''and income levels in America became more equal.'' Among the world's most prosperous nations, most have higher rates of taxes and public spending, and many may have higher living standards, than the United States. ''There really is no example of small government among rich nations,'' Madrick observes. 
 As the political analysts Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril pointed out years ago, Americans tend to be ''ideologically conservative and operationally liberal.'' Many of the most informative and intellectually challenging sections of this book explore how public investments advanced the American dream of a self-reliant citizenry so effectively that most Americans are unaware of the accomplishments of activist government. 
 For instance, Madrick challenges the prevailing view that early in the 19th century, government stayed small and did little. He explains that the state and federal governments invested in roads, canals and public schools, while imposing tariffs on imported goods in order to encourage domestic manufacturing. Even more provocatively, he examines what really enabled the United States to become the first advanced society with widespread property ownership and an acceptance of private enterprise. Madrick points out that Jefferson believed that ''the broad distribution of land he thought ideal could be accomplished only through government control and regulation.'' From the Louisiana Purchase through the Homestead Act and the founding of the land-grant colleges, the federal and state governments acquired unclaimed land, sold it at affordable prices and devoted much of it to public purposes like educational institutions, highways, railroads and parks. As Madrick writes, ''One of the ironies in America is that government was used aggressively in the face of persistent laissez-faire rhetoric.'' 
 From the era when Thomas Jefferson sought to sustain a society of self-reliant farmers, Madrick observes, activist government has been essential -- not only during emergencies like the Great Depression, but also when the entire society was undergoing wrenching changes. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, industrialization created a new country where migrants from rural America and immigrants from Europe crowded into the nation's cities to work as wage earners in the factories and foundries. 
 These newly urbanized workers needed public services -- schools, sewers, mass transit, sanitation -- as well as protections for their wages, working hours and health on their jobs. Even more crucially, Madrick writes, there was this fundamental question: ''Could manufacturing jobs pay well enough and be secure enough to become an adequate substitute for the security of land ownership in early America?'' He answers yes, ''but only with much political turmoil, lost personal independence and the active participation of government.'' 
 Now, Madrick maintains, the transition to a globalized, information-oriented, service economy presents similar challenges that, like the ones of earlier times, can best be answered by activist government. He urges billions for public investments -- universal health coverage, universal pre-kindergarten, repairs in the nation's infrastructure and half of college tuition at no cost for qualified students, similar to the free high school education that was provided to young people at the turn of the last century. 
 Still, even if such investments empower new generations to get ahead, they are quite likely to believe that they did it all by themselves. Like their parents and grandparents before them, they may follow the uniquely American tradition of supporting public programs in practice while claiming to be antigovernment in principle.

HEADLINE: The Occidental Tourist

BYLINE: By MARGOT MIFFLIN. 
Margot Mifflin, a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, is the author of the forthcoming ''The Blue Tattoo: The Life of Olive Oatman.''

 BODY:
WHEN Barack Obama made his first public speech -- on Feb. 18, 1981, exhorting the trustees of Occidental College to divest from South Africa -- he wasn't the only speaker. He wasn't the featured speaker. He wasn't even the best speaker. But the event crystallized the key values Occidental promoted, which helped shape the man making history this week: critical thought and social justice. It also inspired the kind of social alchemy Mr. Obama later mastered on a national scale: bringing disparate groups together and making serious politics seriously fun. 
 The protest fell on the kind of sun-bleached winter day you see only in Southern California. The students gathered outside Coons Hall administration building, a glass-paneled monolith dubbed ''the Chrysler showroom'' because it clashed with the stunning Mediterranean Revival buildings on the rest of the well-manicured campus. While the trustees met inside, the speakers -- black, white, Hispanic and South African -- delivered their pleas, starting with Mr. Obama, whose speech was cut short when two students hauled him away in a staged display of white suppression. After the rally, a pair of folk singers harmonized as we wandered off to class, feeling groovy. 
 In ''Dreams From My Father,'' Mr. Obama wrote that he didn't think the demonstration made any difference, but he was wrong. Though Occidental's 1991 divestment was shamefully belated, more than 300 students from every corner of the tiny campus came together that day: I saw geology and art majors, actors and athletes, international students and sandy-haired Californians, shoulder to shoulder, laughing and shouting back at the speakers with the kind of politically inspired camaraderie that also characterized Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign rallies. 
 Occidental is a fine liberal arts college in Eagle Rock, 10 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, an intimate campus where we were taught above all to think critically and creatively -- it was spelled out in the curriculum. The year before Barry (as we called him) arrived, the freshman ''core program'' was begun, requiring students to become globally literate through courses on international culture that raised questions like, ''How have different societies defined justice, the sacred and the truth?'' 
 The student body was international, although not nearly as racially diverse as it is now. But we were economically diverse, hailing from homes with swimming pools in wealthy Los Angeles suburbs like Brentwood, as well as from blue-collar towns in Connecticut and Massachusetts. We swam in Santa Monica, bowled in Eagle Rock, camped in Mexico, hiked in Joshua Tree National Park and skated at Venice Beach -- something that Barry occasionally did with his friend Hasan Chandoo. We partied, but only after we studied. Our professors pushed us to apply for grants that took us around the globe, and worked community service into our course requirements. They wanted us to become citizens of the world. 
 For Barry, that meant moving on. A few months after the rally at Coons Hall, he left to finish his degree at Columbia, having decided to pursue public policy -- in large part, he later said, because of his involvement in the divestment movement. His closest friends had just graduated. His activism had been ignited. And as an aspiring writer, he'd immersed himself in literature with the kind of Talmudic dedication that, I'm convinced, ultimately made him a brilliant speaker. If Occidental's goal was to make us deep thinkers with a concern for justice and community, Barack Obama earned the degree.

HEADLINE: Speeches

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
If any presidential speech can soar, it is the inaugural. Fueled by aspirations, untroubled by failures, it is the moment for poetry and promises, the source of phrases that can call up an era: The better angels of our nature. Nothing to fear but fear itself. Ask not what your country can do for you. The Great Society. A thousand points of light. 
 Below is a sampling of past Inaugural Addresses, which Barack Obama and his speechwriters have been studying in preparation for his speech Tuesday. (Full texts of all past addresses are at http://www.bartleby.com/124/.) 
 The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people. (George Washington, 1789)
 But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists. (Thomas Jefferson, 1801)
 With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. (Abraham Lincoln, 1865)
 We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics. (Franklin Roosevelt, 1937)
 We sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history. This fact defines the meaning of this day. (Dwight Eisenhower, 1953)
 Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. (John Kennedy, 1961)
 We are a nation that has a government -- not the other way around. And this makes us special among the nations of the earth. Our government has no power except that granted it by the people. (Ronald Reagan, 1981)

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about enduring words first spoken in Inaugural Addresses erroneously included two presidents' well-known phrases. Lyndon B. Johnson first referred to ''the Great Society'' in a graduation speech at the University of Michigan in May 1964. And George H.W. Bush first used the phrase ''a thousand points of light'' in his acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican convention. (They later repeated the phrases in their Inaugural Addresses, in 1965 and 1989.)

HEADLINE: Privacy Issue Complicates Push to Link Medical Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama's plan to link up doctors and hospitals with new information technology, as part of an ambitious job-creation program, is imperiled by a bitter, seemingly intractable dispute over how to protect the privacy of electronic medical records. 
 Lawmakers, caught in a crossfire of lobbying by the health care industry and consumer groups, have been unable to agree on privacy safeguards that would allow patients to control the use of their medical records. 
 Congressional leaders plan to provide $20 billion for such technology in an economic stimulus bill whose cost could top $825 billion.
 In a speech outlining his economic recovery plan, Mr. Obama said, ''We will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that within five years all of America's medical records are computerized.'' Digital medical records could prevent medical errors, save lives and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, Mr. Obama has said. 
 So far, the only jobs created have been for a small army of lobbyists trying to secure money for health information technology. They say doctors, hospitals, drugstores and insurance companies would be much more efficient if they could exchange data instantaneously through electronic health information networks. Consumer groups and some members of Congress insist that the new spending must be accompanied by stronger privacy protections in an era when digital data can be sent around the world or posted on the Web with the click of a mouse. 
 Lawmakers leading the campaign for such safeguards include Representatives Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Pete Stark of California, both Democrats; Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont; and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.
 Without strong safeguards, Mr. Markey said, the dream of electronic health information networks could turn into ''a nightmare for consumers.''
 In the last few years, personal health information on hundreds of thousands of people has been compromised because of security lapses at hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. These breaches occurred despite federal privacy rules issued under a 1996 law. Congress is trying to strengthen those privacy protections and make sure they apply to computer records. Lobbyists for insurers, drug benefit managers and others in the health industry are mobilizing a campaign to persuade Congress that overly stringent privacy protections would frustrate the potential benefits of digital records. 
 One of the proposed safeguards would outlaw the sale of any personal health information in an electronic medical record, except with the patient's permission. 
 Another would allow patients to impose additional controls on certain particularly sensitive information, like records of psychotherapy, abortions and tests for the virus that causes AIDS. Patients could demand that such information be segregated from the rest of their medical records. 
 Under other proposals being seriously considered in Congress, health care providers and insurers would have to use encryption technology to protect personal health information stored in or sent by computers. Patients would have a right to an accounting of any disclosures of their electronic data. Health care providers and insurers would have to notify patients whenever such information was lost, stolen or used for an unauthorized purpose. And patients -- or state officials acting on their behalf -- could recover damages from an entity that improperly used or disclosed personal health information. 
 Rahm Emanuel, who will be the White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, advocated such safeguards when he was a House member from Illinois. ''As we move forward on health information technology,'' Mr. Emanuel said, ''it is absolutely essential that an individual's most personal and vulnerable information is protected.''
 Advisers to Mr. Obama say he favors strong privacy protections but does not want the dispute to slow down the bill.
 Mary R. Grealy, president of the Health Care Leadership Council, which represents large health care corporations, said the proposed safeguards could be an impediment to the widespread adoption of health information technology and counteract any economic stimulus effect. 
 In a letter to Congressional leaders, Karen M. Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, expressed ''serious concern about privacy provisions being considered for inclusion in the economic stimulus bill.''
 She criticized, in particular, a proposal that would require health care providers to obtain the consent of patients before disclosing personal health information for treatment, payment or ''health care operations.''
 Such a requirement, she said, could cripple efforts to manage chronic diseases like diabetes, which often require coordination of care among many specialists.
 At the moment, senior House Democrats are determined to include privacy safeguards in the economic recovery bill. But some insurance lobbyists said they hoped Congress would punt on the issue, leaving privacy standards to be developed by the Health and Human Services Department, where they believe they can make their case more effectively. Microsoft has joined many consumer groups in supporting stronger safeguards. The software giant has developed products that allow consumers and providers to store and share medical data in a secure format. 
 ''Health information technology will succeed only if privacy is protected,'' said Frank C. Torres, director of consumer affairs at Microsoft. ''For the president-elect to achieve his vision, he has to protect privacy.''
 Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Peter R. Orszag, director-designate of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said electronic medical records could be more secure than paper records.
 ''If the files are electronic,'' Mr. Whitehouse said, ''computers can record every time someone has access to your medical information.'' But, he said, the challenge is political as well as technical.
 ''Until people are more confident about the security of electronic medical records,'' Mr. Whitehouse said, ''it's vitally important that we err on the side of privacy.''
 The data in medical records has great potential commercial value. Several companies, for example, buy and sell huge amounts of data on the prescribing habits of doctors, and the information has proved invaluable to pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 ''Health I.T. without privacy is an excellent way for companies to establish a gold mine of information that can be used to increase profits, promote expensive drugs, cherry-pick patients who are cheaper to insure and market directly to consumers,'' said Dr. Deborah C. Peel, coordinator of the Coalition for Patient Privacy, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union among its members.

HEADLINE: Evoking Lincoln, Obama Approaches His Inauguration by Train Ride

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Jen A. Miller contributed reporting from Claymont, Del.

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama stepped onto a vintage train car, built at a time when a black man's ascendancy to the presidency was impossible in America, and traveled Saturday to Washington in a three-day prelude to his inauguration as the nation's 44th president.
 As he did throughout his campaign, Mr. Obama evoked imagery of Abraham Lincoln, in word and deed, as he took an abridged version of Lincoln's journey by rail to the capital before his own inaugural festivities in 1861. The trip offered Mr. Obama one more opportunity to savor his victory before he inherits the challenges that await him.
 ''While our problems may be new, what is required to overcome them is not,'' Mr. Obama said before the train ride began. ''What is required is the same perseverance and idealism that our founders displayed. 
 ''What is required is a new declaration of independence, not just in our nation, but in our own lives -- from ideology and small thinking, prejudice and bigotry -- an appeal not to our easy instincts but to our better angels.''
 The trip picked up momentum as it drew closer to Washington, with larger crowds gathering to wave, cheer and merely catch a glimpse of Mr. Obama, who on Tuesday will be the first African-American sworn in as president.
 Mr. Obama opened his inauguration celebration at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, where a few hundred supporters gathered to send him off. He was joined on stage by his wife, Michelle; their two daughters, Malia and Sasha; and a contingent of friends from Chicago and beyond who have been by the family's side on their two-year odyssey to the White House.
 The train sounded its whistle and pulled from the station about 11:30 a.m., with the conductor booming, ''Welcome aboard the 2009 inaugural train to D.C.''
 Hundreds of people gathered alongside the track, at train crossings, in backyards and on rooftops, waving homemade signs and small American flags at the train. Those who came to witness the moment, even to catch only a peek of the train, stood in single-digit temperatures, with the wind chill below zero.
 At one point, Mr. Obama stood on the outdoor platform of his private car, which was draped in red, white and blue bunting. He waved and smiled as he sounded the train's whistle three times. (''You're never too old to toot the horn,'' he said later, talking to some of his guests on board.)
 When Mr. Obama arrived at the first stop in Wilmington, Del., the crowd spilled from an outdoor plaza at the train station as Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family climbed aboard after a rally. They held a rally in Baltimore before arriving by nightfall at Union Station in Washington, where a large crowd gathered along Pennsylvania Avenue to see Mr. Obama as he was taken to Blair House, the family's temporary residence.
 ''Sometimes it's hard to believe that we'll see the spring again,'' Mr. Biden said to shivering supporters in Delaware, his home state, who had been waiting for hours at the rally. ''But I'll tell you: spring is on the way with this new administration.''
 As the train entered Maryland, about a dozen pickups and cars parked haphazardly in a harvested corn field. People stood outside their vehicles, capturing the moment with their cell phones or hand-held video cameras.
 ''We are praying for you,'' said one sign, written with a shaky hand, which was held by a woman standing at Edgewood Station, not far from Baltimore.
 The route was scripted with echoes of history in mind, with the trip beginning in Philadelphia, where the Constitution was written, and continuing to Delaware, where the Constitution was first ratified. At each stop, the 10-minute speeches from Mr. Obama were imbued with a sense of history, particularly as he called on Americans ''to reach for the promise of a better day, and to do the hard work of perfecting our union once more.''
 For all the pomp and celebration surrounding the slow-motion trek to Washington, a two-hour journey that stretched into more than seven, the underlying mood was a far more serious one than on most days of the presidential campaign. He has often delivered similar speeches with lofty tones, but the moment took on more gravity with the presidency less than three days from being his.
 ''We recognize that such enormous challenges will not be solved quickly,'' Mr. Obama said to a crowd of about 40,000 people in a downtown Baltimore square. ''There will be false starts and setbacks, frustrations and disappointments. I will make some mistakes, and we will be called to show patience even as we act with fierce urgency.''
 While the day was choreographed with a Lincoln-era nostalgia in mind, the train ride was very much a modern-day affair, with cable television networks broadcasting live from a dining car and from satellite trucks parked along the route. It was an opportunity for Mr. Obama to turn the conversation, at least for now, away from the criticism of his economic stimulus plan and other stumbles in his transition, back to his victory in November.
 Jacqueline Tinsley, 56, was among those who turned out to see Mr. Obama as he began his journey to Washington. She volunteered throughout the course of his campaign, well before even she believed that his quest would be a success, and said she could not miss this moment, which she believes will be etched in the nation's history.
 ''In all my life, I never thought that there would be a black president,'' Ms. Tinsley said, taking her seat in the hall of the train station in downtown Philadelphia. ''When he first started, I didn't know how much of a chance he had, but over time, you could see it within him. I know he can't live up to every expectation, but he has something that we need at this time.'' 
 Mr. Obama and his family were riding a private rail car called the Georgia 300, built in 1939, which has carried former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. At the time the car first went into service, getting a job as a railroad porter was among the highest aspirations for a black man in America.
 It was the same blue vintage rail car that carried Mr. Obama on a tour through Pennsylvania during his primary campaign, a few days before losing that state to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 ''It was actually one of my favorite times on the campaign,'' Mr. Obama told his guests aboard the train on Saturday. 
 Although Lincoln provided the inspiration for the train trip to Washington, Mr. Obama did not mention him by name in his remarks, though he has referred to him again and again as a historical beacon for his own candidacy. But Mr. Obama filled his addresses with phrases associated with Lincoln, including the ''better angels'' call to action.
 ''We should never forget,'' Mr. Obama said, ''that we are the heirs of that first band of patriots, ordinary men and women who refused to give up when it all seemed so improbable; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew. That is the spirit that we must reclaim today.''
 Mr. Obama invited a few dozen guests, most of whom he had met during the course of his presidential campaign, to join him on the symbolic last leg of his journey to the nation's capital.
 There was the Fischer family from Beech Grove, Ind., whose home Mr. Obama stopped by for lunch one day last spring as he sought to show his connection to working families. There were the Girardeaus, a family from Kansas City, Mo., whose living room he sat in to watch his wife deliver her speech at the Democratic convention. And there was Lilly Ledbetter, a woman for whom the Fair Pay Act was named, after her long struggle with Goodyear to receive equal wages with men. 
 ''Theirs are the voices I will carry with me every day in the White House,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Theirs are the stories I will be thinking of when we deliver the changes you elected me to make.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Speech at the Lincoln Memorial

 BODY:
Following are the remarks of President-elect Barack Obama as prepared for delivery, and provided by the Presidential Inauguration Committee.
 Washington, D.C. 
 Sunday, January 18, 2009
 I want to thank all the speakers and performers for reminding us, through song and through words, just what it is that we love about America. And I want to thank all of you for braving the cold and the crowds and traveling in some cases thousands of miles to join us here today. Welcome to Washington, and welcome to this celebration of American renewal.
 In the course of our history, only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now. Our nation is at war. Our economy is in crisis. Millions of Americans are losing their jobs and their homes; they're worried about how they'll afford college for their kids or pay the stack of bills on their kitchen table. And most of all, they are anxious and uncertain about the future - about whether this generation of Americans will be able to pass on what's best about this country to our children and their children. 
 I won't pretend that meeting any one of these challenges will be easy. It will take more than a month or a year, and it will likely take many. Along the way there will be setbacks and false starts and days that test our fundamental resolve as a nation. But despite all of this - despite the enormity of the task that lies ahead - I stand here today as hopeful as ever that the United States of America will endure - that the dream of our founders will live on in our time.
 What gives me that hope is what I see when I look out across this mall. For in these monuments are chiseled those unlikely stories that affirm our unyielding faith - a faith that anything is possible in America. Rising before us stands a memorial to a man who led a small band of farmers and shopkeepers in revolution against the army of an Empire, all for the sake of an idea. On the ground below is a tribute to a generation that withstood war and depression - men and women like my grandparents who toiled on bomber assembly lines and marched across Europe to free the world from tyranny's grasp. Directly in front of us is a pool that still reflects the dream of a King, and the glory of a people who marched and bled so that their children might be judged by their character's content. And behind me, watching over the union he saved, sits the man who in so many ways made this day possible.
 And yet, as I stand here tonight, what gives me the greatest hope of all is not the stone and marble that surrounds us today, but what fills the spaces in between. It is you - Americans of every race and region and station who came here because you believe in what this country can be and because you want to help us get there. It is the same thing that gave me hope from the day we began this campaign for the presidency nearly two years ago; a belief that if we could just recognize ourselves in one another and bring everyone together - Democrats, Republicans, and Independents; Latino, Asian, and Native American; black and white, gay and straight, disabled and not - then not only would we restore hope and opportunity in places that yearned for both, but maybe, just maybe, we might perfect our union in the process.This is what I believed, but you made this belief real. You proved once more that people who love this country can change it. And as I prepare to assume the presidency, yours are the voices I will take with me every day I walk into that Oval Office - the voices of men and women who have different stories but hold common hopes; who ask only for what was promised us as Americans - that we might make of our lives what we will and see our children climb higher than we did.
 It is this thread that binds us together in common effort; that runs through every memorial on this mall; that connects us to all those who struggled and sacrificed and stood here before.
 It is how this nation has overcome the greatest differences and the longest odds - because there is no obstacle that can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.
 That is the belief with which we began this campaign, and that is how we will overcome what ails us now. There is no doubt that our road will be long. That our climb will be steep. But never forget that the true character of our nation is revealed not during times of comfort and ease, but by the right we do when the moment is hard. I ask you to help me reveal that character once more, and together, we can carry forward as one nation, and one people, the legacy of our forefathers that we celebrate today.

HEADLINE: Can Sundance Get a Break?

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah 

 BODY:
 During a storied career as an actor and director, Robert Redford bought a ski resort here, financed an institute for independent filmmakers, and most notably, started the Sundance Film Festival 25 years ago, all named for the lovable bandit in ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' 
 But the star who could do no wrong for his audience can't seem to do anything right for his critics within the business. As in that famous role, he spends a fair amount of time getting shot at. Despite the many new films and stars that Sundance helped usher to Hollywood, Mr. Redford is the target of constant sniping by his colleagues who will tell you, while munching on heaping buffets at sponsored events, that the festival is now far too commercial and that it no longer reflects its independent origins. 
 ''What was I supposed to do?'' Mr. Redford asked. ''I wanted to do something besides just make the films that interested me.''
 Sitting at Zoom restaurant in Park City, which, by the way, he also owns, Mr. Redford is clearly prickly about the criticism. 
 ''After 25 years, I've gotten used to the negative speculation that always opens the festival,'' he said. ''It always seems like they are intent on crucifying us for one thing or another, and I sort of say, 'Well hold on. Calm down and just see some movies.' ''
 It is hard to calm down at Sundance, with over 200 films and many more parties. Last Saturday, Anna Wintour of Vogue, Jack White of the White Stripes, and Mike Tyson, the ex-heavyweight champion of the world, were within a few square blocks of each other at various functions. 
 Mr. Tyson, who is here because ''Tyson'' is one of the big documentaries, told me he was planning to avoid the party scene and spend most of his time in his room. ''I'm not going to get mixed up in all that mess.'' It takes a lot of mess to scare a guy who knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds. The event lives on the hype that has made it a magnet for filmmakers -- over 9,000 films were submitted this year, yet another record -- and that coverage has turned it into a commercial and celebrity spectacle worthy of parody on ''Entourage.''
 ''We don't have anything to do with all that,'' Mr. Redford said in a phone call Saturday on the way over to the festival, but concedes, ''some of this stuff threatens to engulf the purpose of the festival.'' Sundance has its share of big-ticket sponsors, but Mr. Redford could not be blamed for walking down the Main Street and asking the same question Butch Cassidy asked the Kid: ''Who are those guys?'' 
 This weekend has brought something of an exodus of the A-listers as they make their way to the inauguration parties in Washington, but Mr. Redford is staying put.
 ''I'm going to stay here and see some movies, although like everyone else, I will be watching the inauguration,'' he said, ''I'm pretty sure they will get along without me.''
 Movie stars of a certain age are supposed to saddle up with their laurels and ride into the sunset, give or take the occasional role as somebody's crabby uncle. Mr. Redford took a different route. 
 At 72, he remains one of America's favorite cowboys -- he's Sundance forever -- but no longer lays claims to be the kid.
 Still, he skipped his hosting duties on Sunday morning and knocked out a couple of ski runs before driving 40 miles over the mountains. ''The snow is really amazing,'' he said.
 Other major festivals like Toronto, Telluride and Cannes also serve as meat markets for Hollywood, but because Sundance is a short-hop flight from Los Angeles and has a history for exhibiting small films that go on to big grosses, the festival is crawling with agents and producers.
 Still, the knock on Sundance this year has been that it is will not be commercial enough. 
 The slumping economy has dealt a big blow to the dreams of independent film producers, and studios are looking to release fewer, safer films, not take more risks. Sundance remains a place where the mythical part of movies live -- everyone is looking for the next ''Little Miss Sunshine'' or ''Sideways'' because low cost and high yield never go out of style. 
 But Hollywood, staring at the recession, seems more interested in its computer models that foretell a film's appeal in the demographic quadrants. It didn't help that the big buys at last year's festival -- ''Hamlet II'' and ''What Just Happened'' -- tanked. (''Brooklyn's Finest,'' one of bigger films here, did sell on Saturday to Senator Film Distribution.)
 ''So if there is a little less of it now that times are tough, so much the better,'' Mr. Redford said. ''And if there are a few less people here and a little more room to move around, is that so bad?''
 ''Right now, the festival continues to be source of diversity in terms of what is seen and sometimes, the movies that are shown elsewhere,'' he said. ''If it ceases to be of benefit in those ways, then who knows. If people think of Sundance and think it's no fun and they don't want to go, I'm fine with it.''
 On Saturday, some 600 people showed up at 8:30 in the morning for ''Humpday,'' which had the unpromising plot about two straight men making a gay sex movie. It sounds tasteless and awful, but it was neither. The tiny movie put together by 16 pals in Seattle was more full of story, laughs and genuine human emotion than a dozen studio movies, and it left buyers nosing around. 
 ''No kidding,'' Mr. Redford said after hearing about the film. ''I'll look forward to seeing that.''

PERSON: Henry Turner 

HEADLINE: Henry Turner, 76, Historian and Author

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Henry Ashby Turner, a leading historian whose book ''German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler'' (1985) challenged the widely held theory that German industrialists were the Nazi Party's most influential supporters and embroiled him in a fierce scholarly debate, died Dec. 17 in New Haven, Conn. He was 76 and lived in New Haven.
The cause was complications of melanoma, said his son Matthew. 
Mr. Turner, who taught at Yale for 44 years, published several important works on modern Germany, including ''Stresemann and the Politics of the Weimar Republic'' (1963), a study of Gustav Stresemann, the liberal statesman who served as Germany's chancellor and foreign minister in the 1920s, and ''Hitler's Thirty Days to Power'' (1996).
He was best known, however, for ''German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler,'' which marshaled a wealth of archival information to argue that German industrialists had contributed far less to the Nazi Party than previously thought.
Most of the Nazi Party's money, he wrote, came from membership dues, contributions at rallies and party publications. It was the owners of small and medium-size companies who were most likely to support the party, he argued, not the big industrialists, who, alarmed by Hitler's anti-capitalist tirades, tended to direct their support to a variety of bourgeois parties.
The argument contradicted the Marxist thesis underlying ''The Collapse of the Weimar Republic: Political Economy and Crisis'' (1981) by David Abraham, a young Princeton historian who argued that German businessmen had assumed the role of Hitler's principal backers to suppress the working-class movement and ensure their own survival.
Mr. Turner accused Mr. Abraham of distorting and in some cases falsifying archival data to suit his argument, touching off a ferocious debate that embroiled eminent scholars in the United States and Germany.
Henry Ashby Turner Jr. was born in Atlanta and grew up in Bethesda, Md. After earning a bachelor's degree from Washington and Lee University in 1954, he attended the University of Munich and the Free University of Berlin before being granted his Ph.D. in 1960 from Princeton, where he studied with Gordon A. Craig.
In 1958 he married Jane Swanger, who survives him, as do his sons Matthew, of Manhattan, and Bradley, of Baltimore; his daughter, Sarah Ryan, of Watertown, Mass.; and six grandchildren.
At Yale, Mr. Turner taught the core undergraduate course on modern German history until his retirement in 2002, while publishing works like ''Faschismus und Kapitalismus in Deutschland'' (''Fascism and Capitalism in Germany,'' 1972), ''The Two Germanies Since 1945'' (1987) and ''Germany From Partition to Reunification'' (1992).
The Abraham affair, a tempestuous interlude in an otherwise quiet scholarly life, sharply divided historians. Some thought that Mr. Turner had fixated on a few careless mistakes by a novice scholar and was pursuing a vendetta based on ideological differences and, perhaps, a sense of rivalry. Mr. Turner's supporters, including one of the two historians who had read Mr. Abraham's book in manuscript, countered that he had exposed scholarly felonies, not misdemeanors. Mr. Turner and his supporters pursued the campaign energetically, and Mr. Abraham eventually left the historical profession.
In 1998 General Motors hired Mr. Turner to investigate the wartime activities of Opel, its German subsidiary, which a group of Holocaust survivors was suing. His research led to the book ''General Motors and the Nazis: The Struggle for Control of Opel, Europe's Biggest Carmaker'' (2005).
Mr. Turner concluded that although Opel had made the morally dubious decision to produce engines for the Luftwaffe in 1938, by the time the war began General Motors had lost control of the company and therefore had no say in its production of military vehicles or its use of slave labor.

HEADLINE: Energy Inefficient

 BODY:
From plug-in cars to carbon capture to wind farms linked to ''intelligent'' power grids, many of the solutions pitched to restructure the country's energy system and confront global warming rely on a faith in high tech: we expect, or at least hope, that an Apollo project, the energy equivalent of the dot.com revolution or some other burst of creative genius will engineer the problem away.
 Obviously, game-changing technologies will play a big role in cutting America's consumption of fossil fuels. They will also be essential to achieving the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that most scientists think will be necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. But as it frames its strategy to deal with both problems, the Obama administration cannot overlook the low-hanging fruit -- the gains to be had from making existing technologies more efficient. 
 The plain truth is that the United States is an inefficient user of energy. For each dollar of economic product, the United States spews more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than 75 of 107 countries tracked in the indicators of the International Energy Agency. Those doing better include not only cutting-edge nations like Japan but low-tech countries like Thailand and Mexico.
 True, energy efficiency has improved, especially in states like California. But American drivers, households and businesses still use more energy than those in most other rich countries to do the same thing. The United States spends more energy to produce a ton of cement clinker than Canada, Mexico and even China. It is one of the most energy-intensive makers of pulp and paper, emitting more than three times as much carbon dioxide per ton as Brazil and twice as much as South Korea. 
 Per-capita carbon dioxide emissions by households in the United States and Canada are the highest in the world -- in part because of bigger homes. And the energy efficiency of electricity production from fossil fuels is lower in the United States than in most rich countries and some poor ones, mainly because of the higher share of coal in the mix. 
 Transportation tells the same story. The United States uses the most energy per passenger mile among the 18 rich economies surveyed by the energy agency. In 2006, the American auto fleet used, on average, a little less than five gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. The Irish went the same distance with under four gallons, the Italians with less than three, basically because they use smaller cars that get better mileage.
 The Union of Concerned Scientists points out that switching from an S.U.V. that gets 14 miles per gallon to one that gets 16 would save the same amount of fuel as swapping a 35-mile-a-gallon car for a 51-m.p.g. new generation gas-sipper. This is not an argument for more S.U.V.'s. It simply shows that we can wring savings from modest efficiency gains in products we already use. 
 A study by McKinsey & Company last year argued that most of the carbon abatement needed between now and 2030 could be achieved with existing technologies, things like insulating homes, improving fuel efficiency, and switching to concentrated laundry detergents to reduce packaging and transport costs. Merely improving transmissions would vastly increase fuel economy. 
 A quantum jump in energy efficiency will still require political leadership. Cheap energy has kept America from making the necessary investments. Yet they must be made; neither the country nor the atmosphere can wait for high tech to ride to the rescue.

HEADLINE: Cost of Borrowing Zooms Up for Corporations

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Like consumers and homeowners, America's corporations binged on easy credit when times were flush, racking up huge debts. Now the bills are due, and paying them back will not be easy, or cheap.
This year alone, more than $700 billion in corporate loans will come due, according to Standard & Poor's. That is the size of the federal bailout of the financial sector. Many companies were counting on being able to borrow more money to meet those obligations and kick their debt farther down the road.
But with the credit markets still tight, corporations are being forced to pay much higher interest rates than they did a few years ago, putting more strain on balance sheets already hammered by falling profits and a grinding recession. 
It is a lesson the discount carrier Southwest Airlines learned firsthand in December, when it went to the bond markets to raise $400 million, in part to cover its losses from betting that fuel costs would stay high.
Southwest, the only domestic airline with an investment-grade credit rating, put up 17 of its Boeing jets as collateral and agreed to pay interest of 10.5 percent, nearly double the rate it had paid in 2004 to raise $350 million. The company chafed at the costs, but it paid them because it needed cash and did not know what credit markets would look like in six months or a year.
''That's the market now,'' said Laura Wright, the airline's chief financial officer. ''There is not money available at the rates we were able to get a year ago.''
Southwest said it had seized the opportunity to raise cash at a time when other companies could not borrow at all. Companies with poor credit ratings are virtually locked out of credit markets or face the prospect of paying 20 percent interest. Many of them are slashing costs, canceling projects or putting assets up for sale to avoid defaulting on their debts.
Despite huge government rescue programs and drastic reductions in the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate, borrowing costs for companies have remained stubbornly high. Investors are wary of anything riskier than ultrasafe Treasury bills, and banks, which lost billions of dollars making bad loans, have tightened their lending.
''This is going to be a very challenging year for corporate treasurers,'' said Roger Lister, chief credit officer at the financial institutions unit of DBRS, the credit rating firm.
Still, borrowing costs have fallen from record levels in October and November, especially for investment-grade bonds, and more companies have sold new debt in recent weeks. Investors who are getting scant returns -- or none at all -- from Treasuries are starting to gamble again on relatively safe corporate debt.
''You are getting a very nice return in real terms,'' said Jim T. Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investments, a mutual fund firm in Boston. ''Companies are willing to pay the price, and the market is willing to take on new issuance.''
Despite this, capital markets are still shaky. Even companies with strong credit ratings are paying about 5 percentage points more than the federal government to borrow money, according to Standard & Poor's. That is more than double the premium they paid last January. Companies with so-called junk credit ratings are paying a 15 percent premium.
''That's an extraordinary spread,'' said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at Standard & Poor's. ''That's unprecedented in the speculative-grade market.''
On top of this, corporate bonds are at risk of being crowded out of the market as the government issues piles of new Treasury notes to combat the financial crisis. And another flood of government bonds is likely if Congress passes an $825 billion economic stimulus measure.
What is more, the government guaranteed nearly $108 billion in cheap debt for financial companies in the last two months of 2008 as part of the rescue package.
By contrast, relatively few nonfinancial companies have been able to raise money in recent months. And those doing so have paid dearly for it.
For example, Nabors Industries, an oil services company, issued $1.1 billion in 10-year bonds two weeks ago, agreeing to a 9.25 percent interest rate. A year earlier, when oil prices were shooting up, the company had to pay just 6.15 percent to borrow $975 million. Taking out a $1.1 billion at last year's rates, could have cut annual interest payments by about $34 million.
The higher interest bill may be too much to bear for some companies. ''Can existing business models support the significantly higher cost of debt that exists now?'' asked Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, an investment firm in San Francisco. ''That's a real issue.''
In all, corporations in the United States borrowed about $172.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly from $179.1 billion issued in the last three months of 2007, according to DeaLogic.
Some businesses planned well for the refinancing crisis, having socked away cash or set up lines of credit with banks that allow them to refinance debt at predetermined rates, said Ed Liebert, chairman of the National Association of Corporate Treasurers. Others that need to bring new debt to market could sell shorter-term notes at lower interest rates or turn to institutional investors like pension funds or insurance companies and issue debt privately, in hopes of negotiating better rates.
Companies with shaky credit are especially vulnerable as their debts come due and are likely to be among the earliest of many expected defaults this year if they cannot find more cash.

HEADLINE: MORE AMERICANS JOINING MILITARY AS JOBS DWINDLE

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ; Malcolm Gay and Sean Hamill contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As the number of jobs across the nation dwindles, more Americans are joining the military, lured by a steady paycheck, benefits and training.
The last fiscal year was a banner one for the military, with all active-duty and reserve forces meeting or exceeding their recruitment goals for the first time since 2004, the year that violence in Iraq intensified drastically, Pentagon officials said.
And the trend seems to be accelerating. The Army exceeded its targets each month for October, November and December -- the first quarter of the new fiscal year -- bringing in 21,443 new soldiers on active duty and in the reserves. December figures were released last week.
Recruiters also report that more people are inquiring about joining the military, a trend that could further bolster the ranks. Of the four armed services, the Army has faced the toughest recruiting challenge in recent years because of high casualty rates in Iraq and long deployments overseas. Recruitment is also strong for the Army National Guard, according to Pentagon figures. The Guard tends to draw older people. 
''When the economy slackens and unemployment rises and jobs become more scarce in civilian society, recruiting is less challenging,'' said Curtis Gilroy, the director of accession policy for the Department of Defense.
Still, the economy alone does not account for the military's success in attracting more recruits. The recent decline in violence in Iraq has ''also had a positive effect,'' Dr. Gilroy said.
Another lure is the new G. I. Bill, which will significantly expand education benefits. Beginning this August, service members who spend at least three years on active duty can attend any public college at government expense or apply the payment toward tuition at a private university. No data exist yet, but there has traditionally been a strong link between increased education benefits and new enlistments.
The Army and Marine Corps have also added more recruiters to offices around the country in the past few years, increased bonuses and capitalized on an expensive marketing campaign.
The Army has managed to meet its goals each year since 2006, but not without difficulty.
As casualties in Iraq mounted, the Army began luring new soldiers by increasing signing bonuses for recruits and accepting a greater number of people who had medical and criminal histories, who scored low on entrance exams and who failed to graduate from high school.
The recession has provided a jolt for the Army, which hopes to decrease its roster of less qualified applicants in the coming year. It also has helped ease the job of recruiters who face one of the most stressful assignments in the military. Recruiters must typically talk to 150 people before finding one person who meets military qualifications and is interested in enlisting. Dr. Gilroy said the term ''all-volunteer force'' should really be ''an all-recruited force.''
Now, at least, the pool has widened. Recruiting offices are reporting a jump in the number of young men and women inquiring about joining the service in the past three months.
As a rule, when unemployment rates climb so do military enlistments. In November, the Army recruited 5,605 active-duty soldiers, 6 percent more than its target, and the Army Reserve signed up 3,270 soldiers, 16 percent more than its goal. December, when the jobless rate reached 7.2 percent, saw similar increases in recruitments.
''They are saying, 'There are no jobs, no one is hiring,' or if someone is hiring they are not getting enough hours to support their families or themselves,'' said Sgt. First Class Phillip Lee, 41, the senior recruiter in the Army office in Bridgeport, Conn.
The Bridgeport recruitment center is not exactly a hotbed for enlistments. But Sergeant Lee said it had signed up more than a dozen people since October, which is above average.
He said he had been struck by the number of unemployed construction workers and older potential recruits -- people in their 30s and beyond -- who had contacted him to explore the possibility. The Army age limit is 42, which was raised from 35 in 2006 to draw more applicants.
''Some are past the age limit, and they come in and say, 'Will the military take me now?' '' Sergeant Lee said. ''They are having trouble finding well-paying jobs.''
Of the high school graduates, a few told him recently that they had to scratch college plans because they could not get students loans or financial aid. The new G. I. bill is an especially attractive incentive for that group.
The Army Reserve and the National Guard have also received a boost from people eager to supplement their falling incomes.
Sean D. O'Neil, a 22-year-old who stood shivering outside an Army recruitment office in St. Louis, said he was forgoing plans to become a guitar maker for now, realizing that instruments are seen as a luxury during a recession. Mr. O'Neil, a Texas native, ventured to St. Louis for an apprenticeship but found himself $30,000 in debt. Joining the Army, his Plan B, was a purely financial decision. With President-elect Barack Obama in office, he expects the troop levels in Iraq to be lowered.
Going to war, although likely, feels safer to him. ''I'm doing this for eight years,'' he said. ''Hopefully, when I get out, I'll have all my fingers and toes and arms, and the economy will have turned around, and I'll have a little egg to start up my own guitar line.''
Ryen Trexler, 21, saw the recession barreling toward him as he was fixing truck tires for Allegheny Trucks in Altoona, Pa. By last summer, his workload had dropped from fixing 10 to 15 tires a day to mending two to four, or sometimes none. As the new guy on the job, he knew he would be the first to go.
He quit and signed up for the Jobs Corps Center in Pittsburgh, a federal labor program that would pay for two years of training, figuring he would learn to be a heavy equipment operator. When a local Army recruiter walked into the center, his pitch hit a nerve. Mr. Trexler figured he could earn more money and learn leadership skills in the Army. Just as important, he could ride out the recession for four years and walk out ready to work in civilian construction.
Although the other branches of the military have not struggled as much as the Army to recruit, they, too, are attracting people who would not ordinarily consider enlisting.
Just a few months ago, Guy Derenoncourt was working as an equity trader at a boutique investment firm in New York. Then the equity market fell apart and he quit.
Last week, he enlisted for a four-year stint in the Navy, a military branch he chose because it would keep him out of Afghanistan and offer him a variety of aviation-related jobs.
''I really had no intention to join if it weren't for the financial turmoil, because I was doing quite well,'' Mr. Derenoncourt, 25, said, adding that a sense of patriotism made it an easier choice.
The Army has struggled to attract the same caliber of enlistee that it did before the war. In 2003, 94 percent of new active-duty recruits had high school degrees. Last year, the number increased slightly from 2007, but it was still 82 percent. The percentage of new recruits who score poorly on the military entrance exam also remains comparatively high. The same is true for enlistees who need permission to enter the military for medical or ''moral'' reasons, typically misdemeanor juvenile convictions. Last year, 21.5 percent of the 80,000 new recruits in the Army required a so-called medical or moral waiver, 2 percent higher than in 2006. Fewer recruits needed waivers for felony convictions, though, compared with 2007.

HEADLINE: Bits: Farmers Market Goes Digital

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
Farmers Market
Goes Digital
The local food movement has been all about buying seasonal food from nearby farmers. Now, thanks to the Web, it is expanding to include far-away farmers, too. 
A start-up, Foodzie, is an online farmers market where small artisan food producers and growers can sell their products. Foodies in Florida, say, can order raw, handcrafted pepper jack cheese from Traver, Calif., or organic fair-trade coffee-flavored truffles from Boulder, Colo.
''You get a similar experience to a farmers market, when you get the opportunity to meet farmers, but it is much more scalable and you get a better selection,'' said Rob LaFave, a Foodzie co-founder. ''Ninety-seven percent of the country does not have this kind of access to artisan food makers.''
Foodzie was started by Mr. LaFave and two of his friends, who met during college at Virginia Tech, where they would frequent farmers markets. Last year, while living in North Carolina, one of them, Emily Olson, now 24, came up with the idea.
She was working as a brand manager for a gourmet grocery chain and realized that other foodies who did not work in the business had no way to discover artisan foods outside their local farmers markets. Small farmers had no way of finding or selling to far-flung customers, either.
One seller, Seth Ellis Chocolatier in Boulder, wanted to reach customers in other states, yet could not take on the building and operating of an e-commerce site and marketing it to national customers, Ms. Olson said. ''We can give them new customers who would have never known about them.''
Foodzie is adding video and other social networking features to help shoppers get to know sellers, as they do at offline farmers markets. ''There's not a great place to talk about the food and artisans they're buying from,'' Mr. LaFave said.
Mr. LaFave is convinced that the recession will not diminish people's interest in buying locally grown and handmade food. ''There is a misconception that all these foods are more expensive than mass-produced alternatives,'' he said. ''People are pouring their heart and soul into these products, using the highest quality, heirloom ingredients. Buyers are really supporting the local economy and small, independent food makers and growers.'' CLAIRE CAIN MILLER We buy from local farmers to support a local food chain, not just artisans. As much as I might like to buy goat cheese from California or truffles from Maine, I will stick to my local sources as much as possible. Hope, Jan. 16

HEADLINE: As Economy Stalls, Fewer New Yorkers Moving Out of State

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In what may prove a silver lining in the latest economic black cloud, New York lost fewer residents to other states in 2007-8 than during any year in at least a generation.
 Between July 1, 2007, and July 1, 2008, New York recorded a net loss of 126,000 residents to other states -- meaning 126,000 more people moved out than moved in -- according to an analysis by demographers at Queens College. 
 Some 257,000 people moved away during those 12 months, the analysis showed, about half the peak of 521,000 in the same 12 months spanning 2005-6. It was the first time the number dipped below 300,000 since the Census Bureau began measuring the annual flows in 1982.
 The collapse of home values across the country appears to have already profoundly affected the ability of people in many states, including New York, to sell their homes and move, curtailing domestic migration. 
 More people who normally might move -- potential retirees and job-seekers -- stayed put, in part because they could not afford to sell their houses and apartments; and fewer moved to traditional retirement and job centers in Sun Belt states.
 Florida, which saw a significant drop in its annual influx of New Yorkers, lost more people to other states -- nearly 10,000 more -- than it gained for the first time in recent history. 
 New York is the leading domestic source of migrants to Florida. In 2005, about 100,000 New Yorkers moved to Florida and 25,000 Floridians moved to New York. Two years later, those numbers dropped to fewer than 60,000 New Yorkers' moving to Florida and 32,000 Floridians' moving to New York. 
 California also faced an anomaly in the most recent data: for the first time since the early 1990s, more people moved out of California than out of New York. That earlier period coincided with a recession in California caused by defense industry cutbacks.
 Holly Reid, a Queens College demographer, said of the trend in New York: ''It's a possible silver lining.'' Despite all the grim economic factors that helped cause the drop-off in out-of-state migration, New York could benefit by retaining its residents. If the trend continues through next year, New York would lose only one seat when Congress is reapportioned after the 2010 census, instead of the two or even three that had been projected, according to Election Data Services, a political consulting firm.
 Robert B. Ward, deputy director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York, said the latest data did not take into account the most recent job losses, which are not unique to New York. ''One factor may be that New York has outpaced the nation in employment growth for most of the past year or two, which is a reversal of most recent history,'' he said. ''California and Florida have also been hurting economically, although Florida's troubles are more recent.''
 Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Indiana, distinguished this recession from earlier ones in terms of its impact on migration.
 ''In a typical recession, major job losses occur in a single sector that is concentrated in one part of the country,'' he said. ''This recession seems to be in full force everywhere. That means if you lose your job in Indiana, New York or California, you cannot easily move somewhere else and find a job.'' 
 ''Because of housing markets, and nearly simultaneous job losses around the country,'' Mr. Hicks said, ''domestic migration will be far less pronounced during this downturn than in previous recessions.''
 The Census Bureau last month showed that Michigan and Rhode Island were the only states whose overall populations declined in the past year. 
 Utah had the highest rate of growth last year, followed by Arizona, Texas, North Carolina and Colorado. For the first time in 24 years, Nevada -- which ranked eighth -- was not among the top four in terms of growth rate.
 Texas gained the most people -- nearly 500,000 -- followed by California, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. 
 ''Most people move within or to the United States for economic reasons,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College demographer. ''With the economy slowing down, and real estate values dropping, it is not surprising that more and more people have begun holding on to what they have and staying in place, rather than seeking declining opportunities elsewhere.''
 Among those most likely to move to New York rather than leave were people between 18 and 34, Asian-Americans and naturalized citizens. 
 A separate analysis of federal tax returns by Jan Vink, a researcher at Cornell University's Program in Applied Demographics, found that while the decline in people leaving New York was spread evenly across the state, the number moving in rose mainly in New York City. 
 More people moved to New York State in 2007-8 from California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Vermont and Washington, D.C., than the year before. 
 Florida is still the top state for people leaving New York, and New Jersey is second, even though the numbers dropped there, too. In a 2005 measurement by the Census Bureau, nearly 61,000 New Yorkers moved to New Jersey. In 2007, the number was 48,000.
 Vicki Been, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, said several factors may explain the migration figures.
 ''Our worry is that if people are under water on their mortgages and the mortgage is more than the value of the house, which is increasingly common, if they sold the house they'd be liable for 20 or 40 or 60 or 80 thousand dollars to pay it off,'' Professor Been said. ''That may very well lock people in.
 ''A second explanation,'' she said, ''is they're just reluctant to sell when they hope prices will go back up.'' 
 As William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, put it: ''Many would-be movers were stranded in states previously thought of as unaffordable.''
 California and New York each lost a quarter-million migrants to more affordable states in 2004-5, he said, roughly double what they lost last year. 
 ''New York's migration has also responded to ups and downs in the financial industry and to housing affordability, but California seems to be much more volatile due to the dynamic push-and-pull migration relationship it has with surrounding Western states,'' Dr. Frey said. ''Still, in the last two years, as the housing market cooled down elsewhere, New York has been more successful than California in reducing the migration hemorrhaging it suffered during the go-go home-buying years earlier in the decade.''
 Florida has never suffered a net loss from one decade to the next, and the 10,000-person deficit in domestic migration last year may also be a first.
 Grant I. Thrall, a geography professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said: ''At the recent peak, 1,000 people per day were moving to Florida. However, 400 people per day were leaving Florida. Now, out-migration has increased and in-migration has declined.'' 
 Dr. Thrall predicted, however, that while Tennessee and the Carolinas were also competing for retirees, migration to Florida would increase again because the number of aging baby boomers is so large and the state remains an appealing destination for them.

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Drop Has Dire Results for Legal Aid Groups

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Scores of legal aid societies that help poor people with noncriminal cases -- like disputes over foreclosures, evictions and eligibility for unemployment benefits -- are being forced to cut their staffs and services, even as requests for help have soared. 
 In an odd twist, the societies have been hit hard by the Federal Reserve's steep reduction of its benchmark interest rate, which finally plunged last month to near zero. 
 The rate decline, though generally welcomed as a blow against the recession, has had an unplanned and severe effect on legal aid societies, which depend heavily on revenues that are tied to the federal funds rate. As recently as 2007, the rate was more than 5 percent and legal aid agencies reaped more than $200 million for their operations. 
 Now, for many legal aid groups across the country, cutbacks in staffing are expected to reach 20 percent or more over the coming months, even as requests for their services have risen by 30 percent or more. 
 Legal aid groups have long benefited from little-known programs that draw interest earned from short-term deposits that lawyers hold in trust for clients during, for example, real estate transactions or personal injury payouts. The interest is mainly donated to legal services for the poor. 
 But as the federal funds rate declined along with the number of real estate transactions, the payout has fallen precipitously. And beleaguered state governments are also curbing their aid.
 The director of Connecticut Legal Services, Steven Eppler-Epstein, said that local agencies were already giving out pink slips and that 50 of 150 legal positions statewide might be lost.
 ''We are watching the interest rates with a sense of horror,'' he said. 
 The cutbacks are occurring precisely as soaring foreclosures and unemployment, a surge in disputed applications for food stamps and a possible rise in domestic violence have produced record requests for help. 
 Some agencies that, in the best of times, had to turn away half of their qualified applicants are facing ever more wrenching choices about whom to represent, decisions that Steven Banks, chief attorney for New York City's Legal Aid Society, compared to those in ''a MASH unit in a war zone.'' Legal aid can represent only one of every seven people seeking help in the city, he said. 
 In East Texas, where thousands of people whose houses were destroyed by Hurricane Ike last fall are contesting federal denials of aid, and some are living in tents, the regional legal service budget of $16 million is expected to decline to $4 million this year. Paul Furrh, director of Lone Star Legal Aid, said his group was already overwhelmed.
 Low-income defendants in serious criminal cases have a constitutional right to a lawyer. But there is no such right in civil cases, even though the consequences -- losing a home or custody of a child, failing to obtain a protective order quickly -- can be just as life-altering. 
 Federal appropriations for the Legal Services Corporation, the largest source of money for aid groups, have declined over time. This year's level of $350 million is, when adjusted to inflation, down more than one-third from its peak in 1994. Many states provide a supplement, but they are also in a brutal fiscal squeeze. 
 Over the last three decades, every state has adopted a program drawing interest from trust or escrow accounts. Called Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, or Iolta programs, they have been a godsend for struggling legal aid groups, providing $212 million in 2007, according to the American Bar Association. 
 But as a result of the collateral damage from the free-falling interest rate, the Massachusetts budget for civil legal services has been cut to $19 million this fiscal year, from $27 million; the Boston branch expects to lay off up to one-fifth of its lawyers and paralegals in coming months. People with legal troubles and little money, like Jim Vedrani, 53, of Amesbury, Mass., have found themselves on their own. 
 As a technician fixing boat motors, Mr. Vedrani earned a right to unemployment benefits when he was let go. Then he took a job working on a farm, but quit after seven weeks because of what he called extreme emotional abuse by his supervisor. ''He took every chance to humiliate me in front of others,'' he said.
 He applied to reinstate his unemployment benefits, but the farm supervisor testified that Mr. Vedrani had not quit for good reason, and his claim was denied. 
 He appealed and contacted the office of Neighborhood Legal Services in Lawrence, Mass., which had recently laid off 7 of 32 staff members. The employment lawyer was too busy to attend his hearing, and Mr. Vedrani lost. 
 Sheila C. Casey, director of Neighborhood Legal Services, said that based on experience with such disputes, ''We probably could have won it.'' 
 Mr. Vedrani moved in with friends and now does odd jobs. ''With those benefits, I'd have the money to put gas in the car, or to get a haircut or buy shoes before an interview,'' he said.
 Legal aid groups have long engaged in painful triage. A study in 2005 by the Legal Services Corporation found that the agencies it helped finance could represent only half the people who asked for help and qualified for it. Many more people never seek aid. 
 ''Equal access to justice is a bedrock principle,'' said Helaine M. Barnett, president of the Legal Services Corporation. But now, ''the justice gap has precipitously widened.'' 
 New York City reduced its grant for legal aid in 2008, and now, with New York State deep in the red, the 2009/2010 budget proposal of Gov. David A. Paterson would cut the entire $8 million it gives to legal service groups. 
 Legal aid for the poor was a contentious political issue in the 1970s, when Congress established the Legal Services Corporation as an outgrowth of the war on poverty. Conservatives charged that liberal lawyers were trying to use legal services, like class-action lawsuits on behalf of migrant farm workers, to change social policy. Congress has restricted how Legal Service Corporation money can be used: recipient agencies cannot be involved in class-action suits or cases involving immigration, abortion or prisoners, among others. As a result, many agencies do not accept federal dollars. 
 Richard A. Samp, chief counsel of the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative law firm, said that the Iolta programs amounted to ''a slush fund for legal aid groups to do the kind of work the Congress has prohibited them from doing with public money.'' 
 His group argued before the Supreme Court that the programs were an illegal seizure of private income, but the court, in 2003, held otherwise, calling them justified for the public good. 
 Lonnie Powers, director of the Massachusetts Legal Assistance Corporation, said in response to Mr. Samp, ''Iolta is a creature of the states, and the states can decide how it is spent.'' Some states impose their own restrictions. 
 The immediate financing crisis, others note, does not reflect any legislative rebuke but rather the fallout from the recession, combined with surging unemployment and foreclosures. 
 Donna Hawkins, 42, a receptionist at a Boston hospital, said she was always on time with the $1,100 rent on the apartment she lives in with her husband, two grown daughters and three grandchildren. So Ms. Hawkins was stunned when two men showed up in May to tell her that the bank had foreclosed on the property and that she had to move out in 15 days. 
 Her story is ending happily. A legal aid lawyer who took up her case free helped her contest improper filings and expects to win a one-year lease. 
 But for the lawyer,Zoe K. Cronin, of Greater Boston Legal Services, the victory is bittersweet. Her agency expects to lay off 15 to 20 lawyers and paralegals this spring, and Ms. Cronin does not have seniority.
 ''I'm virtually certain that I'm going to be laid off,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tensions Rise on Korean Peninsula

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Edward Wong contributed reporting from Beijing, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
South Korea placed more soldiers at frontier guard posts and told its fishermen to refrain from sailing near North Korean waters on Sunday, a day after the North Korean military declared an ''all-out confrontational posture'' against the South and threatened a naval clash.
 The North Korean threat on Saturday came in the same day when an American scholar said North Korean officials told him that they had ''weaponized'' enough plutonium for roughly four or five nuclear bombs. Also Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Ministry said the country would maintain its ''status as a nuclear weapons state'' as long as it perceived a nuclear threat from the United States.American intelligence officials have previously estimated that the North had harvested enough fuel for six or more bombs, although it has never been clear whether the North constructed the weapons. The scholar, Selig S. Harrison, said the officials had not defined what ''weaponized'' meant, but the implication was that they had built nuclear arms. 
 The North conducted a test of a nuclear device in 2006, but it appeared to result in a fizzle and experts concluded the explosion was relatively small. While the country has often claimed to possess a ''deterrent,'' this appears to be the first time it has quantified how much plutonium it says it has turned into weapons. 
 After the threats on Saturday, South Korea ordered its military to heighten vigilance along the heavily fortified border with North Korea, according to a spokesman for the South Korean military joint chiefs of staff.
 North Korea's saber-rattling toward the South has increased in intensity since President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul a year ago with a vow to take a tougher stance on North Korea, reversing 10 years of his liberal predecessors' efforts to engage the North with economic aid. But what made the threat on Saturday unusual, and more worrisome to some South Korean analysts, was the way it was delivered: in a statement read on North Korean television by a uniformed spokesman for the North's joint chiefs of staff.
 ''Strong military measures will follow from our revolutionary armed force,'' the spokesman, a colonel, said, according to Yonhap, South Korea's national news agency, which monitors North Korean broadcasts.
 Usually the North Korean government issues written statements that are delivered by the state-controlled media; sometimes the statements are read by press officers, not by a uniformed member of the military. 
 The spokesman warned of a clash along a disputed western sea border between the Koreas. Their navies fought skirmishes there in 1999 and 2002.
 On Sunday, North Korea's state-run television and radio were repeatedly broadcasting the statement. They also reported that North Korean workers were whole-heatedly supporting their government, ''swelling with hostility'' toward Mr. Lee.
 After the threats on Saturday, South Korea ordered its military to heighten vigilance along the heavily fortified border with North Korea. Officers along the border were ordered to be on standby at their posts, according to a spokesman of the South Korean military joint chiefs of staff.
 ''We are sending in more soldiers on guard post duty along the border,'' he said on Sunday. ''But so far, we haven't seen any unusual movement from the North Korean military, and our measures do not include redeploying rear-area troops to the border.'' 
 Lee Yong Sun, a fisherman in Baengnyeong, a South Korean island near the western maritime border, said Sunday that the marines there told all fishermen not to sail near the disputed border.
 It is always difficult to decipher the messages that North Korea's government is trying to send with its often bombastic statements. In times of crucial bargaining, North Korea often tries to drive a wedge between Washington and South Korea and raises the stakes by increasing demands and issuing threats.
 With President-elect Barack Obama about to take office and negotiations over the North's nuclear program expected to resume, it is possible that the North is merely setting up its negotiating position. But analysts said the North's remarks could also be an indication that it was intending to hold onto its arms despite an agreement it signed with five countries including the United States in 2005, in which it committed to eventually giving up any nuclear weapons. The exact conditions under which it would do so were left vague. 
 Questions over the health of the country's leader, Kim Jong-il, also complicate any attempts to understand North Korea's aims. In August, there were reports that Mr. Kim suffered a stroke, and since then rumors have swirled about whether he is still making important decisions.
 Mr. Harrison, the scholar, presented North Korea's claims of weaponization on Saturday in Beijing after returning from North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.
 Mr. Harrison, a former journalist who is the director of the Asia program at the Center for International Policy, has traveled several times to North Korea to meet with senior officials there.
 ''They've raised the bar and said, 'We are a nuclear weapons state, and deal with us on that basis,' '' Mr. Harrison said at a news conference in the St. Regis Hotel.
 Mr. Harrison acknowledged that North Korea could be bluffing to use the claim of having nuclear weapons as a negotiating tactic. 
 North Korea had declared to the United States last year that it possessed 37 kilograms of plutonium; officials told Mr. Harrison on his trip that they had weaponized almost 31 kilograms.
 Despite that news, he said all the officials he met with seemed eager to open discussions with the incoming Obama administration. ''All the statements about Obama were very helpful, very respectful,'' he said.
 Mr. Harrison said the North Korean officials had several proposals for Mr. Obama, including allowing North Korea to have access to long-term, low-interest credit to buy food.
 South Korea had no immediate reaction to Mr. Harrison's report.
 Earlier Saturday, North Korea had appeared to toughen its stance toward Washington, saying that reopening diplomatic ties would not be enough to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons. It said it would maintain its ''status as a nuclear weapons state'' as long as there was a nuclear threat from the United States.
 ''We can live without normalizing ties with the United States, but we cannot live without a nuclear deterrent,'' a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry told its official news agency, KCNA.
 In the past, the North had said it would not dismantle any weapons until the United States changed what it termed its ''hostile attitude.''
 In the spokesman's comments, and his similar statement last Tuesday, North Korea laid out its demands as it prepared for a new series of negotiations with Mr. Obama, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday.
 In its Tuesday statement, North Korea indicated that the removal of an American nuclear threat meant the removal of South Korea from the American nuclear umbrella, the introduction of a verification mechanism to ensure that no American atomic weapons are deployed in or pass through South Korea, and even simultaneous nuclear disarmament talks among ''all nuclear states,'' including itself.
 Six-nation talks on ending North Korea's nuclear programs, which include the United States, stalled in the last months of the Bush administration as the United States and North Korea bickered over how much nuclear inspection the North should accept.

HEADLINE: Is a Sweatshop Better Than Nothing?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Where Sweatshops Are a Dream'' (column, Jan. 15):
 Nicholas D. Kristof is absolutely right. Sweatshops are much better than a sharp stick in the eye. But when jobs aren't a pathway out of poverty, they create an asymmetric, unsustainable global economy of producer countries and consumer countries that can stand on its head only so long.
 In fact, the sweatshop workers of China were the canary in the coal mine, the starting point in a vicious circle that has impoverished us all. 
 A managerial ethos that tolerates the exploitation of workers in sweatshops won't hesitate to exploit consumers with deceptive mortgages and melamine-tainted milk and, finally, bilk investors with bogus ''securities.''
 The neoliberal daydream of sweatshops leading inevitably to a prosperous future has brought us to our current global nightmare. It's time to wake up. An injury to one is truly an injury to all.
 Adam Neiman Boston, Jan.
 15, 2009
 The writer is the founder and chief executive of No Sweat Apparel, producer of union-made clothing and sneakers in the United States, Canada and the developing world.
 To the Editor:
 Once again, Nicholas D. Kristof attacks labor standards in trade and the anti-sweatshop and labor activists who support them. He uses the misery of scavenging in Phnom Penh garbage dumps in contrast to Cambodian factories as his case in point. But he misses the point:
 Cambodian garment shops are among the best in Asia because of a deal done with the United States in a trade treaty signed in 1999. 
 In return for access to the American market, Cambodia agreed to abide by core labor standards, including the right to form a union and to bargain collectively.
 As result, the industry grew rapidly and so have unions in Cambodia. 
 Cambodian officials are trying to make good labor conditions their brand in the competitive global rag trade.

 To the Editor:
 Truth is often enough the first casualty of nuanced and sophisticated columns. Not so with Nicholas D. Kristof's Jan. 15 column. 
 Social realities are often so painful that the natural instinct is to be in denial of them. But no remedy for such pain ever came about by staying in denial. Mr. Kristof's argument was both clear and painful.
 People who genuinely care about improving the lot of those caught in the kind of poverty described in his column should listen carefully to his message.
 John W. McGinley Manasquan, N.J., Jan.
 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof seems not to understand that the No. 1 reason for imposing higher labor standards on imports isn't to improve living standards abroad but to maintain them here. 
 Americans shouldn't be asked to compete with workers who think that toiling long hours under abysmal conditions is still better than living in the dump. 
 We should make every effort to eradicate poverty abroad, but not at the expense of creating it here.
 Jeremy Weir Alderson Hector, N.Y., Jan.
 15, 2009
 The writer is director of the ''Homelessness Marathon'' radio broadcast.
 To the Editor: 
 Nicholas D. Kristof's argument against the inclusion of labor rights provisions in trade agreements is based on good intentions but a false premise -- that international labor standards and trade-based labor protections necessarily cause job losses and thus harm workers. 
 In fact, raising labor standards can give a competitive advantage to countries in the global market. 
 In the Cambodia example Mr. Kristof negatively cites, the Cambodian government, manufacturers and unions have actually urged that the program continue because they believe that it attracts foreign investment and helps create stable industrial relations.
 The World Bank's International Finance Corporation -- hardly a bastion of radical labor activists or economic protectionists -- is encouraging similar programs elsewhere because it believes that good labor standards and workers' rights protections are good for business and good for overall development. 
 A final point: When I speak with workers around the world in garment and other export industries, they don't tell me ''Yankee, go home, we are just grateful to have work,'' as Mr. Kristof would suggest they should. Instead, they invariably ask, ''Can you do anything to help us make our jobs better?''

PERSON: John DeFrancis 

HEADLINE: John DeFrancis, 97, Chinese Language Expert, Dies

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
John DeFrancis, one of the most influential scholars and teachers of the Chinese language in the last century, died on Jan. 2 in Hawaii. He was 97.
Mr. DeFrancis died in a hospital after falling ill in late December, according to an official Web site memorial dedicated to him.
Few scholars of Chinese wrote more probingly about the language, considered one of the most difficult for Westerners to master, and fewer still created teaching materials that had so widespread an impact on generations of students of Chinese. 
Mr. DeFrancis, who spent much of his career as a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, set out in various books to explain the intricacies of the Chinese language. He tried to debunk commonly held myths about the language -- for example, that Chinese characters are ideograms, which represent ideas. He argued that they are morphosyllabic in nature, meaning they constitute a large system of syllables, albeit imprecise, while also conveying meaning.
Among longtime scholars of the language, Mr. DeFrancis stood out as an iconoclast. Perhaps his most controversial argument was that the writing system needed to undergo a major reformation, with characters that had evolved over thousands of years to be replaced by a phonetic Latin script.
''He was far and away the most important Chinese-language teacher of the 20th century,'' said Victor H. Mair, a China scholar at the University of Pennsylvania who worked closely with Mr. DeFrancis on various projects. ''Plus he was a very influential linguist writing about Chinese, Vietnamese and writing systems in general.''
His experience with the language was deeply rooted in his living and traveling in China at a time when poverty and violence were endemic across the country.
Mr. DeFrancis was born into a working-class family on Aug. 31, 1911, in Bridgeport, Conn. Though his father was a laborer and his mother illiterate, he graduated from Yale in 1933 with a degree in economics. He found it hard to get a job during the Great Depression, and so he boarded a ship for China at the suggestion of a dorm mate from a missionary family.
Mr. DeFrancis enrolled in the College of Chinese Studies in Beijing. He had intended to work as a businessman, but he soon became disillusioned with the prevailing attitudes toward the Chinese among expatriate businesspeople. In 1935, he was asked by H. Desmond Martin, a military historian, to undertake a trip across China tracing the path of Genghis Khan.
Together they traveled 1,000 miles across the Gobi Desert by camel and 1,200 miles down the Yellow River on a raft of inflated sheepskins. Seeing the poverty of rural China up close made Mr. DeFrancis profoundly disillusioned with the Kuomintang, the ruling party at the time. Mr. DeFrancis recounted the journey in the book ''In the Footsteps of Genghis Khan,'' published in 1993 by the University of Hawaii Press.
The year after the trip, back in Beijing, he met Katharine Wilson, whom he would marry. They returned to the United States, and Mr. DeFrancis became the first Ph.D. student in a new graduate program in Chinese studies at Yale. He later transferred to a Sinology program at Columbia.
His first teaching job was as an assistant professor in the Paige School of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University, which was directed by Owen Lattimore, the prominent scholar of Central Asia. Mr. Lattimore became a target of the Communist witch hunts led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, and Mr. DeFrancis was himself blacklisted by universities after coming to Mr. Lattimore's defense.
That prompted Mr. DeFrancis to abandon the field of Chinese studies. To support himself, he became a vacuum cleaner salesman for a time, but his academic career was resurrected by John B. Tsu, the head of Chinese studies at Seton Hall University. Mr. Tsu commissioned Mr. DeFrancis to write a textbook for first-year students of Mandarin Chinese. That eventually led Mr. DeFrancis to write a 12-volume series of textbooks published by Yale University Press. The books, known as the DeFrancis series, were widely used in classrooms in the 1970s and '80s.
Mr. DeFrancis moved to Hawaii with his wife in 1966 to direct the Chinese program at the University of Hawaii. She died in 1970. Mr. DeFrancis is survived by their son, Chuck.
Mr. DeFrancis retired from teaching in 1976, but he continued writing prolifically. One of his most popular books, ''The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy,'' was published in 1984. It was in this book that he tried to tackle many of the myths about Chinese, asserting, for example, that the speech forms in China commonly called dialects are actually distinct languages quite different from Mandarin.
His knowledge was not limited to China; he also wrote on the history and the language of Vietnam. But the Chinese language was always at the center of his scholarly pursuits, and he spent the final years of his life editing an ambitious work, the ABC (Alphabetically Based Computerized) Chinese-English dictionary series. The first edition was published by the University of Hawaii in 1996, and two more editions followed. Many software programs have used the dictionary's database.
In researching the book ''Oracle Bones,'' Peter Hessler, a reporter for The New Yorker, interviewed Mr. DeFrancis at his home on Oahu. Mr. Hessler quoted Mr. DeFrancis as saying he had been so embittered by the fact that Mao Zedong and other Chinese Communist leaders did not follow through with a project to overhaul the writing system that he had not set foot in China for more than 45 years.
Mr. DeFrancis argued that the Communist revolution had created an epochal opportunity to reinvent the Chinese language and make it much more accessible. So he felt that Chinese leaders had failed him. He did eventually return to China, on a visit in 1982, but he never lived there again.

HEADLINE: A Pragmatic Precedent

BYLINE: By HENRY LOUIS GATES Jr. and JOHN STAUFFER. 
Henry Louis Gates Jr. is the editor of ''Lincoln on Race and Slavery'' and the producer of the forthcoming PBS documentary ''Looking for Lincoln.'' John Stauffer is the author, most recently, of ''Giants: The Parallel Lives of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.''

 BODY:
UNTIL a martyred John F. Kennedy replaced him, Abraham Lincoln was one of the two white men whose image most frequently graced even the most modest black home, second in popularity only to Jesus. Perhaps none of his heirs in the Oval Office has been as directly compared to Lincoln as will Barack Obama, in part because Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation began freeing the slaves descended from the continent on which Mr. Obama's father was born, and in part because of Mr. Obama's own fascination with Lincoln himself.
Much has been written about what Mr. Obama thinks about Lincoln; but not much has been said about what Lincoln would think of Barack Hussein Obama. If his marble statue at the Lincoln Memorial could become flesh and speak, like Galatea, what would the man who is remembered for freeing the slaves say about his first black successor?
It is difficult to say for sure, of course, but one thing we can be fairly certain about is that Lincoln would have been, um, surprised. Lincoln was thoroughly a man of his times, and while he staunchly opposed slavery -- on moral grounds and because it made competition in the marketplace unfair for poor white men -- for most of his life he harbored fixed and unfortunate ideas about race. 
Lincoln had a very complex relationship with blacks. Abolition was a fundamental part of Lincoln's moral compass, but equality was not. While he was an early, consistent and formidable foe of slavery, Lincoln had much more ambivalent feelings about blacks themselves, especially about whether they were, or could ever be, truly equal with whites.
For example, on Aug. 14, 1862, he invited five black men to the White House to convince them to become the founders of a new nation in Panama consisting of those slaves he was about to free. A month before emancipation became law, he proposed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing financing for blacks who wished to emigrate to Liberia or Haiti.
Degrading words, deplored by most white abolitionists, like ''Sambo'' and ''Cuffee,'' found their way into Lincoln's descriptions of blacks; he even used ''nigger'' several times in speeches. He also liked to tell ''darkie'' jokes and had a penchant for black-faced minstrel shows. The Lincoln of pre-White House days was a long way from the Great Emancipator; ''recovering racist'' would be closer to the truth.
Except for his barber, William Florville, and William Johnson, a servant from Springfield, Ill., Lincoln didn't know many of what he referred to as ''very intelligent'' black people before he moved to the White House. (In 1840, only 116 blacks lived in Springfield, and they were domestics, laborers or slaves.) In fact, if we add up the amount of time he spent with black people who were not servants even after he became president, it probably would not amount to 24 hours.
The truth is that successful blacks were almost total strangers to Lincoln, born as he was on the frontier and raised in a state settled by white Southerners. From this perspective, then, Lincoln most probably would have been shocked, perhaps horrified, by Mr. Obama's election. Like the majority of Northern whites, Lincoln had a vision of America that was largely a white one.
Once in office, though, he met with more black leaders than any president before him, including Sojourner Truth (whom he unfortunately addressed as ''Aunty''), Henry Highland Garnet and Martin R. Delany, even if he never invited one to a formal meal. But we also know that Lincoln could recognize exceptional people, regardless of race.
As president, he became quite taken with one black man, Frederick Douglass, who initially seems to bear much in common with Barack Obama. Both Mr. Obama and Douglass had one black and one white parent; both rose from humble origins to become famous before age 45; both are among the greatest writers and orators of their generations; and both learned early to use words as powerful weapons. Lincoln, seeing this masterly orator of mixed-race ancestry, would most likely first have been reminded of his exceptional friend, Douglass.
Lincoln's respect for Douglass -- the first, and perhaps only, black man he treated as an intellectual equal -- was total. He met with him at the White House three times and once told a colleague that he considered Douglass among the nation's ''most meritorious men.'' And just after delivering his second inaugural address, Lincoln asked Douglass what he thought of the speech, adding that ''there is no man in the country whose opinion I value more than yours.''
The fact that Lincoln was no natural friend of the Negroes arguably makes his actions on their behalf all the more impressive, even if they were motivated by the urgent pragmatism of war. He and Douglass were unlikely allies: Douglass was a firebrand in the prophetic tradition, whereas Lincoln -- like Barack Obama -- spoke of pragmatism and post-partisanship. While Mr. Obama's election may mark the triumph of Douglass's grand historical project for American race relations, it doesn't mark the ascent of another Douglass.
Lincoln's great achievement, in the eyes of posterity, was really the outcome of his ingrained pragmatism. The Emancipation Proclamation was born of a certain opportunism (to win the war, Lincoln said, he needed freed slaves to defeat their former masters), and is not a lesser thing for it. Perhaps there is a lesson for Mr. Obama here: those who invoke high ideas and scorn compromise often bring themselves into disrepute. Those whose actions are conditioned by an exquisite sense of frailty, by an understanding that it's more important to avoid the worst than to attain the best, may better serve those ideals in the end.
Is Barack Obama another Abraham Lincoln? Let's hope not. Greatness -- witness the presidencies of Lincoln, say, and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- is forged in the crucible of disaster. It comes when character is equal to cataclysm. A peacetime Lincoln would have been no Lincoln at all. Let's hope that Mr. Obama, for all of his considerable gifts, doesn't get this particular chance to be great.
Barack Obama has written that Lincoln's ''humble beginnings ... often speak to our own.'' Once Lincoln had recovered from his shock that a descendant of ''amalgamation'' (about which he once expressed reservations) had ascended to the presidency, one suspects their mutual embrace of economic independence and natural rights, their love and mastery of the English language, their shared desire to leave their mark on history, and their astonishing gift for pragmatic improvisation, would have drawn him to a man so fundamentally similar to himself.

HEADLINE: Impact of Paterson's Health Care Plan May Be Limited

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
It is one of the biggest black holes in the nation's health care system: vast numbers of young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 with no health insurance.
 To plug the gap, Gov. David A. Paterson is preparing a plan that will allow many more young adults to be claimed as dependents on their parents' health insurance plans, a move he described as a significant step toward achieving universal health care in New York.
 The plan was praised by some health care experts as a major step forward, but early evidence from the roughly two dozen other states that have adopted similar programs suggests that their effectiveness in shrinking the ranks of the uninsured has been modest at best. 
 ''We've reviewed the laws and regulations from all 25 states,'' said Joel C. Cantor, the director of the Center for State Healthy Policy at Rutgers University, who is studying the national impact of the state laws on insuring young adults. ''This is about as incremental as incremental gets.''
 Under Mr. Paterson's proposal, employees would be able to claim dependents up to age 29 as part of their health care coverage, up from the current limit of 19, or 22 for full-time students.
 Young adults represent one of the largest groups in the country lacking insurance. According to the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research group in New York, 13.7 million people between the ages of 19 and 29 across the country went without medical insurance in 2006, a number that represented nearly a third of the country's uninsured population that was not elderly.
 In New York, 800,000 people in that age group have no insurance, according to the governor's office, or about 31 percent of the state's uninsured population. About 80,000 young people could be insured within the first year of the governor's plan, which is subject to approval by the Legislature. The estimate is based on enrollment rates in New Jersey, where a similar law was adopted in 2006. 
 It is unclear how much support the proposal will have in the Legislature, but Mr. Paterson said neither businesses nor the state would shoulder the extra cost, which instead would be absorbed by the families who opted for expanded coverage. 
 ''The plan seems like a very legitimate step in the right direction toward improving access to health care,'' said Austin Shafran, a spokesman for the new Senate majority leader, Malcolm A. Smith. ''We're really taking a look at it.''
 There are numerous reasons young adults tend to be uninsured. Public programs and parents' policies often set a cutoff for dependents at age 19 or at graduation from college. Young people often start their careers working part time or for employers who do not offer health coverage. Or they decide not to buy insurance because of the cost, or simply because they believe their youth makes them invincible. 
 In that age group, members of ethnic and racial minorities are more likely to be uninsured than whites -- more than a third of African-Americans and half of Hispanics nationwide are uninsured, compared with roughly one in four whites. 
 The raising of the age limit mandated by numerous state laws was intended to bridge that age gap, at least for dependents whose parents have coverage. But gauging its impact has been difficult. 
 Few states where the age gap now is higher have gathered data about how many young people obtain insurance. One exception is New Jersey, which allowed parents to claim adult children up to the age of 30 (the age was recently raised to 31) as long as their dependents were unmarried, had no children of their own and were living in the state or enrolled full time in college. 
 About 15,000 young adults have been enrolled as dependents since the state increased the age limit in 2006, with 5,000 using it for a short time before dropping out and 10,000 still enrolled, said Marshall McKnight, a spokesman for New Jersey's Department of Banking and Insurance. 
 ''It is considered a success intended to provide temporary coverage for those who needed it,'' Mr. McKnight said.
 But Wardell Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, said the impact of the age-limit extension had not been as great as state officials had envisioned because of the law's restrictions and because federal laws that limited the state program.
 ''I think the folks in New Jersey may have overestimated the number of folks potentially eligible,'' Mr. Sanders said. 
 While states can regulate insurance companies, the federal government regulates employers that self-insure. Generally, larger employers with 500 workers or more self-insure, meaning they bear the full financial risk of the costs, while small and midsize employers buy insurance from companies that bear the risk. 
 As a result, Mr. Cantor said, 55 percent of the nation's workers who have insurance under an employer's plan are unaffected by state regulations that increase the maximum allowable age to claim dependents because the employer self-insures. 
 New York's law would be structured along the same lines as New Jersey's, but its restrictions would be more flexible, according to the governor's office. Adult children could be claimed as dependents even if they have children or are enrolled in college part time or live in a different state as long as their insurance policies are subject to New York law. 
 The law, like those in other states, would not cover young people whose parents have no insurance, or are unemployed, a group that has been growing since the economy's slowdown. Still, policy experts said the proposed law was an improvement. 
 ''Moving the age up to 29 is very significant for lot of young adults who don't have coverage under an employer,'' said Sara R. Collins, an assistant vice president at the Commonwealth Fund. ''It definitely addresses some of the problem that dependents face when they graduate from high school and don't go to college and whose parents are affected by the laws.''
 Utah was the first state, in 1994, to increase the age limit for dependents. Most states set the maximum age at which parents can claim their children at 25. The laws vary by state, but most require that adult children be unmarried and either be full-time college students or live in the same state as their parents -- sometimes at the same address. 
 ''It's the simplest solution, but not an easy solution in any stretch,'' said Kim Holland, Oklahoma's insurance commissioner. ''And we're not sure whether it's the best solution or not.''

HEADLINE: Lyrical Messages About an Inclusive America

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Gospel and soul set the tone on Sunday afternoon for ''We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial.'' The African-American music that finds the promise of hope amid tribulation was just about everybody's music at an all-star event designed to be somberly uplifting and devout, as well as celebratory without triumphalism. 
 A swaying, red-robed gospel choir started Bruce Springsteen's ''The Rising,'' his song about a Sept. 11 rescuer who finds a kind of resurrection in his sacrifice. A choir joined John Mellencamp on the ''Ain't that America'' choruses of ''Pink Houses,'' which also mentions wanting a boy to grow up to be president. 
 The county music star Garth Brooks had a youth choir -- in red and blue windbreakers -- singing along as he segued ''American Pie'' into the Isley Brothers' soul classic ''Shout'' and then his own 'We Shall Be Free,'' a gospel-rooted song about community and the end of discrimination. And the concert's finale belonged to Beyonce, whose ''America the Beautiful'' started out sultry and turned into a hymn. 
 In some ways, ''We Are One'' was the kind of all-star inaugural pageant that also began the Clinton presidency: pop performances sandwiched between quotations from presidents -- and, at ''We Are One,'' from Rosa Parks and Thurgood Marshall -- calling for unity and renewal. Hundreds of thousands of people attended, and it was telecast and broadcast live by HBO and National Public Radio.
 Agenda points were ticked off: the economy, the environment, the arts, respect for the military, community service. After quotations from Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy came Mary J. Blige, belting the affirmations of Bill Withers' gospelly hit ''Lean on Me''; HBO's cameras showed Michelle Obama singing along. Mr. Springsteen and one of his role models, the 89-year-old folk and agitprop singer Pete Seeger, 
 Yet ''We Are One'' was also very consciously a recognition that Mr. Obama is America's first African-American president-elect. There was video from the concert Marian Anderson gave at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939, after being refused the use of Constitution Hall. When the sexagenarian soul singer Bettye LaVette and the New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi sang Sam Cooke's ''A Change Is Gonna Come,'' they changed the last verse to declare: ''A change has come.'' And when U2 sang ''Pride (In the Name of Love),'' its song about Martin Luther King, Bono spoke about the 1963 March on Washington and added, ''On Tuesday, that dream comes to pass!'' 
 Bono also changed the lyrics of U2's ''City of Blinding Lights'' to praise Mr. Obama and vow, ''America is getting ready to leave the ground.'' He also offered what may have been the concert's only contentious, off-message moment; during ''Pride,'' he preached about Ireland, Europe and Africa sharing Martin Luther King's dream and added, ''It's also a Palestinian dream.'' 
 Reflecting the current state of pop, a plurality of the program's stars were R&B singers -- so many of them that they often shared songs. Usher and Shakira sang verses of Stevie Wonder's ''Higher Ground''; Mr. Wonder presided from a platform, playing his clavinet, and sang an a cappella ''O-ba-ma'' as a playful postscript. 
 Heather Headley, a Broadway star who just released a gospel album, joined the operatic singer Josh Groban in ''America,'' adding churchy flourishes. John Legend out-sang James Taylor on Mr. Taylor's ''Shower the People,'' which also featured the country singer Jennifer Nettles from Sugarland. And Will.i.am, whose music-video adapation of an Obama speech became the widely seen online hit ''Yes We Can,'' was joined by Herbie Hancock on keyboard and Sheryl Crow in Bob Marley's reverent ''One Love''; in it, he rapped, ''to discriminate only generates hate.'' 
 It was, by design, a concert full of messages about an inclusive America. Its penultimate song had Mr. Seeger, who survived being blacklisted during the McCarthy era, leading a singalong on a full-length version of Woody Guthrie's ''This Land Is Your Land,'' with one of his admirers, Mr. Springsteen, by his side. Tom Hanks narrated Aaron Copland's orchestral setting of quotations from Lincoln, ''A Lincoln Portrait.'' 
 But not all was earnestness. When Jamie Foxx followed quotations from Thurgood Marshall with quotations from Mr. Obama, he did an affectionate impression of Mr. Obama's own delivery -- drawing laughs down the length of the mall, and a broad, delighted smile from the president-elect.

HEADLINE: In Britain, New Round For Bailout

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
To stabilize a teetering economy, the government bails out several of the nation's largest banks in hopes that credit will flow again. When that does not work, officials return with yet more taxpayer money and, this time, new initiatives to goad banks into lending. 
 Sound familiar? That is what is happening in Britain, where Prime Minister Gordon Brown plans to unveil a second bank bailout on Monday to stoke lending after an earlier $:37 billion, or $54.5 billion, program using taxpayer funds to take stakes in troubled banks failed to get credit flowing in the broader economy. 
 ''We have recapitalized the banks, we have injected money into the economy,'' Mr. Brown said in Egypt on Sunday, where he was attending talks on Gaza. ''At the same time, we know that the essential problem that has been holding back banks internationally is the resumption of lending,'' Brown said, Bloomberg News reported.
 Britain will insure banks against swaths of potential losses from toxic assets still lodged on their balance sheets, in exchange for a fee and a commitment from the banks to start lending again, people briefed on the plan said Sunday. 
 The move comes as the United States throws a second lifeline to Citigroup and Bank of America, and considers new ways to relieve banks of their troubled assets using hundreds of billions in new money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. 
 On Sunday, David Axelrod, a top adviser to President-elect Barack Obama, said on ABC's ''This Week'' program that the second half of the $700 billion TARP fund, to be released after Mr. Obama is in office, must be administered in a way that will get ''credit flowing again to businesses and families across the country. That hasn't happened with the expenditure of the first $350 billion.''
 The British initiative would allow banks to identify their worst-performing, subprime-mortgage-related assets, while also keeping the taxpayer's exposure limited.
 The strategy follows a surge of criticism that the plan Mr. Brown devised at the height of the financial crisis has not stimulated bank lending, even as the economy hurtles toward recession. Last week, shares of British banks plummeted on renewed fears that banks worldwide would be hit with larger write-downs, and face the possibility of nationalization.
 On Friday, Barclays, which snapped up Lehman's broker-dealer business a day after the investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection in September, suffered a 25 percent plunge in its stock price on fears of a large write-off.
 Some analysts blamed the end of a government-imposed ban against short-sales for the stock's decline. 
 In response to the plunge, Barclays said in a statement that its board ''knows no justification for the fall in the share price.'' It said it would announce results for 2008 on Feb. 17, and expected ''to report profit before tax for the year, after reflecting all costs, impairment and market valuations, well ahead of the $:5.3 billion consensus estimate of sell-side analysts.''
 Last fall, Barclays refused government funds that came with restrictions on dividends and compensation. In November, angry shareholders lashed out at directors for planning to raise $10.5 billion -- mostly from Middle Eastern investors -- and dilute existing shares.
 HSBC, another British banking powerhouse, has also been buffeted by concern about its financial health, even though it was widely believed to have escaped the worst of the financial crisis. 
 Its stock slid last week after a Morgan Stanley report said HSBC would have to raise as much as $30 billion in new capital and cut its dividend because of the worsening economic climate and its thin capital base. HSBC maintains that its capital position is strong. It declined to comment on whether it needed to raise more money.
 While Barclays and HSBC may have attracted the attention of short-sellers, weaker banks expecting huge losses, like the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, are expected to make the most use of the government's new insurance plan. 
 Analysts expect it to cover over $:100 billion in distressed assets and to include a swap program that would raise the government's stake in banks like Royal Bank of Scotland, while decreasing the high interest rates that banks are now paying on their preferred government-held shares. The government already owns close to 60 percent of Royal Bank of Scotland, and could increase that stake under the new initiative. 
 Britain's Conservative opposition has scored points against Mr. Brown's Labor Party with rising criticism that Mr. Brown's original bank plan was inadequate. With a 2010 deadline for a general election, the extent to which Mr. Brown's latest bank plan is perceived as successful could have a significant effect on his political fortunes.

HEADLINE: Fox News Primes Itself For a Shift

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When the White House changes occupants this week, it may also change channels.
 Barack Obama's inauguration on Tuesday marks the end of an era for the Fox News Channel, the cable news network of choice during the George W. Bush years.
 Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary from 2003 to 2006, said in an interview last week that ''a number of people viewed Fox as an outlet that would be more favorable'' than other media groups to the Bush administration. He emphasized that this feeling applied to the network's conservative commentators, not its correspondents.
 But the network is showing no concern about the new administration; if anything, it seems re-energized. With a series of program changes this month, Fox News is doubling down on the programming strategy that has made it the No. 1 cable news network for seven years. 
 Some of the network's prominent conservative hosts seem invigorated about being back on offense; Sean Hannity, one of television's foremost voices of opposition to Mr. Obama, introduced a ''liberal translator'' on his prime-time program last week. 
 The media world will watch carefully to see whether Fox receives the same treatment from an Obama White House that it received from Mr. Bush's. And it will wait and see whether Fox can stave off its two primary competitors, CNN and MSNBC, in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that matters most to advertisers.
 Fox easily leads the other cable networks in that demographic on a total day basis. But for a couple of important hours, the gap has narrowed. On at least 10 days since the election, Fox's 9 p.m. program ''Hannity & Colmes'' has been surpassed in the competition for viewers in that demographic by Rachel Maddow, the new MSNBC host.
 The stiff competition may reflect a surge of interest in Mr. Obama. Nevertheless, Fox still commands a larger audience than its competitors, making it an important pulpit for many politicians. And as Mr. Obama's supporters flood this city for the inauguration, they may notice an outsize reminder of Fox's reach. ''No. 1 for 7 years,'' proclaims a billboard promoting Greta Van Susteren's 10 p.m. program along a busy avenue here. 
 Next month another billboard, this one featuring Bret Baier, will appear in the nation's capital. Mr. Baier, a veteran correspondent for Fox, recently replaced the anchor Brit Hume on the news program ''Special Report,'' the first of three major changes to the network's weekday schedule.
 One week ago, Mr. Hannity bid adieu to his liberal co-host of 12 years, Alan Colmes, and started hosting a more pointedly conservative show, named ''Hannity,'' in place of the left-versus-right format. On Monday, Glenn Beck, a right-leaning commentator who left CNN's Headline News channel last year, will start hosting Fox's 5 p.m. hour.
 By tweaking the lineup and improving the production values, Fox appears to be trying to shore up its base of viewers and reasserting itself for the next four years. Bill O'Reilly, the top-rated host in cable news, Mr. Hannity and Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, signed new contracts last year that will continue through the end of Mr. Obama's firstterm. Mike Huckabee, the former Republican presidential candidate, now hosts a weekend talk show, complete with a studio audience.
 Both Mr. Hannity and Mr. O'Reilly honed their talk show skills during Bill Clinton's presidency. During the Bush years, the network's high-octane mix of news and views started to draw more viewers than CNN, creating a new leader in cable news.
 Will the ratings remain steady with a Democratic president? ''That's kind of the million-dollar question,'' Bill Shine, the senior vice president for programming at Fox, said in an interview Friday. ''I get asked it a lot.'' Expressing optimism, he said, ''All I know is that over the course of the next four years, we're going to do what we do really well -- cover the news in a fair and balanced way and put on a very good product.''
 John Moody, executive vice president for news editorial, disagreed with the notion of Fox as a voice of the opposition to Mr. Obama. He said that the network's news correspondents would cover Mr. Obama objectively, just as they had Mr. Bush. 
 ''Will we give this incoming administration a Greek chorus of exaltation? No,'' Mr. Moody said, ''but that speaks more about the other networks than about us.'' He seemed to be referring to MSNBC, whose hosts have been criticized byFox moderators for their praise of Mr. Obama. 
 Fox News reported its highest ratings ever in 2008, with almost 1.1 million people watching at any given time, 35 percent more than the second-highest-rated cable news channel, CNN. But the gains came primarily from older viewers who are less appealing to advertisers. 
 In the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that Fox sells advertising for, Fox's audience was 12 percent bigger than CNN's during an average hour last year, the narrowest it has been in seven years. (CNN's audience, to a greater degree than Fox's, was inflated by debates and primary nights.)
 Among younger viewers, Fox does not have as much momentum as CNN and MSNBC. Last year, compared with the previous election season in 2004, Fox's 25- to 54-year-old audience declined by 7 percent. 
 Nonetheless, Brad Adgate, the senior vice president for research at Horizon Media, said the network is on a firm financial footing heading into 2009. Mr. Adgate said thatFox News has created appointment viewing on slow news days,ensuring that viewers tune in each day and lift the network's ratings. Audience loyalty allows Fox to charge higher rates, both to advertisers and to cable companies that want to carry the channel.
 Surely, the coming years will have no shortage of compelling news. In an interview, Mr. Beck said some of the most important stories now -- including the widespread economic woes -- are broader than any political party. 
 ''The philosophy of the new show is, how to eat an elephant, one bite a time,'' he said, in a reference to the giant problems the country faces. When it was observed that he cited a symbol of the G.O.P., he added, ''I think we'll do our eating and feasting on both of them -- a little donkey and a little elephant.'' 
 Even some of Fox's vocal critics think that Fox will thrive in the coming years. ''Fox is in a much better position with a liberalish Democrat in the White House than they were with a Republican,'' said Eric Alterman, the media columnist for The Nation magazine. 
 He contends that Fox sells a simple message to its audience. ''The things that Obama faces are very complicated and very large, and a lot of things are going to go wrong, especially with the spending levels we're seeing,'' he said. ''There's going to be a lot of things that you can point your finger at and say, 'Yeah, we were right,' ''he said, referring to critics of Mr. Obama.
 ''That's a much simpler thing for them to do,'' Mr. Alterman added, ''than to defend a failed war and a failed president.'' 
 Mr. Moody said the Obama administration would decide whether the network would receive the same level of access the Bush administration granted. He said that Fox's Washington bureau had worked diligently to break news. ''We had good sources, we had good contacts, and we made the most of it,'' he said.
 Under a new president, Fox may lose a handful of influential viewers. Mr. McClellan, who voted for Mr. Obama, said that TVs in the White House tended to be tuned to Fox in the Bush years. 
 While Mr. Obama did sit for interviews with Mr. O'Reilly and Chris Wallace, host of ''Fox News Sunday,'' last year, Mr. Obama's team did not display the same viewing preference during the nearly two-year-long campaign.
 ''They're certainly going to lose some market share at the White House,'' Mr. McClellan said.

HEADLINE: For Obama, Rare Chance For Bold Start On Big Task

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama is well on his way to finding the silver lining in the economic storm he is inheriting. 
 The two-year, $825 billion economic recovery plan taking shape in Congress includes billions of dollars for renewable energy and a national electricity grid to distribute it, lower taxes for all Americans but the affluent, computerized medical records and modernized schools. These are all down payments on Mr. Obama's ambitious campaign promises, affording him an opportunity few new presidents have had. Not since Franklin D. Roosevelt at the depths of the Great Depression has a president entered office with a bipartisan green light to spend and cut taxes so much. 
 The House and Senate are putting their stamp on the product -- shaving the cost on some proposals like the power grid and rejecting a few, notably Mr. Obama's call to give businesses a $3,000 tax credit for every new hire. But to a remarkable degree, the package reads like an Obama campaign checklist, though he never put a comprehensive stimulus blueprint on paper but instead publicly and privately promoted his priorities. 
 While intended for two years, the recovery plan, at $825 billion, is nearly the size of the federal government's annual discretionary budget for almost everything other than Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
 By comparison, Bill Clinton came into office in 1993 seeking just $16 billion for an economic stimulus. A Congress controlled by deficit-conscious Democrats refused to give it to him. 
 Mr. Obama is moving on other fronts to make good on promises quickly, aware that any president's first year is typically the most productive, and that his popularity at his inaugural could well be at its peak. 
 Working with a Congress controlled by his party, he expects soon after taking office on Tuesday to sign laws expanding a program of health care for low-income children and taking aim at pay discrimination against women. Mr. Obama is also expected to use his executive authority to quickly revive federal financing for embryonic stem-cell research. 
 With new authority from Congress to spend the second half of a $700 billion bailout program, Mr. Obama plans to do more than the Bush administration to press financial institutions to help struggling homeowners avert foreclosure and rekindle credit to individuals and businesses. 
 ''He is going to have a strong message for the bankers,'' his senior adviser David Axelrod said Sunday on ''This Week'' on ABC. ''We want to see credit flowing again. We don't want them to sit on any money that they get from taxpayers.'' 
 Democrats expect the stimulus package to be on Mr. Obama's desk by Feb. 13. ''First, it's going to play a significant role in turning the economy around,'' said Rahm Emanuel, who will be White House chief of staff and has been lobbying his former colleagues in Congress for the Obama agenda. 
 But beyond its stimulating effect, Mr. Emanuel said, the package will advance ''every one of the policy goals'' Mr. Obama laid out in his domestic agenda for change in the campaign: energy independence, reducing health care costs, improving education and helping low-wage and middle-income workers. 
 For example, he cited Mr. Obama's promise to spur hospitals' and doctors' use of information technology to improve care and cut costs. The Obama team is expecting more than $20 billion in the final legislation toward the estimated $50 billion cost of wiring providers nationwide. ''We're halfway toward a goal that's been debated for 10 to 15 years,'' Mr. Emanuel said. 
 Yet challenges across the board threaten the big expectations Mr. Obama has stoked. 
 Money has not been the only hurdle for many of his priorities. The medical technology initiative, for instance, must overcome significant privacy concerns that civil libertarians, patients' groups and others have. 
 Also, for all the attention to Mr. Obama's initiatives, more than half of the roughly $550 billion in two-year spending -- roughly $275 billion more is for tax cuts -- would simply preserve the jobs of teachers, firefighters, public health workers and other local government employees by sending relief to the states, said Scott Lilly, a former senior Congressional aide who is now at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group. 
 As big as the package will be, some liberals and conservative economists fear it is not enough, which would endanger what is now Mr. Obama's foremost promise: to get the economy moving again. ''One of the big problems is that the overall economy is weaker than a package of this size can adequately address,'' Mr. Lilly said. 
 Once the economy does start to recover, long-term financing will be in question for Mr. Obama's energy, education and health initiatives as he and Congress turn to reducing budget deficits. 
 Antipoverty groups are concerned about the future of proposals to expand tax breaks to workers who pay payroll taxes but are too poor to owe income taxes, and to extend Medicaid to workers without health care coverage who lose their jobs. Advocates worry that some of the proposals least likely to be made permanent are those that are most beneficial to low-income families.
 Still, advocates say they are pleased that Mr. Obama is keeping a promise to help change Depression-era rules on unemployment compensation to provide aid to more low-wage and part-time workers who lose jobs. The relief to states gives them incentives to make the changes.
 Environmental groups say they are thrilled by the initial subsidies for clean energy development and for jobs to weatherize homes and public buildings. ''We're looking at this as something to build on, instead of looking at it as we've had to do in the past as, What bad things do we have to stop?'' said David Willett, national spokesman for the Sierra Club. ''And that's a good change.'' 
 Dan Weiss, an environmentalist at the Center for American Progress predicted that the recovery plan ''will turbocharge energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.'' 
 Assuming that the projected jobs are created, said Melinda Pierce, chief lobbyist for the Sierra Club, ''there will be continued commitment'' by private and public entities. 
 Even the more traditional stimulus spending, like that for job-providing road construction, has a twist reflecting the Obama agenda. The roughly $30 billion for road and bridge building will favor repairs over new construction, Democrats say. Repairs can be addressed faster, getting money into the economy quickly. But they are also the choice of environmentalists and the National Association of Realtors, which together oppose new roadways that promote urban sprawl and fuel consumption. 
 Education from preschool through college is also shaping up as a big winner, with $141.6 billion in the House bill. Supporters promote the job-creating potential of education spending not just for the short-term, insofar as it is a down payment on Mr. Obama's promise to stem ''the dropout crisis'' and help young Americans become productive taxpayers. 
 ''The down payment actually builds a lot of the proposed 'education house,' '' said Bob Wise, the former West Virginia governor who is now president of the Alliance for Excellent Education. ''This economic stimulus package shows that as we shift from an industrial to an information economy, education is the new currency.'' 
 Mr. Wise cited a recent study that said that cutting dropout rates in half, for about $5 billion a year, would produce $45 billion in new tax revenues and savings on expenses like welfare and incarcerations. 
 Similarly, Democrats are trumpeting the economic impact of other provisions that depart from standard stimulus spending on things like road construction and jobless aid. 
 For example, Mr. Obama is likely to get at least $6 billion of the $10 billion he sought toward his campaign promise of universal broadband service to extend Internet access to rural areas and other regions lacking high-speed service. Each $1 investment, Democrats say, returns $10 to the economy through increased productivity.

HEADLINE: In Washington, Uplifting Music and a Talk of Challenges

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS; Jack Healy contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Framed by the Lincoln Memorial's austere marble and facing a crowd of hundreds of thousands, President-elect Barack Obama on Sunday offered words of high inspiration about his forthcoming presidency that were interlaced with cautions about unrealistic expectations for quick remedies.
 Two days before he is to take the oath of office at the Capitol, Mr. Obama addressed a crowd that began at his feet below Mr. Lincoln's statue and stretched far down the Mall to the World War II memorial. The sea of people -- scarf-wrapped and stocking-capped, shivering under gray skies and 35-degree temperatures -- had poured onto the National Mall on Sunday afternoon to kick off three days of festivities to celebrate the inauguration. 
 ''Only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now,'' Mr. Obama said to the crowd, which had assembled not only to hear him but also such musical stars as Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Garth Brooks and U2. ''Our nation is at war, our economy is in crisis,'' Mr. Obama said near the conclusion of the ''We Are One'' concert. ''Millions of Americans are losing their jobs and their homes. They're worried about how they'll afford college for their kids or pay the stack of bills on their kitchen tables. And most of all, they are anxious and uncertain about the future, about whether this generation of Americans will be able to pass on what's best about this country to our children and their children.
 ''I won't pretend that meeting any one of these challenges will be easy. It will take more than a month or a year, and it will likely take many. Along the way there will be setbacks and false starts and days that test our resolve as a nation.''
 Despite the size of those challenges, he declared himself ''as hopeful as ever'' that the nation will thrive.
 The concert, shown live on HBO, featured a litany of musicians who sang their more inspirational hits, like Stevie Wonder's performance of ''Higher Ground'' with Usher and Shakira. Before singing ''Pride (In the Name of Love),'' U2's tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., the lead singer Bono referred to Dr. King's speech during the 1963 March on Washington at the same spot ''43 years ago,'' which he quickly corrected to ''46.''
 The Dublin-born singer said Mr. Obama's election was an American and Irish dream as well as ''a European dream, an African dream, an Israeli dream.'' After a pause, he added: ''And also a Palestinian dream.'' 
 Mr. Obama, sitting off to the side with his family, nodded in time to the music and sang along as the country singer Garth Brooks belted out Don McLean's ''American Pie.'' 
 Mr. Springsteen performed ''The Rising'' with a gospel choir, and later returned to sing ''This Land Is Your Land'' with Pete Seeger, the folk singer who is now 89. Other performers included Mary J. Blige, James Taylor, John Legend, John Mellencamp, Josh Groban and Renee Fleming.
 In addition, such notables as Tom Hanks, Tiger Woods and Latifah paid tribute to former presidents, the military and everyday Americans.
 Mr. Obama's three-day inaugural celebration in the capital began on a somber note Sunday morning at Arlington National Cemetery. Mr. Obama, accompanied by Mr. Biden, laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Mr. Obama laid his hand on his heart as a military bugler's rendition of ''Taps'' played across the Virginia acreage that had once been the family estate of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Mr. Obama's wife, Michelle, and Mr. Biden's wife, Jill, stood nearby. 
 The Biden and Obama families then went their separate ways for Sunday morning church services. 
 At the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, the congregation erupted in applause when Mr. And Mrs. Obama, accompanied by their daughters, Sasha and Malia, walked in and took seats set aside in the second row, the Association Press reported. 
 ''Understand that God has prepared you and God has placed you,'' the pastor, Derrick Harkins, said in his sermon. ''And God will not forsake you.''
 On the day before the nation commemorates Martin Luther King Jr., children at the service delivered lines recalling the slain civil rights leader. ''Martin Luther King walked so that Barrack Obama could run,'' said one boy, who was followed by another proclaiming: ''Barack Obama ran so that all children could fly.''
 Mr. Biden and his family worshipped and received communion at Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church, the same church President Kennedy attended the morning of Jan. 20, 1961, hours before his inauguration. 
 The congregants on Sunday included Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who is both a longtime parishioner and Senate colleague of Mr. Biden.
 The priest, the Rev. Larry Madden S.J. did not take explicit note of Mr. Biden's presence but when the congregation was asked to welcome visitors, the audience applauded Mr. Biden, who stood in acknowledgement, the Associated Press reported.

HEADLINE: America Meets in Washington to Start Celebrating Obama's Inauguration

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On Sunday, President-elect Barack Obama got Elizabeth Ross, a 57-year-old African-American woman from Lorman, Miss., to see Bruce Springsteen in concert. Clad in a floor-length black mink coat, matching hat and stunningly manicured nails, Mrs. Ross -- and hundreds of thousands of others, their faces bright with both chill and expectation -- converged on the Lincoln Memorial to kick off America's three-day inauguration party.
 Crammed together as far as the eye could see -- from the seated statue of Abraham Lincoln all the way past the reflecting pool and up the hill to the Washington Monument -- they danced, sang, shivered, cheered, hooted and hollered for the black man who will be America's next president, in what seemed a cross between the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington and Woodstock. 
 Mr. Obama, looking into the mass of faces raised to him, seemed to feed off the crowd. The text of his speech was somber, noting the economic crisis and the two wars, and calling for a new spirit of sacrifice to overcome them. But his voice was upbeat. 
 ''I stand here today as hopeful as ever that the United States of America will endure,'' the president-elect said. ''What gives me that hope is what I see when I look out across this mall.''
 Looking back at him from across the Mall was an ocean of expectations, as people from Napa, Calif., to Detroit to Orlando, Fla., clad in Obama T-shirts, hats, jewelry and even face paint, hugged one another and swayed to the music from the array of heavy hitters from the entertainment world who were performing. ''My father would have loved to have seen this,'' Mrs. Ross said, gazing raptly at the stage. 
 In front of her, Mr. Springsteen was singing ''The Rising,'' the song he wrote after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that pays homage to the firefighters who lost their lives as they climbed the stairs of the burning Twin Towers. 
 Mrs. Ross had never seen Mr. Springsteen in concert. In fact, the last concert she went to was by the Manhattans in Atlanta in 2001.
 And yet, there she was, along with three girlfriends -- all in floor-length minks -- huddled in the cold, tapping their feet to the beat. Four middle-age, African-American women, talking about the Selma-to-Montgomery march in 1965, about Dr. King, about the civil rights movement -- and listening to Bruce. 
 ''I'm so out of my comfort zone out here in the cold,'' said Delphine Straughn-Tupper, one of Mrs. Ross's friends. ''But there was no way I was going to miss this.'' 
 For Mr. Obama and his aides, finding a way to temper and manage all that emotion and optimism may be their biggest challenge in the next three days. The incoming White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was on ''Fox News Sunday'' trying to remind everyone that the country will still be in a recession on Jan. 21. 
 ''We did not get into the situation overnight,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''The problems and the challenges that our country face didn't happen all last week. It's going to take us some time.''
 Aides said that Mr. Obama's inauguration speech would touch on individual responsibility, and would urge Americans to prepare for hard times ahead. Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, told NBC that the speech would declare an end to ''the culture of anything goes'' and demand a new era of responsibility from government, corporations and Americans in general. 
 Once he takes office, Mr. Obama will call in his top military commanders and ask them to figure out a withdrawal plan for Iraq, and will pledge more American troops to Afghanistan, his aides said. In Iraq, ''we're in an area where everyone agrees that we should be on a path to withdrawing those troops,'' his senior adviser, David Axelrod, told ''This Week with George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC. 
 Mr. Obama may also issue executive orders in his first week that call for the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, though the process may take time, Mr. Gibbs said.
 But on the Mall on Sunday, few people were talking about Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo or responsibility. Instead, they were talking about history.
 ''We've been up since 6 a.m.,'' said Sarah Scheffer, 18, of Rumson, N.J., who showed up before the gates opened with a dozen other freshmen from American University to secure a spot close to the stage. ''It's going to be a long day, but it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.''
 People perched in the trees around the Lincoln Memorial and even sat on top of the portable toilets to get glimpses of the stage. Fire trucks parked on closed-off 17th Street in front of the World War II monument, but firefighters were not engaged in fire control. Instead, they stood on top of their trucks as people crowded around them, handing up digital cameras and begging them to take photographs of them in front of the crowds. The firefighters obliged, although one could be heard, grumbling, ''O.K., we've got to wrap this up now.''
 The temperature was 28 degrees, but wave after wave of people kept coming, cramming closer to Lincoln's seated statue. 
 For his part, Mr. Obama, who started his day by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery and trying out a potential new church for his family, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in northwest Washington, appeared to enjoy the concert. When Mr. Springsteen and the folk singer Pete Seeger led a raucous foot-stomping version of ''This Land Is Your Land,'' Mr. Obama sang along with everyone else. 
 From the stage, Denzel Washington and Jamie Foxx appeared, almost in a competition for the role of Mr. Obama when Hollywood tries its first take on the 44th president. 
 Mr. Washington went first, striding confidently on stage -- to the attendant shrieks from women in the audience -- and delivering a speech that sounded like one of Mr. Obama's, complete with references to the legacies of Lincoln and other forefathers. 
 But then came Mr. Foxx, who did Mr. Washington one better. ''Change has come,'' Mr. Foxx intoned, in a drop-dead impersonation of Mr. Obama's speech election night in Grant Park in Chicago. In front of him, a delighted-looking Mr. Obama was grinning.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Academy Thinks Big, Despite All

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Even as cultural organizations across the city are contracting in a grim economic climate, the Brooklyn Academy of Music has embarked on a $300 million expansion effort that calls for a new theater, three or four spaces for screening films, new festivals for opera and Muslim culture and a shored-up endowment, officials say.
 Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Academy, acknowledged that the move might seem surprising to donors and to struggling arts institutions. 
 ''Announcing this campaign is not meant to be arrogant,'' she said in an interview. ''It's meant to be thoughtful. We cut our budget by $1.4 million this year.'' (Last year's budget was $40 million.) ''At the same time, we want to be forward-thinking.'' 
 The five-year campaign, to be announced on Wednesday, actually started quietly last year, Ms. Hopkins said. More than half of the money -- $160 million -- has already been raised, including $22.5 million from the city and a $10 million gift from Jeanne Donovan Fisher, the widow of Richard B. Fisher, who served as chairman of the Academy's endowment trust. 
 Ms. Hopkins acknowledged that the institution faced an enormous challenge, given the recent plunge in so many New Yorkers' and corporations' investment portfolios. ''It's going to be very hard; we have a huge job to do,'' she said. ''It's a 5-year campaign, but it may take 10 years.''
 But she added that the Academy had a list of potential donors that she had yet to approach. ''Some of them will give, and some of them won't,'' she said, adding that the institution remained ''committed and focused.''
 The new 263-seat theater, planned for a former Salvation Army building next to the Academy, on Ashland Place in Fort Greene, will be named after Mr. Fisher and designed by the architect Hugh Hardy. Construction is to begin in the fall, with performances starting in 2012, the Academy said.
 The plan reflects the Academy's recognition of how essential the organization, founded in 1861, has become in recent years as an economic and cultural anchor for Brooklyn, and for Fort Greene in particular. 
 ''BAM is so important to the success of the whole community,'' Ms. Hopkins said. ''When we are dark, the whole block starves.''
 Ms. Hopkins said the institution was already one of the borough's leading employers. The new building project would use 125 construction workers daily and involve more than 800 tradesmen. ''That's one of the reasons we're doing this now,'' she said. ''The other reason is that history demands it in a certain way.''
 For nearly a decade the city has been working to create a BAM Cultural District by converting vacant and underused properties in the area into spaces for arts organizations. The Theater for a New Audience, for example, is completing plans for a new home in the district, also designed by Mr. Hardy. A new building adjacent to the BAM Harvey Theater is to house UrbanGlass, a nonprofit center devoted to glass blowing, and BRIC, another nonprofit arts organization, which provides public access television and arts programming for the borough, including the Celebrate Brooklyn! summer concert series. That project is also to begin construction this year. 
 Joe Chan, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, which is overseeing the arts district's development, said he thought the Academy's new theater would play a critical role in advancing the district's growth. ''It will add a new type of venue which is smaller, less costly to operate and more accessible,'' he said.
 The Academy currently operates two stages, the Howard Gilman Opera House, which has about 2,000 seats, and BAM Harvey, which has 874. 
 ''BAM needs a new, small, intimate, completely flexible theater that can respond to the art-making of the 21st century,'' said Joseph V. Melillo, the institution's executive producer. In addition to the theater auditorium, whose seats will be removable, the building is to include a large rehearsal space, classrooms, offices and a green roof. Much of the new complex has already been named after donors: the Peter Jay Sharp Lobby, the Judith R. and Alan H. Fishman Space, the Samuel H. Scripps Stage. 
 ''The roof is not named yet, but hopefully it will be,'' Ms. Hopkins said.
 The Academy will use the theater for half the year. It will be available for rental to local organizations the rest of the year at subsidized rates, a policy made possible by a $2 million grant from the Independence Community Foundation, which supports development, education and the arts in Brooklyn. The Academy has organized a community council to develop a business plan to address neighborhood needs and provide technical assistance and training in areas like marketing.
 The new film-screening spaces will be in another building in the district that has yet to be identified, Academy officials said. That space will also include room for exhibitions and events. 
 The broader plan also includes upgrading the BAM Harvey Theater -- new seats, a reconfigured lobby and improved food service -- and bolstering the Academy's endowment to $110 million from the current $67 million. 
 The Academy seems to be starting on more solid ground than it has for past ventures. In its last fiscal year the organization had no deficit for the first time in decades, after a shortfall that peaked at $4 million in the late 1980s.
 On the programming front, the Academy plans to introduce a biennial opera festival in March 2010, with William Christie as curator. The first program will include Henry Purcell's ''Fairy Queen,'' directed by Jonathan Kent; Marc-Antoine Charpentier's ''Acteon''; and Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas.'' 
 Plans also call for a 2011 revival of Mr. Christie's production of Jean-Baptiste Lully's ''Atys,'' previously presented at the Academy in 1989 and 1992 and jointly produced this time with Opera Comique of France. ''This Baroque music was lost for 200 years, and Christie rediscovered and reinvented it,'' Ms. Hopkins said.
 The Academy will also continue its Bridge Project, a three-year collaboration with the Old Vic in London, in which two new plays directed by Sam Mendes are to be presented each year. The first of the plays, ''The Cherry Orchard,'' adapted by Tom Stoppard, opened this month. 
 With Asia Society and the New York University Center for Dialogues as partners, the Academy will take part this year in ''Muslim Voices: Arts & Ideas,'' which seeks to celebrate the range of artistic expression in the Muslim world. The festival and conference will unfold across the city from June 5 to 19, with performances, films, exhibitions, lectures and an outdoor souk. 
 The Academy has an advantage envied by some other venerable performing arts institutions: its audiences are getting younger. The proportion of spectators under 35 increased to 37 percent in 2008 from 30 percent in 2004. Last year, for the first time, the Academy also saw a tipping of its so-called borough balance: more audience members from Brooklyn than from Manhattan.
 Still, even as it proceeds with these ambitious plans, the Academy will have to grapple with the day-to-day exigencies of the economic downturn. Despite the one-time city gift, its annual city financing has been trimmed by $800,000, Ms. Hopkins said. Should hard times worsen, the Academy will probably have to make additional cuts in its operating budget. 
 But Ms. Hopkins emphasized that the institution had weathered adversity in the past. ''BAM has been around since 1861 and endured fire, flood, the Great Depression,'' she said. ''We are not in this for the short haul.''

HEADLINE: Iran Says It Jailed 2 Prominent Doctors

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
An Iranian intelligence official said Monday that two prominent doctors jailed since June were among four men sent to prison on charges of plotting against the Iranian government with the suspected backing of the United States, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported. 
 Fars quoted the unidentified official as saying, ''Among the four key elements in this case were two doctors named Arash and Kamiar Alaei.''
 The two men, who are brothers, are well-known doctors who founded the country's first HIV-prevention program. 
 Iran said last Tuesday that it had tried four men for attempting to overthrow the government with the support of the United States, but it did not disclose their identities or give any information on when they had been arrested and tried. 
 The official said Monday that ''tens'' of people were involved in the plot to overthrow the government but that the judiciary arrested only four main leaders. ''They purposely cooperated with American intelligence agents in the region and implemented their requests in detail,'' the official said of the four men, according to Fars. He did not identify the other two men.
 The official said the ring was involved in provoking street demonstrations and ethnic unrest in different parts of the country. He said the ring had also picked Iranians from various professions, including fashion designers, doctors, athletes, clerics, artists and professors, and invited them to go to the United States ''in groups of 10 or 15.'' He added that the intelligence ministry was not convinced that all those who went to the United States were involved.
 ''Americans tried to influence them during these trips and convince them that America was the only savior of our people,'' Fars quoted the official as saying. ''Their purpose was to create distance between people and authorities so that when they came back they would put pressure on the government.'' 
 He added that the training centers were in the United States and that they ''sometimes used journalists too,'' Fars said.
 The arrests appeared to be part of a crackdown on activists and opposition figures ahead of the presidential elections in June. Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, said last week that he would run, posing a serious challenge to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose popularity has been falling because of his government's poor economic performance. 
 Authorities jailed three scholars in 2007 on similar charges of trying to overthrow the government but later released them. One of them was Iranian-American academic Haleh Esfandiari, the director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.

HEADLINE: For Peruvians, Baskets for the U.S. Market Bring a New Way of Life

BYLINE: By ROXANA POPESCU

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO DE PINTUYACU, Peru 

 BODY:
Women in this remote Amazon village can weave fibers from the branch of the chambira palm tree into practically anything they need -- fishing nets, hammocks, purses, skirts and dental floss.
 But for the last year they have put their hopes in baskets, weaving hundreds to build inventory for export to the United States. Their first international buyers are the San Diego Natural History Museum and San Diego Zoo, and they plan to sell to other museums and home decor purveyors like the Field Museum in Chicago and eventually Cost Plus.
 The circuitous route these baskets have taken from the jungle to American store shelves started with a bird watcher's passion for natural habitats, passed through a regional government whose policies have become increasingly more conservationist, and, supporters say, should end with better lives for the weavers and their communities.
 The enterprise is one of many ventures here in the Amazon aimed at ''productive conservation,'' which advocates say will save the rain forest by transforming it into a renewable economic resource for local people -- just as some eco-tourism lodges and other ventures in places like Africa and Southeast Asia have tried to do. 
 The greatest challenge has been convincing residents of the communities along the river, who until now largely supported themselves by chopping down palm branches and fishing, that conservation is in their best interest.
 The government of Loreto, Peru's densely forested and least populous region, organized the basket project, which is financed by grants from two nonprofit groups, Nature and Culture International and the Moore Foundation.
 ''Having the government take such a role in a market-based approach is quite novel,'' Amy Rosenthal, deputy director for projects at the Amazon Conservation Association, a nonprofit group that works in southern Peru and northern Bolivia, said when told of the program. 
 She said the state of Amazonas in Brazil has tried a similar conservation-exploitation program. ''It sounds like a well-thought-out program and something that could be wildly successful,'' she said.
 But the program in Peru is not without challengers. Ivan Vasquez, president of the Loreto region, said he had made some enemies for supporting conservation in a region where fishing and logging have been the primary sources of revenue for decades and where oil and gas are seen as the next frontiers. 
 He called himself ''the Quixote of the Amazon.''
 ''We are part of nature. When we destroy nature, we destroy ourselves,'' Mr. Vasquez said.
 He said big logging operations, not small farmers, continue to pose the greatest deforestation threat.
 The changes in Loreto may correspond to a broader shift in Peru's attitude toward conservation. Last spring, motivated by the signing of a free-trade agreement with the United States, the country set up an environment ministry, which has already started to focus on deforestation. 
 The basket project is the brainchild of Noam Shany, an Israeli agronomist and entrepreneur. A bird-watching trip in 2005 led him to a remote village on the Tahuayo River, an Amazon tributary. There, he said, he noticed striking local baskets for sale in a tourist lodge. 
 Mr. Shany, who had previously sold artificial plants to Wal-Mart and cacti to nurseries in California and Australia, decided to put his retail experience to an environmental use. 
 In 2006 he helped found Procrel, a biodiversity program that has worked with the regional government to establish three vast protected reserves. The basket program is one of several conservation initiatives intended to help indigenous peoples benefit from the conservation efforts. 
 Pitching Peruvian handicrafts to retailers in the United States was easy. ''These baskets represent so much more than simply a basket,'' said Nancy Stevens, manager of retail and wholesale operations for the San Diego Natural History Museum. 
 ''When I began to hear their story,'' she said, ''from a local project into a story of sustainability, where they're being developed as a responsible use of the natural resources of this Amazon region -- it just clicked so beautifully with the mission of this museum.''
 Pitching an international enterprise to the villagers was almost as easy. Mr. Shany turned a somewhat haphazard local craft -- women making a few baskets, selling them in a local shop, then making a few more -- into something more like mass production, with higher returns to the producers. 
 Artisans get $10 to $12 for each basket, which sells for $40 in the United States. About a third of that goes into shipping and distribution, and the rest is retailer profit, meaning the company that distributes the baskets gets a little more per unit than each maker. Mr. Shany and Procrel receive nothing. 
 The artisan's cut may not seem substantial, Mr. Shany said, but it is more than double previous monthly earnings. Two years ago, households in this region earned as little as $30 a month selling fish and palm frond roofing at city markets, he said. Today, experienced weavers can earn up to $100 a month. 
 Over time, urban Peruvian employees of the program have brought a new vocabulary to the river communities. Visiting every few weeks, they encourage the weavers to respect deadlines, quality control and inventory requests. On one such recent trip, Mr. Shany delivered a pep talk to his newest recruits.
 ''These stores don't buy one hundred baskets,'' he said. ''One hundred is nothing. Two hundred is nothing. They buy a thousand, ten thousand. You're all going to need to work together.''
 Since the program started, Mr. Shany said, the weavers had not been able to meet demand. ''We can't keep up with the orders,'' he wrote in a recent e-mail message. ''We are training more ladies to increase production and also to involve more people.''
 Ms. Rosenthal said that there were considerable difficulties with any start-up operation like this, not the least of which is falling discretionary spending of all kinds by American consumers as the recession in the United States deepens. 
 Other than that, ''quality assurance is probably their biggest challenge for selling something retail in the U.S.,'' she said. But if successful, the arrangement ''can bring them much better profits and a much better source of income than in local terms.''
 Still, Trevor Stevenson, executive co-director of the Amazon Alliance, a nonprofit group that focuses on indigenous populations, said it was vital for communities to diversify their income and not count exclusively on crafts, which can be volatile, particularly in times like these. 
 One challenge has been teaching the river communities to shift from consumption to conservation on a large scale.
 ''Here, today is today,'' Mr. Shany said. ''Tomorrow is another day. It's an immediate mentality, so replanting, and not cutting the tree in the first place, is really revolutionary.''
 Eblis Chavez, from San Antonio de Pintuyacu, a village of Iquito Indians that is two days by motorboat from the nearest city, said residents had been slowly won over.
 ''We hesitated a bit originally,'' Mr. Chavez said, ''but it makes much more sense to preserve the trees.''
 A year ago, villagers here walked for hours to find irapay palms, whose fronds are used for the ubiquitous thatched roofs sold at markets, because they had chopped all the trees closer to them. They carried the loads on their backs. ''We were slaves of the irapay,'' Mr. Chavez said.
 Since last January, villagers have planted chambira groves 10 minutes away, where young fibers used for basket weaving are ready for harvest every six months.
 ''I'm pleased with this reforestation project, which will remain for my children,'' said Angela Pacaya, who heads the artisan cooperative.
 The baskets are bringing staples, and stability. ''Already, there's more money changing hands. Already we're buying more from the bodegas. Rice, sugar, soap,'' said Erika Catashunga, of Esperanza, another village, speaking by communal telephone. 
 Ms. Catashunga, 25, is now at the forefront of another venture. She has just received the first business license granted to a basket weaver with Procrel, establishing her as the manager of a nine-village empresa comunal, or communal enterprise. Its name is Mi Esperanza, or My Hope.
 Growing up, she never imagined she would manage a global business. ''Not even in my dreams,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Anxiety Grips Restaurants, New Ones In Particular

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
It was 5:37 on a subfreezing weekday evening in the dining capital of America, and in a sleek new Manhattan restaurant named At Vermilion, the staff of 26 had but one option before the dinner rush: to wait.
''Every night, there are butterflies,'' said Rohini Dey, 40, the majority owner of the two-month-old, $4.5 million restaurant at 480 Lexington Avenue, at East 46th Street.
''These are strange times,'' she said, surveying her empty 200-seat restaurant, which offers a fusion of Indian and Latin cuisine.
In a season when diners have been ordering hamburger platters instead of T-bones, the stone-cold economy is a consuming preoccupation for most of the city's 26,000 dining establishments. But especially for new restaurants, January is a roll of the dice. 
''The restaurant business is tough to start with, and survival in New York is especially difficult, thanks to high operating costs,'' said E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the New York City chapters of the New York State Restaurant Association. In the best of times, he said, 70 percent of new restaurants fail or change ownership during their first five years.
''But this is the toughest climate we've seen since I was a kid,'' said Mr. Hunt, 72, who was born during the Depression.
This was no surprise to the workers at the 12,000-square-foot At Vermilion: three hostesses, three bartenders, five servers, four runners, chef, manager, assistant manager and eight cooks and kitchen workers.
''This is literally the calm before the storm,'' said Maneet Chauhan, 32, the executive chef, who placed her own big bet by moving from Chicago to open the new kitchen.
She had arrived at 6 a.m. to make preparations, and now she was walking the spacious kitchen, with its two 4.5-foot-tall clay tandoor ovens, ensuring that sous-chefs were patrolling their stations and readying condiments for the line cooks. The restaurant's menu depends on Indian spices like garam masala, and on cumin, coriander and cilantro, which are also used in Latin cultures.
By 10 p.m., when customers placed the final dinner orders, nearly 100 people had eaten in the restaurant and the lounge, and 70 earlier, at lunch. Ms. Dey said that ''clearly we have to double volumes on a consistent basis,'' adding that despite wildly varying patronage thus far, she thought it was eminently possible.
To survive, Ms. Dey said, the restaurant will need yearly revenues of $6 million to $10 million.
''Going to work in a new restaurant is never a safe thing,'' said Eddie Witten, 30, a waiter who previously worked at Eleven Madison Park and who is hoping that success will bring larger tips. ''But in this economy?''
He left his question hanging, but added, ''I thought, 'This space is so large, it wasn't designed to fail.' '' Indeed, it is 100 seats larger than Vermilion, the popular Chicago restaurant that Ms. Dey and Ms. Chauhan opened five years ago.
The new gamble ''is a little on the nervy side, for all of us,'' said Luis Peralta, a 38-year-old sous-chef from Barranquilla, Colombia, who previously worked at Django and Oceana. ''But we're all glad to have a job. And we all hope we can keep our jobs.''
It would be an exaggeration to say that all of the city's new restaurants are fighting to survive the downturn's undertow.
At the 60-seat Corton, for example, ''We are as busy as we want to be,'' said Drew Nieporent, who opened the high-end restaurant, at 239 West Broadway, in October while the economy was imploding, and won brilliant reviews. ''We couldn't do any more business now.''
No matter the state of the economy, he said, many new owners are locked into an opening date through lease agreements, marketing and other advance commitments. ''If we'd had any inkling that there would have been a financial crisis, we would have re-evaluated,'' said Mr. Nieporent, who owns seven city restaurants, including Nobu and Tribeca Grill. ''But we thought that things would be normal -- until it was too late.''
Ms. Dey, too, had been intensively planning At Vermilion far in advance: by the end of 2007. She had visited 80 Manhattan spaces before choosing one last June. Her new restaurant opened in mid-November in the space of the former Django, a Mediterranean bistro once popular among the now-thinning ranks of financial-services workers.
''From Day 1, we knew that this was a bad time to open, because every investor told us that,'' said Ms. Dey, 40, who has a Ph.D. in economics and worked for McKinsey & Company and at the World Bank in Washington. ''I persisted. Why? Well, because fools rush in -- that, and an entrepreneur's optimism.''
It hardly helps that the restaurant has received mixed reviews. The New York Times criticized the blandness of some dishes and the stringiness of its signature skirt steak entree, while noting that a few of the menu items ''manage to translate the place's ambitions to the plate.'' Crain's New York Business, however, praised that same steak dish as ''a standout,'' but disparaged the lamb shank as ''too timid in the flavor department.''
Ms. Chauhan vowed, however, to ''work towards perfection'' in the kitchen. And one plus for At Vermilion is the years-long experience with the first restaurant in Chicago, Mr. Hunt said, adding that beyond that, ''rookies will have problems, because sometimes it takes as long as a year to get to the point of breaking even.''
Also on the upside, Ms. Dey estimated that the deflating economy enabled her to negotiate a lower sale price and lease, and to drive tough bargains with vendors and building contractors, ''who are very hungry for business,'' she said.
Ultimately, she won the restaurant space at just under $60 a square foot in annual rent -- prime Midtown locations can cost from $150 per square foot to double that -- and the owner of the building, Brookfield Properties, ''extended our lease to 15 years at very good terms,'' she said.
''In the end,'' she added, ''we brought this restaurant in at a cost that was about a third lower than it would have been without the recession.''
New York is, to Ms. Dey, ''the highest-risk -- and highest-reward -- step that we could take,'' she said. ''Investors have put their capital in, and emotionally, there is so much vested in it.''
And Ms. Dey has urged her 15 backers -- who include the novelist Salman Rushdie; Sonny Mehta, chief executive of the Alfred Knopf publishing house; and Sabeer Bhatia, co-founder of Hotmail -- to work their business and social networks to attract customers.
At Vermilion is also offering its fusion fare for parties and off-site catering. ''Since so many corporate budgets are reduced for entertainment, we're targeting weddings, bar mitzvahs and showers, which have held up well,'' said Michelle Zaontz, 24, the restaurant's director of events, who formerly worked at Django and at the Trustees Dining Room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Thus far the clientele is decidedly eclectic. ''We're getting customers who know the restaurant in Chicago, and some from the Internet, and many from word of mouth,'' said Eduard Petrescu, an assistant general manager.
One such customer was Suresh Chakravarthi, a financial services manager who works in the neighborhood and heard about the restaurant from a friend. ''They wouldn't have this at Smith & Wollensky,'' he said as he sampled the chimichurri strip steak with Indian-spiced sweet potato, the same entree that had caused critical disagreement.
The opening has taken its toll. ''I promised myself that someday I would climb Mount Kilimanjaro -- and open a restaurant,'' Ms. Dey said, laughing, adding that last August she trekked to the top of the 19,000-foot volcano, where 10 climbers die each year. ''Only time will tell if that was the easier of the two goals.''

HEADLINE: A Gloomy Forecast for Australian Economy in 2009

BYLINE: By MERAIAH FOLEY

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
The Australian economy, once considered a relatively save haven, is headed for a steep downturn in 2009, in part because of slower-than-expected growth in China, a leading forecaster said Monday. 
 In a starkly worded quarterly outlook report, the Australian research firm Access Economics warned that the mining-led economy ''will unwind scarily fast'' in 2009, sending the Australian dollar and interest rates crashing.
 ''This is not just a recession,'' the report said. ''This is the sharpest deceleration Australia's economy has ever seen.''
 The report predicted that the central bank would be forced to cut interest rates to 2.5 percent, from 4.25 percent, to stimulate growth. 
 About 300,000 jobs will be lost and corporate profits will be cut in half, it said.
 ''China's slowdown is Australia's recession,'' the report said. ''Many businesses will fail, as demand gains shrink.''
 It is the latest in a string of worsening predictions about the Australian economy, which has long regarded itself as relatively immune to the financial problems affecting the United States and Europe because of its dependence on commodities.
 Australian banks have so far avoided crippling exposure to bad mortgage-related debts in the United States, and many economists had believed that continued, though weaker, demand from China for Australian mineral resources would save the country from recession.
 In its last forecast in November, the International Monetary Fund predicted that China would continue to record strong growth and that Australia would be one of the few industrialized economies to grow in 2009, albeit at a modest 1.8 percent.
 But the breakdown in financial markets last year shattered confidence around the world, leaving few corners of the world untouched. A sharper-than-expected fall in Chinese demand for resources exposed Australian vulnerability, the report said.
 Justin Smirk, an economist with Westpac Banking, one of the biggest Australian banks, said the report was ''not far off consensus'' among analysts, who are busy revising their forecasts downward as the global economy continues to sour.
 ''The bottom line is that I would be expecting the I.M.F. to be downgrading its outlook for Australia,'' Mr. Smirk said. 
 Wayne Swan, the Australian treasurer, said the government, which has already thrown billions of dollars in stimulus money at the economy, was prepared to ''take further decisive action'' if necessary.
 But how much more leeway Mr. Swan will have is open to debate. 
 The Australian government has enjoyed steady budget surpluses and is under political pressure to keep deficit spending to a minimum. 
 Access Economics predicted that falling commodities prices would drag company profits down, meaning fewer corporate taxes to fill federal coffers and inevitable budget deficits.
 ''There's no doubt that the slowing of the global economy -- the impact on commodity prices -- certainly has very significant ramifications for growth here,'' Mr. Swan told a national broadcaster Monday. ''It will certainly impact upon the budget bottom line.''

HEADLINE: Your Nest Is Empty? Enjoy Each Other

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE. 
E-mail: well@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The empty nest may not be such an unhappy place after all.
Since the 1970s, relationship experts have popularized the notion of ''empty nest syndrome,'' a time of depression and loss of purpose that plagues parents, especially mothers, when their children leave home. Dozens of Web sites and books have been created to help parents weather the transition. Simon & Schuster has even introduced a ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' dedicated to empty nesters.
But a growing body of research suggests that the phenomenon has been misunderstood. While most parents clearly miss children who have left home for college, jobs or marriage, they also enjoy the greater freedom and relaxed responsibility. 
And despite the common worry that long-married couples will find themselves with nothing in common, the new research, published in November in the journal Psychological Science, shows that marital satisfaction actually improves when the children finally take their exits.
''It's not like their lives were miserable,'' said Sara Melissa Gorchoff, a specialist in adult relationships at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Parents were happy with their kids. It's just that their marriages got better when they left home.''
While that may not be surprising to many parents, understanding why empty nesters have better relationships can offer important lessons on marital happiness for parents who are still years away from having a child-free house.
Indeed, one of the more uncomfortable findings of the scientific study of marriage is the negative effect children can have on previously happy relationships. Despite the popular notion that children bring couples closer, several studies have shown that marital satisfaction and happiness typically plummet with the arrival of the first baby.
In June, The Journal of Advanced Nursing reported on a study from the University of Nebraska College of Nursing that looked at marital happiness in 185 men and women. Scores declined starting in pregnancy, and remained lower as the children reached 5 months and 24 months. Other studies show that couples with two children score even lower than couples with one child.
While having a child clearly makes parents happy, the financial and time constraints can add stress to a relationship. After the birth of a child, couples have only about one-third the time alone together as they had when they were childless, according to researchers from Ohio State.
The arrival of children also puts a disproportionate burden of household duties on women, a common source of marital conflict. After children, housework increases three times as much for women as for men, according to studies from the Center on Population, Gender and Social Equality at the University of Maryland.
But much of the research on children and marital happiness focuses on the early years. To understand the effects over time, researchers at Berkeley tracked marital happiness among 72 women in the Mills Longitudinal Study, which has followed a group of Mills College alumnae for 50 years.
The study is important because it tracks the first generation of women to juggle traditional family responsibilities with jobs in the work force. In the empty-nest study, researchers compared the women's marital happiness in their 40s, when many still had children at home; in their early 50s, when some had older children who had left home; and in their 60s, when virtually all had empty nests. At every point, the empty nesters scored higher on marital happiness than women with children still at home. The finding mirrors that of a report presented last year at the American Psychological Association, tracking a dozen parents who were interviewed at the time of a child's high school graduation and 10 years later. That small study also showed that a majority of parents scored higher on marital satisfaction after children had left home.
While the Berkeley researchers had hypothesized that the improvement in marital happiness came from couples' spending more time together, the women in the same study reported spending just as much time with their partners whether the children were living at home or had moved out. But they said the quality of that time was better.
''There are fewer interruptions and less stress when kids are out of the house,'' said Dr. Gorchoff, at Berkeley. ''It wasn't that they spent more time with each other after the children moved out. It's the quality of time they spent with each other that improved.''
She notes that the lesson from the empty nest may be that parents need to work to carve out more stress-free time together. In the sample studied, it was only relationship satisfaction that improved when children left home. Over all, parents were just as happy with children at home as in the empty nest. (What happens when adult children move back home, their job prospects having evaporated in a brutal economy, has not been extensively studied.)
''Kids aren't ruining parents' lives,'' Dr. Gorchoff said. ''It's just that they're making it more difficult to have enjoyable interactions together.''

HEADLINE: After Sure-Bet Investment Fails, A Bank Contends It Was Duped

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Nearly two years ago, on a Tuesday in February 2007, a Wall Street salesman pitched an investment that sounded almost magical. It was called Gemstone VII. A shiny amalgam of financial instruments, it promised attractive returns -- with virtually no risk. 
 If that sounds too good to be true, that is because it was. Like so many investments that Wall Street concocted in recent years, Gemstone was fashioned from subprime dross. The M&T Bank Corporation, which got the sales talk and subsequently bought into the investment, lost $80 million. 
 At issue now is who should bear responsibility for those losses. Should it be Gemstone's creator, Deutsche Bank, which had sold mortgage investments to customers like M&T Bank while encouraging others to bet against them? Or should it be M&T, which had invested in Gemstone, an instrument known as a collateralized debt obligation, and taken the risks? The two banks are arguing over these questions in a lawsuit in upstate New York.
 M&T Bank says it was duped. Deutsche Bank representatives portrayed Gemstone as safe -- ''fully rock solid,'' and ''a layup,'' M&T contends in its complaint. The German bank counters that M&T executives entered into the investment as consenting adults, and that they knew, or should have known, the risks they were taking. 
 Gemstone may seem like footnote to the financial crisis, but in many ways it encapsulates the story of homeowners, bankers, businesses and an entire economy undone by the lure of easy money. Gemstone also lays bare many of the conflicts inherent in the financial engineering that spread the risks in the American housing market to every corner of the world. 
 Opaque markets in instruments like Gemstone were allowed to balloon with little oversight from regulators. Gemstone, for instance, was not required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is because Gemstone, like many C.D.O.'s, was set up offshore, in this case in the Cayman Islands. It was listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, although it was neither regulated nor traded in Ireland. 
 The consequences of the binge years -- a collapse in the stock and housing markets; a multitrillion-dollar government rescue of the financial industry; and a recession or worse -- has deeply shaken the confidence of professional investors and ordinary Americans. Analysts say investors' trust is unlikely to return fully until Washington and Wall Street address fundamental failings in the financial system that put it in jeopardy. 
 Gemstone, and trillions of dollars of investments like it, have not gone away. Loans that cannot be paid, bad mortgage investments and other worrisome financial instruments are clogging up companies and, increasingly, courts. More than 100 securities cases involving losses of $400 billion were filed against financial firms last year, according to Cornerstone Research. The legal wrangling has only just begun. 
 Among the most toxic investments that Wall Street devised as housing boomed were C.D.O.'s, which bundled together all kinds of debt, including subprime mortgages. But Gemstone was a popular variant: a hybrid C.D.O., composed not only of mortgage bonds but also of credit-default swaps, which have played a critical role in the running crisis. 
 The swaps enabled some investors to multiply their mortgage bets, while letting others wager that the housing bubble would pop. Worldwide, there are about $55 trillion of these contracts, which enable people to make side bets on whether borrowers will default on their debts. The market is so big that problems with even a fraction of these instruments could further destabilize the financial markets.
 How did so many investments like Gemstone go so wrong? Janet Tavakoli, a leading expert on so-called structured investments like Gemstone, says there is plenty of blame to go around. Some financiers who created these investments obscured their risks, she says. And some investors, lured by promises of risk-free riches, became ''willing victims,'' she says. 
 ''It was so outrageous the way these deals were being put together,'' said Ms. Tavakoli, a consultant and author of several books on derivatives and structured finance. The securities, she said, were ''so overrated, and the prices weren't worth it.'' 
 The dangers were clear even to some inside Deutsche Bank. Several months before the bank sold Gemstone to M&T Bank, Greg Lippmann, who headed trading in C.D.O.'s and asset-backed securities at the bank, was encouraging hedge funds to bet against mortgage investments. 
 In the summer of 2006, Mr. Lippmann began giving presentations to select clients and traders at rival banks about the fragile state of the housing market, according to people who attended the meetings. He handed out T-shirts to some clients with a logo that proclaimed his bearish view: ''I'm Short Your House.'' His presentations contrasted with the more bullish opinions expressed by other Deutsche Bank officials.
 ''He would bluntly share his opinion, and he would tell people that were buying that they were idiots,'' said a hedge fund manager who was familiar with Mr. Lippmann's presentations and who asked that he not be named in order to preserve professional relationships. 
 Deutsche Bank declined to make Mr. Lippmann or other executives available for comment. 
 But filings in the lawsuit paint a vivid picture of the case, and of how both the buyers and sellers of investments like Gemstone often overreached, with disastrous results. 
 The story begins in early 2007, at One M&T Plaza, the Buffalo headquarters of M&T Bank, a regional lender with more than $65 billion in assets. 
 At that time, M&T's executives had much to crow about. M&T had largely avoided subprime mortgages and other risky loans, and its reputation was bolstered by the fact that its second biggest shareholder was Warren E. Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time. 
 But because loan rates were relatively low at that time, M&T began hunting for more profitable assets. It turned to a longtime adviser, Deutsche Bank, which had expanded into the American market with its acquisition of Bankers Trust in 1999. 
 Representatives of the two banks began discussing possible investments. Sean Whalen, the Deutsche Bank salesman who called M&T Bank that February day in 2007, urged M&T to opt for Gemstone. M&T officials traveled to the Park Avenue offices of HBK Investments, a firm that would manage Gemstone, for a sales presentation.
 Within two weeks, M&T invested $82 million in Gemstone VII, the last in a series of seven deals totaling more than $4.3 billion. For the final Gemstone, Deutsche Bank shared $10 million in fees with ratings firms, lawyers and others involved in the transaction. 
 The $1.1 billion Gemstone VII was typical of the C.D.O.'s that were being offered at that time. It consisted of $500 million of bonds, mostly backed by home loans, and $600 million of credit-default swaps. Deutsche Bank used the swaps to insure bonds on behalf of hedge funds and other clients, paying Gemstone VII premiums that would be passed on to investors like M&T. 
 But thousands of the loans that backed Gemstone turned out to be deeply troubled. For instance, 3,949 home loans backing one of the mortgage bonds in Gemstone had been made by New Century Financial, which that February disclosed that it had discovered problems in its accounting for delinquent loans. 
 Many of those mortgages were made without fully verifying the borrowers' income and assets, and they were made to homeowners in California and Florida, where inflated home prices were already falling. By January 2007, nearly 14 percent of the New Century loans were delinquent or in foreclosure, up from 11 percent in December.
 Gemstone insured $30 million of the bonds backed by this pool. In other words, if the bonds lost value -- which they subsequently did as more homeowners defaulted -- someone stood to make a profit. The bonds were wiped out in 2008. Under the terms of the deal, Gemstone owed Deutsche Bank $30 million. Many other bonds insured through Gemstone also deteriorated rapidly. 
 Wall Street officials say investment banks served as intermediaries in such swap trades for other clients like hedge funds, but deal documents do not list those players.
 Some investors say the collapse of deals like Gemstone is a wakeup call for money managers. ''It's finally dawning on market players and investors that Wall Street's interest and those of investors have never been aligned,'' said Thomas C. Priore, chief executive of ICP Capital, an investment firm that specializes in credit markets. ''Investors are beginning to say to themselves: 'Hey, there is someone who will benefit if this doesn't go well.' ''
 Others on Wall Street say that investment banks' potential conflicts should have been apparent. ''As an institutional investor, your first duty is to do your own work,'' said Ron D'Vari, who is chief executive of New Oak Capital and previously managed the C.D.O. business at BlackRock. ''You have to do your own due diligence.'' 
 In its complaint, M&T claims that Deutsche Bank and HBK never disclosed fully what Gemstone was made of or that subprime mortgages were souring fast. The bank ''was told that it was receiving high-quality collateral that was triple-A rated and that had been screened for safety, when in fact it received impaired loan collateral,'' said Robert J. Lane, a lawyer overseeing the case for M&T.
 But Deutsche Bank has asserted that it gave M&T all the information it needed to evaluate Gemstone, including a 390-page offering document with detailed descriptions of the kinds of bonds that would go into Gemstone. 
 Furthermore, Mr. Whalen e-mailed a list of bonds that would be part of Gemstone to M&T two months before the deal closed. A copy of the message was provided to The New York Times by Deutsche Bank, which declined to comment further. (M&T countered that the list it received was preliminary and carried the disclaimer that the bonds it listed ''may or may not be included.'')In its filings, HBK, which declined to comment, added that it could not have deceived M&T because it has lost millions as an investor in Gemstone, too. 
 The justice hearing the case, John M. Curran of State Supreme Court in Buffalo, is expected to rule soon on a motion to dismiss the case.
 While M&T's losses on Gemstone and similar securities were relatively small, amounting to less than 2 percent of the bank's investment portfolio, M&T's chief executive, Robert G. Wilmers, wrote about them at length in his bank's 2007 annual report. 
 He lamented the decision to trust others, and said that the fact that some C.D.O.'s paid just 0.25 of a point more than traditional mortgage securities ''makes one rue the choice all the more.''
 Deutsche Bank, however, emerged relatively unscathed from Wall Street's misadventures in C.D.O.'s. While other banks, like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, were staggered by bad C.D.O.'s because they retained tens of billions of dollars of the investments, Deutsche Bank has reported only modest losses from its significant involvement in the American housing market.
 Analysts say that Deutsche Bank, which is the world's second largest bank by assets after Royal Bank of Scotland, held on to fewer of the investments it originated, selling more of them to investors like M&T. It also, presciently, bought protection against mortgage bonds at the urging of traders like Mr. Lippmann.
 Still, Deutsche Bank has not been immune from the crisis. Last week the bank said it would lose $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter in part because of losses in bond and swaps trading.
 The vast majority of investments like Gemstone have deteriorated rapidly. Moody's Investors Service found that from the start of 2007 until last September, it had downgraded more than $449 billion in securities similar to Gemstone VII, or 82 percent of all those outstanding. Moody's had downgraded more than three-quarters of C.D.O. securities that it once rated triple-A -- which has enraged many investors, who claim that ratings firms like Moody's failed them. 
 Curtis D. Ishii, senior investment officer for Calpers, the big California pension fund, says many banks and investors have learned the hard way that no amount of financial engineering can transform bad financial ingredients into good investments. 
 ''You can't turn manure into filet mignon,'' he said. ''You just can't.''

HEADLINE: Lunges and Tumbles Become Fluid Movement, Both Sparing and Lush

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

 BODY:
With the temperature around 12 degrees on Friday night, it was hard not to indulge in some grim ''this better be worth it'' muttering to self while heading ever further west toward the icy Hudson River air and the Merce Cunningham Studio. And, as it turned out, it was. 
 The Boston-based company Kelley Donovan & Dancers showed ''Borrowed Bones,'' a new work by Ms. Donovan notable for its fluid, sensuous movement; skillful structure; and evocation of a self-contained yet somehow expansive world.
 Developing a movement vocabulary isn't much of a concern among contemporary choreographers right now, but Ms. Donovan bucks the trend both by making work with a noticeably personal style and by ignoring the temptations of text, speech or film.
 Instead, ''Borrowed Bones'' is that rare beast, spotted only occasionally in the downtown dance savannah: a pure dance work that's actually full of dance. It's so pure that Ms. Donovan almost ignores her music -- a subtle mix of electronic scores briefly permeated by voices -- but provides more than enough of her own rhythmic dynamics to carry the piece. 
 At the beginning Ms. Donovan appeared alone, her first movements a compelling indication of what was to come. Larger-bodied than most professional dancers, she turned that into a sculptural asset through her gorgeously fluid, strongly rooted movement. Curving her arms -- elbows leading the way -- through space, rippling her body into coiled lunges, tumbling fluidly across the floor, Ms. Donovan felt like a force of nature
 Remarkably, that impact didn't disappear as she ceded the stage to her dancers. Some of the stylistic elements and choreographic motifs apparent in her solo -- the rolling, sliding floor work; the quick folding-in arms; the almost classical pirouettes; the jumps into arabesque crashing to the floor -- recur throughout the work.
 But Ms. Donovan knows how to make her dancers (all excellent) emerge as individuals, how to weave variation into her movement and how to use counterpoint to keep our eyes and minds active. In several group sequences she set slow, weighted movement against faster, athletic floor work, building the pace, then seamlessly dissolving it and dispersing the dancers.
 In its calm segues between large groups and small, intimate solos and duets, ''Borrowed Bones'' was both economical and lush, never a moment wasted or exceeded. Ms. Donovan should come to New York again, soon.

HEADLINE: At Town Hall, Expression That Leaves Mere Words Behind

BYLINE: By VIVIEN SCHWEITZER

 BODY:
Hearing songs in foreign languages without translations is different from occasions when you are aware of precise narratives. Even if a listener is familiar with a song's theme, following a particular story line can give way to savoring mood and expression. 
 There were no written translations or surtitles provided for any of the songs the excellent mezzo-soprano Bernarda Fink performed on Sunday at Town Hall (a fine space for vocal recitals), but the expressive power of her voice conveyed plenty. Ms. Fink's appearance was part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, the recession-proof series that offers first-rate soloists and ensembles for as little as $10 a show. 
 Ms. Fink, who rarely gives recitals in New York, opened her program with a selection of Schubert songs, including ''An Silvia,'' ''An die Nachtigall,'' ''An den mond'' and ''Nachtviolen,'' followed by six songs set to texts by Goethe. Her amber-toned voice and vivid interpretations were ideally matched by the thoughtful, nuanced playing of Anthony Spiri, her pianist. 
 Ms. Fink used the score (although she often barely glanced at it), but performed from memory for the concert's second half. After intermission she sang (in Czech) Dvorak's ''Biblical Songs'' and ''Gypsy Songs,'' the highlights of the afternoon.
 Mr. Spiri gave a brief description of the works from the stage, mentioning the psalms Dvorak chose for ''Biblical Songs,'' written in 1894 in the United States shortly after the composer learned that his father was dying. 
 Ms. Fink offered five excerpts from the 10-song cycle, including ''The Lord Is My Shepherd'' and ''By the Rivers of Babylon,'' singing with finely hued and poignant conviction. 
 The program concluded with the seven ''Gypsy Songs'' -- settings of poems by Adolf Heyduk that exalt the freedom of Gypsy life and their love of music. Ms. Fink sounded lovely here as well, although the evocative spell of ''Songs My Mother Taught Me'' was shattered by a cellphone. 
 For her first encore she sang a folk song by Dvorak (Op. 73, No. 2). For the second encore Ms. Fink, born in Argentina to Slovenian parents, said it was difficult to choose between those two countries; out of deference to the Slovenes in the audience, though, she sang a wistful Slovenian folk song.
 The next concert in the series is the pianist Kirill Gerstein on Saturday at Washington Irving High School, 16th Street and Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org.

HEADLINE: Not Just for Spies Anymore

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. LUONGO

 BODY:
Alessandro Pappalardo, an artist in New York, holds passports from Italy and Argentina and, last year, added an American one. Previously an executive with Aerolineas Argentinas, he said, ''I used to go a lot to Brazil, and I would always decide what passport to show depending on what line was shorter.''
 Stefan Stefanov, a citizen of the United States and Bulgaria who works for FirstApex Group in Warsaw, said he decided which passport to use depending on where he was going. ''Of course, I don't hide that I am a U.S. citizen,'' Mr. Stefanov said. ''But I don't parade it either.'' 
 Dual passports are no longer the sole province of people who grew up in more than one country. Millions of American citizens potentially qualify for various reasons -- ethnic heritage, religion, country of birth or where their spouse was born.
 ''The fact is people don't think about it until it is pointed out to them,'' said Jan Dvorak, president of Travisa, a passport services company in Washington. Some Americans, he said, ''don't realize that they actually have dual nationality.'' 
 While there are no hard numbers, more Americans seem to be trying to qualify for additional passports. ''Savvy travelers and business travelers want to make sure they have two passports based on nationality because there are certain advantages,'' Mr. Dvorak said. 
 Among those is the ability to work without restriction in various countries, particularly with passports from countries in the European Union. Also, Mr. Dvorak said, it is ''a way of hiding where one has been,'' when traveling among countries with soured relations.
 Christopher Davis, the chief executive of G3 Visas & Passports in Washington, said that his company regularly processes British passports. For clients who become dual nationals, he said, ''there are distinct benefits to it, especially now that the E.U. has grown in size and scope, especially if you need to take an assignment there.'' 
 Mr. Davis said foreign passport applications can be complicated, particularly for Italy and France, at times requiring a long series of documents to ''show the progression of the genealogy.''
 He also cautioned that for Americans, ''it doesn't matter how many passports you have, you must enter and leave with a U.S. passport.'' 
 In addition, he recommended that anyone considering dual passports think first of the tax consequences and the potential for military service, though, he added, ''you can get exemptions for all of this because you're a U.S. citizen.''
 Israel allows anyone of Jewish heritage to use what is called aliyah, or the Law of Return, to become a citizen, but the military draft can be an issue. Noam Greenberg, a press officer with the Israeli Consulate in New York, said that the maximum age for the draft is 28 for men and 22 for women, although married women are exempt at any age. Americans can apply for exemptions.
 The draft was an issue for Abdullah Daglioglu, an actor whose stage name is Neil Malik Abdullah. Born in Austria to parents from Turkey, he has both nationalities, but avoided Turkey because, he said, ''I would have to do the military.'' He lives in Germany and works on films throughout the European Union. ''I can act in movies all over Europe,'' he said. ''There's no visa necessary.''
 Mr. Daglioglu, who played one of the Sept. 11 terrorists, Ahmed al-Haznawi, in the British television movie ''Hamburg Cell,'' said he used his Austrian passport for the United States visa that he needed for part of the filming in Florida. 
 On paper, there was ''no background showing I am actually Turkish,'' Mr. Daglioglu said. ''It's easier to travel with the Austrian passport because it is European, rather than the Turkish passport. Everybody makes a problem when your last name is Abdullah.''
 Ruth Yoffe also has dual passports. She started Reloop Designs, a company that hires handicapped people in Cambodia to weave colorful baskets from recycled plastic bags. 
 A citizen of the United States and New Zealand, she travels frequently throughout Southeast Asia. ''For obvious safety reasons, I always try and travel and put my visas on my New Zealand passport,'' she said via e-mail. ''On a plane, I don't want to be identified as an American if I have that choice, depending on where I am heading.''
 Visas are also cheaper for New Zealanders. ''They assume anyone else from any other country can't be as rich'' as Americans, Ms. Yoffe said.
 Alex Thomas, the corporate manager of Travel Document Systems, a visa and passport services company in Washington, said that some of his clients are ''uneasy traveling with a U.S. passport, and if they have an additional passport, they prefer to use it.'' 
 In fact, in the terrorist attacks in November in Mumbai, the terrorists specifically sought out American and British passport holders, releasing some tourists with other passports. 
 Mr. Thomas cited globalization and marriage to immigrants as reasons that more Americans are getting dual citizenship, but the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the recent economic collapse also came up as issues for some dual nationals. 
 Mr. Thomas said there are ''four or five people a month who ask specifically what they need to do to get a passport'' for another country. ''Because of the way things are going in the world,'' he said, he expects that number to rise.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 27, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Tuesday about the advantages of holding passports issued by more than one country overstated reports linking terrorists in Mumbai to citizens holding American and British passports. While some witnesses said the terrorists singled out American and British citizens, officials have uncovered no evidence showing that was the case.

HEADLINE: In 'Geek Chic' and Obama, New Hope for Lifting Women in Science

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
With the inauguration of an administration avowedly committed to Science as the grand elixir for the nation's economic, environmental and psycho-reputational woes, a number of scientists say that now is the time to tackle a chronic conundrum of their beloved enterprise: how to attract more women into the fold, and keep them once they are there.
Researchers who have long promoted the cause of women in science view the incoming administration with a mix of optimism and we'll-see-ism. On the one hand, they said, the new president's apparent enthusiasm for science, and the concomitant rise of ''geek chic'' and ''smart is the new cool'' memes, can only redound to the benefit of all scientists, particularly if the enthusiasm is followed by a bolus of new research funds. On the other hand, they said, how about appointing a woman to the president's personal Poindexter club, the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology? The designated leaders so far include superstars like Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate, and Eric Lander, genome meister. 
The Rosalind Franklin Society, a group devoted to ''recognizing the work of prominent women scientists,'' has suggested possible co-chairwomen for the panel. Its candidates include Shirley Ann Jackson, a nuclear physicist and president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Shirley Tilghman, a molecular biologist and president of Princeton University. Others have proposed Jacqueline Barton, a chemist and MacArthur fellow at the California Institute of Technology. Or, given the increasing importance of brain research, how about a prominent female neuroscientist like Nancy Kanwisher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Carla Shatz of Stanford University?
''People say, oh, we shouldn't have quotas, but diversity is a form of excellence, and there are plenty of outstanding women out there,'' Jo Handelsman, president of the Franklin society and a microbiologist at the University of Wisconsin, said in an interview. ''You don't have to lower your standards in the slightest -- you just have to pay attention.''
Some would like to see novel approaches to treating systemic problems that often work against women's scientific ambitions. Mary Ann Mason and Marc Goulden of the University of California, Berkeley, have gathered extensive data showing stark male-female differences in the family structure and personal lives of academic researchers at the top tiers of the profession.
Surveying outcomes for 160,000 Ph.D. recipients across the United States, the researchers determined that 70 percent of male tenured professors were married with children, compared with only 44 percent of their tenured female colleagues. Twelve years or more after receiving their doctorates, tenured women were more than twice as likely as tenured men to be single and significantly more likely to be divorced. And lest all of this look like ''personal choice,'' when the researchers asked 8,700 faculty members in the University of California system about family and work issues, nearly 40 percent of the women agreed with the statement, ''I had fewer children than I wanted,'' compared with less than 20 percent of the men. The take-home message, Dr. Mason said in a telephone interview, is, ''Men can have it all, but women can't.''
From a purely Darwinian point of view, expecting a young woman to sacrifice her reproductive fitness for the sake of career advancement is simply too much, and yet the structure of academic research, in which one must spend one's 20s and early 30s as a poorly compensated and minimally empowered graduate student and postdoctoral fellow, and the remainder of one's 30s and into the low 40s working madly to earn tenure, can demand exactly that.
Nor do all young men in science accept the notion that their lab bench must double as a sleeping cot while their wives take care of the kids. In a new survey of 19,000 doctoral students at the University of California, Dr. Mason and her colleagues found that while two-thirds of the respondents either had or planned to have children, 84 percent of the women and 74 percent of the men expressed worry about the family-unfriendliness of their intended profession, and many had changed their plans accordingly. While 40 percent of the male science graduate students and 31 percent of the women said they had begun their Ph.D. programs intent on pursuing an academic career -- still considered the premier path to science glory -- a year or more into their studies, only 28 percent of the men and 20 percent of the women still hoped to become research scientists at a university.
Dr. Mason and other legal experts suggest that President Obama might be able to change things significantly for young women in science -- and young men -- by signing an executive order that would provide added family leave and parental benefits to the recipients of federal grants, a huge pool of people that includes many research scientists.
Whatever the impediments, women have made great strides in most areas of science. According to Joan Burrelli of the National Science Foundation, whereas 50 years ago women earned a piddling 8 percent of the science and engineering doctorates, by 2006 they claimed a 40 percent share. In 1973, only 6 percent of the Ph.D. scientists employed full time in academia, business or elsewhere were women; by 2006 the number had risen to 27 percent. Over that same time frame, women's share of full professorships in the sciences quadrupled, to about 20 percent. Yet the stats vary sharply from field to field: 26 percent of full professors in the life sciences are women, but in physics, 6 percent.
For many female physicists, the mystery of women's slow progress through their ranks is nearly as baffling as the research mysteries they confront in the lab. Of course, only 6 percent of physics professors are female; only 4 to 6 percent of the matter in the universe is visible. ''Sound familiar?'' Evalyn Gates, the assistant director of the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago, said wryly.
She has urged her colleagues to attack the problem of low female numbers as they would any scientific problem, by systematically gathering data, checking their detectors, factoring out background noise. Yes, girls and women leak out of the pipeline in comparatively greater numbers than males for every scientific discipline, she said, but they fall out of physics first and fastest. Why should it be, she said, that almost half of high school students in Advanced Placement physics classes are girls, but women earn only a fifth of bachelor's degrees in physics? What turns girls away from physics so early?
Some have suggested that girls just can't handle the advanced math of physics. Yet in an analysis of high school students' performance on standardized math tests, published last summer in the journal Science, Janet Hyde and her colleagues found no gender differences in average performance, and even at the uppermost tails of achievement the discrepancies were minor and inconsistent: among whites who scored in the top 1 percent, there were two boys for every girl, whereas among Asian top scorers, there was one full girl for every nine-tenths of a boy. Besides, said Dr. Gates, female students earn half of the bachelor's degrees in another math-heavy discipline called -- mathematics.
Others have insisted that women just don't like physics, perhaps because it seems cold and abstract, concerned with things rather than the flesh-and-blood focus of female-friendly fields like biology. But such reasoning, Dr. Gates said, cannot account for the fact that women earn half of the undergraduate degrees in chemistry, which is not quite plush toy material. ''Something different is going on with physics, and we don't know what it is yet,'' she said. The culture? Bubble-headed television shows like ''The Big Bang Theory,'' with its four nerdy male physics prodigies and the fetching blond girl next door?
The difficulties are not confined to America. Surveying some 1,350 female physicists in 70 countries, Rachel Ivie and Stacy Guo of the American Institute of Physics found that, worse than family balance issues or lack of day care options, was the problem of public perception. The women were passionate about their work. They didn't choose physics; physics chose them. Yet 80 percent agreed that attitudes about women in physics needed a serious overhaul.
As long as we're making geek chic, let's lose the Einstein 'do and moustache.

HEADLINE: On Eve of History, Obama Follows Low-Key Path: In Transition, Clues to How a Leader Might Govern

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On the day before moving into the nation's most storied house, Barack Obama visited a shelter for teenagers with no home. With sleeves rolled up, he spent a few minutes painting for the benefit of the cameras that trail him everywhere now.
Cara Fuller, a shelter worker, asked if he was sweating.
''Nah, I don't sweat,'' he told her. ''You ever see me sweat?''
Not yet. But then again, it is still early. 
Mr. Obama arrives at the presidency Tuesday after a transition that betrayed little if any perspiration and no hint of nervousness. Throughout the 77 days since his election, he has been a font of cool confidence, never too hot, never too cold, seemingly undaunted by the magnitude of troubles awaiting him and unbothered by the few setbacks that have tripped him up.
He remains hard to read or label -- centrist in his appointments and bipartisan in his style, yet also pushing the broadest expansion of government in generations. He has reached across old boundaries to build the foundation of an administration that will be charged with hauling the country out of crisis, but for all the outreach he has made it clear he is centralizing policy making in the White House.
He will eventually have to choose between competing advice and priorities, risking the disappointment or anger of constituencies that for the moment can still see in him what they hope to see.
What the country has seen of his leadership style so far evokes the discipline of George W. Bush and the curiosity of Bill Clinton. Mr. Obama is not shy about making decisions and making them expeditiously -- he assembled his team in record time -- but he has also sought to tap into the nation's intellectual dialogue at a time of great ferment.
He has set out ideas for governance even before taking office, but he has also adapted the details as conditions changed.
More than any president since he was an infant, Mr. Obama has taken a place in society that extends beyond political leadership. He is as much symbol as substance, an icon for the young and a sign of deliverance for an older generation that never believed a man with his skin color would ascend those steps to vow to preserve, protect and defend a Constitution that originally counted a black man as three-fifths of a person.
He is a celebrity president in a celebrity culture, cooed over for his shirtless physique on the beach and splashed on the cover of every magazine from Foreign Policy to People. What his political opponents sought to portray in the campaign as arrogance is now presented by his aides as comfort with power and the responsibilities that go along with it.
''He sort of lives in a grudge-free zone,'' said John D. Podesta, a co-chairman of his transition team. ''He's capable of taking on board a lot of information and making good decisions. He knows he's going to make mistakes. But he also knows that you've got to do the best you can, make tough decisions and move on.''
Some of those mistakes may owe in part to that signature confidence. Mr. Obama knew and liked Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, initially overlooking an investigation into state contracts that later sank his nomination for commerce secretary. Likewise, Mr. Obama forged a personal connection with Timothy F. Geithner and picked him for Treasury secretary, choosing to disregard Mr. Geithner's past failure to pay some of his taxes.
Little has emerged about the process behind those episodes, but aides described Mr. Obama's decision making as crisp and efficient. When he sits down for meetings, they said, he starts by framing questions he wants answered, then gives each person a chance to talk, while also engaging them. At the end, he typically sums up what he has learned and where he is leaning. A late-night person, he often follows up with calls to aides at 10 p.m. or later, after he has put his daughters to bed.
Mr. Podesta would not describe how the decision had been made to pull Mr. Richardson's nomination but said it had played out over just nine hours rather than days, which limited the damage. ''We saw the problem, understood it, Bill understood it wasn't viable, and we stopped it,'' Mr. Podesta said.
That contrasts with Mr. Clinton, who liked free-ranging discussion and took time making decisions. Mr. Podesta, Mr. Clinton's last White House chief of staff, described the former president as brilliant at ''thinking laterally'' across subject areas. ''One thing that seemed not to have taken on Bill Clinton is law school,'' he said. ''I tend to think of the president-elect as approaching a problem in a more logical, more drill-down sort of way.''
Mr. Obama opted not to play it safe during the transition. He brought his Democratic rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, into the cabinet, and angered gay and liberal supporters by inviting the Rev. Rick Warren, an opponent of abortion and same-sex marriage, to give the inaugural invocation. Although Mr. Obama deferred foreign affairs with his ''one president at a time'' rule, that did not apply to domestic policy, where he lobbied Congress to release $350 billion in financial bailout money and set about negotiating roughly $800 billion in spending programs and tax breaks.
''He's got the political courage to look at things and be bold,'' said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton's who has spent time with Mr. Obama since the election. ''The political wisdom is go slow, take the easy way first and build up some victories.''
Mr. Rendell said Mr. Obama did not mind taking risks. ''He's goal-oriented, not process-oriented,'' he said. ''If he does some things that are unorthodox or tick off his friends to achieve a goal, he'll do that.''
But Mr. Obama made a point of engaging adversaries, dining with conservative columnists and talking with Republican congressmen. ''He and his transition team have reached out to the Hill more than any transition team I've seen,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader. ''So far, so good. But running a campaign and running a transition are going to be different than governing, because governing is about making choices.''
Mr. Boehner noted that Mr. Obama had originally reserved 40 percent of his economic package for tax cuts but now seemed to be heeding Democrats pushing for more spending. ''At some point he's going to have to tell people what he's for,'' Mr. Boehner said, ''and then we'll see whether he really wants to govern from the middle or cave into the liberals in his party.''
Mr. Obama's outreach to Republicans has paid dividends. He wooed enough Republican senators to release the bailout money. Even some he did not convince muted their opposition. For instance, he called Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, who opposed more bailout money without a commitment that it be used only for the financial sector, not other industries.
''They didn't want to shut the door, and if I were them maybe I wouldn't either,'' Mr. Coburn said. ''But I wanted the door shut.'' After Mr. Obama's call, he said, ''I was quiet as I voted against it.''
Mr. Obama has built a broader base of public support than many incoming presidents. Representative Artur Davis, Democrat of Alabama, said 53 percent of white voters in his conservative state now had favorable views of Mr. Obama, compared with 17 percent before the election. ''He has been pragmatic,'' Mr. Davis said, ''and even many voters who voted against him see him as prepared to govern in a pragmatic, nonideological way.''
But Mr. Obama has been harder to peg than that, and the next few months should flesh out his governing philosophy.
''I don't think it maps into traditional right-left, but nor is it Bill Clinton-like triangulation,'' said Robert B. Reich, Mr. Clinton's labor secretary and an economic adviser to Mr. Obama. ''My sense is he genuinely believes that people can come to a rough consensus about big problems and work together effectively. I don't really get a sense of ideological position. He's obviously a man of strong convictions, but they don't fall into the standard boxes.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, New Efforts To Bolster Lending

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY; Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
After a first round of costly bank bailouts and stimulus programs came up short, governments in Europe and the United States are moving more forcefully to assure that bailed-out banks lend more money to offset the recession that has engulfed both continents.
 On Monday, a day after officials of the incoming Obama administration promised to take steps to force banks to lend, Britain outlined details of a new $:100 billion, or $147.5 billion, plan to limit banks' losses from troubled assets in exchange for their pledge to increase the flow of credit. 
 ''In return for access to any government support, there will have to be an increase in lending, and that will be legally binding,'' Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, said. 
 As if to illustrate the depths of the problem, the Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Monday that it faced losses of up to $:28 billion or $41 billion for 2008, a record for any British company. The bank's already depressed shares fell nearly 67 percent, touching off a rout in European financial stocks that could extend to United States markets when they reopen on Tuesday. 
 The second round of efforts in Britain and Europe to jump-start lending comes as the region girds for a more painful recession than expected. The European Commission warned on Monday that the 27-nation European Union faced a ''deep and protracted recession'' that would shrink the economy by 1.8 percent in 2009 and cut 3.5 million jobs across the bloc.
 Adding to the sense of urgency, Standard and Poor's ratings agency downgraded Spain's sovereign debt from its AAA rating. Greece's sovereign debt was cut on Wednesday, rekindling worries about what might happen to the euro zone as a whole if a member were to default on its public debt.
 The bleak prospects have prompted leaders to try other ways of urging banks to lend as it becomes more clear that the bailout measures pledged by governments at the height of the financial crisis in autumn have not flushed away the bad loans that still clog the system. If anything, the problems are set to worsen as the downturn accelerates. 
 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France is to meet on Tuesday evening with French bankers to press them to lend more money to French businesses. ''The banks must understand that the times have changed,'' Christine Lagarde, the finance minister, told a business daily, Les Echos, on Monday. The French plan would require banks receiving new capital injections to make ''precise commitments,'' including giving up bonuses this year, she said.
 Late Sunday, Denmark announced an $18 billion aid plan for its banks, saying it would inject the funds on the condition that the recipients increase lending.
 In Germany, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Josef Ackermann, who is also chairman of the Institute of International Finance, an organization of the world's largest financial institutions, suggested last week that the creation of so-called bad banks might be the way forward. 
 In a bad-bank arrangement, governments would buy up scorched assets, said George Magnus, senior economic adviser at UBS Investment Bank in London. That contrasts with the method now being used in the United States and Britain, where troubled assets remain on the balance sheet, but losses beyond some limit are insured by the government.
 ''There is no 'right' way and both schemes have their merits and drawbacks under given and local circumstances,'' Mr. Magnus wrote in a research note. He said the bad-bank plan might be more suited to the United States, while Britain might be able to manage with its plan for an insurance program because it has far fewer banks.
 Members of the incoming Obama administration are considering proposals that include buying up bad assets, a return to the original vision of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.
 ''The focus isn't going to be on the needs of banks,'' Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, said on the CBS program ''Face the Nation.'' ''It's going to be on the needs of the economy for credit.'' 
 Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm in London, said he thought that Europe was also ''edging toward the creation of bad banks.''
 Under Britain's latest bank bailout, its Treasury will ''protect financial institutions against exposure to exceptional future credit losses on certain portfolios of assets'' in return for a fee. Participating institutions will take the initial losses, with the Treasury bearing about 90 percent of the rest.
 Britain's central bank could buy up to $:50 billion worth of ''high-quality assets'' from banks, giving it more monetary policy tools after it cut its benchmark interest rate to a record of 1.5 percent this month. The government is also extending measures to increase liquidity, including a $:250 billion program to let banks to issue government-backed bonds. The latest steps would cost taxpayers an additional $:100 billion on top of the $:37 billion plan announced in October and a $:20 billion stimulus plan announced in November.
 Mr. Brown said he was angry at Royal Bank, whose losses include as much as $:20 billion of good-will write-downs from the acquisition of a portion of another bank. ''Almost all their losses are in the subprime markets in America and related to the acquisition of the bank ABN Amro,'' he said. ''And these are irresponsible risks, which were taken by a bank with people's money in the United Kingdom.''
 European bank stocks fell sharply on Monday on fears that more pain, including the wiping out of some shareholders, might lie ahead. Last week, the Irish government nationalized the Anglo Irish Bank, rendering equity stakes worthless.
 Peter Dixon, a global equities economist in London for Commerzbank, said the latest British rescue plans were ''a step in the right direction.'' But, he added, ''In the end, either banks will have to be nationalized or have their bad loans split off into another institution. That's the only way they will be clear about their capital positions.''

HEADLINE: Government's Promise

 BODY:
When he accepted his party's nomination last year, Barack Obama repudiated the ''you're on your own'' ethos that had come to define the government's relationship to the people. He said government cannot do everything, but he promised one that would do what individuals cannot do for themselves: ''protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.'' 
 Today he takes the oath of office before a nation that has placed an extraordinary amount of trust -- and an extraordinary amount of hope -- on the idea that this promise will be kept by a 47-year-old from Illinois who defied all conventional wisdom to become the first African-American president of the United States. 
 The country's 44th chief executive already is on track to fulfill his pledge. The House last week unveiled an $825 billion economic recovery plan -- developed in partnership with Mr. Obama -- that includes money for education, infrastructure, energy investments and basic research, as well as emergency spending for unemployment benefits, health care and food aid. 
 The details are likely to change as the package moves through Congress; lawmakers and Mr. Obama would be wise, for instance, to settle on less money for low-yielding tax cuts and more for high-return public spending. But to the credit of Mr. Obama and House leaders, the overall package is well timed and well aimed.
 There is, however, one serious omission that falls squarely into the area that Mr. Obama defined, where government must help the individual. There is nothing in the plan, as yet, to stop foreclosures on Americans' homes.
 Such an omission was understandable when the package was conceived mainly as stimulus, which implies short-term action to jolt the economy. But it has clearly become more than that -- and correctly so, given the dire economic outlook. To be credible and successful as an economic recovery plan, foreclosure relief is essential. Without it, the housing bust, the financial crisis and the recession will only continue to feed on each other. 
 The first step toward providing the relief is to include in the package a measure to allow hard-pressed homeowners to have the terms of the mortgages modified under bankruptcy court protection, an avenue currently denied them by an outdated and anti-consumer bent to the law. Mr. Obama supported such a bankruptcy amendment during his campaign. Committees in both the House and Senate each passed a bankruptcy amendment last year. Now Senate leaders have vowed to pursue a change in the bankruptcy code in their version of the recovery package, which is expected this week. In a push forward for the solution, Citigroup recently endorsed the Senate's proposed amendment -- recognition, at last, that the financial crisis will not end until defaults and foreclosures abate. 
 The fear is that including the bankruptcy provision in the recovery package will cost votes among Republican senators who oppose the measure, largely out of solidarity with the lending industry. But given the importance of the package, Senate leaders are confident it will safely pass, even with a bankruptcy measure. 
 Mr. Obama can build support for the measure, too, by explaining to the American people that it is a way to begin to solve the foreclosure problem that costs taxpayers nothing. In fact, it would be unconscionable to move forward with taxpayer-financed solutions before putting in place a measure that could help to achieve the desired result without involving taxpayers. 
 The bankruptcy amendment cannot stop all foreclosures. But it is the starting point. And it would be a prime example of government doing for individuals what they cannot do for themselves -- opening a courthouse door that is closed to them by law.

HEADLINE: On the Subject of Judicial Salaries, a Sharp Difference of Opinion

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 Federal judges say they are underpaid. The problem, in Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s words, ''has now reached the level of a constitutional crisis.''
 It takes a pretty brave soul to argue the other side.
 ''I couldn't find any evidence to support his claim,'' Scott Baker, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, said of the chief justice. Professor Baker published a study last year in the Boston University Law Review that considered whether society would be better off were judges paid more as a matter of labor economics. 
 Its conclusion: ''Pretty much nothing would happen if Congress decided to raise judicial salaries.'' Money appears to have almost no impact on the quantity and quality of the work judges produce, Professor Baker found, and lots of capable people are eager to take the jobs at the current salary.
 A second study to be published in The Journal of Legal Analysis, a peer-reviewed publication at Harvard Law School, goes even further. Its title seems calculated to provoke the people who wear black robes at work: ''Are Judges Overpaid?''
 G. Mitu Gulati, who conducted the study with Eric A. Posner and Stephen J. Choi, said judges had not embraced their findings. ''There was anger and even incredulity that we would even ask the question,'' he said. 
 Federal district judges make $169,300; federal appeals court judges, $179,500; Supreme Court justices, $208,100; and the chief justice, $217,400. There is no question that those salaries, which increased 2.5 percent last year, have dropped significantly in real terms in recent decades or that they represent a small fraction of what partners in big city law firms make.
 This year, federal judges, alone among federal employees, did not even receive a cost-of-living adjustment. 
 On the other hand, being a judge is pretty sweet work and the job is in high demand. It comes with status, power, good working conditions, no clients, the ability to affect policy and the satisfaction of doing justice. Federal judges get very good health care, exceptionally generous pensions and the ultimate in job security -- life tenure.
 The two sides in the debate, in any event, are mostly talking past each other. 
 The professors collected data and analyzed it using the tools of economics. They measured things like productivity (number of published opinions), quality (how often other courts cite those opinions), speed (how quickly opinions are produced) and independence (how often judges disagree with colleagues with similar political views).
 The study in The Journal of Legal Analysis considered the relative quality of state-court judges around the nation in light of their varying salaries. Professor Baker looked at federal appeals court judges in different parts of the country, taking account of the pay scales at the regional law firms judges might join if they left the bench. 
 Both studies found almost no evidence that taxpayers would be better off by paying judges more. A possible exception, according to Professor Baker's study, is that ''low salaries lead to slightly fewer dissents.''
 Frank B. Cross, a law professor at the University of Texas and a sophisticated empiricist, said the new studies went off the rails. ''I love these economic tools,'' Professor Cross said. ''But we don't have a good measure of judicial quality.''
 ''Given the anecdotal evidence, economic logic and the great importance of a quality judiciary,'' he wrote in a reply to Professor Baker, ''the case for a judicial pay raise is reasonably strong.''
 Many judges say the entire enterprise is absurd and insulting. ''The country wants and deserves the strongest possible judiciary, and we should be willing to pay for that,'' said David F. Levi, the dean of Duke Law School and a former federal judge. (He said he did not step down for financial reasons.) 
 Chief Justice Roberts, in his report on the state of the judiciary at the end of 2006, cited a few kinds of data to support his argument that low pay was leading to a crisis. One was that 38 judges left the federal bench from 2000 to 2005, some citing the need to make more money. 
 Richard A. Posner, a prominent federal appeals court judge in Chicago (and the father of Eric Posner), called this ''crying wolf'' in his recent book, ''How Judges Think.'' The chief justice had lumped retirements and resignations together, Judge Posner said. Only 12 federal judges had resigned out of a total of 1,200 active and senior judges in the years in question, a small number in absolute terms and a smaller percentage than in the six years ending in 1974.
 Judge Posner did not dispute that low pay may meant that there were fewer judges coming from private firms, but he did not see why that should matter so long as there appeared to be plenty of qualified candidates. 
 Chief Justice Roberts also said that the real pay of federal judges had dropped about 24 percent since 1969 while the average worker's real pay rose about 18 percent. 
 ''But this is misleading,'' Judge Posner responded. Federal judges received a roughly 30 percent pay raise in 1969. ''Had Roberts picked as his base year 1968 rather than 1969,'' Judge Posner said, ''the picture of decline would have been less dramatic.'' 
 What is most interesting about the basic argument made for a judicial pay raise is that it appeals to a value that many judges resist in other contexts. It is an argument about fairness and respect. It is the sort of argument liberals make for raising the minimum wage or for laws that guarantee equal pay for equal work.
 Professor Baker said those arguments ought not matter. ''Judicial selection has to be subjected to cost-benefit analysis just like everything else,'' he said.
 But he acknowledged a human dimension to the question.
 ''I got some e-mails from judges saying, 'How would you like it if your salary were not raised?' '' Professor Baker said. ''I kind of feel sympathetic to that. I'd probably be mad.''

HEADLINE: House Plan for Infrastructure Disappoints Advocates for Major Projects

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
When President-elect Barack Obama announced last month that he would revive the economy with the largest public works program since the dawn of the Interstate System of highways, advocates for the nation's long-neglected infrastructure were euphoric. 
 Some hoped that the time had finally come to bring high-speed rail to the United States, or to wean the nation from its dependence on foreign oil with new or transformed public transit systems, or to take bold action to solve the problems of rising populations and falling reservoir levels across the Southwest. 
 But those hopes are fading. As the details of the plan come into focus, big transformative building projects seem unlikely. And the plan does not begin to provide the kind of money that civil engineers believe is needed to bring the nation's aging bridges and water systems and roads and transit systems to a state of good repair.
 Less than one-third of the $825 billion plan that was introduced Thursday in the House would go to infrastructure, and much of that would go to high-tech projects, rather than traditional concrete-and-steel building and repair work. The rest would go to tax cuts and aid to help states pay for health care and education. At a time when the American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated that $1.6 trillion is needed to improve the nation's crumbling infrastructure, the proposal calls for spending $30 billion on roads and, to the consternation of transit advocates, only $10 billion on transit and rail. 
 (The House bill, though, was only the opening salvo in the push to pass a bill quickly, and some senators are already talking about adding money for more transit programs.)
 The requirement that the money be spent quickly, in order to get it coursing through the parched economy, means that many ambitious projects that require more planning will have to give way to smaller ones considered ''shovel ready.'' 
 The plan also calls for using existing federal formulas to send transportation money quickly to the states, giving policy makers in Washington little say as to where or how the money should be spent.
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, who, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California formed a group called Building America's Future to push for more infrastructure spending, called the plan a good first step but warned that it fell far short of what was needed. 
 ''Anybody who thinks -- if the president-elect thinks, or the team thinks -- that this is the answer to America's infrastructure needs is in a different universe,'' said Mr. Rendell, a Democrat who noted that his state was full of aging, deficient bridges.
 Mr. Rendell said in an interview that the proposal would help upgrade the nation's electrical grid and water systems, modernize schools and expand broadband access to rural areas.
 But he noted, regretfully, that it contained less money for more traditional transportation projects than a House proposal last year, and he worried that Mr. Obama's campaign call for creating a new national infrastructure bank to evaluate big projects and set priorities had so far not been included in the plan. 
 Other planners agreed with his assessment.
 ''It's a drop in the bucket,'' said Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, which has shaped long-term planning in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut since before the New Deal. 
 Some advocates said they feared that the pressure to spend more on infrastructure -- which has risen since the levees failed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed in Minnesota, and as old water mains have burst and submerged streets around the country -- would ebb now that some money had been allocated for such projects.
 Still, there are areas where Mr. Obama's plan would break ground. 
 Mr. Obama wants to computerize the nation's medical records to make health care more efficient and less expensive, and expand rural broadband internet access. He plans less-visible, but perhaps more critical, improvements to water and electric systems. He wants to repair and modernize schools, and make federal buildings more energy efficient, a priority that gets more money in the House bill -- $31 billion -- than aid to roads and highways. 
 But proponents of mass transit, which has had a significant increase in riders in recent years, even as the recession is forcing many major transit systems to reduce service -- had hoped that much more money would be devoted to transit projects. 
 Phineas Baxandall, a senior analyst for tax and budget policy at the United States Public Interest Research Group, a liberal advocacy organization, noted that highways still stood to get three times as much aid as rail and transit systems.
 ''Money included to modernize and expand public transportation networks will put thousands to work while reducing our nation's dependence on oil, traffic congestion, and global warming pollution,'' Mr. Baxandall said.
 The demand for more public transportation has been evident recently. Voters authorized spending more money on mass transit and rail projects in local ballot measures last November. Californians voted to authorize $10 billion in borrowing to begin bringing high-speed rail to the land of the freeway. 
 But those kinds of projects are hard to get under way quickly. Using existing formulas to distribute the money will also make it hard for policy makers in Washington to make sure it goes to the areas with the greatest needs. 
 Robert Puentes, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, analyzed some of the lists of state projects that have begun to emerge, and found that the 100 biggest metropolitan areas, considered the economic engines of the nation, were not getting priority. 
 Although Mr. Obama has said he would not tolerate bridge-to-nowhere projects, there is nothing to keep states from taking political considerations into account when deciding how to spend their share of the highway money, say, by doling out some of it to each lawmaker's district instead of to more beneficial projects.
 The plan will include a use-it-or-lose-it provision to force states to spend the money they get quickly, or risk forfeiting it. But that can be hard to do. 
 Jack Wells, the chief economist at the Department of Transportation, said that the Federal Highway Administration had analyzed how long it took before money from transportation projects was paid out to workers, and found that 27 percent of it was paid in the first year and 41 percent in the second year.

HEADLINE: For the Jobless, Hope and Fear For a New Day

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Joe Lewis came to the local employment office on Friday in the hope of buying a little more time.
Four months had passed since he lost his job as a maintenance worker at a chain of convenience stores, trading a paycheck of $370 a week for an unemployment check of $180 a week. With those benefits about to expire, Mr. Lewis arrived to fill out the paperwork for an extension, weary and uncertain about the future.
A new president is about to take responsibility for the American economy -- the first black president, which has a particular resonance for Mr. Lewis, 52, an African-American. That Barack Obama is promising to devote hundreds of billions of dollars toward creating jobs is interesting, too. Yet none of this gave Mr. Lewis comfort. 
''I haven't seen the change,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Until he does something, he's just like all the rest of them to me. He ain't done nothing for me. Everybody's making promises.''
Mr. Lewis's job search has amounted to an in-depth tour of shrinking prospects in one of the worst economic downturns since the Depression. He has applied at warehouses, at a moving company, at a concrete plant. So far, nothing. The next stop: a poultry slaughterhouse on the outskirts of Columbia.
Variations on his story echoed through the employment office in downtown Columbia, whose economic experience traces the national trajectory of the last decade more than any other metropolitan area. The people who passed through on this recent morning provided a snapshot of the extraordinary economic challenges inherited by the new president, as well as the mixture of hope and skepticism that greets his arrival.
Hope, because Mr. Obama represents a distinct break from the past, armed with a mandate to unleash government largess toward putting millions of people back to work. Skepticism, because Washington seems a long way from where most Americans live, geographically and figuratively. At the employment office, sounds of frustration created the running soundtrack. ''This is the issue ...'' ''I never got the call.'' ''The store has closed ...'' ''I just need this paper signed, showing that I been here.''
A lot of people have been here. In December, 23,029 people passed through here to arrange job training, seek a new job or arrange unemployment benefits, said Keith Lucas, area director of the Midlands Workforce center, the official name for the place. That was far more than the 13,698 who came in the final month of 2007.
Nationally, some 2.6 million jobs have disappeared since December 2007, when the recession began. Last week, 524,000 more Americans filed for unemployment benefits, amid forecasts that the number could spike as high as 750,000 by late this year.
The economy that Mr. Obama is supposed to somehow fix is gripped by fear and the deepening realization that, for many people, recovery will be an exercise in making do with less than they had before.
A year ago, people let go by area factories that had paid as much as $18 and $20 an hour generally balked at the idea of retraining for a job installing heating and air-conditioning gear at half that pay. Now, those training programs are packed.
''There was a lot of resistance before,'' said Abby Linden, who oversees such programs. ''People now seem to expect that they're going to have to start over.''
Mr. Obama's inauguration is like a palpable marker of a new beginning for many, an inarguable sign of change, she said. ''There's a lot of excitement and hope,'' Ms. Linden said. ''People have a lot of faith in him, and faith that he's going to be able to turn it around.''
And yet, out in the lobby, where dozens of people sat quietly in plastic-backed chairs arrayed across the linoleum floor, waiting to apply for unemployment benefits, weariness and resignation carried as much weight as faith and hope.
''It's got to be better, it can't be worse,'' said Charles English, 62, who lost his job at an asphalt plant two years ago and has not worked since, living on the good graces of his grown son. ''Just to listen to Obama talk and see those kids of his, it just makes you stand up and feel proud.''
But the talk of big spending on public works projects to generate jobs seemed to exclude him. ''I ain't able to go out and get this construction work,'' he said. ''I'm too old for that. So what happens to me?''
As John Arnette sat beneath the pale glow of the fluorescent lights, waiting to inquire why his check had suddenly stopped, he worried that Mr. Obama was promising to spend money the country did not really have, adding to long-term debts.
''You've got all the money that's been given to the financial sector, plus all the money that's going to the Big Three auto companies,'' he said. ''Where's the money going to come from?''
It was the same question being asked with increasing frequency in his own household: Despite his college degree, Mr. Arnette, 36, has been out of work since May, when he lost his job as a midlevel manager at a convenience store chain.
Looking for work has been a humiliating process of discovery. Fresh college graduates are working as waiters or stocking the shelves at Lowe's, the home improvement store. Management positions there seem increasingly filled by people with graduate degrees.
His wife still works, at a Verizon Wireless call center, but their household income has dropped from $150,000 a year to about $65,000.
''I'm blessed that my wife has a good job,'' Mr. Arnette said. ''Without that, I'd be homeless.''

HEADLINE: McCain Country Warms to Its New President

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
TULSA, Okla. -- ''I voted for John McCain and still would,'' said Tim Driskill, in a flatly drawled declaration of certainty that still speaks for many in this place underwhelmed last November by the charms of Barack Obama, then the Democratic nominee for president.
Not a single county in Oklahoma stirred from the orderly phalanx marching behind Mr. McCain, the senator from Arizona who was the Republican nominee, and Mr. Driskill, the owner of an insurance agency in downtown Tulsa, said he was proud to be in those ranks. Statewide, two out of three voters supported Mr. McCain, the highest percentage in the nation. 
But that staunchly Republican, conservative Oklahoma is harder to find now. While there are countless Mr. Driskills here -- and hardly anyone doubts that Mr. McCain would easily win again in a redo of the vote -- there are also new fractures and fault lines as some voters have shifted toward accepting what the rest of the country wrought in giving Mr. Obama a lopsided victory.
In interviews in the week leading up to Mr. Obama's inauguration, many people here said a tolerant spirit toward his presidency has been hastened, paradoxically, by some of the same groups that voted mostly Republican in the election. Those include active or former military personnel, and people who identify themselves as evangelical Christians, two groups with traditions of respecting hierarchical order and strong leadership.
''Oklahomans understand and respect the elections process,'' said Chris Benge, a Republican from Tulsa who serves as speaker of the Oklahoma House. ''Once the president has been determined, the vast majority of people are willing to get behind him.''
That does not mean, Mr. Benge said, that Mr. Obama has won Oklahomans over, but only that the campaign season has ended. Do not look for Mr. Benge at any inaugural parties. He said he would be watching what he could of the ceremonies on television in his office between meetings.
But some people have, in fact, changed their minds. Leonard Nelson, 63, a 23-year veteran of both the Army and the Navy, said he had voted for Mr. McCain mainly through military fealty, believing that Mr. McCain's own military record would make him a better commander in chief.
''But I've come to think the better man won,'' said Mr. Nelson, owner of the Humidor Cigar Shop, an aromatic haven of pipes, blended tobaccos and customers on a first-name basis. Mr. Nelson said that Mr. Obama, through his cabinet selections, sent a signal of centrist government intention that feels all right to him.
Mr. Nelson's customers like Cliff A. Stark, a lawyer and pipe smoker, were more representative of the spirit of pained resignation that is common here. ''It's just something you can't do anything about,'' Mr. Stark said.
At one of the city's biggest evangelical megachurches, Victory Christian Center, with 17,000 members, there were also mixed messages of enthusiasm.
The church's pastor and founder, Billy Joe Daugherty, said that the selection of the Rev. Rick Warren, a prominent evangelical minister from California, to give the inaugural invocation went a long way to easing fears in Mr. Daugherty's mostly conservative congregation about a liberal social agenda. Mr. Obama's selection of Mr. Warren has been denounced by many gay rights advocates and other liberal groups.
''What I'm sensing from Obama in making the choice he did -- he's saying to all groups, 'Why don't we come together?' '' Mr. Daugherty said in an interview.
Inauguration Day, though, will be mostly business as usual. The 5th through 12th graders at Victory Christian Center will watch the ceremony on a big screen, but Mr. Daugherty said he would be traveling. Church staff members might watch in their offices, he said.
To be sure, Oklahoma remains subtly distinct from the national pattern. The state unemployment rate, while up almost a percentage point from where it stood in the fall, is still well below the national average. And the state budget, for the moment, is running a surplus.
Gun sellers have also prospered, marketing the notion that the Obama administration might try to tighten rules on gun ownership. What had been a monthly gun show near downtown has been held twice a month since November.
But an economy that looked solid enough two months ago to feel insulated -- or at least not shaky enough to nudge many voters toward the idea of changing party control of the White House -- has also shivered since then in the chill breeze of recession.
Ron Green saw a change in mid-November. Sales at the downtown deli owned by his wife, Susan, called The Greens on Boulder, dropped 30 percent in one week, compared with the previous year. ''Business fell off a cliff,'' said Mr. Green, who pitches in at lunch.
In conservations with customers, he said he had heard more business people agree lately that an Obama stimulus plan was sounding pretty good for the city.
Some black people here say their racial anxiety has heightened since the election, an ill-defined uneasiness they feel in mixed-race situations. With 380,000 residents, Tulsa is 70 percent white, 15 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic.
Princetta Rudd-Newman is living through that mix of hope and anxiety. She exults one minute over Mr. Obama's election, she said, and frets the next over the future of the city she loves.
Her family has a long history here -- an uncle began one of Tulsa's oldest black-owned businesses, a funeral home, in 1917 -- and Ms. Rudd-Newman has been trying this month to organize an inauguration party in the city's historically black north end. But the money has not been coming in, especially at the $150-a-ticket Patriot level, pitched to local white-dominated corporations.
Ms. Rudd-Newman said she did not think it was about race. ''It's financial, in my perception,'' she said. ''It's hard times.''
But it is also a time, for many people, to wait and see. The political debate over what might be has developed into more practical considerations about what can be done with the world as it is.
''Nothing's changed,'' said John Rittenoure, a software developer for Tulsa's electric utility company, referring to his opinion of Mr. Obama. ''But you've got to give the guy a chance, see what he can do.''

HEADLINE: More Than They Could Have Hoped For, After a Generation of Big Dreams

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE BREAKTHROUGH 
 Politics and Race in the Age of Obama 
 By Gwen Ifill 
 277 pages. Doubleday. $24.95. 
 WHAT OBAMA MEANS... 
 For Our Culture, Our Politics, Our Future 
 By Jabari Asim 
 223 pages. William Morrow. $21.99. 
 For Gwen Ifill, moderator and managing editor of ''Washington Week'' on PBS, Barack Obama's 21-month-long campaign laid bare ''America's conflicts about race,'' and his historic election signifies the many breakthroughs in electoral politics that a new generation of black politicians has been making around the country, building upon the achievements of the civil rights generation, while exchanging its advocacy and movement politics for a broader, mainstream brief. 
 For Jabari Asim, the author of ''The N Word'' and editor in chief of The Crisis, the N.A.A.C.P. magazine, Barack Obama's remarkable ascendancy reflects ''the alignment of irreversible cultural trends, substantial political developments and unstoppable market forces.'' As Mr. Asim sees it, Mr. Obama ''appeared at exactly the right time and place in the course of American events,'' following in the footsteps of crossover stars like Prince, Michael Jackson, Bill Cosby, Michael Jordan and Denzel Washington, even as he captured the imagination of a new generation of voters, oblivious to the barriers of race and the fatalism of the past. 
 Both these authors' books -- ''The Breakthrough'' by Ms. Ifill, and ''What Obama Means'' by Mr. Asim -- offer some cogent insights into the political and cultural environment in which Mr. Obama forged his momentous victory. But by so insistently trying to turn him into a representative figure emblematic of broader social trends, both books have the inadvertent effect of diminishing Mr. Obama's particular gifts and the startling efficacy of his campaign, and they minimize the roles that a global economic crisis and voter frustration with eight years of Bush policies played in shaping the dynamics of the 2008 election. 
 Because every aspect of Mr. Obama's candidacy was minutely discussed, dissected and deconstructed by reporters, pundits and scholars over the course of nearly two years, much of what Ms. Ifill and Mr. Asim write in these pages about his campaign will sound highly familiar. In this respect their books often feel like value-added amalgamations of arguments made by other journalists during the run-up to the election. 
 Some of the most provocative passages in ''What Obama Means'' extrapolate from a 2007 Los Angeles Times piece by David Ehrenstein, who suggested that in white voters' imaginations, Mr. Obama played the role of the ''Magic Negro'': a postmodern folk culture figure (exemplified by Sidney Poitier in ''Lilies of the Field'' and Scatman Crothers in ''The Shining''), who surfaces one day to help a white protagonist and thereby assuage white guilt ''over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history.'' As for ''The Breakthrough,'' much of its central narrative retraces ground covered in a New York Times Magazine article last August by Matt Bai, who contrasted the views of veterans of the civil rights movement with those of younger African-American politicians like Mr. Obama, Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, Representative Artur Davis of Alabama and Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia -- politicians who have tended to build more diverse constituencies and work from within the establishment as elected officials rather than agitate from outside. 
 Ms. Ifill's book also retraces distinctions Mr. Obama drew during the campaign, between the Moses generation, which fought for civil rights in places like Selma and Birmingham, and the Joshua generation, charged with finishing its work; between members of an older generation who grew up with segregation and remained haunted by memories of ''humiliation and doubt and fear'' and a younger generation eager to move beyond the old racial divisions.
 In ''The Breakthrough'' Ms. Ifill observes that the worldview of many older black politicians like Andrew Young was defined by limitation: ''They could not eat at lunch counters. They could not sit where they liked on buses or vote how and for whom they liked. They could not attend the schools they preferred or aspire to the jobs they believed they were qualified to hold. Every time one of those barriers fell, it was power seized, not given. They marched, they preached, and they protested.'' 
 In contrast, she goes on, their children ''were raised to believe they could do anything'': ''Their schools were integrated, and Ivy League colleges came looking for them.'' Growing up in a ''world shaped by access instead of denial,'' they did not carry the psychological and political baggage of their elders, and they were idealistic enough to believe that change was not only possible but within their grasp.
 During the early months of the Democratic race, many longtime black leaders lined up behind Hillary Rodham Clinton rather than Barack Obama: some because they were old Clinton allies and didn't really know the junior senator from Illinois; some because they feared that a black candidate was not going to win the primary fight, much less the general election; some because they said Mr. Obama lacked experience, implying that he should have waited his turn; and some, Ms. Ifill writes, because Mr. Obama ''refused to demand support based solely on his breakthrough potential.'' 
 But once Mr. Obama won in Iowa, showing he could attract white votes, black voters began flocking to him en masse. Suddenly, Ms. Ifill notes, questions about whether Mr. Obama was ''black enough'' appeared ''moot, almost quaint.'' She goes on to quote Michael S. Steele, the former Maryland lieutenant governor, arguing that any African-American politician elected to national office will always have to perform a kind of balancing act: 
 ''You've got to be able to speak about these things more broadly, because you don't want white folks to think you are a single-issue or single-race individual, which most people aren't,'' he said, ''but the black community also has to hear some authenticity with respect to their issues in your voice.'' 
 Ms. Ifill writes in this volume more as a reporter than as an analyst, and by far the freshest portions of her book deal not with Mr. Obama, but with other African-American politicians who have achieved breakthroughs on a state or local level -- including Artur Davis; Cory A. Booker; Michael A. Nutter; former Congressman Harold Ford Jr. from Tennessee; Gov. David A. Paterson of New York; Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts; Mayor Michael B. Coleman of Columbus, Ohio; and Washington's mayor, Adrian M. Fenty. 
 In ''What Obama Means,'' Mr. Asim also tries to situate Mr. Obama's achievements within a larger context. He does a deft job of placing Mr. Obama's speeches within an oratorical tradition, tracing echoes in his work back to such disparate predecessors as Martin Luther King Jr. and Barbara Jordan, but when it comes to broader cultural antecedents, his narrative often seems lacking in nuance. 
 After all, it's one thing to argue, as some have, that Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice have enabled white voters to become accustomed to seeing blacks in authority positions; it's quite another to suggest, as Mr. Asim does, that fictional black presidents, like Morgan Freeman in ''Deep Impact'' and Dennis Haysbert in ''24,'' have helped pave the road for white voters' acceptance of Mr. Obama as president. 
 It seems similarly trivializing to suggest that People magazine's choice of Denzel Washington as the ''sexiest man alive'' in 1996 ''represents a sort of tipping point'' in cultural history that somehow contributed to Mr. Obama's election as president.
 What most observers would agree on is that the election of Barack Obama is a true watershed moment -- a moment, Ms. Ifill says, that signifies that ''we in this country may be reaching the end of the 'firsts.' '' Perhaps, she goes on, ''breakthroughs are on the verge of becoming enough of a part of the national political landscape that at some point we will cease noticing them altogether.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, a Stronger Push to Oversee Banks

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY. 
Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
After a first round of costly bank bailouts and stimulus programs came up short, governments in Europe are moving more forcefully to take control over banks and their lending policies.
 But it will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions more. With one of its leading banks facing losses of $:28 billion, or $40.6 billion, Britain on Monday outlined details of its $:100 billion plan to help banks limit their losses from troubled assets -- and to get lending flowing again in the face of deteriorating economic conditions.
 The British government said banks taking advantage of the system would have to sign legally binding agreements requiring them to provide more loans to consumers and businesses.
 Governments and financial institutions around the globe have begun to acknowledge that the trillions of dollars' worth of stimulus and bailout measures pledged last fall have not been enough to flush away the bad loans that clog the system. If anything, it now appears that problems are set to worsen as the economic downturn accelerates. 
 The British move comes as the United States throws a second lifeline to Citigroup and Bank of America, and considers ways to relieve banks of their troubled assets using hundreds of billions in new money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. In Washington on Sunday, David Axelrod, a top adviser to President-elect Barack Obama, said that the second half of the $700 billion bailout fund, to be released after Mr. Obama takes office, must be administered in a way that will get ''credit flowing again to businesses and families across the country. That hasn't happened with the expenditure of the first $350 billion.'' 
 Other European bailout plans are also coming together. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his finance minister, Christine Lagarde, will meet Tuesday with French bankers to press them into ease their lending restrictions.
 ''The banks must understand that the times have changed,'' Ms. Lagarde said in an interview published Monday in a business daily, Les Echos. ''The president was very clear: To benefit from a new capital injection, they will have to make precise commitments'' -- including giving up bonuses this year.
 As if to illustrate the depths of the problem, Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Monday that it faced losses of up to $:28 billion or $41 billion for 2008, a figure that would be a record for any British company. That includes as much as $:20 billion of goodwill write-downs from the acquisition of a portion the financial giant, ABN-Amro. Royal Bank of Scotland's shares fell nearly 67 percent Monday.
 The downgrading of Spain's sovereign debt -- the second European country to suffer that fate in less than a week -- added to the sense of urgency in Europe. Greece's sovereign debt was cut last Wednesday, rekindling worries about what might happen to the euro zone as a whole if a member were to default on its public debt.
 The European Commission on Monday warned that the European Union, which has 27 member nations, faced a ''deep and protracted recession.'' It predicted that the European economy would shrink by 1.8 percent in 2009, with the loss of 3.5 million jobs across the bloc.
 Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Josef Ackermann, who is also chairman of the Institute of International Finance, based in Washington, suggested last week that the creation of so-called bad banks might be the way forward.
 ''Buying toxic assets from banks is a good thing because I think confidence comes back into the banking system when you are certain -- or more certain -- that you have no time bombs ticking,'' Mr. Ackermann said.
 In a bad-bank arrangement, governments would buy up scorched assets, said George Magnus, senior economic adviser at UBS Investment Bank in London. That contrasts with the method now being used in the United States and Britain, where troubled assets remain on the balance sheet, but losses beyond some limit are insured by the government.
 ''There is no 'right' way and both schemes have their merits and drawbacks under given and local circumstances,'' Mr. Magnus wrote in a research note. He said the bad bank plan might be more suited to the United States, while Britain may be able to manage with an insurance program because it has far fewer banks.
 Top members of the incoming administration of Barack Obama have already signaled that they want to focus on freeing up credit in the United States, including buying up bad assets in a way that harks back to the initial vision of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which has been financed with $700 billion.
 Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm in London, said he thought that Europe was also ''edging toward the creation of bad banks.''
 ''There are divergent agendas among banks and governments,'' Mr. Adamson said. ''Governments want banks to keep lending. From a bank's point of view, rash lending is one way they got into this mess.''
 In London, the British Treasury said it would ''protect financial institutions against exposure to exceptional future credit losses on certain portfolios of assets'' in return for a fee. Participating institutions will take the initial losses, with the Treasury bearing most of the rest -- on the order of 90 percent.
 The new measures also would authorize the Bank of England to buy as much as $:50 billion worth of ''high-quality assets'' from financial institutions. That would give the central bank more monetary policy tools after it cut its benchmark interest rate to 1.5 percent on Jan. 8, the lowest level in a history that goes back centuries.
 The government is also extending measures introduced under the October plan to increase liquidity in the financial system, including a $:250 billion program to allow banks to issue government-backed bonds.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown told journalists that he was ''angry'' at Royal Bank. ''Almost all their losses are in the subprime markets in America and related to the acquisition of the bank ABN-AMRO,'' he said.
 ''And these are irresponsible risks which were taken by a bank with people's money in the United Kingdom.''
 The British Treasury said the latest steps would cost taxpayers an additional $:100 billion on top of the $:37 billion plan announced in October and a $:20 billion stimulus plan announced in November.
 The government said it was exchanging $:5 billion of preference shares it had received from Royal Bank in its previous bailout for common equity, a move that raises the government's stake in the bank to 68 percent from 58 percent, but still falls short of full-scale nationalization, which would erase equity investors' stake.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Brown and his chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, signaled that the government funds would come with strings attached, as any bank taking advantage of the new measures would be required to increase lending. Already, they said, Royal Bank would be required to lend $:6 billion over the next 12 months. Officials said they would also order Northern Rock, the mortgage lender nationalized a year ago, to increase lending.
 European bank stocks fell sharply Monday on fears that more pain, including wiping out shareholders, might lie ahead. Last week, the Irish government nationalized Anglo Irish Bank, rendering equity stakes worthless.
 ''It's a step in the right direction,'' Peter Dixon, global equities economist in London for Commerzbank, said of the latest British rescue plans. ''But in the end, either banks will have to be nationalized or have their bad loans split off into another institution. That's the only way they will be clear about their capital positions.''
 Denmark late Sunday announced an $18 billion aid plan for its banks, saying it would inject the funds on condition that they increase lending.
 In France, the government last year agreed to lend the top six banks
 10.5 billion euros, or $13.8 billion, and Ms. Lagarde said it had authorization from the European Union to go ahead now with an equivalent amount. But she told Les Echos that banks availing themselves of the funds would have to abide by Mr. Sarkozy's demand last week that they suspend bonuses, as a ''minimum,'' and that they moderate their dividend payouts.
 The credit rating downgrade for Spain, while not unexpected considering the economic crisis, nonetheless increases the pressure on European policy makers for a rapid overall response.
 The downgrade reflects ''expectations that public finances will suffer in tandem with the expected decline in Spain's growth prospects, and that the policy response may be insufficient to effectively counter the related economic and fiscal challenges,'' said Trevor Cullinan, a Standard & Poor's credit analyst.
 Joaquin Almunia, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs said at a briefing in Brussels that the risk of default, while always present in both the private and public sectors, was not a major concern. In the case of euro zone countries, ''I don't think the risks are high or are significant,'' he said.
 In Brussels, the Spanish economy minister, Pedro Solbes, sought to put the downgrade in the best possible light, noting that the new rating of AA+ ''is something quite positive still.''
 The European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, acknowledged Monday in Paris the year 2009 ''will be very difficult.'' But he said investors might now be taking an overly pessimistic view of the future.
 ''Having underestimated considerably the true underlying risks that were lying ahead in 2008 and 2009,'' Trichet said, ''it would be an error of equal magnitude for the actors of the private sector to now overestimate the risks that are lying ahead.''

HEADLINE: Fiat Nearing a Deal for Chrysler Stake

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Italian carmaker Fiat is nearing a deal to take a large stake in Chrysler, the most financially troubled of the Detroit automakers, and begin selling small cars in the United States through Chrysler, a person with knowledge of the talks said Monday. 
 The deal could give Fiat control of 35 percent of Chrysler by later this year and possibly raise its stake in the American company to as much as 55 percent, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. 
 The talks were first reported Monday by the trade journal Automotive News. Chrysler declined to comment directly on the matter.
 ''In today's economic environment, talks are going on between companies in all industries -- ours is no different,'' a Chrysler spokeswoman, Lori McTavish, said in a statement. ''Chrysler as a matter of policy, however, does not confirm or disclose the nature of its private business meetings.''
 Chrysler, which received $4 billion in loans from the federal government last month to help it remain solvent, has been involved in partnership talks with several rivals since being sold to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management in 2007. Its former owner, Daimler, retains a 19.9 percent stake.
 The company considered merging with General Motors several months ago and last year reached a deal to build pickup trucks for Nissan-Renault, which will in turn build small cars for Chrysler. 
 Chrysler also began talking to Fiat last year about building cars for the Italian company's Alfa Romeo brand.
 A partnership with Fiat could help Chrysler convince its skeptics in Congress that the company is viable as it seeks more money. During recent hearings in Washington on aid for the Detroit automakers, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, expressed doubt that Chrysler would last much longer independently.
 ''They have not invested in technology and those kinds of things necessary to be a stand-alone,'' Mr. Corker said last week during a tour of the Detroit auto show. ''My hope is that they will in fact merge and again be a viable part of Michigan and our country.''
 Chrysler and General Motors, which also received government loans, have until March 31 to submit plans showing that they can reorganize themselves and survive. Both companies are negotiating with the United Automobile Workers union to find ways to make their labor costs more competitive with foreign-based rivals like Toyota and Honda.
 Fiat, which stopped selling cars in the United States in 1983, would use Chrysler's North American plants and dealers to introduce lower-emission, front-wheel drive vehicles, Automotive News reported.

HEADLINE: On Eve of History, Obama Follows Low-Key Path: For New First Lady, Hints of Agenda and Tone

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- She celebrated her 45th birthday in a vintage train car, amid balloons and crepe-paper streamers, and cheering crowds serenaded her by name.
She danced in front of the Lincoln Memorial to Stevie Wonder's ''Higher Ground'' with her husband and daughters clapping by her side. She assembled care packages for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, in this long, whirlwind weekend, marveled that she would soon be the public face of America's first family.
On Inauguration Day, Michelle Obama will become the first African-American to assume the role of first lady, a woman with the power to influence the nation's sense of identity, its fashion trends, its charitable causes and its perceptions of black women and their families. Already, the outlines of her style and public agenda have begun to emerge.
She has hired a politically seasoned team of advisers and an interior decorator committed to creating a family-friendly feel in her elegant new home. She has sketched out a vision of a White House brimming with children and ordinary Americans while suggesting she may delegate some traditional first lady duties to her staff: food tastings, china selection and the like. 
She has decided to shape her public program with the help of a policy director who has raised concerns about instances of systemic employment bias against minorities and called for tougher enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, contentious issues in the workplace.
And she has highlighted the warm, informal tone that she hopes will characterize her time in the executive mansion by signing e-mail messages to supporters simply as ''Michelle.''
Mrs. Obama, a Harvard-educated lawyer and a former hospital executive, has made it clear that her two young daughters will be her biggest priority. The causes she has promised to promote -- expanding volunteerism and supporting military families and working parents -- fall squarely into the realm of platforms traditionally championed by first ladies. But the staff she has assembled is also clearly prepared to tackle a tougher issues-oriented program.
''Her experience will guide the kinds of things she does, and her personal experience is unique for a first lady,'' said Paul Schmitz, a longtime friend. ''She understands the needs of low-income communities. She understands the needs of women. She has balanced raising a family with a career.''
''She'll think deeply about how to use her own bully pulpit,'' said Mr. Schmitz, who heads Public Allies, a nonprofit leadership-training network for young adults. ''And I think that's the challenge. You are now the most prominent woman in America. What does that mean? What do you do?''
It is a difficult question, particularly since Mrs. Obama is still grappling with how life in the grand house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will transform her family's existence.
She has grown accustomed to being in the spotlight -- with Secret Service agents accompanying her to private lunches with her girlfriends -- and has consulted with Laura Bush and former first ladies Hillary Rodham Clinton, Nancy Reagan and Rosalynn Carter. But she has no experience with the day-to-day details of life in the White House.
President Bush and his wife were old hands at White House living because they had visited often when Mr. Bush's father, George Bush, was running the country.
Mrs. Obama visited the private residence in the White House for the first time in November after the election. She grew up in a tiny apartment and marveled recently when she and her close friend Valerie Jarrett pored over photographs of the 15 bedrooms in the presidential mansion.
''You have to pinch yourself to think that that's home,'' said Ms. Jarrett, who is also one of President-elect Barack Obama's closest advisers.
Craig Robinson, Mrs. Obama's brother, described the Obamas' new reality as ''mind-boggling.''
''Every time I talk to her, I'm like, 'What are you doing now?' '' said Mr. Robinson, who has delighted in his sister's accounts of her days in Washington before the move to the White House. ''We are such novices at this. I'm just trying to find out, How many bathrooms are in there?''
(The answer is 34, according to William Seale, a historian who has written about the White House.)
Mrs. Obama has the highest favorability ratings of any incoming first lady since 1980, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll completed Thursday. Forty-six percent of those surveyed had a favorable opinion of her. Seven percent had an unfavorable view.
Gossip magazines, cable networks and major newspapers vie for tiny details about her and her daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7. The designer of Mrs. Obama's inaugural gown? (Sorry, no word yet.) Her favorite musician of all time? (Yes, Stevie Wonder.) Where in the White House is Malia likely to gather her thoughts when she has a tough school assignment? (At Lincoln's desk where he penned the Gettysburg Address.)
Mrs. Obama, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has reached out directly to supporters via e-mail and YouTube. And she has taken care in recent months to strike the right notes, emphasizing a preference for American fashion designers and announcing plans to use ''affordable brands and products'' as she redecorates the White House during this recession.
She knows that life under the microscope carries its perils.
After some rhetorical stumbles during the presidential campaign, Mrs. Obama was criticized by conservative columnists who accused her of being unpatriotic and bitter toward whites. Her approval ratings have soared since she refocused her image on her role as a wife and mother, but she still comes under periodic attack from conservative bloggers and others.
''There will be some people trying to pick holes,'' Mr. Robinson said. ''We're used to that.''
Mrs. Obama's diverse team, which includes former Congressional staff members and strategists from Democratic presidential campaigns, seems equally prepared to hone her message or deflect attack.
Jackie Norris, her chief of staff, served as a senior adviser in Iowa for the presidential campaigns of Mr. Obama and former Vice President Al Gore. Melissa Winter, her deputy chief of staff, spent 18 years on Capitol Hill.
Jocelyn Frye, her policy director, is general counsel for at the National Partnership for Women and Families in Washington, a nonprofit that advocates for workplace equity. Camille Johnston, her communications director, worked on Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns and served as press secretary for two cabinet officials. And her press secretary, Katie McCormick Lelyveld, worked for Mrs. Clinton when she was first lady and was deputy communications director for Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign.
By contrast, Laura Bush's first chief of staff came straight from the Governor's Mansion in Texas and knew little about national or Washington politics, and her press aides have typically lacked national media experience, according to a former Bush administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
While many of Mrs. Obama's advisers do not have White House experience and may have initial difficulties navigating its bureaucracy, the official said the staff was far more politically seasoned than Mrs. Bush's team. ''She's trying to get the best people, pulling in the cream of the crop,'' the official said of Mrs. Obama.
The new first lady will also have clear channels to the West Wing, counting close friends among the president-elect's advisers, including Ms. Jarrett and Susan Sher, who is associate counsel. They could be key allies should she choose to weigh in on policy issues she cares about. (She has said that she plans to leave the business of governing to her husband.)
Mrs. Obama has focused publicly in recent months on her self-described role of ''mom in chief,'' settling her daughters at Sidwell Friends School and persuading her mother to move into the White House. She has made a point of hiring a chief of staff and a chef who regularly wrestle with the challenges faced by working mothers.
But the disciplined, no-nonsense executive also comes through.
While Mrs. Bush often hand-picked the silver, china and tablecloths for White House dinners, Mrs. Obama is more likely to focus on the broad themes of such events, delegating the details, Ms. Jarrett said. (Mr. Robinson said that while his sister typically cooked for her girls, she might be happy to delegate that for a while, too.)
She wants a home that is gracious, with 20th-century art amid the antiques, but comfortable for children. As a former community organizer, she also wants the White House to be more accessible to ordinary Americans, envisioning picnics that might include local children as well as state dinners.
''She wants it to be fun and to bring a sense of youth and style,'' said Ms. Sher, Mrs. Obama's friend.
Mrs. Obama also wants the White House to feel like home. She has spent her entire life in Chicago, aside from her years in college and law school. And when her closest friends prepared to hold a goodbye lunch in her honor, she asked only for keepsakes and personal mementos.
So her friends brought snapshots in small frames, photographs of Mrs. Obama with her family, colleagues and friends in Chicago.
Ms. Sher, who attended the lunch, said she did not know if Mrs. Obama had settled on a place for the photos in her new house. But she is not worried.
''She said there's a lot of room,'' Ms. Sher said.

HEADLINE: The Politics Of Cohesion

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1962, Daniel Bell published a book called ''The End of Ideology.'' The title struck a nerve because it reflected the view, common at the time, that the United States was about to leave behind the brutal, ideological politics that had characterized the 1930s and the early cold war. The 1960s, it was believed, would be a decade of cool pragmatism. Keynesian models would be used to scientifically regulate the economy. Important decisions would be made empirically. 
 Instead, we got what Francis Fukuyama later called The Great Disruption. The information economy began to disrupt the industrial economy. The feminist revolution disrupted gender and family relations. The civil rights revolution disrupted social arrangements. The Vietnam War discredited the establishment. 
 These disruptions were generally necessary and good, but the transition was painful. People lost faith in old social norms, but new ones had not yet emerged. The result was disorder. Divorce rates skyrocketed. Crime rates exploded. Faith in institutions collapsed. Social trust cratered.
 As community bonds dissolved, individual autonomy asserted itself. Liberals championed the moral liberation of individuals. Conservatives championed their economic liberation. The combined result was a loss of community and social cohesion, and what Christopher Lasch called a culture of narcissism. 
 Instead of ending ideology, the Great Disruption produced ideological politics. The weakening of social norms led to fierce battles as groups vied to create new ones. Personal became political. Groups fought over basic patterns of morality.
 Republicans tended to win elections because liberals were associated with disorder and conservatives with attempts to restore it. Yet both sides were infected with the same pulverizing style. Politics wasn't just about allocating resources. It was a contest over values, lifestyles and the status of your tribe. This venomous style dominated politics straight through the two baby boomer presidencies -- of Clinton and Bush. 
 But societies do mend themselves, slowly and organically. In 2002, Rick Warren wrote a phenomenally popular book called ''The Purpose Driven Life.'' The first sentence was, ''It's not about you.'' That was a sign that the age of expressive individualism was coming to an end. New community patterns and social norms were coalescing. 
 Crime rates had begun to fall, along with teen pregnancy rates and a rash of other social indicators. Young people flocked to perform community service. Couples created families that sought to harvest the gains of feminism while preserving the best of traditionalism.
 In the cultural realm, the Great Disruption came to an end. New social norms and patterns settled into place. Barack Obama exemplifies the social repair. The product of a scattered family, he has created a highly traditional one, headed by two professionally accomplished adults. To an almost eerie extent, he exemplifies discipline, equipoise and self-control. Under his leadership, as Peter Beinart noted in Time, Democrats came to seem like the party of order while Republicans were associated with disorder.
 Obama's challenge will be to translate the social repair that has occurred over the past decade into political and governing repair. Part of that will be done with his inaugural address today. Look for him to emphasize the themes of responsibility, cohesion and unity. Look for him to reject the culture, which lingered in the financial world, of anything goes.
 Part of that will be done with his governing style. Obama aims to realize the end-of-ideology politics that Daniel Bell and others glimpsed in the early 1960s. He sees himself as a pragmatist, an empiricist. Politics is not personal with him. He does not turn political disagreements into a status contest between one kind of person and another. He is convinced that most Americans practice their politics between the 40-yard lines. 
 Part will be accomplished with his aggressive outreach efforts. Already he has cooperated with Republicans. He has rejected the counsel of the old liberal warriors who want retribution and insularity. 
 But the real test will come in the realm of policy. The next few months will be occupied with the stimulus package. And anybody who is not terrified by the prospect of spending $800 billion hastily has not spent enough time studying the difference between economic textbooks and the way government actually operates.
 But after that, folks in the Obama camp hope to create a Grand Bargain. That would mean building on a culture of cohesion and tackling the issues that require joint sacrifice -- like reducing deficits, fixing Medicare and Social Security and reforming health care. These problems were insoluble during the era of division and distrust. In the climactic season of his presidency, the winter of 2010, Obama would seek to fundamentally restore balance to American government.
 If he can do that, the Great Disruption would truly be over. The next chapter in American history would begin on firmer ground.

HEADLINE: Is Star Power Enough to Sell Beer in Hard Times? Two Brewers Hope So

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
TWO big brewers are about to find out whether star power is sufficient to help counteract a star-crossed economy.
 Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken are preparing efforts to reach beer drinkers who have been watching their spending since the recession began. Beer has long been thought to be less affected by downturns than other consumer purchases, but the severity of current conditions has called into question the most cherished of marketing assumptions.
 ''Now more than ever, you need to give consumers a reason why you're worth paying more for,'' said Christian McMahan, chief marketing officer at Heineken USA in White Plains, a division of the Dutch brewer Heineken. 
 ''This is what leaders do in tougher times,'' he added. ''When others are pulling back, we're moving forward.''
 For the flagship Heineken brand, Heineken USA is introducing a tongue-in-cheek campaign that presents the actor John Turturro as a guru whose words of wisdom are composed of more head than beer.
 Some sayings offered by Mr. Turturro's character seem sagacious (''Every man is the leader of his own expedition''). Others sound like double-talk (''But he who wanders with purpose has no purpose to wander'').
 Plans call for the Heineken campaign, which began on Sunday, to be expanded to include a sibling, Heineken Premium Light, along with the original brand. The budget for the campaign, created by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., is estimated at more than $125 million.
 When it comes to spending on beer ads, no one outdoes Anheuser-Busch InBev, which pays hefty sums to be the exclusive beer sponsor of the Super Bowl each year and typically buys the most commercial time during the game of any advertiser.
 The company will complete its lineup of seven or so commercials for brands like Bud Light and Budweiser, which will be shown during the four and a half minutes of time it has bought on the NBC broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII on Feb. 1. Although the network is charging an estimated average of $3 million for each 30-second spot, significant spenders like Anheuser-Busch InBev usually pay lower rates.
 One likely choice for the game is a commercial with the comedian Conan O'Brien, making his debut as a product pitchman. The spot spoofs celebrities who limit their endorsement work to foreign countries. The commercial starts with Mr. O'Brien agreeing to peddle Bud Light if his spot runs only in Sweden; naturally, complications ensue.
 The commercial is meant to assist Mr. O'Brien and NBC in raising the curtain for his new role as the host of ''The Tonight Show.'' Mr. O'Brien asked that his fee be donated to the Fresh Air Fund charity, executives at Anheuser-Busch said.
 There also may be as many as three spots during the game that would feature the familiar Budweiser Clydesdales, which have had star turns in many previous Super Bowl commercials. The spots are variously humorous, upbeat and even uplifting in what the Anheuser-Busch executives said they hoped would be a welcome respite for viewers from current events.
 ''A little more than ever,'' Super Bowl Sunday will be ''a time to kick back and enjoy the game with family and friends,'' said Bob Lachky, chief creative officer at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis.
 ''It's about entertainment,'' he added. ''It's about escape.''
 Usually, the Clydesdales are seen in only one spot in each Super Bowl. The possible three-play comes after the Belgian brewer InBev completed its $52 billion acquisition of the American brewer Anheuser-Busch.
 Although ''I wouldn't say it's the driving factor'' behind the additional appearances, said Keith Levy, vice president for marketing at Anheuser-Busch, the horses do ''embody the company and its American roots.''
 ''The best thing we can do as marketers,'' he added, is reassure consumers that ''the things they've grown accustomed to and love about our brands still remain.''
 In one Clydesdale commercial, a horse engages in a can-you-top-this competition with a Budweiser Dalmatian. A second spot is about the romance of a Clydesdale and a circus horse. A third commercial is a fanciful recounting of how the Clydesdales came to the United States.
 The O'Brien commercial and two Clydesdale spots were created by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. A third Clydesdale commercial was created by Waylon Advertising in St. Louis.
 Three additional spots being considered for the Super Bowl -- for Bud Light, Bud Light Lime and Budweiser American Ale -- were also created by DDB Chicago.
 The Heineken commercials will also run during the Super Bowl, but only in local station breaks in 25 large markets across the country. That is because the Anheuser-Busch sponsorship precludes other brewers from peddling their wares nationally during the game.
 The Heineken campaign carries the theme ''Give yourself a good name,'' which replaces the theme of previous ads, ''It's all about the beer.''
 The new theme ''has two layers to it,'' said Mark Fitzloff, executive creative director at the Portland office of Wieden & Kennedy. ''One is about a name on the bottle; you literally give yourself the Heineken name when you order one.''
 ''On a second level, it's about reputation, how you act in social situations,'' he added. ''Where beer is around, people are not always carrying themselves with dignity.''
 The initial commercials with Mr. Turturro will be followed by ads in stores and bars as well as sponsorships of events like the United States Open tennis tournament. There will also be a campaign aimed at Hispanic consumers, Mr. McMahan said, to be created by the Vidal Partnership in New York.

HEADLINE: Banks Foreclose on Builders

BYLINE: By JOHN COLLINS RUDOLF

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
Dave Brown, one of this city's best-known home builders, had kept his head above water through the housing downturn, not missing a single interest payment on his loans. 
 So he was confounded a few months back when one of his banks, spooked by the decline in his company's revenue, suddenly demanded millions of dollars in additional collateral to continue carrying loans on his projects.
 He was unable to come up with the money, and in October, JPMorgan Chase foreclosed on five of his developments. Shortly thereafter, Brown Family Communities, 33 years in the business, decided to shut its doors. 
 ''They treated me like a deadbeat who missed his car payment,'' said an embittered Mr. Brown, 76. ''They wanted their money now.'' 
 After riding high on one of the greatest housing booms in American history, the nation's home builders today face a devastating reversal of fortune. 
 Although the housing crisis is nearly two years old, many banks had refrained from cracking down on small home builders. 
 They are starting to do so, and a wide swath of the industry could be forced out of business in the next few years. The trouble is concentrated especially in the Sun Belt, the scene of so much overbuilding. 
 Not only have new-home sales stagnated, but builders confront a rising wave of foreclosed properties coming to market at prices below the cost of building a new home. To move houses, they have to mark them down to less than the cost of construction.
 The convergence of these problems is bringing many small and medium-size builders -- who account for about 70 percent of new-home construction in the United States -- to their knees. 
 ''The reality is, we're seeing conditions in home construction and home finance that are the worst since the Depression,'' said Steve Fritts, associate director of risk management policy at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government agency that insures bank deposits.
 Life has been difficult for large publicly traded home-building companies as well, where stock prices have collapsed and construction sharply cut back. Yet for now, many of the public companies can meet their obligations.
 ''They're better capitalized and they have cash on hand,'' said Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst. ''They're in a much better position than the private builders.''
 No hard count exists of precisely how many builders have gone out of business since the downturn began. According to an estimate by the National Association of Home Builders, at least 20,000 builders -- about a fifth of the total nationwide -- have closed up shop in the last two years.
 With the industry still owing hundreds of billions of dollars in loans made at the market peak, many more face insolvency in the coming months and years. ''Probably north of 50 percent will fail,'' Ms. Zelman said.
 Much of that borrowed money went to finance land deals that now appear to have been catastrophic miscalculations. In cities like Phoenix, where housing starts are near record lows, demand for undeveloped land has plummeted, and prices have followed. 
 As defaults and delinquencies rise, home builders, once prized banking customers, have become pariahs. Even builders who are up to date on their interest payments or still managing to sell houses are getting trampled, as in the case of Mr. Brown.
 ''They're not distinguishing the track records of one borrower against another,'' said John Fioramonti, a real estate consultant in Scottsdale, Ariz. ''If you're a builder, you are a bad risk.''
 With the pullback accelerating, complaints among builders of hardball tactics and shoddy treatment by banks are mounting, as is a general sense of betrayal.
 ''The behavior of the banks is unprecedented,'' said Mick Pattinson, a home builder from Carlsbad, Calif. who has organized a national coalition of builders to draw attention to what they regard as unreasonable treatment. ''Yes, there was overleveraging in the industry. But the aftermath doesn't need to have been as brutal as it has been.''
 Some experts defend the banks, saying they are starting to do what is necessary to come to grips with the turmoil in real estate. For months, they have been under pressure from federal bank regulators and their own shareholders to curtail lending to a faltering industry.
 ''The lenders are not operating irrationally or unfairly, generally speaking,'' Mr. Fritts said. ''They have to protect themselves.''
 Access to credit is essential to builders, who rely heavily on borrowed money to finance land acquisitions and home construction. 
 More than 15 percent of loans for single-family home construction were in some form of default by September 2008, up from 10 percent in January of that year, according to figures from Foresight Analytics, a housing analysis firm. Still, until recently, banks had largely chosen to keep past-due borrowers afloat, in the hope that a housing recovery might pave the way for them to repay their debts in full. 
 Only now, with the economic outlook darkening, are lenders stepping up foreclosures of troubled loans. Zelman & Associates, a housing analysis firm, estimates that losses on land and construction loans could eventually reach $165 billion, one reason federal regulators are pushing banks to come to grips with the problem.
 ''When we talk to regulators now, they say they've lost patience,'' said Ms. Zelman, who is chief executive of Zelman & Associates.
 In this climate, keeping loan payments up to date -- something many builders are struggling mightily to do -- is not necessarily any protection.
 Many loans in the building industry are of short duration, coming up for renewal at least once a year. This allows banks to take a fresh look at the financial health of a borrower, as well as the assets securing their debt. A steep fall in cash flow or a decline in the value of the collateral -- usually building lots or half-built houses -- can mean an automatic default, whether a borrower has missed payments or not.
 It was a combination of these factors that put an end to Mr. Brown's home-building company, Brown Family Communities.
 In 2005 and 2006, with loans from JPMorgan Chase and the big finance company GMAC, Brown Family Communities bought hundreds of acres of land on the far outskirts of Phoenix, in towns like Goodyear and Buckeye, where development was rapidly transforming cotton and alfalfa fields into malls and upscale subdivisions. 
 The company was emerging from a record year in 2005, selling an average of 85 homes a month and booking revenues of $352 million.
 Each succeeding year brought a decline in sales, and by 2008, the company was on pace to sell fewer than 300 homes. A glut of foreclosures on the market drove down prices, forcing Mr. Brown's company to discount homes by as much as $100,000.
 In early 2008, GMAC, citing the depreciating worth of assets the company had used as collateral, shut off construction loans for two subdivisions under development. Though Brown Family Communities had yet to miss a payment, renegotiating the debt proved impossible, and GMAC -- struggling with huge problems of its own because of the global credit crisis -- foreclosed on the neighborhoods.
 ''They were in chaos,'' Mr. Brown said of GMAC. ''We couldn't even get them on the phone.''
 In late July, JPMorgan Chase followed suit, freezing construction loans on five subdivisions it had financed. Again, a workout proved elusive. And this time, when the bank foreclosed, it delivered a fatal blow to Brown Family Communities. 
 Neither JPMorgan Chase nor GMAC would comment on their banking relationship with Mr. Brown's company. ''We have been and continue to work with our clients to find the best solution to manage risk for them and for us,'' said Mary Jane Rogers, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase.
 In one otherwise finished subdivision, a half-dozen of Mr. Brown's partially built homes stand amid weeds, their wooden frames slowly bleaching in the desert sun. In another, chain-link fences surround houses that appear only days from completion. 
 Buyers were lined up for several of the homes before the bank halted construction, Mr. Brown said. But they are long gone.
 ''Now you talk about good business sense -- the bank wouldn't allow us to finish them,'' he said. ''Did the bank get millions less than if they had handled it differently? Yes.''
 With thousands of small and midsize builders facing similar circumstances, the outlook for the industry is dire. ''The downturn that we're experiencing right now is so unprecedented that there's really no business model that works,'' said Joel Shine, a real estate investor.
 Some builders are now demanding federal relief. They want a tax credit of up to $22,000 for new-home purchases and they want the government to buy down interest rates on new mortgages, to 3 to 4 percent.
 Some analysts, however, believe such a bailout would artificially re-inflate home prices and encourage further building in a saturated market. ''What is the public good for that?'' asked Thomas Lawler, a housing analyst and former vice president for risk analysis at Fannie Mae.
 Meantime, new construction has collapsed, sending workers in search of employment. Brown Family Communities had a full-time staff of 160 at its peak, not including the thousands of subcontractors at work on hundreds of home sites. Now, only a handful of employees are left.
 Mr. Brown found it excruciating to fire the people who had helped him build his business.
 ''They'd come in and say goodbye and we'd have a good cry and then they'd go on their way,'' Mr. Brown said. ''There's nothing out there for them. The real estate market's gone.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 20 about the financial problems of home builders misstated the actions that JPMorgan Chase took against Brown Family Communities, a borrower in Arizona. The bank took control of five subdivisions built by Brown Family Communities by winning appointment of a court receiver for the properties, not by foreclosing on loans. The article also may have left an incorrect impression that Brown Family Communities went out of business after the bank took control of the properties. The builder had announced its intention to go out of business before the bank acted, blaming its financial straits on earlier steps taken by JPMorgan Chase and other banks.

HEADLINE: TRIBAL RIVALRIES PERSIST AS IRAQIS SEEK LOCAL POSTS

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER; An Iraqi employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Falluja.

DATELINE: RAMADI, Iraq 

 BODY:
Here in barren Anbar Province, the tribes that were once the main source of support for killing American soldiers are now running in provincial elections that, in the best case, could fulfill American promises to create stability in Iraq by the ballot box. 
 But two weeks before the voting, in Anbar it appears that the ancient tribal way of doing business is on a collision course with the new ideal of democracy. Anbar is where the United States military enlisted tribal leaders and former insurgents to create the Sunni Awakening, fostering a calm that rippled around Iraq. 
 Now the tribes are jockeying to gain or maintain power, and people here complain bitterly that the machinery of democracy is gilding corruption, internal rivalries and an intense feudal instinct that regards elected office -- unthinkable under Saddam Hussein -- as a chance for a bigger cut of provincial resources and security forces. 
 ''It's a mess,'' said Sheik Amer Abdul-Jabbar, an elderly and ailing tribal leader from Anbar Province, respected among some as the wise ''prince'' of Anbar, but derided by others as an opportunist eager to lend his tribal credentials to the highest bidder. 
 Around Iraq, the provincial elections, scheduled for Jan. 31, are viewed as a landmark moment to reshape, and make fairer, local politics. Many Sunni Muslims boycotted the last provincial elections four years ago, and as a result are now underrepresented in local councils in many parts of the country. The United States hopes that these elections will fix that as its own military and political power in Iraq wane.
 And in Anbar, the campaign looks refreshingly like elections all over the world. Party posters are plastered around the province, at times on concrete blast walls, reminders of more violent days. 
 There are more than 500 candidates divided into 37 political groups -- a robust choice given the boycott of four years ago. Sheiks making earnest campaign promises proudly display photographs of themselves posing with other politicians. One tribal leader managed pictures with both President Bush and Barack Obama.
 But Anbar, poor and lawless even under Mr. Hussein, is different from many other parts of Iraq. It is overwhelmingly Sunni, so the fights are not ethnic or sectarian but between competing tribes. When the Americans began paying former insurgents and tribal leaders to help enforce security, they favored some tribes over others, in many cases displacing the old for upstarts. 
 That fostered a general peace layered over an angry tribal instability that many fear could turn lethal, in the elections or after. 
 ''We are not suited for democracy,'' said Maj. Gen. Tariq al-Youssef, the chief of the provincial police force, who worries that the tribes are seeking political power not to administer the security forces, but to co-opt them as quasi tribal militias.
 Broadly, the Awakening is seeking to transform its credentials as peacemakers into political power, a force for the minority Sunnis against the dominance of the Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, and the Shiite parties. Here in Anbar, the new political forces are meant to challenge the Iraqi Islamic Party, which became the main Sunni party after the elections in 2005, but is often accused of corrupt and autocratic rule. 
 On one level, the elections are functioning as their American designers had hoped: The lure of elective office is creating new political entities seeking to gain legitimacy by attracting the largest number of voters. 
 ''This is democracy,'' reveled Mamoon Sami Rashid, the governor, who is running for re-election despite many corruption allegations against him. ''Each sheik wants to have his say. Previously only the paramount sheik ruled.''
 On a recent afternoon here in Ramadi, Bangladeshi servants whisked around trays of mutton and rice for well-wishers at the opulent compound of Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha, who is not running for office but is fielding a slate of candidates. His party is casting for votes on promises to rebuild Anbar's war-battered economy and to create jobs.
 But dig deeper, and the tensions become clear.
 Before the American invasion in 2003, the Abu Risha tribe had not been among the most powerful.
 But as the American military built up the Awakening groups, his tribe has flourished with American support and political largess. Sheik Ahmed's brother, Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, was the leader of the Awakening until he was killed in a suicide bombing, betrayed by his own bodyguard, in September 2007.
 Now the sprawling Abu Risha estate is ringed with Iraqi Army and police checkpoints. Sheik Ahmed's new wealth, as the Awakening leader, is on display: stables of Arabian horses, a camel farm, caged fawns, a pink mansion and a fleet of armored S.U.V.'s. Sheik Ahmed owns properties as well as trade and investment companies in the United Arab Emirates. He envisions a similar future for Anbar, and is pushing for a natural gas project worth billions. 
 ''I dream of Anbar becoming like Dubai,'' Sheik Ahmed said. ''We have all the prerequisites.'' 
 Not everyone shares his vision.
 Nestled amid palm groves just across the river from the Abu Risha fief is the seat of the Abu Dhiab tribe. Its leader, Sheik Mohammed al-Hayis, is nicknamed ''the whale'' because of the lucrative contracts steered his way by the American military, admits his brother, Sheik Hamid al-Hayis. A large photograph of Sheik Mohammed with President Bush adorns his opulent mansion, which is decked with marble stairs and giant crystal chandeliers.
 Sheik Hamid, who counts himself among the early Awakening leaders, said that Sheik Ahmed had ''dishonored'' the legacy of his late brother Sattar by forming his own political party and making friendly overtures to the ruling Iraqi Islamic Party, which Sheik Hamid describes as the sworn enemy of the tribes.
 As a result, Sheik Hamid and his brother have formed their own rival election slate called simply the Tribes of Iraq. 
 Among his backers is Sheik Jabbar al-Fahdawi, who accuses Sheik Ahmed of sowing discord inside many tribes, including his own Abu Fahed, by extending patronage to certain members of the tribes and promoting them over others as the real leaders.
 ''Ahmed inherited the Awakening from Sattar and turned it into an enterprise for deals and contracts,'' said Sheik Jabbar, 35, who owns a contracting company.
 ''Anbar is splintered; the tribes are splintered.''
 At the seat of the influential Abu Nimer tribe in the town of Hit, west of Ramadi, a part of the tribe has backed the Abu Risha and a rival group within the tribe belittles them as ''highway bandits'' unfit to enter politics.
 Mr. Maliki has also jumped into the fray in Anbar, drafting nearly 3,000 Awakening members last fall in the town of Garma, near Falluja, into a new tribal council answerable to his office with oversight powers over the local government. This has jolted several sheiks affiliated with the Awakening in Garma, where security remains tenuous. 
 The council's chief, Col. Saad Abbas, recently survived an attempt to poison him after narrowly escaping a truck bomb attack last month. The effective crumbling of the Awakening has benefited other forces in Anbar. 
 In a move viewed by many as a shrewd game of political survival, the Iraqi Islamic Party has spread its candidates among several lists, while its main list, the Alliance of the Educated and Tribes for Development, is led by Sheik Amer, the septuagenarian ''prince'' of Anbar.
 The party's legacy, after four years in power, has been tainted by numerous corruption charges, including financial improprieties involving a $52 million contract to import medical equipment for provincial hospitals and a $60 million contract to upgrade the telecommunications network.
 And so some in Anbar are turning quietly to other alternatives: Gen. Saadoun al-Jumaili, a former commander in the Iraqi Air Force who now leads an elite police unit in Garma, said a reconstructed version of Mr. Hussein's ruling Baath Party was becoming more popular. While it is officially banned, General Jumaili said with some approval that it was operating in secret in Anbar and that it was making strides in regrouping. 
 The party reportedly held a large secret meeting for its members late last year in the town of Khaldiya.
 ''The most honorable party at the moment is the Baath,'' said General Jumaili, adding that tribal leaders, even his own relatives, have no place in electoral politics.
 On the streets of Ramadi and Falluja there is little enthusiasm for the elections and there are ample accusations that both the Iraqi Islamic Party and the Awakening tribal leaders are siphoning off much of the billions of dollars of American and Iraqi financing intended for reconstruction. Much of the reconstruction, indeed, seems cosmetic.
 ''One gang leaves and another one comes in,'' said Anas Ahmed, 22, a government employee in Ramadi.
 In Qattana, a Ramadi neighborhood that was once an insurgent stronghold, and behind the crumbling and war-battered buildings on the main road that were given a quick bright paint job as part of the reconstruction drive, the back streets are flooded with a sludgy mix of sewage and clogged rainwater. A few dead rats float. Several months ago, a major water drainage project was supposed to have fixed the problem. 
 The greatest risk is that dissatisfaction with the current order could leave room for a return of the insurgency. 
 In recent months there have been a number of assassination attempts against political and tribal figures in Anbar. A double truck bombing against police stations in Falluja on Dec. 4 killed 17 people. On Dec. 26, militants broke out of a jail here, leaving 14 dead. 
 ''I am pained because the situation is providing openings for Al Qaeda to come back, and it is coming back slowly but surely,'' said Sheik Aifan al-Issawi, a native of Falluja and one of the original Anbar Awakening leaders, who is running for office.
 Perhaps worse, some in Anbar say they are so fed up with what democracy seems to be bringing that they would welcome back the insurgency. 
 ''This is what we will get from elections,'' said Hassan Ramzi, 47, a carpenter, pointing to the filthy streets of Ramadi. ''There must be a radical solution.''

HEADLINE: Obama Will Ease Restraints on States' Health Insurance Programs for Children

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Within days of taking office, President-elect Barack Obama will rescind a Bush administration policy that has impeded state efforts to provide health insurance to children from low- and middle-income families, aides and advisers said Monday.
 The policy, issued in August 2007, is one of many that the new administration hopes to change or withdraw in its first weeks in office. 
 Some of the policies may take more time to revise because they are in regulations that have already taken effect and have the force of law. 
 Mr. Obama has said, for example, that he objects to a last-minute Bush administration rule that grants sweeping new protections to health workers who refuse to help perform abortions, dispense contraceptives or provide other care because of their ''religious beliefs or moral convictions.''
 This ''provider conscience regulation,'' published on Dec. 19, takes effect on Tuesday, the day of Mr. Obama's inauguration.
 A 1983 Supreme Court decision suggests that the new administration would need to go through a formal rule-making process, with an opportunity for public comment, if it wanted to revoke this rule. 
 Seven states and two family-planning organizations challenged the rule in lawsuits filed last week in Connecticut. The new administration could try to postpone the effective date of the rule, pending judicial review. But a health care worker who was fired could still try to take advantage of protections offered by the rule.
 Mr. Obama is also expected to revoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that prohibits organizations receiving federal money from performing abortions or supporting abortion as a method of family planning in other countries. Critics say that the restrictions -- imposed by President Ronald Reagan, removed by President Bill Clinton two days after he took office and then reinstated by President Bush -- also limit access to contraceptives and family planning services.
 An official at the United States Agency for International Development, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ''We are preparing the new policy, press releases, a memo to the field that could go out immediately telling them that all the restrictions have been removed.''
 The policy on health insurance for children was set forth in a letter to state health officials, not in a formal regulation. The policy is fundamentally at odds with efforts by Mr. Obama and the new Democratic-controlled Congress to expand federal health programs to cover the uninsured, including middle-income families who have lost health benefits along with their jobs.
 Under the Bush policy, the federal government said it would not allow states to cover children from families with annual incomes above 250 percent of the poverty level -- $53,000 for a family of four -- unless they met several preconditions. To qualify, a state must demonstrate that at least 95 percent of eligible children in families making less than 200 percent of the poverty level have already been enrolled in Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program.
 The purpose of the requirement, the White House says, is to make sure states focus on poor children first.
 The Bush policy also requires states to establish waiting periods, so middle-income children do not go directly from a private health plan to a public program. Such youngsters must be uninsured for one year before they can enroll in the children's health program.
 A career employee at the Health and Human Services Department said the Bush administration policy had ''prevented a lot of kids from receiving the health care they needed,'' a concern echoed by many state officials.
 The policy blocked or delayed the expansion of coverage in several states, including Louisiana, New York, Ohio and Oklahoma.
 In September 2007, the Bush administration rejected a request from New York State to expand its Children's Health Insurance Program to cover 70,000 additional uninsured youngsters.
 New York wanted to cover children in families with incomes up to four times as much as the federal poverty level, or $84,800 for a family of four. The state's limit at the time was 250 percent of the poverty level. 
 New York eventually increased its income limit. But the federal government does not pay its usual share of the cost for children above 250 percent of the poverty level, leaving the state to shoulder the full cost. New York normally pays 35 percent of the costs under the child health program.
 Researchers at Georgetown University have found that when a state expands eligibility by increasing its income limit, more than half of the people who sign up were already eligible under the old rules, but had not enrolled. Expanding eligibility apparently increases public awareness of the program and reduces its stigma.
 Still, the issue is contentious in Congress.
 ''I do not believe it is good public policy for a family with an income of $83,000 to be able to get on Schip when the median household income in America is about $50,000,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.

HEADLINE: Obama Team Makes Early Efforts to Show Willingness to Reach Out to Republicans

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama is set to visit a gathering of House Republicans. The incoming White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, is in running cellphone contact with his former Congressional adversaries. Some Republicans say they hear more from the Obama team than they ever did from the Bush administration.
 As Mr. Obama prepares to move into the White House, he and his top advisers are making a visible effort to engage Congressional Republicans, hoping to show they are serious about Mr. Obama's commitment to bipartisanship and to try to enact an economic recovery measure with solid support from both sides in the crucial early going. 
 The outreach has gone beyond the phone calls that Mr. Obama, Mr. Emanuel and others routinely make, though the influence of that personal contact should not be underestimated. More substantively, though, the House Republican leadership has accepted Mr. Obama's invitation to put together its own ideas for economic recovery and said it will initially offer them as a part of the economic recovery package, not as an alternative as has been the usual practice. 
 The fervent courtship is turning the debate on the economic package into a test of whether the Obama White House can put an end to years of distrust between the parties and overcome their recent inability to shape consensus legislation. 
 The early indications are mixed; only six Senate Republicans sided with Mr. Obama on releasing the second half of the bailout money, though two members of the leadership hopped on board. House Republicans have been caustic in criticizing an initial Democratic stimulus proposal and intend to submit their own ideas. And Senate Republicans who last year worked with Democrats on a children's health care measure have been critical of the way Democrats are now handling it.
 Still, both sides say they are willing to try to make it work.
 ''We take the incoming president at his word,'' said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the new No. 3 House Republican, who has been consulting frequently with Mr. Emanuel. ''We've tried to extend the same hand of good faith. We know there are going to be differences, but I think most Republicans believe now is the time for us to work together on behalf of getting this economy moving.''
 Neither party wants to appear unwilling to work together when the public is hopeful for new cooperation. But the legislative give-and-take carries risks. Should Republicans find their ideas kicked to the side after trying to deal with Democrats, they could be reluctant to try again on future legislation. And in shaping bills to win Republican support, Mr. Obama and his advisers risk alienating Democrats who may not be willing to make similar concessions, particularly when the party controls both Congress and the White House.
 ''I'm very happy with Obama,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee. ''But he may overestimate what he is going to get from them. I think there is a danger in overreaching and getting too little in return.''
 Republicans say Congressional Democrats already sent a message to the Obama administration to not go too far in wooing Republicans by sounding the alarm over business tax breaks floated as a way to bring Republicans behind the stimulus bill.
 ''The Obama transition team has reached out to Republicans and they got their fingers burnt by Democrats,'' said Representative Adam H. Putnam of Florida, a former member of the Republican leadership. He said the continuing conversation is ''not only a test to see if Republicans will genuinely engage in collaboration with the Obama administration, but it is also a test to see if Democratic leadership will tolerate collaboration.''
 Mr. Emanuel said ideas from House Republicans on the economic recovery package will get serious consideration. ''There is not just one way to create jobs,'' he said.
 He and Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's economic adviser, met privately with Senate Republicans on Wednesday afternoon before Thursday's vote on freeing the remaining $350 billion in bailout money. Even Republicans who were not persuaded by the consultation said they were impressed by the candor of the two men.
 ''I think they have been pretty impressive,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''They are saying all the right things, and I think they did themselves some good in the briefing.''
 But the positive sentiment did not translate into substantial votes for the money. And leading Senate Republicans who negotiated with Democrats last year over an expansion of children's health insurance lashed out at Democrats on Thursday, saying they were shifting the bill to the left now that they were in full control.
 ''It's a sad start to what is billed as a new era in politics,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, senior Republican on the finance committee.
 Other Republicans say they see an opening with Mr. Obama for a change in the intense partisanship that has typified Congress under both Republican and Democratic control. The parties have generally cooperated only under extreme circumstances like the threatened economic collapse last fall.
 But those same Republicans also note ruefully that President Bush entered office promising to work with both parties and had an initial bipartisan achievement with his education bill before the relationship collapsed almost entirely.
 ''It can fade very rapidly,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of Senator John McCain, the man Mr. Obama defeated. ''I hope this is of a more sustainable nature. I think they are serious about finding common ground. It is not a photo op to me, but time will tell.''

HEADLINE: Inauguration Day: Obama and History

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 During a recent six weeks, while on a book tour across America, I was asked repeatedly in interview after interview to make comparisons between my grandfather Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama -- F.D.R.'s challenge in 1933 during the Great Depression and the president-elect's challenge in the current recession. 
 While I emphasized F.D.R.'s rapport with the American people, I failed to make a basic point. It is that the American people picked up on Roosevelt's attitude. They may not have understood much about the host of new agencies created, but they did understand that their president cared, that he was concerned for them. 
 How F.D.R. managed to convey this feeling I do not know. But later, I learned firsthand from my grandmother Eleanor Roosevelt that ''Pa's great strength'' lay in what was behind his thinking -- his caring, a genuine sense of starting programs that addressed the places and issues where Americans were hurting. (And in the process saving capitalism for this country.) 
 That F.D.R. could have assumed dictatorial powers, but didn't, illustrates the point.
 Mr. Obama will not have the broad mandate the Great Depression handed F.D.R. Hence, he will not have the liberty to press for legislation the way F.D.R. did in launching the New Deal. Unlike F.D.R., Mr. Obama's inheritance of foreign policy problems from the present administration will severely complicate his actions.
 By not having F.D.R.'s mandate for change -- and being burdened by a much wider set of problems -- President-elect Obama actually has a tougher entrance to the Executive Mansion than Roosevelt did in 1933. My sense is that he may have that same political nose that F.D.R. had, that instinct for ''the game'' between the White House and Capitol Hill. We'll see.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Republicans' Latest Talking Point: The New Deal Failed'' (Editorial Observer, Jan. 12):
 Adam Cohen correctly notes that the people who lived through the Great Depression and then the New Deal knew better -- most Americans living then knew that President Franklin D. Roosevelt's policies and leadership had improved their lives and lifted their spirits. The people demonstrated this decisively at the polls, as early as the 1934 midterm elections and in F.D.R.'s unprecedented three re-elections.
 In these last days of a presidency, we should recall what a departing president who as a young man had those Great Depression and New Deal experiences, President Ronald Reagan, stated spontaneously, with humor and no regret, during his last weeks in office at a tribute to F.D.R.: ''I had voted four times for the man we honor today.''

 Re ''Classrooms Find Lessons in Obama's Inauguration'' (news article, Jan. 16):
 While schools nationwide gear up to acknowledge the inauguration of America's 44th president, Barack Obama, it is important that they highlight the historical lessons of this particular inauguration and steer clear of any whiff of partisanship. 
 Not all families voted for Mr. Obama, and the larger lesson of America's journey through the race landscape needs to be kept front and center.
 Slaves built the White House, Bull Connor blasted hoses at peaceful African-American demonstrators in the civil rights era, and Rodney King endured a beating at the hands of white police officers in the early 1990s. Now, America readies to bear witness to the peaceful transfer of power to Barack Obama, the nation's first African-American president. 
 Whether schools close, or bring together the community to watch the inauguration live, schools need to scaffold the history behind this incredible moment in America so as not to lose the teachable moment in the minefield of political partisanship.
 Matt Levinson Hillsborough, Calif., Jan. 16, 2009

 To the Editor:
 Three silent participants in Barack Obama's historic inauguration will be two Jews and a black man: Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney. 
 Four decades ago, these brave young men gave their lives in Mississippi as part of the ''Freedom Summer'' that has made this great day possible. 
 America owes a heart-felt moment of silence for them and for all those who gave their lives for the right for all to vote, as we bear witness to the making of history on Jan. 20. Hope is in the air. 
 Susan Wasserman Bexley, Ohio, Jan. 14, 2009
 To the Editor:
 When my husband rode in the inaugural parade of John F. Kennedy 48 years ago to demonstrate racial equality as a young Japanese-American, he was a token and it was a sham. Now that we are poised to inaugurate a man of color as president of the United States, I can only hope that racial equality and justice will finally begin in this country with all sides understanding that the promise of our Constitution is real and participatory.
 Priscilla Kawakami Salt Lake City, Jan. 15, 2009

 Re ''Your Mother Is Moving In? That's Great'' (Home section, Jan. 15):
 Both my husband and I grew up with our maternal grandparents as part of our Brooklyn households, back in the 1960s and 1970s. There was no question when we started our own family and moved to Westchester that my then-widowed mother would move in with us and help raise our two children. 
 Besides providing our children with the love and wisdom only a grandmother can give, my late mother was regarded as the ''universal grandmother'' to our community at large. Malia and Sasha Obama are luckier than they know. Merri Rosenberg Ardsley, N.Y. Jan. 15, 2009

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Gentlemanly Goodbye

BYLINE: By NORMAN J. ORNSTEIN. 
Norman J. Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE past few weeks have been a time to reflect on the legacy of the Bush administration. It has not been a kind time for George W. Bush. Most analyses have been harsh, raking him over the coals for everything from Hurricane Katrina to Abu Ghraib to the financial meltdown to his advocacy of nearly unfettered executive power. I would join in many of those criticisms. But there is one area where President Bush's legacy will be strong and admirable -- the way he is leaving office.
 Presidential transitions are always difficult. The United States has an extraordinarily long three-month interregnum during which the person departing the presidency retains full power while the person elected to assume the office waits to take over. I have likened it to a man who moves in with his fiancee -- while her soon-to-be former husband still lives in the house. This awkwardness combines with the natural tension between the old and new over policy and personnel that exists even when the outgoing and incoming presidents are in the same party (ask members of George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan's staffs about the 1988 transition). 
 For an outgoing president, there is always some resentment that the new guy is expected to act as president starting the day after the election; everyone anticipates his policies and ignores the actions of the lame duck. The president is often skittish about providing the newcomer with top-secret information, in part because the new team is not formally in place. For the president-elect, the outgoing president's 11th-hour actions, including appointments of his loyalists to career positions, stir resentment. 
 Incoming members of a president-elect's team often encounter sullenness from their outgoing counterparts, or a false eagerness by some who don't want to leave their posts at all. 
 Beginning well before the election, President Bush and his chief of staff, Josh Bolten, decided to make this transition different by removing many of the usual obstacles and fostering cooperation and harmony. President Bush created a formal transition council, headed by Mr. Bolten and including all the people in charge of national security and the economy in his administration, and this group has met regularly to address every action, large and small, that needs to be taken to turn over power.
 The signals went beyond simple cooperation. Mr. Bolten and Clay Johnson, from the Office of Management and Budget, who had worked on the transition when President Bush came to the White House, expedited the security checks and other administrative processes for Barack Obama's nominees. National security briefings were held with the president-elect in Chicago, and a high level of important information was shared with his top aides even before they were assigned to specific posts. It is also clear that Mr. Bush has agreed to make a few difficult or unpopular decisions on his way out so as not to burden Mr. Obama with them -- for example, his request last week that Congress release the second half of the $700 financial billion bailout.
 To be sure, President Bush has signed some last-minute executive orders, especially in the environmental area, that will create headaches for Mr. Obama. But as a top Obama transition official told me, these were limited in number and scope and all done in the open. 
 A good piece of the credit for the smooth transition is also due to the Obama transition team. But it was important for President Bush to be accommodating, given the nature of this transition, occurring as it does during a time of war and economic crisis. The nation can little afford a rocky transfer of power. America also faces threats from terrorists and other adversaries, and the first few months of a new administration can be a vulnerable time for the nation -- when the full national security and economic teams are not yet in place and no crisis decision-making process has been established.
 The Bush administration may be leaving the country with big policy problems. But George W. Bush deserves a big gold star for the way he is leaving his office.

Nostalgia for the Cave Life
Movies like ''10,000 B.C.'' are popular because they appeal to a sense that life used to be simpler, more in sync with the environment and with how humans evolved, Marlene Zuk, a biology professor at the University of California, Riverside, writes. But, the notion that there was a time of perfect adaptation, from which we've now deviated, is a caricature of the way evolution works, she says. PAGE D5

THE PROMISE OF GOVERNMENT
When he accepted his party's nomination last year, Barack Obama repudiated the ''you're on your own'' ethos that had come to define the government's relationship to the people. With the $825 billion economic recovery plan unveiled last week, he is already on track to fulfill his pledge. Page A32
MAYBE, FINALLY, A WILDERNESS BILL
The Senate last week gave final approval to an omnibus public lands bill that would designate more than two million acres across nine states from California to West Virginia as permanent wilderness. The House can now honor the country by passing the bill. Page A32
A MORE DYSFUNCTIONAL F.E.C.
Hardly known for vigor or vigilance, the Federal Election Commission is about to undergo well deserved scrutiny from President-elect Barack Obama's administration. Page A32

HEADLINE: New York Times Accepts an Investor's $250 Million Loan

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The New York Times Companysaid Monday it had reached an agreement with the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu for a $250 million loan intended to help the newspaper company finance its businesses. 
 Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Slim, who already owns 6.9 percent of the Times Company, would invest $250 million in the form of six-year notes with warrants that are convertible into common shares, the company said in a statement. The notes also carry a 14 percent interest rate, with 11 percent paid in cash and 3 percent in additional bonds. 
 The deal comes as the Times Company looks to raise money amid flagging advertising sales and approaching deadlines to pay back $1.1 billion in debt in the next few years. 
 The company will use the proceeds from the transaction to refinance its existing debt. One of its two $400 million revolving credit lines is set to expire in May. The $250 million investment should help free some of the company's borrowing capacity. 
 ''This agreement provides us with increased financial flexibility to continue to execute on our long-term strategy,'' Janet L. Robinson, chief executive of the Times Company, said in a statement. ''We continue to explore other financing initiatives and are focused on reducing our total debt through the cash we generate from our businesses and other decisive steps.'' 
 The company has also put its stake in the Boston Red Sox up for sale and said last year that it would borrow as much as $225 million against its new headquarters in Manhattan through a sale-leaseback agreement. 
 Mr. Slim will receive no representation on the company's board or any shares with special voting rights like those of the Sulzberger family, which controls the company. Nonetheless, when Mr. Slim exercises the warrants, he will be among the largest single shareholders in the Times Company, owning up to 17 percent of the common shares outstanding. 
 The Sulzberger family members own about 19 percent of company and control it with a special class of voting shares.
 Mr. Slim, one of the wealthiest people in the world, controls phone companies and has major investments in retailing, construction, banking, insurance, railroads and mining. In March, Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at $60 billion.
 Mr. Slim first approached the Times Company in November, people briefed on the discussions said.

HEADLINE: Barack Obama's Inaugural Address

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of President Barack Obama's Inaugural Address, as transcribed by CQ Transcriptions: 
 PRESIDENT BARACK Thank you. Thank you.
 CROWD: Obama! Obama! Obama! Obama!
 My fellow citizens: I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.
 I thank President Bush for his service to our nation...
 (APPLAUSE) 
 ... as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
 Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath.
 The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.
 So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.
 That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.
 Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly, our schools fail too many, and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
 These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land; a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.
 Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real, they are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this America: They will be met.
 (APPLAUSE)
 On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
 On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.
 We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.
 (APPLAUSE)
 In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less.
 It has not been the path for the faint-hearted, for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.
 Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things -- some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor -- who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
 For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West, endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
 For us, they fought and died in places Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
 Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
 This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed.
 Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.
 (APPLAUSE)
 For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.
 The state of our economy calls for action: bold and swift. And we will act not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth.
 We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
 We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality...
 (APPLAUSE)
 ... and lower its costs.
 We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.
 All this we can do. All this we will do.
 Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this country has already done, what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage.
 What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long, no longer apply.
 MR. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works, whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.
 Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end.
 And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account, to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day, because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.
 Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.
 But this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.
 The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.
 (APPLAUSE)
 As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.
 Our founding fathers faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.
 Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake.
 And so, to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.
 (APPLAUSE)
 Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
 They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use. Our security emanates from the justness of our cause; the force of our example; the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
 We are the keepers of this legacy, guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We'll begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard- earned peace in Afghanistan.
 With old friends and former foes, we'll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet.
 We will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense.
 And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that, ''Our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.''
 (APPLAUSE)
 For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.
 We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and nonbelievers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth.
 And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.
 To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
 To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.
 To those...
 (APPLAUSE)
 To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.
 (APPLAUSE)
 To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.
 And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders, nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.
 As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.
 We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service: a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.
 And yet, at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
 For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies.
 It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break; the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
 It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
 Our challenges may be new, the instruments with which we meet them may be new, but those values upon which our success depends, honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old.
 These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.
 What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task.
 This is the price and the promise of citizenship.
 This is the source of our confidence: the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.
 This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed, why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall. And why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.
 (APPLAUSE)
 So let us mark this day in remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled.
 In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by nine campfires on the shores of an icy river.
 The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood.
 At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:
 ''Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.''
 America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words; with hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come; let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.
 Thank you. God bless you.
 (APPLAUSE)
 And God bless the United States of America.
 (APPLAUSE)

HEADLINE: How Long Will the Obama Honeymoon Last?

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Given the excitement in Washington this week, one would think that with inauguration of Barack Obama -- and the departure of George W. Bush -- the economy is about to spring back to life, the troops are all on their way home from Iraq, there will be health care coverage for all and, to quote a certain Obama foe turned Obama Secretary of State, ''celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect.''
 But as Mr. Obama takes the oath of office, there is evidence that, as enthusiastic as the public is about the change in power, there are no expectations of quick fixes. The cascade of grim economic news, combined with the calculatedly sober tone Mr. Obama has adopted -- most recently in his no-applause-line speech to thousands of supporters at the concert on the Mall on Sunday -- has provided something of a cushion for Mr. Obama. 
 ''People are going to give Obama more time than they would any other new president because they know he is dealing with unprecedented challenges,'' said Mark McKinnon, a consultant who worked for a time for Senator John McCain, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent in the presidential election. ''The economic crisis President-elect Obama faces may in some ways help him -- it is taking some of the helium out of what would otherwise be stratospheric expectations.''
 Still, if it is now clear that Mr. Obama has some time, the next question is, how much? Just how much patience does the country have for turning the ship of state around, no matter how much it likes its new president?
 Mr. Obama's advisers, who have been nothing if not diligent about pushing the idea that none of this is going to happen quickly, tend to avoid allowing themselves to be nailed down on any specific timetable, not surprisingly. ''I just don't know,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, said in an interview. ''I think that's hard to judge. I think right now people are inclined to give us some time. By time I mean more than months. People understand that it's going to take years.''
 Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's designated chief of staff, responded with a terse e-mail message when asked how long he thought Mr. Obama had. ''Will not put time on it,'' he wrote.
 ''I think based on what I see they know these are big problems and cannot be turned around quickly,'' he wrote. ''Public quite pragmatic.'' 
 A Times/CBS News Poll, conducted last week, offered at least some guidance for the Obama Expectations Clock. Most respondents said they thought it would take Mr. Obama two years or more to deliver on campaign promises to improve the economy, expand health care coverage and end the war in Iraq. One of the more intriguing questions as the nation approaches this transfer of power is this: At what point, if ever, does Mr. Bush lose ownership of this recession and it becomes an Obama recession? Most respondents think the recession will last two years or longer.
 David Plouffe, who was Mr. Obama's campaign manager, argued that there were some ways in which Mr. Obama can earn patience from the American public, and that much of it has to do with tone. ''People expect a change in priorities,'' he said. ''People expect a change in intensity. But they know it's going to take a long while for things to stabilize and turn around.''
 In truth, though, according to aides to Mr. Obama and outside analysts, the amount of time he has to deliver on promises and deal with problems varies with the problem and the promise. For obvious reasons, he probably has a good deal of breathing room on the economy. That is also true with health care, given the long and tortured history of attempts to change the system.
 But given the crispness and certitude of the campaign promise Mr. Obama made to bring all combat troops out of Iraq in 16 months, it seems fair to say that the public at large (and his Democratic base in particular) will not be quite as tolerant of delays on that front. The fact that Mr. Obama and his aides have not done anything to really walk back that promise, as opposed to some others, suggest that he understands that.
 Mr. Obama may also find it difficult to delay for too long closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He has walked a careful line on this issue since the election, raising all the complications in closing it while at the same time making clear that it will be closed eventually.
 And Mr. Obama's ability to slow-walk some campaign promises will also be affected by how well he maintains his standing with the American public and continues to project an air of command and competence. With a series of missteps upon assuming the presidency in 1993, Bill Clinton was quick to squander what political capital he had, as became clear with his party's disastrous showing in the midterm elections of 1994. So far, Mr. Obama has managed to remain unscathed by any missteps he has made, but his ability to ask for the American public's patience depends in no small part on the public's confidence in his competence and motives.
 Mr. Axelrod said he thought that Mr. Obama and the country were in tune with one another on the problems he faces and what it will take to turn things around.
 ''What's remarkable about the polls is that people are at once optimistic and realistic,'' he said. ''They have high hopes for his presidency, and that he can help lead us out of the morass we are in -- and they understand how deep the morass is. And that's a good position to be in.''
 Still, if this past few years have proved anything, it is that things move much more quickly in politics than they ever have before; public opinions shift, events change, perceptions change. Even as Mr. McKinnon, the media adviser, argued that Mr. Obama enjoyed a lot more running room than other presidents, his estimate of when the check might come due was probably one that Mr. Axelrod would not like to hear.
 ''I think Obama can count on a very long honeymoon,'' said Mr. McKinnon, who also advised President Bush on media strategy. ''I think he's got about six months, which is about five and half months longer than usual.''

HEADLINE: In Tight Times, Finding Office Space on a Limited-Engagement Basis

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Despite New York City's depressed economy, there is a flurry of activity in at least one niche of the real estate industry: business center companies, also often known as executive suites.
Since the middle of last year, such companies -- which rent out furnished office space on a short-term basis, offering services like a receptionist, mail delivery and telephone-call answering and screening -- have opened new facilities in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn, the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan and in One and Five Penn Plaza, near Penn Station in Manhattan.
Two floors of suites are to open this month at 1515 Broadway, a 54-story office building in Times Square. And the Regus Group, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange, is adding two Manhattan sites, bringing its total to 18. It is investing $5 million on new centers at 100 Church Street and 1501 Broadway. The former is opening this month, and the latter in the second quarter of the year. 
Industry officials and observers say business centers -- which vary widely in terms of furnishings, services provided and rents charged -- are ideal for displaced or downsized businesses or start-up companies seeking space without long-term leases. But they also say the timing of the opening of New York's new business centers is unrelated to current economic conditions; most have been planned for a while.
Renting an executive suite is a ''very, very easy way to do business if you need only one or two offices,'' said Kathy Donohue, president of PowerSpace and Services, which runs the new business center in One Penn Plaza and is a subsidiary of Vornado Realty Trust. ''You don't have to lay out capital; the infrastructure is set up; you can lock the door and not worry.''
John Humphrey, a co-founder and co-owner of Sustainable Energy Partners, a clean-energy consulting firm based in San Francisco, recently set up a New York office in Green Desk, the business center in Dumbo. He and another consultant occupy a 100-square-foot space, which is furnished but has no door, for which he pays $700 a month.
Green Desk ''really simplified the process of opening an office,'' Mr. Humphrey said. ''Sizing is flexible -- if I grow, I can move into a larger space. And they handle office stuff, like receiving packages and making sure the Internet and phone work.''
D. Edward Bungert, a vice president of World-Wide Business Centres and president of the Office Business Center Association of New York, estimates Manhattan has 60 to 65 business centers, run by some 25 companies and generating annual revenue of $100 million. All of these numbers are up from two or three years ago, he said, when revenue totaled about $75 million to $80 million.
Some industry officials say they believe weakness in the rental market will create attractive expansion opportunities for business center operators.
Regus is the largest operator in the city, running suites under the names Regus and HQ. It leases office space on a long-term basis, and then sublets the space on a short-term basis to its own tenants.
Other business center companies that lease the space they later rent out include Rockefeller Group Business Centers, Sunshine Suites and Wurk Environments, which is the operator of the new center at 1515 Broadway.
Some companies operate business centers in buildings they own. Besides Vornado, these include Edison Properties, which operates a business center in the Hippodrome Building, at 1120 Avenue of the Americas. In addition, Edison, which also owns Manhattan Mini Storage, rents out loftlike office spaces, marketed under the name Workspace, in three of its storage buildings: 5030 Broadway at 213th Street, 131 Varick Street at Spring Street and 55 Vandam Street at Varick Street.
Another company, Pearl Realty, a Brooklyn-based developer, owns a turn-of-the-20th-century former coffee factory at 155 Water Street in Dumbo, where Miguel McKelvey, the general manager, said $5 million had been invested in refurbishing the building and starting up Green Desk. Jack Guttman, president of Pearl, owns half of Green Desk.
Each of the building's six floors covers 4,000 square feet and is divided into some 30 offices. These range in size from 25 square feet -- one desk in an open cubicle -- to a 500-square-foot office that accommodates up to seven people.
Monthly fees for Green Desk's tenants range from $375 for a one-desk cubicle to $3,500 for the 500-square-foot office; these charges cover Internet access but not phone service, which is extra. Besides Mr. Humphrey, tenants include a calligrapher, a tour operator, an investment manager and a fashion designer.
Wurk occupies the 11th and 12th floors of 1515 Broadway. Each floor is 33,000 square feet, divided among 100 offices. With decor by Swanke Hayden Connell Architects that features Haworth modular office furniture, and views of Times Square and the Hudson River, each floor has a reception area for a concierge and other support staff, a cafe, a business lounge and conference rooms.
Monthly rents start at $1,500 for an 85-square-foot office with one desk and a door that locks, and go as high as $16,000 for an 800-square-foot office accommodating 14 people. Internet and telephone access and other support services are an additional $400 each month for each person.
Edison's Workspace offices -- which provide Internet capability but few other business center services -- range in size from 150 square feet, available for $650 a month at 5030 Broadway, to 1,400 square feet, offered at $5,000 a month at 131 Varick Street. Tenants include artists, graphic designers and film production companies.
The depressed economy appears to be affecting operators differently. For example, Joseph DeTrano, a vice president of Wurk, said it had signed up ''more tenants than we had planned for at this point.''
But, over all, Mr. Bungert said, ''business is down for all operators, some a little and some a lot. We have seen a slight uptick in demand for space for five or more people, and much less demand from a single-office entrepreneur starting something new.''
For the first quarter of this year, Regus is giving one month's free rent to Manhattan tenants who sign a minimum 12-month agreement. Mark Dixon, chief executive of Regus, said that although ''demand levels are good,'' the company was experiencing ''increased levels of move-out.''

HEADLINE: China Sees Threats From Separatists and U.S. Arms Sales

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
China said Tuesday that it faces threats from independence movements related to Taiwan, Tibet and the western desert region of Xinjiang, and that American arms sales to Taiwan jeopardize stability in Asia. 
 The assessment came in a white paper on national defense released by the State Council, China's cabinet. The paper said that ''China's security situation has improved steadily,'' but that ''being in a stage of economic and social transition, China is encountering many new circumstances and new issues in maintaining social stability.'' 
 The 105-page paper sought to portray China as a power that would use military force only defensively and sees territorial integrity as the top defense priority. 
 According to goals implied in the paper, China also seeks to counterbalance the American military presence in Asia. In several instances, the authors pointed out what they called worrisome aspects of American intervention. 
 ''The U.S. has increased its strategic attention to and input in the Asia-Pacific region, further consolidating its military alliances, adjusting its military deployment and enhancing its military capabilities,'' the paper said. 
 Certain destabilizing factors outside China are growing, the paper added, singling out American arms sales to Taiwan, which could lead to ''serious harm to Sino-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.'' China considers Taiwan a breakaway province.
 Last October, the Pentagon announced it was selling $6.5 billion of weaponry to Taiwan despite protests from Beijing. The package included 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 Patriot missiles and 32 Harpoon missiles that can be launched from submarines. The Taiwan Relations Act, passed in 1979 when the United States normalized relations with China, states that the United States will provide arms of a defensive nature to Taiwan. 
 In presenting the white paper on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said he hoped the Obama administration would build stronger military relations between the United States and China. 
 ''At present, when China-U.S. military-to-military relations are faced with difficulties, we call on the U.S. Department of Defense to remove obstacles,'' the spokesman, Senior Col. Hu Changming, said at a news conference. 
 Although Taiwan enjoys de facto independence, the Chinese government has long maintained that it hopes to reunite Taiwan with the mainland and that it will prevent any move by Taiwan toward formal, legalized independence, by force if necessary. Under Taiwan's previous president, Chen Shui-bian, relations with the mainland grew tense because Mr. Chen's policies moved Taiwan closer to formal independence, prompting bellicose reactions from Beijing.
 But following the election in Taiwan last year of Ma Ying-jeou, a member of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, whose members fled the Communist takeover of China in 1949, the Taiwanese government has taken a more conciliatory approach toward the mainland. 
 The white paper grouped separatist forces in Taiwan -- meaning supporters of Mr. Chen and his policies -- with groups that China says are seeking independence for Tibet and Xinjiang. ''Separatist forces working for 'Taiwan independence,' 'East Turkestan independence' and 'Tibet independence' pose threats to China's unity and security,'' the paper said. 
 Last year, violence erupted in Tibet and Xinjiang that challenged the country's security forces. 
 Since 2001, when the Bush administration announced its ''war on terror,'' the Chinese government has said it faces an organized terrorist independence movement in Xinjiang, an oil-rich area that is home to the Uighurs, a Muslim Turkic-speaking ethnic group. Many Uighurs are resentful of rule by the ethnic Han Chinese, and some openly advocate an independent country called East Turkestan. 
 Last March, riots and protests erupted across Tibetan areas of China, prompting a harsh crackdown. The Chinese government has accused the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, of organizing the uprising, which the Dalai Lama has denied. 
 China officially allocated $61 billion to defense spending last year, an 18 percent increase over 2007. The Pentagon says China actually spends much more than that amount on its military.
 The white paper made no mention of construction of an aircraft carrier, which Chinese military officials have said is a project under consideration. It did say that ''efforts are being made to build new types of submarines, destroyers, frigates and aircraft.''

PERSON: Edmund de Rothschild 

HEADLINE: Edmund de Rothschild, 93, Is Dead; Led Canadian Hydroelectric Project

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Edmund de Rothschild, a merchant banker from the renowned banking family's British branch who led the development of a major hydroelectric project in Labrador while helping his firm expand globally and opening it to people outside his family, died Saturday at his home. He was 93. 
 His family announced the death in a notice in The Times of London, but specified only that he died at home. His most famous home was Exbury House near Southampton, England, where he developed 800 rhododendron hybrids in his family's garden
 Mr. de Rothschild helped put together what in the early 1950s was the largest project ever undertaken by private enterprise, the giant hydroelectric development. The story began when Joseph R. Smallwood, premier of Newfoundland, which governs Labrador, personally asked Winston Churchill to help arrange for British investment in the project in 1953. Mr. Smallwood said he hoped the British would develop something like the East India Company or the Hudson's Bay Company.
 Mr. Smallwood next met with Anthony de Rothschild, who then headed the British Rothschilds' business, and with Edmund, Anthony's nephew. As a result, Edmund put together a consortium of seven Canadian and American companies to develop mineral, timber and hydroelectric power resources in an area bigger than England and Wales combined.
 After many years of political and economic twists and turns, the project, at Churchill Falls (originally named Hamilton Falls), began operating in 1971 as the second-largest hydroelectric plant in North America. Edmund de Rothschild made more than 400 trips to Canada in pushing the project to completion.
 Mr. de Rothschild also changed the corporate structure of the Rothschild partnership to open it to people from outside the family. He made Rothschild a significant factor in the birth of the Eurobond market, and oversaw the firm's considerable expansion internationally, particularly to Japan.
 Edmund Leopold de Rothschild was born on Jan. 2, 1916, in London, and was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. After he graduated, his father, Lionel Nathan de Rothschild, paid for an 18-month trip around the world, The Daily Telegraph reported in its obituary. Edmund went big-game hunting in Africa and rode horseback over the Andes, and told of his adventures in a book, ''Window on the World'' (1949).
 He returned from the trip to work at the family firm until World War II. He joined an artillery regiment in the British Army, and served in France, North Africa and Italy, where he was injured.
 Mr. de Rothschild returned to the firm, where, since the death of his father, his uncle Anthony had been the sole partner. ''My knowledge of banking was nonexistent,'' The Telegraph quoted him as saying. When Anthony had a stroke in 1955, Edmund effectively took over.
 He headed both Rothschild Continuation Holdings, the Rothschilds' holding company based in Switzerland, and the family's London operation, N. M. Rothschild & Sons.
 His first wife, Elizabeth Lentner, died in 1980. The Telegraph reported that he had two daughters and two sons with her, but did not say how many survived him. In 1982, he married Anne Harrison, who was alive when the 2008 entry in ''Debrett's People of Today'' was published.

HEADLINE: Downsizing Is the Business To Be In Now

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
As companies across the country eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, one field is hiring: the layoff industry. Businesses that specialize in ''career transition'' can barely keep up with the demand as corporate America cuts staff. 
 Banks, manufacturers, media companies and other industries have relied on the businesses to a greater degree in the last year as economic conditions have worsened. 
 ''I can't remember a busier time,'' said Elaine Varelas, a managing partner at Keystone Partners, based in Boston. Right Management, another company that specializes in outplacement, reported a 39 percent increase in profit last fall. And William L. Ayers Jr., president of the 28-year-old Ayers Group in New York, said his business had had a 75 percent spike in so-called career transition work last year.
 In some cases, the companies do everything except deliver the bad news. They provide scripts and ''termination training'' for the managers. They counsel the laid-off workers and later offer them resume-writing seminars and office space for job searches. 
 Ryan Teixeira is among the unwitting clients of the outplacement business, which was called the ''industry that guilt built'' by Fortune magazine two decades ago. 
 Mr. Teixeira was a software architect at Yahoo until Dec. 10, when the company laid off about 1,500 people. As documented in a series of slides leaked to the Silicon Valley blog Valleywag, managers were instructed to tell employees like Mr. Teixeira that ''we've had to make some tough decisions around eliminating a number of positions.'' 
 The script continues, ''Your position is one of those being eliminated.''
 After the conversation, Mr. Teixeira was led to a room, where he was met by a Right Management consultant, with two other terminated employees. 
 ''The topics discussed were not very deep,'' he said. ''They give some very basic tips on what to do next. They answer any questions they can. It is all about moving on.''
 The postlayoff session ''allows the individual to vent,'' Mr. Ayers said, ''about their angst, their anger, their fear.'' 
 It is a time to let off steam -- and avoid what he called ''bad and potentially disastrous behavior'' -- and figure out what to tell family members and friends. Outplacement advisers say the sessions lower the chance of public disputes, employee theft or even people harming themselves.
 A day or two later, the employee will typically attend a seminar about resume writing, job-search tools and applying for unemployment benefits. The outplacement consultants essentially act as a version of a high school or college career counselor.
 The clinical language used in the Yahoo script is also typical. Within the third-party companies, a mass layoff is called a RIF, short for ''reduction in force.'' The termination day is the ''day of notification,'' and the initial meeting with a laid-off worker is a ''pickup.'' Consultants are careful to say that people are not eliminated, positions are eliminated. (Or, preferably, they are ''made redundant.'') 
 But laid-off workers, of course, do take it personally. The third-party companies act as the ''cleanup team'' at the end of the layoff, said Alan Whitton, who had worked at Nortel for 20 years when he lost his job last August. ''They deal with folks like me who knew it was coming and ask a couple of questions and bug out -- and those who didn't see it coming and are still in shock,'' he said.
 After being notified by phone of his termination, Mr. Whitton was walked through the severance package by a human resources worker, who then introduced him to the outplacement representative. He was asked about his feelings, handed a binder of information and asked to attend an orientation session the next day. 
 Several of these outplacement companies say that they are hiring to help companies lay off workers. Right Management's overseas practice is adding staff in Austria, Poland, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. The Ayers Group, which employs about 30 people in the New York-New Jersey market, hired an additional consultant last month. 
 Until the last year, the layoffs in the wake of the 9/11 attacks were the worst that Mr. Ayers, who started his company in 1975, had seen. But the current layoffs have been ''broader, wider and deeper,'' he said. 
 The national unemployment rate rose sharply in the last year, to 7.2 percent in December, from 4.9 percent in January. The executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimates that corporations planned the layoffs of more than one million people during the year.
 Ms. Varelas of Keystone Partners said the severity and the swiftness of the current economic crisis were similar to the banking crisis of the early 1990s. This time, though, ''we're much busier,'' she said, ''and partly that's because career transition and outplacement has become a much more accepted benefit.'' 
 She said a basic package of services for a departing employee, including a one-day seminar, can cost about $1,000.
 When they are not dealing with mergers, acquisitions or layoffs, many of the career transition companies also offer executive coaching and other good-economy services. What worries them most, then, are so-called slack tide periods, when companies are neither hiring nor firing.
 Mr. Teixeira says he believes the outplacement companies are here to stay. ''Changing jobs is becoming the norm,'' he said, citing his firsthand experience. In fact, when he was laid off from Yahoo last month, the Right Management consultant looked familiar. He had first met her a year ago, when he was laid off from his previous job.

HEADLINE: In Albany, an Expectation of Higher Taxes for the Rich

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Warning to rich New Yorkers: The tax man might be digging deeper into your pockets in the years ahead.
 There is a growing sense in the capital that legislators are likely to turn to an income tax increase on the wealthiest New Yorkers to help close the state's $15 billion deficit, now that Democrats control the Senate, the Assembly and the governor's office. 
 The Assembly, where Democrats have an overwhelming majority, has long supported increasing taxes on the wealthy, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, reiterated this month that there continued to be strong backing for the measure among his colleagues. 
 Gov. David A. Paterson, a Democrat, did not propose any income tax increases in his budget proposal, but acknowledged in last month that ''taxing the wealthy is probably going to be part of the solution if the deficit gets any worse, and all indications are that it probably will.''
 That could leave the matter in the hands of the Senate, where Democrats won a narrow majority in November. Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat, said that he planned to introduce a bill in the coming weeks that would increase taxes on the rich, and that he expected his colleagues to have an active debate about the issue. 
 ''There are a lot of us who feel that for the last 30 years we've been shifting the tax burden from the wealthy to middle-class families,'' Mr. Schneiderman said on Tuesday. ''Our conference is operating through consultation and discussion, and I expect we'll be talking about restoring some additional tax brackets for upper-income New Yorkers as well as a lot of other options.'' 
 Malcolm A. Smith, the new Senate majority leader, said he was not enthusiastic about the idea but looked forward to a vigorous debate in his caucus.
 ''I know that recent surveys have come back and shown that it is very popular among the people of the city and state, but I'm not sure at this present time it's the right course of action,'' he said, referring to polls showing support for increased taxes on the wealthy. ''The conference members are split on the issue and are discussing it, but it's my belief that it's the last course of action we should take.''
 ''I'm not ruling it out, but it's not the first course of action,'' he added. 
 There is considerable pressure on lawmakers to act, and several powerful interest groups in Albany are pushing for a tax increase for the wealthy as a way to forestall steep budget cuts. Days after the governor unveiled his budget proposal last month, a commercial touting ''fair share tax reform'' was aired by 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, the influential hospital workers' union, and the Greater New York Hospital Association. 
 The Working Families Party, a labor-backed party that has considerable clout in Albany, has also been outspoken in its support for the tax. 
 ''We are going to be running a full-throated campaign to make the case that it would be wiser to tax the very wealthiest New Yorkers rather than cut spending on the elderly, children and the disabled,'' said Dan Cantor, executive director of the Working Families Party. 
 ''That will mean knocking on doors, organizing local opinion makers, meeting with people affected by the cuts, doing town hall meetings and meeting with legislators.''
 Democrats would have to largely unite behind the proposal, because there are probably not many Republicans who would support a budget with income tax increases. Pending the outcome of a contested Queens race, Democrats are expected to have a 32-30 majority in the Senate. 
 ''We are not going to support increases in income taxes,'' said John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate minority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican.
 ''We aren't going to support increases in business taxes, we aren't going to support raising taxes on people's insurance policies, their soda, their cable television, their satellite television, you name it,'' he added, referring to some of the 137 individual new or increased taxes the governor proposed in his budget last month. 
 Several measures that would impose higher taxes have been discussed, so it is not clear which path Democratic lawmakers will pursue. The measure previously talked about in the Assembly called for an increase of nearly one percentage point on anyone who earns $1 million or more annually. But other plans echo President Obama's campaign call for increased taxes on families earning $250,000 or more. 
 Mr. Silver said in a recent interview, ''The extent of the tax is to be determined, but clearly the public has indicated they support a millionaires' tax, the Assembly has indicated they support it.''
 Over the last 30 years, the trend has been to pare back income tax rates on the rich, federally and in the state. Since the mid-1970s, the state has cut its top tax rate from 15.375 percent to 6.85 percent. The top income tax rate in New Jersey is 8.97 percent, and in Connecticut it is 5 percent, according to data from the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group.
 That said, the richest 1 percent of New Yorkers paid more than 40 percent of the income tax in 2007, up from about 30 percent in 1996, according to state data, though that figure is declining as the financial crisis makes the rich less so. 
 ''This is the worst possible time to do this, because the economy is deeply stressed, our key industry is laying in pieces in the gutter and partially nationalized, and a lot of business people have to reassess their future in the most costly city in the country,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group.

HEADLINE: It's Bad, But 1982 Was Worse

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
Email: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You often hear that we are now living through the worst recession since the early 1980s, and the comparison is not wrong. But it's ultimately unsatisfying, because it is a little too vague to be useful. 
 Is the economy only a little worse than it was in the last couple recessions, as some have said, and still a long way from the dark days of 1982? Or are we instead on our way toward something that may even approach the severity of the Great Depression? 
 Without more specifics, it is hard to judge the staggering stimulus numbers being thrown around Washington. It is hard to know how tough a task the Obama administration is facing -- and whether it's running the risk of being too timid or too aggressive. 
 I thought it would make sense to get some clearer historical perspective, and the economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics were nice enough to help me do so. In the last week, they helped me put together a broad measure of the job market -- one including both official unemployment and more subtle kinds -- stretching back to 1970. Since the job market covers the entire economy and affects families in tangible ways, it seems to be the single best yardstick. 
 And it shows, for starters, that the economy is not yet as bad as it was in the early 1980s. It's not even that close to being as bad. The ranks of unemployed and underemployed, controlling for the size of the population, were much larger in 1982 than today. 
 But economies are a little like battleships. They turn slowly, and you can often tell where they are going before they get there. At The New York Times, we're discouraged from using the word ''unprecedented.'' (''Use the term rarely and only after verifying the history,'' the stylebook says.) 
 So suffice it to say that the serious recent declines in retail sales, business spending and employment make it highly unusual that the economy will improve anytime soon. The job market will almost certainly continue to worsen for most of 2009. Even if the much-needed stimulus bill passes, the economy is likely to end the year in roughly as bad a shape as its 1982 nadir. Which is saying something. 
 The recession of the early 1980s doesn't have a catchy name, and almost half of Americans are too young to have any real memory of it. But it was terrible -- qualitatively different from the mild recessions of 1990-91 and 2001.
 The first big blow to the economy was the 1979 revolution in Iran, which sent oil prices skyrocketing. The bigger blow was a series of sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, meant to snap inflation. Home sales plummeted. At their worst, they were 30 percent lower than they are even now (again, adjusted for population size). The industrial Midwest was hardest hit, and the term ''Rust Belt'' became ubiquitous. Many families fled south and west, helping to create the modern Sun Belt.
 Nationwide, the unemployment rate rose above 10 percent in 1982, compared with 7.2 percent last month. But that rate has a couple of basic flaws, as I've discussed in previous columns. It counts people who have been forced to work part time, even though they want to work full time, as fully employed. It also considers people who have given up looking for work -- so-called discouraged workers -- to be no different from retirees or stay-at-home parents. They simply aren't counted.
 Years ago, the Labor Department responded to criticism about these issues by creating several broader measures of joblessness. Unfortunately, they don't exist prior to 1994. But the department was doing similar work in earlier years, which allows the economists who work there to make estimates about how to compare the various survey categories over time. I took these estimates -- and they are estimates, not official statistics -- and created a measure of unemployment that goes back to 1970. 
 Including discouraged workers, the measure shows that the unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month. Another 5.2 percent of the labor force was involuntarily working part time. These two groups bring the combined rate to 12.8 percent.
 Even this is an understatement, because the Labor Department's definition of discouraged workers is a little narrow. To be counted, somebody must have looked for a job in the last year. And there appear to be several hundred thousand people -- mostly men -- who stopped looking for work more than a year ago but would gladly take a good-paying job if one came along. They would lift the rate above 13 percent.
 As bad as the number is, it is still not that close to its 1982 peak of 16.32 percent (or anywhere near its Depression levels, which were probably above 30 percent). The early '80s really were that bad.
 So why are public opinion polls showing Americans to be even gloomier about the economy today than they were back then? I think there are two main reasons.
 First, the economic expansion that just ended wasn't as good as the 1970s expansions. The '70s get a bad rap, and deservedly so in many ways. But median family income still rose 2 percent during the decade, after adjusting for inflation. Over the past decade, it has fallen.
 Second, people seem to understand that the worst is yet to come -- that the economy has not yet worked off its excesses.
 A good reminder came in a recent report on the Manhattan real estate market by Goldman Sachs. It looked at apartment prices relative to rents, incomes and mortgage rates and concluded that prices were 19 to 44 percent higher than historical norms. Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist, was careful to say that prices won't necessarily drop by that much. But we should know by now that old-fashioned economic fundamentals deserve some respect. 
 In much of the rest of the country, home prices also still have some amount to fall. Banks still have more losses to acknowledge. Companies have more jobs to cut. Some time this year, one in six workers may find themselves unemployed or underemployed, just as was the case in 1982.
 The biggest risk is that these problems will feed on themselves and make the situation even worse than now seems likely. That has been the pattern for the past year and a half. If it continues -- and it will without a big stimulus package -- the economy really could end up in worse shape than it's been in more than 60 years. 

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Rising Tide of Joblessness: A broader, unofficial measure of the job market, based on government estimates, shows that it is not yet as bad as it was in the early '80s but is closing the gap.
 The job market appears to be a long way from returning to health -- in part because employment has recovered more slowly after recent recessions than after those of the '70s and '80s.(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics) Chart details line graphs for underemployed, discouraged, and unemployed.

 Israel Slows Gaza Withdrawal
 As the Cease-Fire Is Violated
 Israel slowed its withdrawal of forces from Gaza as the cease-fire with Hamas suffered its first violations. Eight mortars were shot at Israel, all falling short, and Israeli troops twice came under fire. Israel responded with airstrikes on launching sites. PAGE A8 
 A VILLAGE REDUCED TO DEBRIS
 In Juhr el Dik, a farming village on Gaza's eastern border, a swath of destruction spreads like a sea across an area where about 40 houses once stood. While the destruction was indisputable, who is at fault is not, as Israel blames Hamas, and the villagers blame Israel. PAGE A8

 STUDY SAYS IMMIGRANT WOMEN
 Mistreated in Detention Centers
 A study by the University of Arizona found that some 300 women held at immigration detention centers in Arizona face dangerous delays in health care and widespread mistreatment. Federal immigration officials said the study, which examined the conditions for women in the process of deportation proceedings at three federal immigration centers in Arizona, was narrow and unsubstantiated.

HEADLINE: At a School in Kansas, A Moment Resonates

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: JUNCTION CITY, Kan. 

 BODY:
 Shortly before lunchtime on Tuesday, a strange quiet settled over Junction City Middle School. Strange because quiet does not come naturally to a collection of 875 students in the full throes of adolescence. But this clearly was a moment, a time to set aside childish things.
 The sixth and eighth graders had shuffled into the auditorium of the year-old school, past the signs saying no gum, drinks or food, while the seventh graders took seats in the adjacent cafeteria, redolent of chicken patties frying. All were silent, and not only because the expressions of the adults hovering about signaled the need for communal reverence. 
 They gazed up at large screens to watch the presidential inauguration in Washington, nearly 1,100 miles away, though the distance sometimes seemed even farther. While the audio feed remained steady, the video stream stopped and stuttered, like old NASA images from space, so much so that Aretha Franklin seemed to start singing ''My Country 'Tis of Thee'' before opening her mouth.
 But this glitch only added to the moment's import, as if to echo other firsts -- sending a man to the moon, say -- along the American continuum. And these YouTube-era students never snickered; they only watched, some wide-eyed, some sleepy-eyed, the flickering images of power's formal transfer.
 Also watching, also looking up, was Ronald P. Walker, 55, the schools superintendent, from a cafeteria table he was sharing with six seventh-grade girls. He wore a dark suit, a white shirt and a red tie -- the same attire as the president-elect now striding across the screen above.
 Mr. Walker grew up in an all-black town in Oklahoma, worked his way through the ranks of education, and is now the only black schools superintendent in Kansas. He worries about budget cutbacks as a result of the economic crisis throttling his state and his country, but he saw in the man appearing above him a thinker, a statesman, the embodiment of hope.
 ''And his emphasis on education is critical for all of us,'' Mr. Walker said.
 One could argue that many of the students in Mr. Walker's charge have more at stake in this far-off Washington ceremony than most. Junction City may be a place of about 20,000 in the flat plains of Kansas, but it is as diverse as any place in the country, mostly because in many ways it serves at the pleasure of Fort Riley, a major military base a few miles away.
 Slightly fewer than half the students are white, more than half receive free or discounted lunches -- and a full third have some connection to Fort Riley, which adds both a cultural richness and an uncommon kind of stress.
 School officials say the students worry less about grades and friends than about when a parent will be deployed, when a parent will return, whether a parent will survive combat.
 These are not daydream worries, what with 3,400 soldiers from Fort Riley now in Iraq, and the knowledge that 159 soldiers and airmen from the base had been killed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by the end of last year. 
 Not too long ago, there was a report of graffiti in the bathroom at the high school. The culprit was a girl, and what she had written, over and over, was: I Miss My Dad.
 So here they were, the children of a place called Junction City -- a community proud of its distinctive Kansas limestone buildings, struggling still with its honky-tonk, ''Junk Town'' reputation of long ago -- looking up at screens, waiting for a new and different show. Gazing up, too, were many adults, most of whom had thought they would never see the day.
 Here was Ferrell Miller, 63, the school's principal, whose father used to say the ''N'' word as if it were just any other word. Dr. Miller came to Junction City more than 40 years ago as a soldier, met and married a young woman from the Philippines, return to his Ohio hometown -- and then moved back to Junction City because that place in Ohio ''didn't have the diversity we were looking for.'' But Junction City did.
 And here were the cafeteria workers, white, Hispanic, black, most of them wearing hairnets, taking a break from food prep to share in the moment. Margaret Langley, 73, a German woman who married a G.I. in the mid-1950s, is proud to be a naturalized citizen; Nellie Vargas, 29, from Houston, married to a soldier stationed at Fort Riley; Phyllis Edwards, 46, of North Carolina, married to a retired soldier and with a son in the eighth grade here.
 ''I'm just so nervous,'' said Ms. Edwards, failing to find the words to match her emotions.
 Finally, the moment. The announcer asked people in Washington to please stand; the students of Junction City remained seated. The chief justice of the United States said, ''Congratulations, Mr. President''; those students burst into applause.
 As President Obama began his Inaugural Address, the seventh-grade students began their lunch. They filed into the kitchen to collect their trays of chicken-patty sandwiches, fries and chocolate milk. Few opted for the peas. 
 Kimberlee Munoz set down her tray and rendered her review of the Inaugural Address -- ''It was the bomb!'' -- while at a table nearby, Reggie Campbell ate his lunch in forced exile, having gotten into it with another student who was making fun of him. He said he lived with an uncle who was in Iraq at the moment, and he said he enjoyed watching the inauguration.
 ''I think it's nice to have a black president for once,'' he said.
 Meanwhile, the adults at the middle school began the orderly transition from historic to mundane. Ms. Edwards took her place behind the buffet table, wishing all the while that she was in Washington. Ms. Vargas left her cafeteria work early to drive her husband to the airport; an emergency leave had ended, and he was returning to Iraq.
 And Mr. Walker, in his dark suit, white shirt and red tie, set off for another meeting in another building in Junction City, leaving in his wake one word: Wow.

HEADLINE: 800 Jobs To Be Cut At Warner Brothers

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Warner Brothers said it would eliminate 800 jobs, or about 10 percent of its global work force, as it struggled with declining DVD sales and a poor outlook for scripted television programming. 
 While not unexpected -- Warner had been quietly preparing Hollywood to expect cuts -- the layoffs rattled the movie capital because the studio is regarded as one of the industry's healthiest. With a parade of hits like ''The Dark Knight,'' ''Sex and the City,'' ''Get Smart'' and ''Four Christmases,'' Warner recorded global ticket sales of $1.77 billion in 2008, up 25 percent from a year earlier.
 But DVD sales plummeted in the fourth quarter and orders of scripted television programs -- a huge Warner business -- are expected to decline as networks cope with tumbling advertising sales. The struggles of Warner's parent company, Time Warner, in the publishing arena have also put pressure on the studio to increase profitability.
 ''Warner Brothers is not immune to the changing entertainment business landscape, shifting consumer demand and the state of the global economy,'' the studio said in a statement. ''Despite the fact that the company performed solidly in 2008, this decision reflects changes necessary for stability and growth going forward,'' the statement said.
 Of the 800 positions, about 300 involve back-office duties like accounts payable and technology support. The company, which is based in Burbank, Calif., said it would outsource many of those jobs to local firms and would do what it could to place affected employees in those jobs. Another 300 people in jobs across the studio will be laid off, with the final 200 cuts coming from open positions.
 Time Warner, which has already taken significant steps to reduce filmed entertainment costs over the last year, including closing its New Line label, joins NBC Universal and Viacom in carrying out broad layoffs. NBC Universal eliminated about 700 jobs in October, or 5 percent of its work force, while Viacom has laid off several hundred employees at MTV and Paramount Pictures.
 So far, the Walt Disney Company and 20th Century Fox have skirted the firing of large numbers of employees by clamping down on spending.

HEADLINE: Speech Puts a New Frame On Obama's Call to Serve

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In his Inaugural Address, President Obama quoted not Abraham Lincoln or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom he has often referenced in his speeches, but George Washington, speaking to his bedraggled troops during the darkest days of the Revolutionary War, when, as Mr. Obama put it, ''The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood.''
 The ''father of our nation,'' the new president said, ''ordered these words be read to the people: 'Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.' '' 
 The references to Washington aim not just to inspire a country grappling with an economy in free fall and two ongoing wars but to situate America's problems in a historical context. Mr. Obama often does this in his speeches -- recalling Lincoln's efforts to fashion a new and improved nation out of the ashes of the Civil War, or the efforts of today's Joshua generation to build upon the achievements of the Moses generation who fought the civil rights battles of the 1960s. Here, Mr. Obama employed an even wider historical lens, asking Americans to remember the daunting, seemingly impossible challenges faced by the founding fathers in winning independence from the mighty British Empire. 
 Talking of the continuum of history enables Mr. Obama to remind us of the progress that has been made toward perfecting this nation, and this Enlightenment faith in progress, in turn, offers the hope that today's challenges, too, can be met and conquered: or, as he put it, ''All this we can do. All this we will do.'' 
 As in most of his major speeches, Mr. Obama repeatedly referred to ''us'' and ''we,'' while playing down his own role as a leader. His few references to himself were put in the service of making a larger point about America. He talked of ''the small village where my father was born,'' in terms of the hope America has long held out to immigrants. And he talked about the improbable fact that ''a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.''
 Mr. Obama tends to be less cautious about getting personal in his books, as his remarkable memoir ''Dreams from My Father'' attests. But in his speeches, ''me'' tends to become a collective ''we.'' This is partly a vestige of Mr. Obama's past as a community organizer, a job which encourages a group to find purpose with or without a strong leader. During the campaign, it was partly a reflection of his desire -- and that of the Democratic Party -- to build a new majority. And today, it underscored the importance of building a movement that might endure for decades, beyond Mr. Obama himself or the vicissitudes of electoral politics.
 Mr. Obama's writings and speeches are informed by a familiarity with the oratory of the past -- Lincoln or King or the African-American church tradition: if not directly quoting his famous predecessors, then invoking memories through the use of a phrase or an image. He also has an uncanny sense of his audiences, calibrating his language and his delivery with that in mind -- something he's able to do more artfully than most politicians because of his extraordinary literary skills and the elasticity of his voice. His speech commemorating the Selma Voting Rights March in early 2007, for instance, referred in detail to stories from Scripture, while his stump speeches tended to be more conversational and improvisatory than the big addresses delivered in Berlin, Denver and Chicago.
 Whereas Mr. Obama has made references to the likes of Faulkner and Shakespeare in the past, he on Tuesday used language many audience members might immediately recognize. He paraphrased a song made famous by Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, saying ''we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America.'' And he paraphrased that well-known Biblical homily about setting aside childish things. Most of all, his Inaugural Address was a call to service: an exhortation to citizens of this great ''patchwork'' country to ''find meaning in something greater than themselves'' and to boldly enter a ''new era of responsibility.''

HEADLINE: Questions for Mr. Geithner

 BODY:
Timothy Geithner, President Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary, appears before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday. The Op-Ed page asked seven experts in finance and economics to pose the questions they would like to hear the nominee answer.
 1. The American tax code is so complex that even Treasury secretary nominees can easily make mistakes on their returns. Furthermore, while income tax rates are 10 percent to 35 percent for individuals and 35 percent for corporations, because of the proliferation of deductions, credits, exclusions and loopholes, the revenue from income tax amounts to only 10 percent of gross domestic product. Should you give priority to simplifying the code and enforcing compliance before raising rates? 
 -- CHARLES O. ROSSOTTI, the commissioner of internal revenue from 1997 to 2002
 1. Ordinary taxpayers would like an answer to this question: Why have they been billed more than $45 billion to rescue Citigroup from failure when, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, you were its primary supervisor? Three major problems led to Citigroup's downfall: bad investment policy; overexpansion, which overwhelmed Citigroup's management; and an inadequate capital base. Why was Citigroup's supervision inadequate to deal with these problems?
 2. The Treasury and Federal Reserve have been selecting which companies in American industry and finance will get taxpayer money. What criteria do you use to decide? 
 3. During the banking crisis of the late 1980s, assets of failed savings and loans were acquired by the government's Resolution Trust Corporation. The trust corporation then sold off the assets in an orderly fashion. Would you consider requesting Congress to revive the Resolution Trust Corporation, so you would not have to decide which companies to save and which not to save? Would you consider re-establishing the trust corporation now for commercial banks that are likely to fail?
 -- ANNA JACOBSON SCHWARTZ, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research and the author, with Milton Friedman, of ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867 to 1960''
 1. Do you believe that money from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Fund should be exclusively used to preserve our financial system, or should it be used to assist distressed non-financial institutions like manufacturers and retailers? If non-financial institutions are eligible, how do you decide which are deserving?
 2. Do you believe raising taxes on savings and investment, as would occur if the Bush tax cuts expire in 2010, will help or hurt our economy?
 3. How do we more effectively regulate the financial services industry without adding unnecessary regulations that cripple our ability to compete globally?
 -- MITT ROMNEY, a former governor of Massachusetts
 1. In the past, you have praised the ''resiliency'' of the American financial system. But a resilient financial system would demand that banks maintain stricter capital standards in normal times so that when a crisis hits, they don't all have to tighten lending at the same time. What exactly did you mean by ''resiliency''? 
 -- ROBERT SHILLER, professor of economics at Yale
 1. The income tax code favors those with employer-provided health insurance over those who buy their own health insurance or pay medical bills out of pocket. It also favors homeowners over renters, through the mortgage interest deduction. Is this tax treatment efficient or fair? Might you favor a more level playing field?
 2. President Obama supports the estate tax. Why should a person who leaves his money to his children pay more in taxes than another person with the same lifetime income who spends all his money on himself?
 -- N. GREGORY MANKIW, a professor of economics at Harvard
 1. The American financial regulatory system is highly fragmented, with authority divided among federal and state governments, the Federal Reserve, the comptroller of the currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, etc. Do you favor an overhaul of the system and, if so, what should the new system look like? 
 -- JOHN STEELE GORDON, the author of ''An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power''
 1. This country has long benefited from the world's confidence in our financial markets. Are financial regulatory reforms necessary now to restore investors' confidence and revive our economy?
 2. Should debt securities that are held by regulated banks and pension funds be rated by multiple independent credit reports that have been commissioned by a federal agency, or should we continue to let the issuers of debts decide who will rate their risks?
 3. Should large financial institutions incur higher reserve requirements or other regulatory penalties when they become ''too big to fail''?
 -- ROGER B. MYERSON, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a winner of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences

HEADLINE: Radical In the White House

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
For one day, for one hour, let us take a bow as a country. Nearly 233 years after our founding, 144 years after the close of our Civil War and 46 years after Martin Luther King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech, this crazy quilt of immigrants called Americans finally elected a black man, Barack Hussein Obama, as president. Walking back from the inauguration, I saw an African-American street vendor wearing a home-stenciled T-shirt that pretty well captured the moment -- and then some. It said: ''Mission Accomplished.''
 But we cannot let this be the last mold we break, let alone the last big mission we accomplish. Now that we have overcome biography, we need to write some new history -- one that will reboot, revive and reinvigorate America. That, for me, was the essence of Obama's inaugural speech and I hope we -- and he -- are really up to it. 
 Indeed, dare I say, I hope Obama really has been palling around all these years with that old Chicago radical Bill Ayers. I hope Obama really is a closet radical.
 Not radical left or right, just a radical, because this is a radical moment. It is a moment for radical departures from business as usual in so many areas. We can't thrive as a country any longer by coasting on our reputation, by postponing solutions to every big problem that might involve some pain and by telling ourselves that dramatic new initiatives -- like a gasoline tax, national health care or banking reform -- are too hard or ''off the table.'' So my most fervent hope about President Obama is that he will be as radical as this moment -- that he will put everything on the table. 
 Opportunities for bold initiatives and truly new beginnings are rare in our system -- in part because of the sheer inertia and stalemate designed into our Constitution, with its deliberate separation of powers, and in part because of the way lobbying money, a 24-hour news cycle and a permanent presidential campaign all conspire to paralyze big changes. 
 ''The system is built for stalemate,'' said Michael J. Sandel, the Harvard University political theorist. ''In ordinary times, the energy and dynamism of American life reside in the economy and society, and people view government with suspicion or indifference. But in times of national crisis, Americans look to government to solve fundamental problems that affect them directly. These are the times when presidents can do big things. These moments are rare. But they offer the occasion for the kind of leadership that can recast the political landscape, and redefine the terms of political argument for a generation.''
 In the 1930s, the Great Depression enabled Franklin Roosevelt to launch the New Deal and redefine the role of the federal government, he added, while in the 1960s, the assassination of John F. Kennedy and ''the moral ferment of the civil rights movement'' enabled Lyndon Johnson to enact his Great Society agenda, including Medicare, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. 
 ''These presidencies did more than enact new laws and programs,'' concluded Sandel. ''They rewrote the social contract, and redefined what it means to be a citizen. Obama's moment, and his presidency, could be that consequential.''
 George W. Bush completely squandered his post-9/11 moment to summon the country to a dramatic new rebuilding at home. This has left us in some very deep holes. These holes -- and the broad awareness that we are at the bottom of them -- is what makes this a radical moment, calling for radical departures from business as usual, led by Washington.
 That is why this voter is hoping Obama will swing for the fences. But he also has to remember to run the bases. George Bush swung for some fences, but he often failed at the most basic element of leadership -- competent management and follow-through. 
 President Obama will have to decide just how many fences he can swing for at one time: grand bargains on entitlement and immigration reform? A national health care system? A new clean-energy infrastructure? The nationalization and repair of our banking system? Will it be all or one? Some now and some later? It is too soon to say. 
 But I do know this: while a crisis is a terrible thing to waste, so too is a great politician, with a natural gift for oratory, a rare knack for bringing people together, and a nation, particularly its youth, ready to be summoned and to serve.
 So, in sum, while it is impossible to exaggerate what a radical departure it is from our past that we have inaugurated a black man as president, it is equally impossible to exaggerate how much our future depends on a radical departure from our present. As Obama himself declared from the Capitol steps: ''Our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed.''
 We need to get back to work on our country and our planet in wholly new ways. The hour is late, the project couldn't be harder, the stakes couldn't be higher, the payoff couldn't be greater.

HEADLINE: A Proud Day for Black America, And for the Rest of the Nation, Too

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In a city of fiercely private spaces, people wanted to plant their flags in the moment, but not in solitude. 
 Aurora Burke and her sister Wilma Marshall found that they had arrived too late to watch the inaugural ceremony at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture on 135th Street in Harlem: a few minutes after 11 Tuesday morning, every seat and spot to stand in the auditorium was taken.
 The sisters quickly changed course and headed to the plaza outside the state office building on 125th Street, where a giant television screen and speakers had been set up. ''Even with the cold,'' Ms. Burke said, ''it's too important to do alone.'' 
 As noon approached and hundreds of people piled into the plaza, a warming hum rose from the crowd. Each face that appeared on the screen was scrutinized. Suddenly, a wave of boos rang out. Dick Cheney, with a bad back, was being wheeled to the ceremony in a chair, and people hooted good-naturedly, as if he were the villain at a wrestling match. ''It's like he's Mr. Potter the banker in 'It's a Wonderful Life,' '' declared one man in the crowd.
 Of course, no one was standing in the bitter cold simply to yell at Dick Cheney.
 Matthew Gantt, 33, out of work and on his way to the 125th Street unemployment office, stopped in the plaza and snapped some pictures of the new president on the big screen. ''It's not about him doing this, or doing that for me,'' Mr. Gantt said. ''Poverty was here for a long time. He's got a job, we're still broke. This is about pride.'' 
 By the time Barack Obama lifted his right hand, a line of tears had cut across the cheek of Katrina Foye, a city worker who had dashed out on her lunch hour with a friend, Michelle Gonzalez. ''This is the moment black people have been waiting for, from a time when we thought none of us could ever be president,'' said Ms. Foye, 39. ''It's liberating. It's not just for black people. The country can be itself.''
 Also watching in the plaza was Gary Coppedge, 41, a mechanic for Mercedes-Benz, who grew up in New York and lives in Harlem. Five of his six children were taking in the events at colleges, high school and junior high. 
 The youngest, Naim, age 2, swaddled in a scarf, knit cap and hooded down jacket, was perched on his dad's chest. 
 ''I requested last week to have the day off,'' Mr. Coppedge said. ''It's so beautiful. I wouldn't have missed this for the day.'' 
 It was, he said, a moment of pride and progress for black Americans. That would be enough of an epochal change for any one day. But there was even more. 
 Naim clutched a tiny American flag in one fist. When Mr. Obama spoke, the crowd fell silent. His image filled the screen. The flag pin on his lapel, and the American flags, small and large, waving across the plaza and hanging from windows in Harlem, brought to mind a campaign debate last year, when an ABC broadcaster said Mr. Obama's failure to wear a flag pin had been linked to questions about the ''general theme of patriotism in your relationships.'' 
 By Inauguration Day, Mr. Obama had long since untangled the matter of patriotism from the demands for an unquestioned conformity, particularly in the use of armed force. He had, after all, distinguished himself not only as an orator but also for his unequivocal opposition to the war in Iraq before the first missile was fired, when that was lonely ground in his own party, if not among the public. At the time, police agencies across the country were infiltrating peace groups and opponents of the war; in the news media, most serious criticism of the arguments for war was buried.
 For many, Mr. Obama's presidency stood for the proposition that dissent was not a threat to the nation, but an asset.
 When the speeches and prayers ended, there was no lingering in the plaza. It was the middle of a January workday. Ms. Foye paused for a moment to say that with the election of Mr. Obama, the country was embracing people and perspectives that had long been marginalized. 
 ''I do feel this means we are one United States, one people,'' she said, the flags behind her snapping in the breeze.

HEADLINE: Obama Is Sworn In as the 44th President

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Barack Hussein Obama became the 44th president of the United States on Tuesday before a massive crowd reveling in a moment of historical significance, and called on Americans to confront together an economic crisis that he said was caused by ''our collective failure to make hard choices.''
 Mr. Obama spoke just after noon to a sea of cheering people, appearing to number well over a million, who packed the National Mall from the Capitol to the Washington Monument and beyond. Four hours later, at the end of the parade route, he left his car and strolled with his wife along Pennsylvania Avenue on the final steps of a long march to the White House, holding hands and waving to cheering crowds.
 In his inaugural address, Mr. Obama acknowledged the change his presidency represented, describing himself in his inaugural address as a ''man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant.'' But although the crowd and the podium around him were full of elated African Americans, Mr. Obama, the first black to become president, did not dwell on that in his speech. 
 He spoke for about 20 minutes, after taking the oath of office on the same Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inaugural in 1861, emphasizing his determination to unite Americans in confronting both the economic challenges facing him and the continuing fight against terrorism. 
 The problems, he warned, ''are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America -- they will be met.''
 Later, during a luncheon with members of Congress, Mr. Obama urged lawmakers to come together ''with a sense of purpose and civility and urgency.''
 ''It doesn't mean we're going to agree on everything,'' he told the lawmakers, who are already at work on major parts of his agenda. ''And I assure you our administration will make mistakes.''
 The festive luncheon ended on a subdued note after Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has brain cancer, was stricken with convulsions. Hours later, the chairman of neurosurgery at the Washington Hospital Center said Mr. Kennedy, the 76-year-old Massachusetts Democrat, had suffered a seizure from ''simple fatigue,'' but was awake and ''feeling well'' and would be released in the morning.
 With his wife, Michelle, holding the Bible, Mr. Obama, the 47-year-old son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Africa, was sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.a few minutes after noon, a little later than planned, and spoke immediately afterward.
 Because the ceremony ran slightly long, Mr. Obama did not recite the oath of office until just after noon, the moment when he officially became president. And there was an awkward moment during the swearing-in when Justice Roberts and Mr. Obama, who is famed for his elocution, mixed up their words slightly.
 In his inaugural address, Mr. Obama promised to take ''bold and swift'' action to restore the economy by creating jobs through public works projects, improving education, promoting alternative energy and relying on new technology.
 ''Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Hours later, the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, signed a memorandum sent to agencies and departments to stop all pending regulations until a legal and policy review could be conducted by the Obama administration.
 Turning to foreign affairs, the new president made note the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the ''far-reaching network of violence and hatred'' that seek to harm the country. He used strong language in pledging to confront terrorism, nuclear proliferation and other threats from abroad, saying to the nation's enemies, ''you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.''
 But he also signaled a clean break from some of the Bush administration's policies on national security. ''As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals,'' he said, adding that the United States is ''ready to lead once more.'' 
 The poet Elizabeth Alexander, in a speech following the swearing in, paid tribute to the contributions of working Americans and slaves.
 ''Sing the names of the dead who brought us here, who laid the train tracks, raised the bridges, picked the cotton and the lettuce, built brick by brick the glittering edifices they would then keep clean and work inside of,'' she said. 
 Former President Bill Clinton, making his way through the Capitol after the ceremony, called the speech thoughtful, weighty and well-delivered. 
 ''It's obviously historic because President Obama is the first African American president, but it's more than that,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''This is a time when we're clearly making a new beginning. It's a country of repeated second chances and new beginnings.''
 In his speech, Mr. Obama acknowledged that some are skeptical of his ability to fulfill the hope that many have in his ability to move the nation in a new direction.
 ''What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply,'' said Mr. Obama, who in his campaign emphasized a commitment to reduce partisanship. ''The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.''
 After the speech, Mr. Obama escorted Mr. Bush to the East Front of the Capitol, where a helicopter was waiting to take the former president and his wife to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington for a return trip to Texas. 
 After seeing Mr. Bush off, Mr. Obama went back inside the Capitol to sign nomination papers for his cabinet choices and to attend a traditional luncheon in Statuary Hall, the original chamber of the House of Representatives. 
 After lunch, the Senate got back to business, and by unanimous consent confirmed the appointments of seven cabinet secretaries: Steven Chu, secretary of energy; Arne Duncan, secretary of education; Janet Napolitano, for homeland security, Peter Orszag as director of the Office of Management and Budget; Ken Salazar as secretary of the interior; Eric K. Shinseki as secretary of veterans affairs; and Tom Vilsack as secretary of agriculture.
 At the same time, Senate Republicans delayed the confirmation of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state for at least a day because of concerns about potential conflicts of interest posed by possible foreign donors to her husband's foundation.
 It was after 3:30 before Mr. Obama made his way down Pennsylvania Avenue to view the parade through sidewalks still packed with people, some of whom had been there for eight hours.
 At the peak of the celebration, at least a million people -- it was impossible to count -- packed the National Mall from the West Front of the Capitol to beyond the Washington Monument, buttoning up against the freezing chill but projecting a palpable sense of hope. It was the largest inaugural crowd in decades, perhaps the largest ever; the throng and the anticipation began building even before the sun rose. 
 As the crowds gathered, Mr. Obama and his wife -- who attended a church earlier in the day -- had coffee with President Bush and his wife, Laura, and then rode with them to Capitol Hill for the swearing in.
 Even before the sun rose or the mercury rose to the freezing point, people had streamed from all directions to the West Front of the Capitol, making their way on foot and by mass transit, since traffic was barred from a wide area around the grounds and the National Mall for security and to prevent gridlock.
 Given the historic nature of Mr. Obama's election, black Americans appeared to be much more prevalent in the gathering crowd than at inaugurals of the recent past.
 The Obamas left Blair House at 8:47 a.m. for the short drive in their new presidential Cadillac limousine to St. John's Episcopal Church, just a few blocks away, for a prayer service. Mr. Obama wore a dark suit and red tie. 
 Shortly before 10 a.m., the Obamas arrived at the White House, accompanied by Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden and his wife, Jill. The Obamas were met at the door by the Bushes. The two men shook hands and with their wives posed for a picture before going inside for a traditional coffee and a final few moments for the Bushes in the home they have occupied the past eight years.
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama left the White House at 10:47 and, pausing only momentarily for photographers, entered the limousine that would take them to the Capitol. They arrived there 10 minutes later. 
 Inside the Capitol, staffers were scurrying about putting the final touches on the Inaugural Luncheon in Statuary Hall. The corridor leading to the House chamber had been transformed into staging grounds for the caterers, with huge serving tins of beets and green vegetables. Outside the House chamber, were dozens of cases of Korbel Champagne. 
 The tables were set with large centerpieces of red roses. And a lectern, fashioned from a brass statue of a bald eagle, was positioned behind the dais. Decorators were making final adjustments to the lighting of ''View of Yosemite Valley'' an 1885 painting by Thomas Hill that was positioned directly behind President Obama's seat at the center of the dais.
 ''He is going to be counting on the American people to come together,'' Colin Powell, the former military leader and secretary of state, said in an appearance on MSNBC on Tuesday morning. ''We all have to do something to help the country move forward under the leadership of this new president.''
 As a black American who grew up in a segregated nation, Mr. Powell said the inauguration was looming as a powerful and emotional moment for African Americans. ''You almost start tearing up,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama's assumption of the presidency caps a remarkable rise for a man first elected to national office in 2004, winning a Senate seat in a year when he also delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. 
 After a big Democratic field narrowed to just two, he defeated Senator Clinton of New York in a pitched presidential primary battle and then beat Senator John McCain of Arizona in a general election conducted against the backdrop of a national economic collapse.
 Though Mr. Obama did not emphasize his African American heritage as a candidate, the symbolism was evident and was reinforced by the fact that the swearing in was taking place the day following the national holiday to mark the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King. He will take office less than a month before the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, another Illinoisan who took the office at a time of national turmoil and a man whom Mr. Obama clearly looks to as an inspiration for his own presidency. 
 ''Today is about validation of the dream Dr. King enunciated 45 years ago on the steps on the Lincoln Memorial,'' said Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House and the highest ranking black congressman.

HEADLINE: Obama Promises the World a Renewed America

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Reporting was contributed by Simon Romero from Caracas, Venezuela; Mona el-Naggar from Cairo; Ellen Barry from Moscow; Marc Lacey from Mexico City; and Daphne Angles from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
President Obama used his Inaugural Address to promise the regeneration of an America many in recent years had feared lost. 
 Speaking directly to the millions who crowded around televisions across the world as much as to Americans, Mr. Obama said the United States was ''ready to lead once more'' despite the ravages of protracted wars and a depleted economy.
 But he coupled that with a vision of an America that exercises its power with a sense of justice, humility and restraint, and an America that, while believing its values still light the world, pledges to promote them through cooperation and understanding as much as military might. 
 With a steel never so pronounced in his campaign, he challenged America's adversaries -- and, recently, some of its oldest friends -- who have spied an America diminished by economic distress and war, and heralded a new world order in which America would give up much of its power. 
 That hesitant, regretful America was nowhere to be seen in Mr. Obama's address, which called on Americans to rally against ''a nagging fear'' that decline is inevitable. While offering a ''new way forward to the Muslim world,'' and warning dictators that they are ''on the wrong side of history,'' he sounded not unlike George W. Bush in his challenges to those who spread terror and destruction. ''You cannot outlast us; we will defeat you,'' he said. 
 Some abroad bridled and some were reassured by the recurring foreign policy motif of Mr. Obama's address -- his resolve that the United States, as it rebuilds at home, will not give up its long-established role as the leader of the free world. And while many hailed the change of tone, others were uncertain that real change was coming, given the realities of American politics and the world that has not altered with the transition in Washington. 
 In Cairo and Lebanon, while some hailed Mr. Obama's outreach to the Muslim world, most remained skeptical about his ability to change the basic direction of American policy and what many Arabs regard as a strong bias toward Israel. For many, the war in Gaza, which caused tremendous anger throughout the Arab world, overshadowed the inauguration; Mr. Obama did not refer to it in his address. 
 ''Why should I be optimistic about what he said?'' said Hassan Abdel Rahman, 25, a salesman in a flower shop in Cairo. ''If there was reason to be optimistic, then we would have felt it during the war on Gaza, and if he was just, then he would have said something then -- but he said nothing!''
 Some old adversaries suggested that they would keep an open mind. ''We salute the people of the United States,'' said Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, emphasizing that he hoped that Mr. Obama's presidency would ''mark a change in the relations of the United States with the countries of the third world.''
 In some capitals, Mr. Obama's renewed claim to foreign leadership and the prospect of an American president with the kind of aura not seen since John F. Kennedy have provoked stirrings of jealousy, even animosity. In Russia and France, notably, there have been high-level calls that Mr. Obama accept that America's days as the dominant superpower are over, especially in the face of the retreat from the free-market capitalism the United States has championed. 
 Russia's foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, published an essay last month saying, in language that was almost pitying, that Russia had ''returned to the world stage'' and would not accept the United States any longer as an imperial power. ''America has to recognize the reality of a 'post-American' world,'' he said. 
 More surprising, perhaps, has been the changed tone of France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who took office in 2007 with a reputation as France's most pro-American president in memory but has tempered that as he has sought to establish himself as Europe's most powerful voice. ''I have always been in favor of a very close alliance with the United States of America,'' Mr. Sarkozy said two weeks ago. ''But let us make things clear: in the 21st century, there is no longer one nation that can tell what must be done or what one must think.''
 The tone of Mr. Obama's address, especially his emphasis on greater cooperation, and his vow to combat poverty, climate change and nuclear threats, scarcely presaged a new era of American bullying. But even with a radical new tone, he may find the partners he seeks may be reluctant to share burdens that have until now been America's main responsibility to bear.
 ''We have entered a period of historical transition in which the United States will become first among equals, rather than simply top dog, hyperpower and unquestioned hegemon,'' said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford. ''But for Europeans, it may be a case of being careful what you wish for, because the Obama administration is likely to say, 'Good, then put your money where your mouth is, and in the first place, put more troops in Afghanistan.' ''
 In the days leading up to the inauguration, many politicians, academics, opinion leaders and others spoke to correspondents of The New York Times around the world about Mr. Obama in terms verging on euphoria. But they also sounded warnings that the expectations were too high and that the world might discover that Mr. Obama is hemmed in by some of the unyielding realities that had frustrated his predecessor, compounded now by the worldwide recession and what it has done to diminish America's reputation as a model of free-market prosperity. 
 ''Obviously, there is a risk that we will expect too much of this president -- that we will learn that however hugely talented he is, he isn't a global miracle worker,'' said Christopher Patten, a former European commissioner for foreign affairs who is now chancellor of Oxford.
 Moves that Mr. Obama has signaled, like a plan to close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to align the United States with international law on the use of torture, are certain to be greeted with relief and celebration around the world. But on Iran's suspected bid to acquire nuclear weapons, on his pledge to step up the allied military commitment in Afghanistan, on climate change and a host of other issues, he may find personal popularity one thing, achieving his goals through partnership and negotiation quite another. 
 As he prepared to leave office, Mr. Bush admonished Mr. Obama to remember that a president's first priority is to keep America safe, a challenge the new president addressed.
 But his pledges to ''leave Iraq to its people'' and push for a ''hard-earned peace'' in Afghanistan may yet jar with reality, military analysts have warned. His plan to increase American and allied troop strength in Afghanistan has met with a chilling riposte from Osama bin Laden, who, by eluding capture since 9/11, has embodied the limits of Mr. Bush's ''great war on terror.''
 Last week, Mr. bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, challenged Mr. Obama in an audio message. Referring to Afghanistan and Iraq, he said Mr. Obama was ''like one who swallows a double-edged dagger -- whichever way he moves it, it will wound him.'' Iraq could be just as tricky, confronting Mr. Obama, should trends toward less violence there reverse, with a challenge to his campaign commitment to a 16-month troop withdrawal timetable. 
 Jorge Montano, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States, said that Mr. Bush had been too focused on Afghanistan and Iraq to notice that Latin America was drifting away from the United States, and that Mr. Obama might prove little different. ''Right now, the people of the United States are worried about their credit cards, their mortgages,'' he said. ''These will be Obama's priorities, and this region will have to wait.''
 But as Mr. Obama took office, practical calculations were largely set aside. Commentaries praising him found much more to admire than the fact that he is the first African-American president, significant though that is in a world whose population of 6.5 billion is overwhelmingly nonwhite.
 Even before his solemn and measured address, Mr. Obama had drawn widespread plaudits for his character and judgment. ''Obama acts like a kind of antacid to the American stomach,'' Andrew Sullivan, a columnist for The Sunday Times of London, wrote last weekend, one of a raft of adulatory articles in Europe's major newspapers. Rather than seeing the world in black and white terms, he wrote, Mr. Obama ''sees it as a series of interconnected conflicts that can be managed by pragmatic solutions, combined with a little rhetorical fairy dust and willingness to offer respect where Bush provided merely contempt.''
 ''This is not a panacea,'' he added. ''But it is not nothing either.''

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Oath, and Nation in Crisis Embraces the Moment

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Barack Hussein Obama was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States on Tuesday and promised to ''begin again the work of remaking America'' on a day of celebration that climaxed a once-inconceivable journey for the man and his country.
 Mr. Obama, the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, inherited a White House built partly by slaves and a nation in crisis at home and abroad. The moment captured the imagination of much of the world as more than a million flag-waving people bore witness while Mr. Obama recited the oath with his hand on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used at his inauguration 148 years ago. 
 Beyond the politics of the occasion, the sight of a black man climbing the highest peak electrified people across racial, generational and partisan lines. Mr. Obama largely left it to others to mark the history explicitly, making only passing reference to his own barrier-breaking role in his 18-minute Inaugural Address, noting how improbable it might seem that ''a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.'' 
 But confronted by the worst economic situation in decades, two overseas wars and the continuing threat of Islamic terrorism, Mr. Obama sobered the celebration with a grim assessment of the state of a nation rocked by home foreclosures, shuttered businesses, lost jobs, costly health care, failing schools, energy dependence and the threat of climate change. Signaling a sharp and immediate break with the presidency of George W. Bush, he vowed to usher in a ''new era of responsibility'' and restore tarnished American ideals. 
 ''Today, I say to you that the challenges we face are real,'' Mr. Obama said in the address, delivered from the west front of the Capitol. ''They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America, they will be met.''
 The vast crowd that thronged the Mall on a frigid but bright winter day was the largest to attend an inauguration in decades, if not ever. Many then lined Pennsylvania Avenue for a parade that continued well past nightfall on a day that was not expected to end for Mr. Obama until late in the night with the last of 10 inaugural balls.
 Mr. Bush left the national stage quietly, doing nothing to upstage his successor. After hosting the Obamas for coffee at the White House and attending the ceremony at the Capitol, Mr. Bush hugged Mr. Obama, then left through the Rotunda to head back to Texas. ''Come on, Laura, we're going home,'' he was overheard telling Mrs. Bush.
 The inauguration coincided with more bad news from Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 300 points on indications of further trouble for banks.
 The spirit of the day was also marred by the hospitalization of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose endorsement helped propel Mr. Obama to the Democratic nomination last year. Mr. Kennedy, who has been fighting a malignant brain tumor, suffered a seizure at a Capitol luncheon after the ceremony and was wheeled out on a stretcher.
 The pageantry included some serious business. Shortly after he and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were sworn in, Mr. Obama ordered all pending Bush regulations frozen for a legal and policy review. He also signed formal nomination papers for his cabinet, and the Senate quickly confirmed seven nominees: the secretaries of homeland security, energy, agriculture, interior, education and veterans' affairs and the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
 When he arrives in the Oval Office on Wednesday, aides said, Mr. Obama will get to work on some of his priorities. He plans to convene his national security team and senior military commanders to discuss his plans to pull combat troops out of Iraq and bolster those in Afghanistan. He also plans to sign executive orders to start closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and could reverse Mr. Bush's restrictions on financing for groups that promote or provide information about abortion.
 Delays in the confirmation process have left both the State Department and the Treasury Department in the hands of caretakers. But Hillary Rodham Clinton was expected to win Senate confirmation as secretary of state on Wednesday, and the Pentagon remains under the control of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who was kept on from the Bush administration and did not attend the inauguration so someone in the line of succession would survive in case of terrorist attack.
 In his address, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Bush ''for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.'' But he also offered implicit criticism, condemning what he called ''our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.'' 
 He went on to assure the rest of the world that change had come. ''To all other peoples and governments who are watching today,'' Mr. Obama said, ''from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born, know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.''
 Some of Mr. Obama's supporters booed and taunted Mr. Bush when he emerged from the Capitol to take his place on stage, at one point singing, ''Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye.'' By day's end, Mr. Bush had landed in Texas, where he defended his presidency and declared that he was ''coming home with my head held high.''
 The departing vice president, Dick Cheney, appeared at the ceremony in a wheelchair after suffering a back injury moving the day before and was also booed. 
 The nation's 56th inauguration drew waves of people from all corners and filled the expanse between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. For the first transition in power since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, much of the capital was under exceptionally tight security, with a two-square-mile swath under the strictest control. Bridges from Virginia were closed to regular traffic and more than 35,000 civilian and military personnel were on duty.
 Mr. Obama secured at least part of his legacy the moment he walked into the White House on Tuesday, 146 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, 108 years after the first black man dined in the mansion with a president and 46 years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. declared his dream of equality.
 Mr. Obama, just 47 years old and four years out of the Illinois State Senate, arrived at this moment on the unlikeliest of paths, vaulted to the forefront of national politics on the strength of stirring speeches, early opposition to the Iraq war and public disenchantment with the Bush era. His scant record of achievement at the national level proved less important to voters than his embodiment of change.
 His foreign-sounding name, his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia and his skin color made him a unique figure in the annals of presidential campaigns, yet he toppled two of the best brand names in American politics -- Mrs. Clinton in the primaries and Senator John McCain in the general election.
 Mr. Obama himself is descended on his mother's side from ancestors who owned slaves and he can trace his family tree to Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. The power of the moment was lost on no one as the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, one of the towering figures of the civil rights movement, gave the benediction and called for ''inclusion, not exclusion; tolerance, not intolerance.''
 The Rev. Rick Warren, a conservative minister selected by Mr. Obama to give the invocation despite protests from liberals, told the crowd, ''We know today that Dr. King and a great cloud of witnesses are shouting in heaven.''
 For all that, Mr. Obama used the occasion to address ''this winter of our hardship'' and promote his plan for vast federal spending accompanied by tax cuts to stimulate the economy and begin addressing energy, environmental and infrastructure needs.
 ''Now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans,'' he said. ''Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this country has already done, what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage.''
 He also essentially renounced the curtailment of liberties in the name of security, saying he would ''reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.'' He struck a stiff note on terrorism, saying Americans ''will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense.''
 ''For those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken,'' he said. ''You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.''
 But Mr. Obama also added a message to Islamic nations, a first from the inaugural lectern. ''To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect,'' Mr. Obama said. ''To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history -- but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.''
 Mr. Obama's public day started at 8:45 a.m. when he and his wife, Michelle, left Blair House for a service at St. John's Church, then joined the Bushes, Cheneys and Bidens for coffee at the White House. 
 The Obamas' daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, joined them at the Capitol, as did Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain, as well as former Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and the elder George Bush.
 While emotional for many, the ceremony did not go entirely according to plan. Mr. Biden was sworn in by Justice John Paul Stevens behind schedule at 11:57 a.m., and Mr. Obama did not take the oath until 12:05 p.m., five minutes past the constitutionally proscribed transfer of power.
 Moreover, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stumbled over the 35-word oath, causing Mr. Obama to repeat it out of the constitutional order. Instead of swearing that he ''will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States,'' Mr. Obama swore that he ''will execute the office of president of the United States faithfully.''
 Following time-honored rituals, the Obamas attended lunch with lawmakers in Statuary Hall at the Capitol, then rode and walked to the White House, where they watched the parade from a bulletproof reviewing stand. They planned to attend all 10 official inaugural balls before spending their first night in the White House.
 In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Obama seemed at times to be having a virtual dialogue with his predecessors. ''What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility,'' he said, ''a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly.'' Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton likewise called for responsibility at their inaugurations, but Mr. Obama offered little sense of what exactly he wanted Americans to do.
 Mr. Obama also seemed to take issue with Ronald Reagan, who declared when he took office in 1981 that ''government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.'' Mr. Clinton rebutted that in 1997, saying, ''government is not the problem and government is not the solution.''
 Mr. Obama offered a new formulation: ''The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works, whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end.''
 Mr. Clinton, at least, applauded the message. In a brief interview afterward, he said Mr. Obama's installation could change the way America was viewed. 
 ''It's obviously historic because President Obama is the first African-American president, but it's more than that,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''This is a time when we're clearly making a new beginning. It's a country of repeated second-chances and new beginnings.''

HEADLINE: Obama Embarks on His Honeymoon. The Question: How Long Will It Last?

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Given the excitement in Washington this week, one might think that with the inauguration of Barack Obama and the departure of George W. Bush, the economy was about to spring back to life, the troops were on their way home from Iraq, there would soon be health care coverage for all, and, to quote a certain Obama foe turned Obama secretary of state-designate, ''celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect.''
 But as Mr. Obama moves into the White House, there is evidence that, enthusiastic though the public is about the change in power, there are no expectations of quick fixes. The cascade of grim economic news, combined with the calculatedly sober tone Mr. Obama has adopted, has provided him something of a cushion. 
 ''People are going to give Obama more time than they would any other new president, because they know he is dealing with unprecedented challenges,'' said Mark McKinnon, a Republican media consultant who worked for Mr. Bush and, for a time, Senator John McCain, Mr. Obama's opponent in the election just past.
 Still, just how much patience does the country have for turning the ship of state around, no matter how much it likes its new president?
 Mr. Obama's advisers, who have been nothing if not diligent about pushing the idea that change will not come quickly, tend to avoid being nailed down to any timetable.
 ''I just don't know,'' David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said in an interview. ''I think that's hard to judge. I think right now people are inclined to give us some time. By 'time,' I mean more than months. People understand that it's going to take years.''
 Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, responded with a terse e-mail message when asked how long he thought Mr. Obama had. 
 ''Will not put time on it,'' Mr. Emanuel wrote.
 ''I think based on what I see,'' he wrote, ''they know these are big problems and cannot be turned around quickly. Public quite pragmatic.''
 A Times/CBS News poll conducted last week offered at least some guidance for the Obama Expectations Clock. Most respondents said they thought it would take Mr. Obama two years or more to deliver on campaign promises to improve the economy, expand health care coverage and end the war in Iraq. 
 But an intriguing question is when, if ever, does Mr. Bush lose ownership of this recession and it becomes an Obama recession? In a poll question dealing solely with the recession, most respondents thought it would last two years or longer.
 David Plouffe, who was the Obama campaign manager, argued that Mr. Obama could earn patience from the American public in part with his tone. 
 ''People expect a change in priorities,'' Mr. Plouffe said. ''People expect a change in intensity. But they know it's going to take a long while for things to stabilize and turn around.''
 In all likelihood, the length of time the president has to deal with problems and deliver on promises will vary with the problem and the promise. He probably has a good deal of breathing room not only on the economy but also on health care, given the long and tortured history of efforts to change the system.
 But after the crispness and certitude of his campaign promise to bring all combat troops out of Iraq within 16 months of his taking office, it seems fair to say that the public at large, and his Democratic base in particular, will not be quite so tolerant of delays on that front.
 Mr. Obama may also find it difficult to delay very long in closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He has walked a careful line on this issue since the election, making clear that he will eventually close the camp but noting all the complications in doing so.
 His ability to slow-walk some campaign promises will also be affected by how well he maintains his standing with the American public and continues to project a commanding air. With a series of missteps upon assuming the presidency in 1993, Bill Clinton was quick to squander what political capital he had. So far, Mr. Obama has remained unscathed by any missteps he has made, but his ability to ask for the American public's patience depends in no small part on confidence in his competence and motives.
 Mr. Axelrod said he thought Mr. Obama and the country were in tune with each other.
 ''What's remarkable about the polls is that people are at once optimistic and realistic,'' he said. ''They have high hopes for his presidency, and that he can help lead us out of the morass we are in -- and they understand how deep the morass is. And that's a good position to be in.''
 Still, if these past few years have demonstrated anything, it is that things move much more quickly in politics than they ever have before; events change, perceptions change, public opinion shifts. Even as Mr. McKinnon argued that Mr. Obama would enjoy a lot more running room than other presidents, his estimate of when the bill might come due was probably one that Mr. Axelrod would not like to hear.
 ''I think Obama can count on a very long honeymoon,'' Mr. McKinnon said. ''I think he's got about six months, which is about five and a half months longer than usual.''

HEADLINE: A Day of Uplift in America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 On Tuesday, Barack Obama became the 44th president of the United States. That he is the first African-American president of a country that only a handful of generations ago fought a bloody civil war that abolished slavery, and only 50 years ago struggled in the streets to bring civil rights to all citizens whatever their color, is a testament to something very good going on in America. 
 The grip of fear, cultural tyranny and bigotry itself has weakened and loosened to a point where, truly, the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. take on a new and powerful meaning, ''Let freedom ring.'' 
 These are hard times for people and our country. War, economic faltering and collapse in some areas, the threat of terrorism -- these and more can bring fear and uncertainty to every citizen of this country. 
 There is much to be learned, much to be improved, there is hardship ahead as there was years ago and always will be. And in this struggle the Lord continues to work to bring us opportunities to strive for Him and do the right thing, to grow, to reach for a better life not just without, but a spiritual life within, which honors God, one another and strives to bring good will, respect and honor to all human beings, because they are human beings. 
 Take a moment this week to reflect on this historic inauguration of our 44th president. Perhaps this is a moment in history, within a time of uncertainty, to see a light shine, brighter than before, reflecting in the faces of all people, of all backgrounds and colors, bringing just a little more hope and faith and genuine charity to this world.

 To the Editor:
 To the world -- President Obama promised a return to the power of our values from this unseemly focus on the value of our power. To us at home -- President Obama said the celebration is over and we must get down to ''the work of remaking America.'' He expects all of us to sacrifice, sweat and serve. 
 For when he said, ''All this we can do. All this we will do,'' he was really commanding us, ''All of this we must do!''

 To the Editor:
 I was a strong supporter of John McCain. I believed that his record of service to the nation and willingness to pursue bipartisan solutions to our problems made him uniquely suited to be president. Naturally, I was disappointed with the election results. But I can honestly say I was not depressed.
 While I might not agree with him on every issue, Barack Obama is honest, extremely intelligent and very capable. He has inspired a groundswell of enthusiasm and optimism greater than any I can recall in my lifetime. 
 In these times of financial meltdown and international turmoil, all Americans of good will -- Republicans, Democrats, independents, blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, Jews, Christians, Muslims -- share a common wish for President Obama and our nation to succeed.
 Godspeed, Barack Obama.

 Re ''From Books, New President Found Voice'' (front page, Jan. 19): Forget Oprah's Book Club -- let's make President Obama's reading list part of the national curriculum. Can you imagine? Shakespeare, Melville, Lincoln and Gandhi harbored at the core of America's consciousness.
 Their writings are sitting and waiting, right now, in public libraries, public schools and online. They are available to everyone. This could be an opportunity to build America's intellectual and spiritual infrastructure. And it doesn't have to cost a dime. Ainslie Jones Uhl

 Re ''I Wish You Were Here'' (column, Jan. 20):
 Three cheers for Bob Herbert's recognition of Lyndon B. Johnson's ''herculean effort'' in leading the way to passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which opened the way for Barack Obama to become the nation's first African-American president. 
 Moreover, L.B.J.'s food stamp program helped Mr. Obama's mother during some difficult times, and the extension of his 1965 college grant and loan programs helped both Barack and Michelle Obama get their first-class education.
 It's refreshing to have at least one member of the news media point out how ''shamefully'' the Democratic Party and nation (including the rest of the media) have neglected L.B.J.'s ''monumental'' achievements for social justice.

 Re ''Obama Reaches Out for McCain's Counsel'' (news article, Jan. 19):
 There is, in fact, a precedent for President Obama's seeking Senator John McCain's counsel. 
 After Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1940 election, he invited his opponent, the Republican Wendell L. Willkie, to meet with him in the White House. ''You know, he is a very good fellow,'' F.D.R. said afterward to his secretary of labor, Frances Perkins. ''He has lots of talent. I want to use him somehow.''
 When Roosevelt learned that Willkie was going to England in January 1941, he asked him to be his personal representative, giving him a letter for Prime Minister Winston Churchill. After his return, Willkie testified in Congress as a strong proponent of the Lend-Lease Act and more aid to Britain.
 F.D.R. and Willkie continued to meet, and in the late summer of 1942, with F.D.R.'s approval and cooperation, Willkie again embarked on a fact-finding mission around the world. The two men even began talks on joining hands to realign the two political parties, a project cut short by Willkie's death in 1944.
 ''You know, Willkie would have made a good Democrat,'' F.D.R. once said to Perkins. ''Too bad we lost him.''

 To the Editor:
 The Jan. 20 front-page photo of the Obamas and the baby is iconic and should take its place in the history of the glorious day of Jan. 20, 2009. It expresses, beyond what words can convey, the joy, hope and love felt by so many in the United States and throughout the world.

HEADLINE: 2 Confirmed for Economy And for National Security

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate on Tuesday confirmed seven of President Obama's cabinet-level appointments, but the group included only two members of Mr. Obama's national security and economic teams, the bedrock of his new administration during the economic crisis and two wars. 
 Of the seven confirmations, approved by the unanimous consent of all 99 senators, only one--Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, is directly responsible for national security issues, and only one, Peter R. Orszag as director of the Office of Management and Budget, is directly responsible for economic issues.
 Senate action on Hillary Rodham Clinton's confirmation as secretary of state was delayed until Wednesday after Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said he still had questions about foreign donors to the charitable foundation run by former President Bill Clinton. 
 Mrs. Clinton is still expected to be confirmed with wide support among her colleagues in the Senate, but the objection of even just one senator makes a roll-call vote necessary. Senate aides said there was an agreement between party leaders to hold that vote on Wednesday after three hours of debate.
 Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's press secretary, told reporters that he expected the Senate Finance Committee to vote on Timothy F. Geithner for Treasury secretary on Thursday.
 Mr. Obama has scheduled a meeting with members of his National Security Council on Wednesday afternoon, administration officials said. Normally, such a meeting would include both the secretary of state and the Treasury secretary. If Mrs. Clinton's confirmation goes through before the meeting, she will attend, one official said. It was unclear whether William J. Burns, the acting secretary of state, would attend the meeting if she is not yet confirmed.
 Aides said Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser; Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary; and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would all attend the security council meeting, to discuss Afghanistan, Iraq and the fragile cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and the militant Islamist organization Hamas.
 It was also unclear who would represent the Treasury at the N.S.C. meeting, since the confirmation hearing for Mr. Geithner was delayed after questions arose about mistakes on tax returns that required him to make substantial late payments to the Internal Revenue Service, an agency that would be under his purview.
 The Obama administration will be under pressure to make swift decisions on the economy. Even as the inaugural ceremonies were unfolding, Congressional staff members were scrutinizing a report on the House Democrats' version of a proposed $825 billion economic stimulus package that raised questions about how quickly government action would be able to help jump-start the struggling economy. 
 In addition to Ms. Napolitano, who had been governor of Arizona, and Mr. Orszag, the Senate confirmed Steven Chu, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, as energy secretary; Arne Duncan as education secretary; Ken Salazar, a former senator from Colorado, as interior secretary; Eric K. Shinseki as veterans secretary; and Tom Vilsack, the former governor or Iowa, as agriculture secretary.

HEADLINE: Nation's Many Faces in Extended First Family

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR; Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from Kenya. Kitty Bennett contributed research.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The president's elderly stepgrandmother brought him an oxtail fly whisk, a mark of power at home in Kenya. Cousins journeyed from the South Carolina town where the first lady's great-great-grandfather was born into slavery, while the rabbi in the family came from the synagogue where he had been commemorating Martin Luther King's Birthday. The president and first lady's siblings were there, too, of course: his Indonesian-American half-sister, who brought her Chinese-Canadian husband, and her brother, a black man with a white wife.
 When President Barack Obama was sworn in on Tuesday, he was surrounded by an extended clan that would have shocked past generations of Americans and instantly redrew the image of a first family for future ones. 
 As they convened to take their family's final step in its journey from Africa and into the White House, the group seemed as if it had stepped out of the pages of Mr. Obama's memoir -- no longer the disparate kin of a young man wondering how he fit in, but the embodiment of a new president's promise of change. 
 For well over two centuries, the United States has been vastly more diverse than its ruling families. Now the Obama family has flipped that around, with a Technicolor cast that looks almost nothing like their overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly Protestant predecessors in the role. The family that produced Barack and Michelle Obama is black and white and Asian, Christian, Muslim and Jewish. They speak English; Indonesian; French; Cantonese; German; Hebrew; African languages including Swahili, Luo and Igbo; and even a few phrases of Gullah, the Creole dialect of the South Carolina Lowcountry. Very few are wealthy, and some -- like Sarah Obama, the stepgrandmother who only recently got electricity and running water in her metal-roofed shack -- are quite poor.
 ''Our family is new in terms of the White House, but I don't think it's new in terms of the country,'' Maya Soetoro-Ng, the president's younger half-sister, said last week. ''I don't think the White House has always reflected the textures and flavors of this country.'' 
 Though the world is recognizing the inauguration of the first African-American president, the story is a more complex narrative, about immigration, social mobility and the desegregation of one of the last divided institutions in American life: the family. It is a tale of self-determination, full of refusals to follow the tracks laid by history or religion or parentage.
 Mr. Obama follows the second President Bush, who had a presidential son's self-assured grip on power. Aside from a top-quality education, the new president came to politics with none of his predecessor's advantages: no famous last name, no deep-pocketed parents to finance early forays into politics and, in fact, not much of a father at all. So Mr. Obama built his political career from scratch, with best-selling books and long-shot runs for office, leaving his relatives astonished at where he has brought them.
 ''It is so mind-boggling that there is a black president,'' Craig Robinson, Mrs. Obama's brother, said in an interview. ''Then you layer on top of it that I am related to him? And then you layer on top of that that it's my brother-in-law? That is so overwhelming, I can't hardly think about it.''
 Though Mr. Obama is the son of a black Kenyan, he has some conventionally presidential roots on his white mother's side: abolitionists who, according to family legend, were chased out of Missouri, a slave state; Midwesterners who weathered the Depression; even a handful of distant ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War. (Ever since he became a United States senator, the Sons of the American Revolution has tried to recruit him. ) 
 But far less has been known about Mrs. Obama's roots -- even by the first lady herself. Growing up on the South Side of Chicago, ''it was sort of passed-down folklore that so-and-so was related to so-and-so and their mother and father was a slave,'' Mr. Robinson said. 
 Drawing on old census data, family records and interviews, it is clear that Mrs. Obama is indeed the descendant of slaves and a daughter of the Great Migration, the mass movement of African-Americans northward in the first half of the 20th century in search of opportunity. Mrs. Obama's family found it, but not without outsize measures of adversity and disappointment along the way. 
 Tracing Family Roots
 Only five generations ago, the first lady's great-great-grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born a slave on Friendfield Plantation in Georgetown, S.C., where he almost certainly drained swamps, harvested rice and was buried in an unmarked grave. As a child, Mrs. Obama used to visit her Georgetown relatives, but she only learned during the campaign that her forebears had been enslaved in the same town where she and her cousins had played.
 According to Megan Smolenyak, a genealogist who has uncovered the roots of many political figures, Mrs. Obama has ancestors with similar backgrounds across the South. The public records they left behind give only the briefest glimpses of their lives: Fanny Laws Humphrey, one of Mrs. Obama's great-great-grandmothers, was a cook in Birmingham, Ala., born before the end of the Civil War. Another set of great-great-grandparents, Mary and Nelson Moten, seem to have left Kentucky for Chicago in the early 1860s, a hint they might have been free before the end of the Civil War. And in 1910, some of Mrs. Obama's ancestors are listed in a census as mulatto, adding some support to family whispers of a white ancestor.
 The jobs that her relatives held in the early 20th century -- domestic servant, coal sorter, dressmaker -- suggest an escape from sharecropping, the system that trapped many former slaves and their children in penury for generations. 
 Still, the family's progress has a two steps forward, one step back quality. Jim Robinson was born into slavery, but his son, Fraser, ran a lunch truck in Georgetown. In turn, his son, Fraser Jr., struck out for Chicago in search of something better. But he was unable to find work, and left his wife and children for 14 years, according to his son Nomenee Robinson. As a result, Mrs. Obama's father was on welfare as a boy and started working on a milk truck at 11. 
 After serving in the Army in World War II and finally securing a job as a postal clerk, Fraser Robinson Jr. rejoined his family. He was so thrifty that he would bring home chemicals to do the family dry cleaning in the bathtub. But his son -- Mrs. Obama's father, Fraser Robinson III -- became overwhelmed with debt and dropped out of college after a year. He worked in a city boiler room for the rest of his life, helping to send his four younger siblings to college, then his two children, Mrs. Obama and her brother, to Princeton.
 Classroom Values
 For all of the vast differences in the Obama and Robinson histories, a few common threads run through. Education is one of them. As a young man, Mr. Obama's father herded goats, then won a scholarship to study in the Kenyan capital. When Mr. Obama lived in Indonesia as a child, his mother woke him up for at 4 a.m. for English lessons; meanwhile, in Chicago, Mrs. Obama's mother was bringing home math and reading workbooks so her children would always be a few lessons ahead in school.
 Only through education, generations of Robinsons taught their children, would they ever succeed in a racist society, relatives said. ''My mother would say, 'When you acquire knowledge, you acquire something no one could take away from you,' '' Craig Robinson said.
 The families also share a kind of adventurous self-determination. In the standard telling, the Obama side is the one that bent the rules of geography and ethnicity. Yet the first lady's family, the supposed South Side traditionalists, includes several members who literally or figuratively ventured far from home. Nomenee Robinson was an early participant in the Peace Corps, serving in India for two years; later, he moved to Nigeria, where he met his wife; the couple now live in Chicago. Capers Funnye Jr., a cousin of Mrs. Obama's and a rabbi, was brought up in the black church, he said, but as a young man, he felt a calling to Judaism he could not ignore.
 In daring cross-cultural leaps, no figure quite matches Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro, Mr. Obama's mother. As a university student in Honolulu, she hung out at the East-West Center, a cultural exchange organization, meeting two successive husbands there: Barack Obama, an economics student from Kenya, and later, Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian. Decades later, her daughter Maya Soetoro was picking up fliers at the same East-West Center when she noticed Konrad Ng, a Chinese-Canadian student, now her husband.
 Now the Obama-Robinson family's move to the White House seems like a symbolic end point for the once-firm idea that people of different backgrounds should not date, marry or bear children. In Mr. Obama's lifetime, racial intermarriage not only became legal everywhere in the United States, but has started to flourish. As many as a quarter of white Americans and nearly half of black Americans belong to a multiracial family, estimates Joshua R. Goldstein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.
 Diversity inside families, said Michael J. Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Stanford University, is ''the most interesting kind of diversity there is, because it brings people together cheek by jowl in a way that they never were before.''
 ''There's nothing as powerful as family relationships,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said, ''and that's why interracial marriage was illegal for so long in the U.S.'' 
 Initially, some of the unions in the Obama family caused consternation. ''What can you say when your son announces he's going to marry a Mzungu?'' said Sarah Obama in an interview, using the Swahili term for ''white person.'' But it was too late, she said, because the couple was deeply in love.
 Now, the relatives say, their family feels natural and right to them, that they think of each other as individuals, not as members of groups. Ms. Soetoro-Ng said she was not ''the Indonesian sister,'' but just Maya.
 A Special Reunion
 On Monday, some of Mr. Obama's Kenyan relatives milled around the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel here, their colorful headscarves earning them more curious glances than even the sports and pop music stars in the room. Zeituni Onyango, the president's aunt, explained that their family had always been able to absorb newcomers. 
 Pointing out that her male relatives used to take on multiple wives, she said, ''My daddy said anyone coming into my family is my family.'' (Ms. Onyango, who lives in Boston, recently faced deportation charges, but those orders have been stayed and she is pursuing a green card.)
 At holidays and celebrations, ''you get a whole lot of people who are happy to be around family,'' Craig Robinson said. ''They happen to be from different cultures, but the common thing is that they are all family.''
 ''Like the inauguration, those celebrations draw on a happy mishmash of traditions and histories. Take the Obamas' 1992 wedding, which included Kenyan family in traditional dress, a cloth-binding ceremony in which the bride and groom's hands were symbolically tied, and blues, jazz and classical music at the reception (held at a cultural center that was once a country club where black and Jewish Chicagoans were denied admission).
 White House events may now take on some of the same feel. Four years ago, when the family descended on Washington for Mr. Obama's Senate swearing-in, Mr. Ng strolled over to the White House gates and took a picture of his then-infant daughter, Suhaila -- ''gentle'' in Swahili -- sleeping in her stroller.
 Days before leaving Hawaii for the inauguration, Mr. Ng stared at the picture and wondered how much had changed since it was taken. After Tuesday's ceremony, he said, ''folks like me will have a chance to be on the other side.''

HEADLINE: Cubs: Coveted Team But a Tough Sell

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The identity of the next owner of the Chicago Cubs could be known Wednesday, later this week or, given the pace of this deal, when Ron Santo is voted into the Hall of Fame.
The Tribune Company has been peddling the Cubs, part of its coveted baseball assets, since the start of the 2007 season, when it was announced that the real estate billionaire Sam Zell had acquired the news media giant. The deal's tempo kept Tribune from profiting directly off the Cubs' two straight postseason appearances and led the company into a credit crunch that may affect the sale price. The huge debt incurred through Zell's $8.2 billion acquisition, compounded by the recession, sent Tribune into bankruptcy last month.
The Cubs, Wrigley Field and a third asset, Tribune's 25 percent stake in Comcast SportsNet Chicago, were excluded from the bankruptcy filing, but their sale must be approved by the bankruptcy court judge. Creditors upset with the price could seek new bids (but they can't squawk about Milton Bradley's new three-year, $30 million deal). 
But if the judge and the creditors are happy, the next hurdles would be approval by M.L.B.'s ownership committee and a three-quarters vote of owners.
The Tribune board is expected to choose one bidder with whom it will enter exclusive negotiations, but it was impossible on Tuesday to ascertain when the board will meet or whether it will force the three bidders into a Strat-O-Matic playoff to determine the finalist.
''I'm disappointed the process has taken this long, both as a fan and as a potential buyer,'' said Thomas Mandler, a lawyer in Chicago who was part of a group that bid between $700 million and $800 million for the Cubs package but did not qualify for a subsequent round. He wondered how much the deep recession would affect the final price.
''It could be less than our bid,'' he said, noting that the economy has shrunk the fortunes of the wealthy and the nest eggs of just about everyone else.
The final price will be up to the final bidder (among the remaining three), who may be paying $1 billion or so. The announced price will reflect the complex financial structure Zell has been deploying in negotiations to limit his tax liabilities, much as he did last year when he sold Newsday to Cablevision for $650 million.
The bidder believed to be the favorite is Thomas Ricketts, a Chicago-based bond underwriter whose family founded the TD Ameritrade brokerage. While attending the University of Chicago, he lived in an apartment above a bar across from Wrigley.
The second, Hersch Klaff, was born in South Africa and is a commercial real estate investor in Chicago. The third is a two-man group: Marc Utay, a former Chicagoan who runs a private equity firm in Manhattan, and Leo J. Hindery Jr., a news media investor who was the founding chairman of the YES Network.
If it takes a billion dollars, even in a deep recession, is that vanity or sophistication?
A little ego is required -- who wouldn't want to own the Cubbies if he or she could afford them? -- but some financial sense is involved. The Cubs are a bedrock major league franchise with a national following that has made the team a tourist attraction (despite the miserable state of the bathrooms at Wrigley) even in losing times.
The bidders have examined the financials (after being prequalified by Major League Baseball) and can evaluate the Cubs and the team's iconic stadium that, as it approaches age 95, is in need of repairs and, as they say, revenue enhancements. Mandler said the financial data showed the team to be profitable before 2008 (he has not seen last year's numbers). But, he added, ''The initial information raised questions about value that I presume were discussed during the second round of bidding that we weren't a part of.''
If the Cubs & Company are won for $1 billion, that would be a 52 percent increase over a similar deal for another storied franchise: the $660 million that John Henry's group (which included The New York Times Company) paid in 2002, in a far better economy, for the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park and 80 percent of the New England Sports Network.
Mark S. Rosentraub, a sports business expert and author of the coming book, ''Major League Winners: Using Sports and Cultural Centers for Economic Development,'' said in an e-mail message that the value of the Cubs' assets was ''based on anticipated future earnings.''
He would not vouch for the wisdom of a $1 billion price tag, but of the economy and the Cubs, he said: ''Do we have the most serious problem in more than six decades? Yes. Will we recover? Absolutely. And will baseball and sports in Chicago continue to be valued assets producing impressive revenue streams across time? Without a doubt.''
Amid the chatter of asset values, Mandler said, ''As a fan, I would love to see the winning bidder be a sportsman interested in bringing a championship, not a businessman just interested in making a profit.''

HEADLINE: Speech Spanned History and Confronted Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Though couched in indirect terms, Barack Obama's inaugural address was a stark repudiation of the era of George W. Bush and a vow to drive the United States into ''a new age'' by reclaiming the values of an older one. 
 It was a delicate task, with Mr. Bush and the former vice president, Dick Cheney, sitting feet from him as he described the false turns and the roads not taken. In his words, Mr. Obama blamed no one other than the country itself -- ''our collective failure to make hard choices'' and a willingness to suspend national ideals ''for expedience's sake.'' 
 Yet every time Mr. Obama urged Americans to ''choose our better history,'' to make decisions according to science instead of ideology, to reject a ''false choice'' between safety and American ideals, to recognize that American military power does not ''entitle us to do as we please,'' he signaled a commitment to pragmatism not just as a governing strategy but as a basic value.
 It was, in many ways, exactly what one might have expected from a man who propelled himself to the highest office in the land by denouncing where an excess of ideological zeal has taken the nation. But what was surprising about the speech was how much Mr. Obama dwelled on America's choices at this moment in history, rather than the momentousness of his ascension to the presidency. 
 Much as he did during his campaign, he barely mentioned his race in his first moments as the 44th president of the United States. He did not need to. The surroundings said it all as he stood on the steps of a Capitol built by the hands of slaves, and as he placed his own hand on the Bible last used by the Great Liberator.
 He talked instead, with echoes of Churchill, of the challenges of taking command of a nation beset by what he called ''gathering clouds and raging storms.'' And as a student of past inaugural addresses, he knew what he needed to accomplish. He had to evoke the clarion call for national unity that Lincoln made the centerpiece of his second inaugural in 1865. He had to instill the sense of optimism and patience that resounded in Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first inaugural in 1933, as the nation confronted the worst moments of the Great Depression. And finally, he needed to recall the combination of national inspiration and resoluteness that John F. Kennedy delivered from the same spot, six months before Mr. Obama was born.
 As his voice and image tripped down the Mall, Mr. Obama spoke across many generations stretched to the Washington Monument and beyond. Mixed in the crowd were the last remnants of a World War II generation, the Tuskeegee Airmen among them, for whom Jim Crow was such a daily presence that this day seemed unimaginable.
 There were middle-aged and elderly veterans of the civil rights movement for whom this seemed the crowning achievement of a lifetime of struggles. There were young Americans -- and an overwhelming number of young African-Americans -- with no memory of the civil rights movement or of the Cold War, for whom Mr. Obama was a symbol of a new age of instant messaging, instant communication and integration in every new sense of the word.
 For those three generations, for the veterans who arrived in wheelchairs and the teenagers wearing earphones and tapping on their iPhones, Mr. Obama's speech was far less important than the moment. Many of those who braved the 17 degree chill to swarm onto the mall at daybreak had said they would not believe America would install a black president until they saw and heard him take the oath, even if on a Jumbotron a mile from the event.
 His appearance on the Capitol steps was so historic that the address became larger than its own language, more imbued with meaning than anything he could say.
 And yet what he did say must have come as a bit of a shock to Mr. Bush, who knew his policies had been widely criticized, yet rarely over the past eight year had to sit in silence listening to a speech about how America had taken a tragic detour. 
 It was Mr. Bush, in 2004, who vowed repeatedly that it was his job ''to confront problems, not to pass them on to future presidents and future generations.'' Yet there was Mr. Obama, blaming America's economic peril to an era ''of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.'' He talked of how ''the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet,'' an implicit critique of an administration that went to war but did little to change America's habits. 
 When Mr. Obama turned to foreign policy, he had more implicit criticisms, noting that the Cold War was won ''not just with missiles and tanks,'' but by leaders who understood ''that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.'' It grows instead, he said, ''through its prudent use.''
 It was a message much of the world was waiting to hear. But it was matched with a warning to America's enemies, especially terrorists and terror-sponsoring nations, that ''you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.'' It is that balance -- the promise of an America that hews to its ideals, but achieves victory through silent strength -- that will be the true test of Mr. Obama's administration. It is a test yet to come, but one that begins today.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Tops Forecasts for the Quarter

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. reported a solid 12 percent gain in net income for the fourth quarter, bucking the trend of steep declines for many technology companies amid the economic downturn and surprising Wall Street.
 The company is seen as a bellwether of global technology spending among corporations. Yet its strong performance in the fourth quarter, analysts say, mainly points to the success of its strategy in recent years of tilting toward higher-profit software and services and reducing its reliance on the computer hardware business, which suffers more in down economic cycles.
 I.B.M.'s hardware sales did drop 20 percent in the quarter, but that weakness was more than made up by strong results from the company's far-larger services and software groups. 
 Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.'s chief executive, said in a statement that ''a strong fourth quarter capped an outstanding year.'' Despite the global economic turmoil, he also expressed confidence that the company could reach its earnings goal of at least $9.20 a share for 2009 -- well above Wall Street's recent expectations.
 Some analysts had predicted that I.B.M. would announce as many as 10,000 staff cuts, or 3 percent of the work force, to trim costs in a weak economy. 
 But trimming, Mr. Palmisano wrote in an e-mail message to employees Tuesday, is not the company's current strategy.
 ''Many companies today are curtailing or drastically cutting spending and investment, even in areas that are important to their future,'' Mr. Palmisano wrote. ''We are taking a different approach, not only because we have the financial strength to do so, but because we choose to manage I.B.M. for long-term success.''
 In after-hours trading, after the quarterly results were announced, I.B.M. shares rose 4.14 percent, to $85.37. Shares closed Tuesday at $81.98.
 I.B.M.'s solid profit performance came largely from higher profit margins in the services and software businesses that now account for more than 80 percent of the company's earnings.
 In a difficult economic environment, I.B.M. has apparently been successful in convincing corporations and government agencies that its technology would deliver gains in efficiency. ''Cost-saving offerings continue to sell,'' Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts.
 I.B.M. reported net income of $4.4 billion, a 12 percent gain from a year earlier. Its quarterly earnings were $3.28 a share, well above Wall Street's consensus of $3.03 a share. The company's profits benefited by 16 cents a share from foreign tax credits and the new research tax credit in the United States.
 In the year-ago quarter, I.B.M. reported profits of $4 billion, or $2.80 a share.
 The company reported quarterly revenue of $27 billion, down 6 percent, reflecting the weakness in hardware sales and a stronger dollar. In constant dollars, excluding the impact of currency swings, revenue slipped 1 percent. 
 ''Growth is decelerating for I.B.M., but it has unique advantages that have helped it hold up pretty well over all,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
 I.B.M. has so far sidestepped the worst of the slump in corporate technology spending, which struck after the credit crisis deepened last fall. In the fourth quarter, earnings for the 75 technology companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are expected to drop 19 percent, according to analysts' forecasts compiled by ThomsonReuters. That is a sharp retreat from the Wall Street consensus in early October, when analysts forecast tech sector profits to rise 8 percent in the fourth quarter.
 Last week, the chip maker Intel reported that profit fell 90 percent in the fourth quarter. Other technology suppliers like Seagate Technology, the largest maker of disk drives, and Advanced Micro Devices, a chip maker, have announced salary cuts and layoffs. 
 I.B.M. has held up better than many of its peers in the technology sector because of its global reach and its mix of businesses. About 40 percent of its revenue and 60 percent of its profit come from products and services sold on a subscription basis as licenses or contracts that are renewed every year or so. 
 Such annuity businesses include services that support essential client operations like billing. Most companies do not regard these as discretionary purchases.

HEADLINE: From a Festive Crowd Come Chants and Tears

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH; Reporting was contributed by Corey Kilgannon, Eric Lichtblau, Janie Lorber and Eric Schmitt.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- From overhead and on television, the inaugural throng on Tuesday resembled a singular human blanket sprawling over miles. Up close, what was striking were the tears, visible up and down the Mall and the parade route, dripping from the eyes of adults, children, at all points of the day.
Unlike election night, Inauguration Day is a fait accompli, not meant for uncertainty or surprise. And yet so many in the crowd spoke of their own recognition of shock, an identifiable moment in which Barack Obama's presidency suddenly became real. 
When did it become real?
''When I first heard his voice on a loudspeaker,'' said Tiajuana Lee, a 42-year-old schoolteacher who traveled here with her family from Kentwood, La., and watched the parade on Pennsylvania Avenue. ''There was something very private and almost personal about being here and then hearing that voice.''
For James Peters of San Antonio, the moment was at noon, when Mr. Obama, by law, assumed the office -- a scene he watched on the television of the basement coffee shop at a Courtyard by Marriott hotel about a mile from the Capitol.
For Nina-Marie Nunez, 22, who traveled from Miami, the realization struck much earlier: the moment she woke up on Tuesday.
''I saw the text messages, the phone calls from my friends,'' said Ms. Nunez, on a Metro subway car just before arriving at the parade route. ''It just started immediately, like we all had the recognition at the same time -- that 'This is the day.' ''
On the streets of Washington, the human blanket revealed itself to be more of a quilt of intimate subcultures. ''Amen'' choruses broke out around barroom televisions while the new president spoke. ''Obama'' chants erupted on corners and uniformed black schoolchildren sang ''God Bless America'' en route to the parade, or as close to the parade as they could get.
People often referred to Mr. Obama as ''he'' or ''him,'' as if the identity of the man was so understood that it made uttering his name unnecessary.
The crowd seemed increasingly quiet, even subdued in places, as it moved closer to the Capitol stage. It started out loud from a distance -- packs of suburban teenagers responsively chanting ''Barack'' and ''Obama'' on a Metro subway car at 6 a.m. (more joyous than obnoxious, but most assuredly loud). Then the crowd hushed as it approached Pennsylvania Avenue, the Mall and the Capitol, or maybe people were just cold.
Tracy Tolbert held the hand of her niece Osha tightly as they headed to the Mall from their tour bus that had brought them from Lansing, Mich. Ms. Tolbert spoke of a new kind of kind of unity Mr. Obama would bring to the country, tearing down racial barriers that had defined the notion of diversity strictly in terms of black and white.
''I don't think this is a one-year thing or a two-year thing,'' she said. ''This is an all-the-way thing.''
Seven-year-old Bryana Dorsey of Durham, N.C., got hooked on Mr. Obama's presidential campaign last summer, and when he won, Bryana begged her parents to take the family to Washington for the inauguration.
So by 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday, she and her 2-year-old sister, Bailee, along with her parents -- Renaldo, 39, a contract manager, and Debra, a health insurance analyst -- had staked out a patch on the Mall.
''This gives young African-Americans the belief they can do anything they want,'' said Mr. Dorsey, nestling a swaddled Bailee inside his down jacket as Bryana napped at his feet. ''Coming after Martin Luther King's birthday, this doesn't completely fulfill the dream, but it is one giant step toward that.''
Jordan Broadway, a high school student from Lanham, Md., waiting in line at a security checkpoint on the parade route, compared this experience to what his father must have experienced when he saw the first astronauts land on the moon, only better. ''Because I'm here,'' he said, ''and my dad wasn't actually on the moon.''
And Famious Stephenson, a chemical engineer from Los Angeles, laid down his own historic marker, saying, ''In our lifetimes, this will be our version of the 'I Have a Dream' speech and Woodstock, all in one.''
After two years of a presidential run, Mr. Obama's milestone events -- like his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver and his election-night rally at Grant Park in Chicago -- have acquired telltale characteristics. They are large, multiracial and, for the most part, orderly extravaganzas with Obama-branded paraphernalia being hawked everywhere.
There was a woman selling handmade Obama earrings ($26 a pair on the Mall), an Abraham Lincoln look-alike on stilts selling ''Yes We Did'' buttons ($5), a woman selling Hillary Rodham Clinton T-shirts bearing the message, ''Madame Secretary, 2016,'' among others.
Abdul Jihad, 64, was selling Obama buttons and shivering as passers-by headed to the Capitol a few blocks away.
''They said it was going to be a cold day in hell before we had a black president,'' he said, blowing into his cupped hands. ''Well, here it is. Best day of my life, though. I don't even feel it, I'm so happy.''
Then he resumed chanting his sales pitch. ''Come on people, buy your buttons,'' he said. ''The new president needs help. I'm just doing my best to help the economy.''

HEADLINE: Optimism in Washington, but Pessimism on Wall St.

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
President Obama took office Tuesday urging Americans to choose hope over fear, but on Wall Street, fear was making a comeback.
 Stock markets had one of their worst Inauguration Day losses in more than a century, skidding more than 4 percent. Financial companies plunged more than 15 percent, their biggest one-day drop in nearly two decades, as investors worried that the troubles facing the country's biggest banks might be larger and deeper than anyone had thought.
 Even after record corporate write-downs and a $700 billion bailout to shore up the financial system, banks are still reporting huge losses, lining up for new government lifelines and cutting their profit outlooks. 
 The State Street Corporation, one of the world's largest institutional money managers, reported a 71 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit, sending its share price down 59 percent.
 The bigger economic picture is still a landscape of ''gathering clouds and raging storms,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday. Housing values are falling faster, trade is shrinking and the unemployment rate, now at 7.2 percent, is expected to hit 9 percent or more.
 ''At the end of the year, we saw some light at the end of the tunnel,'' said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Company. ''Unfortunately, we found out that the light at the end of the tunnel was a train.''
 Wall Street opened down and slid steadily lower throughout the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 332.13 points, or 4 percent, to 7,949.09. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 5.28 percent, or 44.90 points, to 805.22. The Nasdaq composite index declined 5.78 percent, or 88.47 points, to 1,440.86. 
 The losses erased all of Wall Street's gains from the start of the year and brought stocks within reach of their lows of Nov. 20.
 Some analysts said they thought that Wall Street might now be headed there again. 
 ''It's ugly,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. ''It's got all the makings of the late November panic.''
 Financial shares went into a free fall on Tuesday. Shares of Citigroup, once the largest American bank, fell 20 percent, or 70 cents, to $2.80 a share, and the bank cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent. Bank of America fell 29 percent, or $2.08, to $5.10. Shares of JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and several other banks also dropped by double digits.
 State Street, which received $2 billion last year from the federal bailout fund, plunged 59 percent, or $21.46, to $14.89. Analysts said that the losses might force State Street to eventually raise more capital or sell itself. 
 The drop in State Street's shares also caused heavy selling in other so-called custody banks like Bank of New York Mellon and Northern Trust. Custody banks perform often mundane tasks for institutional investors, including recordkeeping, tracking performance and lending securities to hedge funds, mutual funds and pensions.
 Analysts and investors are worried that State Street's continued losses on bond funds and other investments could cause credit agencies to lower their ratings, making it more costly for it to finance continuing operations.
 ''The big question facing State Street and other banks is how much capital they need to satisfy investors, rating agencies and regulators,'' said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. ''The government needs to define what the minimum capital ratios should be for banks.'' 
 Regions Financial, which has banks in 16 states, reported a $6.2 billion loss for the fourth quarter. Its shares fell 24 percent, to $4.60.
 Investors took little solace from the latest measures by Britain and Canada to address the deepening recession. The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to 1 percent, after Britain announced on Monday another bailout plan that included a measure to increase the government's stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland to 70 percent.
 ''It's a growing lack of confidence, and almost panic, that's traveling around the world right now,'' said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland & Company. 
 As volatility rises and markets tumble lower, analysts said that Mr. Obama and Congress could not move fast enough to push an $825 billion stimulus package of tax cuts, public works projects and emergency benefits into law.
 ''That fear that's creeping back into Wall Street is spreading to the broader market,'' said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. ''We're going to have to see some real action plans to get us out of this. We're going to have to see the new administration step forward and announce some of these plans that are going to kick-start the market.''
 Crude oil prices settled at $38.74 a barrel, up $2.23 in New York trading. Oil prices have tumbled from their summer highs above $145 a barrel on weakening demand for gasoline and other petroleum products.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 18/32, to 111 30/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.38 percent, from 2.32 percent late Friday.

Senate Should
Go for Geithner
Timothy Geithner, President Barack Obama's pick for Treasury secretary, has two charges to answer during his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Finance Committee, relating to his tax history and his role in financial bailouts to date. Set those against his capabilities and experience -- not to mention the absence of a better candidate -- and he should still get the job.
The tax problem does raise concerns. When working for the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2004, Mr. Geithner failed to pay certain self-employment taxes. This omission was later brought to his attention by the tax authorities. 
The bigger worry is that having paid up for 2003 and 2004, he still neglected to do so for 2001 and 2002. Yet even that isn't quite as it seems. A statute of limitations may have rendered a second payment unnecessary, in strict legal terms. That sounds like weaseling out, especially for a potential Treasury boss -- hence the belated decision to pay. It doesn't make Mr. Geithner look good. But not many people voluntarily pay more tax than they're ordered to.
As for other bailouts, there's no doubt that Mr. Geithner; the outgoing Treasury chief, Hank Paulson; and the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben Bernanke, have engaged in both trial and error with Bear Stearns, the American International Group and others. But Mr. Geithner can't, for instance, yet be tarred with the missteps of the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Moreover, he isn't conflicted by a Wall Street background, or more specifically, by direct connections with Goldman Sachs. Sure, he worked closely with Goldman alumni like Mr. Paulson and Robert Rubin. But the firm isn't part of his identity and livelihood. It is to be hoped that his experience as president of the New York Fed will help him hit the ground running at Treasury, not encourage him to be soft on bankers.
It's also easy to forget that he spoke out against excessive leverage and tackled banks' slapdash management of credit derivatives long before the credit bubble burst. True, he didn't squash the exuberance. But he was up against the powerful financial lobby and the laissez-faire attitude of his bosses at the Fed.
Finally, even Mr. Geithner's critics struggle when it comes to suggesting a credible alternative candidate -- especially someone with a record relevant to today's crisis environment. He may be imperfect, and he owes lawmakers some frank explanations. But he still looks like the best candidate available.
Forced Lending
Governments are thumping the tables for bailed-out banks to crank up lending. President Obama's economic adviser, Larry Summers, says future bailouts will come with lending requirements. Prime Minister Gordon Brown went so far as to include a ''binding'' pledge to get more loans in Britain.
The trouble with all this is that, short of nationalization, such efforts have the potential to create troublesome dual mandates. Banks normally exist to serve their shareholders. Right now, to do so they may be holding back on their lending to repair balance sheets, or they may fear the extent of future losses on existing assets. Or they may simply not like the credit quality of potential borrowers.
Pushing them to lend -- especially by government fiat -- sets up a conflict between their responsibility to their owners and a public policy role. Such a conflict bedeviled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, leading to the deterioration of their capital levels, which contributed to their quasi-nationalization.
One could argue that some initiatives to juice lending -- like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's extension of bank debt insurance to cover long-term bonds backed by consumer loans -- raise no such conflicts because they're voluntary.
But giving a funding advantage to one type of activity is risky, as the implicit guarantee on Fannie and Freddie debt proved. Banks may lower their standards too much when lending against guaranteed assets.
If politicians really want to make banks little more than vehicles to leverage government funds into new loans, they need to get rid of the other mandate and nationalize them. But if the banks are then forced to lend in the interest of public policy, that could make it very difficult for them to bolster asset quality and profitability enough to return to the private sector for future funding. Governments then really run the risk of becoming the lender of first, not last, resort.

HEADLINE: Banned Sport Gains Fans, And Seeks More in Albany

BYLINE: By PETER DUFFY

 BODY:
When Lou Neglia first opened his Brooklyn martial arts academy in 1974, students wanted to learn kung fu, inspired by the television show starring David Carradine. Then karate enjoyed a surge of interest after the release of the 1984 film ''The Karate Kid.'' Now nearly everyone who enters Mr. Neglia's school in Gravesend wants to learn mixed martial arts, the wildly popular staple of cable and pay-per-view television. 
 ''It's the fastest-growing sport in the country,'' said Mr. Neglia, a former world kickboxing champion, in a rapid-fire delivery that he interrupted to take a stream of business calls. ''Boxing is dead.'' 
 Mr. Neglia, 58, teaches the fighting style, which combines punching, grappling and kicking, and he is a regional promoter of the sport. In 2009, he will host five mixed martial arts events at the Tropicana in Atlantic City. Each will feature fighters from New York, where mixed martial arts competitions are banned. 
 It is a prohibition Mr. Neglia finds frustrating. ''It doesn't make any sense,'' he said, adding that the sport ''could be a major boost to the economy.'' Mr. Neglia is among the many people involved in mixed martial arts who are seeking to overturn the ban. 
 The principal force behind the effort is the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the largest mixed martial arts association in the world.
 The association, which is based in Las Vegas and is the major leagues of mixed martial arts, has hired a law firm, Brown, McMahon & Weinraub, to lobby Albany officials. It also hired a consulting firm, the Global Strategy Group, to handle media and political relations. Global Strategy advises Gov. David A. Paterson as well as many Democrats in the State Senate.
 Fighters have also traveled to Albany to meet with legislators, and bloggers have organized petition drives and urged letter-writing campaigns.
 Those hoping to legalize the sport face a difficult challenge. Legislation to legalize mixed martial arts died last June in the Assembly's Committee on Tourism, Arts and Sports Development. Assemblyman Bob Reilly, a Democrat from the Albany area, took the floor to excoriate what he called a ''disgusting'' spectacle.
 ''I spoke for about three or five minutes without any intention of swaying votes,'' Mr. Reilly said in an interview. But his argument that such ''brutal and violent'' events had no place in the state resonated with the majority, which prevented the bill from moving to the floor for consideration by the full Assembly.
 To bolster its case, the Ultimate Fighting Championship released in November an economic impact study claiming that mixed martial arts events would have ''a significant impact on state and local economies by generating tax revenues, creating jobs and boosting tourism industries.''
 ''It's about education, I believe,'' said Marc Ratner, the association's vice president of government and regulatory affairs. ''The sport will never be acceptable to 100 percent of the population. There are people who don't like N.F.L. football. It's personal taste. To say that it's not right for the state to me is very wrong.''
 Mr. Ratner said that the sport had changed considerably since former Gov. George E. Pataki called it ''barbaric'' and pushed for the ban in 1997. It is now legal in 37 of 45 states that have athletic commissions, he said. Most states operate under a set of unified rules of mixed martial arts, first adopted by New Jersey in 2000, which establish weight classes, rounds and more than two dozen types of fouls. Only one serious injury, a broken arm, has occurred in the roughly 800 Ultimate Fighting Championship fights that have been held in Nevada since 2001, Mr. Ratner said.
 But Mr. Reilly, a former running coach at Siena College, points to the unified rules as one of the reasons he continues to support the ban. The sport, for example, allows fist and elbow strikes to the head while an opponent is on the ground. ''I find the rules themselves speak against the sport and make a clear statement that the purpose of the fight is not to demonstrate skills but to damage your opponent,'' he said.
 Supporters respond that the sport attracts gifted athletes who are dedicated to true competition. Fourteen former Olympians and 17 former college wrestling champions have participated in mixed martial arts, the association says. 
 ''They are serious, educated and passionate about what they do,'' said Christian Montes, a professional fighter who operates Ronin Athletics, a mixed martial arts school on West 37th Street in Manhattan. 
 Advocates argue that legalization could marginalize fringe aspects of the sport. Peter Storm, promoter of what he calls the Underground Combat League, has been hosting unregulated matches in isolated locations in the city. ''My shows attract fans of the sport who don't want to go to Jersey and would rather see a fight live rather than on pay-per-view,'' he said. 
 Bryan Vetell, 31, a professional fighter from Briarwood, Queens, said he started his career in underground matches. ''There was no weigh-in, no gloves, no medical reports, no warm-ups, no nothing,'' he said. ''But that's what we had to work with in New York City.''
 Ending unregulated fights is one reason that Melvina Lathan, a veteran boxing judge who was appointed chairwoman of the New York State Athletic Commission in July, supports lifting the ban. ''The safety aspect is a particular concern of mine,'' she said. 
 Legislators in Albany said that a bill on mixed martial arts would probably not come up for a vote until the end of this session, which winds up in June. Members of the Assembly's tourism committee remain divided, said Assemblyman Steve Englebright, a Democrat from Suffolk County. ''I don't think it's shaken its image as human cockfighting, not among all the members of the committee,'' he said. 
 A Senate committee did not consider a similar bill during the last session. A spokeswoman for Governor Paterson said he would not comment on the issue until a bill was passed by both chambers of the Legislature. 
 Carmine Zocchi, a professional fighter and instructor from Middle Village, Queens, said New York should be a showcase for mixed martial arts. ''New York is supposed to be the center of the world, and it has nothing,'' he said. ''I have to travel four hours to fight. Why not have it in Madison Square Garden? Can you imagine how crazy that would be? It would be insane.''

HEADLINE: 'From Slavery to History': Americans Witness a Day of Clarity

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Reporting was contributed by Bernie Becker, Jodi Kantor, Corey Kilgannon, David D. Kirkpatrick, Rita Koganzon, Mark Leibovich, Juliet Macur, Kirsten B. Mitchell, Ariel Sabar, Eric Schmitt, Scott Shane, Ravi Somaiya, Ashley Southall and Ginger Thompson.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Rare are the moments in history when it is clear that history is being made. Tuesday was a day for clarity. In a thousand unseen moments, people knew.
 They knew at the Lincoln Memorial, huddling under blankets at sunrise, as the first soft streaks of pink painted the sky. They knew in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, where roads and bridges into the capital were closed. People simply walked the four miles in. 
 They knew on the steps of Constitution Hall, the stately home of the Daughters of the American Revolution, whose history is stained by its refusal in 1939 to let Marian Anderson sing there. 
 On Tuesday, an elegant woman in a full-length fur stood on those grand white steps, hoisting a handmade sign that shouted: ''From Slavery to History. Obama Baby!'' 
 Tuesday was also a day for poetry, a day for prayers, a day for dancing and celebration -- ''a big party,''' as one parade-goer said, ''for the nation.''
 12:01 a.m.
 Sleepless in Washington
 Less than a minute into Jan. 20, the gym inside the Washington D.C. Jewish Community Center went dark. It was curfew for about 300 out-of-town college students at a pre-inaugural sleepover here.
 The location, a mile north of the White House, was perfect. And with hotel rooms going for $500 a night, the price was right: $35 to $50.
 Chaperones walked the hallways saying, ''Ssh!'' -- to no avail. In one corner, a cellphone snapped open, its light casting an eerie glow over a giddy teenager typing a text message. Isaiah Ramos, 21, of West Hartford, Conn., explained, ''We're too pumped to sleep.''
 5:45 a.m.
 From Divide to Unity
 The Lincoln Memorial was quiet and dark, save for the bright white light that bathed the giant marble likeness of the 16th president. The scaffolding was still up from the concert on Sunday. A dozen or so people silently gazed at the statue. A voice broke the stillness: ''It won't work,'' the man said, pointing a tiny camera at his wife. ''All we get is silhouettes.''
 That was Bill Johnson, 58, of Anaconda, Mont., a bear of a man with a story to tell. Mr. Johnson and his wife, an occupational therapist named Dixie, spent two weeks this summer driving from Divide, Mont., to Unity, N.H., (get the symbolism?) with a homemade ''Obama cart'' in tow. They stopped in every little town they could and promised themselves, long before the November election, to come to Washington on Inauguration Day.
 ''I graduated from high school the day Bob Kennedy died,'' he said, using an unfamiliar nickname for the slain Kennedy brother. ''I've been waiting since then.'' And here, he paused to collect himself. ''You know, for a visionary, for somebody that ...''
 His voice trailed off, and a single tear rolled down the big man's cheek.
 6:30 a.m.
 A Blur of Days
 For some at Busboys and Poets, a bar/bookstore/coffee shop for the hip crowd, it was still Monday night. Others had already made it to Tuesday morning. 
 Arondae Neugusi, a 23-year-old slouched on a couch, was still in Monday. He had been bar hopping until 4 a.m.
 David Fontana, a 31-year-old law professor at George Washington University, was deep into Tuesday, already on his fifth cup of coffee.
 The intersection between one day and the next has lately become a pattern at Busboys and Poets, which has been open nonstop since Friday under a temporary city ordinance that allows such establishments to serve alcohol until 4 a.m. but remain open around the clock. 
 ''Around 4:10, people get a little upset that we stop serving,'' said Ron Jones, a bartender. ''Then you see them putting their heads down on the bar. That's when you start really serving the coffee.''
 6:43 a.m. 
 The Big Chill
 As dawn broke over the Pentagon, the members of the Punahou School Marching Band, from President Obama's alma mater in Honolulu, looked positively frozen.
 With temperatures hovering at about 20 degrees, the Punahou students, in their white uniforms, could see their breath. Lips were blue. Teeth chattered. The white feathers atop their hats danced to the beat of the wind gusts as they waited 20 minutes for a bus bound for a staging area near the White House. 
 ''I want to be here. This is history,'' insisted a shivering Jonathan Yau, 14. 
 A contingent from the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipes and Drums may have been even colder. A bagpiper, Patrick Logan said the men, following tradition, were naked underneath their kilts. ''It's just what we do,'' he said. 
 7:55 a.m. 
 Entrepreneurial Spirit
 Her scarf festooned with her dangling wares, Andrea Duchovnay strolled the aisle aboard a Maryland commuter train from Baltimore to Washington.
 ''Get your Obama earrings!'' she cried.
 Every color, rectangles, ovals and squares, with the now ubiquitous face and with fine print Ms. Duchovnay, of Rutledge, Pa., had to check to recall, ''Nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.''
 ''Obama earrings!'' she called, as the low sun sliced across the windows as the train sped past the usual commuter stops. 
 Of the $10 for each pair, she said, she would take home $3.50. ''I was going to the inauguration anyway, so I figured I should make use of my time.''
 9:40 a.m. 
 A Long Wait for Relief
 ''Yes We Can -- Hold On a Little Bit Longer.'' 
 That was the unspoken rallying cry among those confronting a preinaugural call of nature on Tuesday at the Firehook Bakery, two blocks from the parade route. The ratio of people to lavatory was weighing heavily on the side of great discomfort, despite the presence of hundreds of portable toilets.
 ''I've got to say, I'm a little funny about Porta-potties,'' Tracey Elam declared. This explains why Ms. Elam, 33, a shoe saleswoman from Miami, spent 45 minutes waiting for a restroom, first at McDonald's, then at Firehook. Julani Shaffer, 11, from Atlanta, was waiting, too, jumping up and down in the international I-can't-hold-it-much-longer signal.
 ''You can hold it a little more,'' implored his grandmother, Donna Green. ''Yes, you can.''
 10:50 a.m.
 Inching Toward the Gates
 The gates to the parade route had been open for more than three hours, but Octavia Singleton, a 21-year-old junior at Florida State University, still had not gotten in. 
 ''This is not Jesus,'' Ms. Singleton told her friend Kristin Murray as they inched their way through the line.
 ''This is not Jesus,'' Ms. Murray replied, ''but this is something I may never see again.''
 11:30 a.m. 
 Solidly for Obama
 As Mr. Obama's swearing in drew closer, shouts of ''Obama!'' could be heard in the streets of Anacostia, the most impoverished and predominantly black corner of Washington. At the MLK Community Barbershop Too, five men watched on a small television as a young boy had his hair clippered.
 Did anyone in Anacostia vote for Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, Senator John McCain?
 ''Don't joke about that,'' said Valentine Jackson, 40, the shop owner. ''You disrespect your mama talking like that.''
 11:49 a.m. 
 A Time for Tears
 Angela Bokern lifted both hands to wipe tears from her eyes. 
 ''I was in 9/11,'' said Ms. Bokern, watching the ceremony on television at Elephant andCastle, a pub on the parade route. ''Second tower, 61st floor, Morgan Stanley. This is what I wanted to see Sept. 12. Responsibility. Action, Service. This was the America I wanted to live in. And I am a Republican.''
 Noon 
 Hope at a Homeless Shelter
 At the precise moment that Mr. Obama was supposed to take the oath of office (he ran five minutes late) as the first black president of the United States, some three dozen men gathered around a big-screen television at the Central Union Mission, to celebrate the event over cold-cut sandwiches and orange soda.
 The scene looked nothing like the elated multiracial throngs witnessing the inauguration on the Mall. The group at the mission, one of city's largest homeless shelters, was almost entirely black. Many looked downtrodden, and on the far side of middle age. And the frayed, muddy clothes on their backs were among their only belongings.
 But when Mr. Obama uttered ''So help me God,'' the divide between the Mall and the mission disappeared -- even if only for a few hope-filled minutes. Many of the men jumped up, clapping and pumping their fists into the air. 
 ''I feel a part of this moment, too,'' said Carlton Wilkins, an unemployed electrician and father of three, who stood cheering in the back of the room. ''For a long time now, it has felt like this country forgot about the poor. But today, the president said that helping the least among us is important for the well-being of all of us.''
 12:06 p.m
 To the Promised Land
 For some of Hurricane Katrina's elderly survivors, most of whom saw a lifetime of memories flushed away by that horrific storm, Tuesday marked the long-awaited fulfillment of a divine promise.
 They stood on the penthouse terrace of the J. W. Marriott on Pennsylvania Avenue, the youngest 82, the oldest 100, watching the swearing-in on television. The Stafford Foundation, a Virginia nonprofit, had invited them to come. 
 Dorothea Williams, 86, remembered cleaning houses for white families and driving her eight children to sit-ins and protests.
 ''I made it to the Promised Land,'' Ms. Williams had said the night before, referring to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 ''I Have a Dream'' speech. ''You thought it might happen because the Bible said so, and Martin Luther King said so. And here it is.''
 12:15 p.m. 
 Tonsorial Advice
 Mr. Jackson, the barber, was assessing the hair of the newly sworn-in 44th president. ''The left side don't look like the right one,'' he was telling his wife over the phone as Mr. Obama delivered his Inaugural Address. ''He brought his barber from Chicago, but someone needs to send him an e-mail to tell him to get a better haircut.''
 1 p.m. 
 A Not-So-Fond Farewell
 For the most part, Tuesday's was a polite crowd. But some people had trouble minding their manners.
 ''We're here to see Bush leave; we're going to give him the Jersey wave,'' said James Moore, as he watched the former president depart Washington by helicopter. ''If you're from New York, it's the same as the Bronx cheer.''
 Dozens of people held up cameras to capture a moment that signaled the end of the Bush era. 
 As the copter lifted off, there was a roar from the crowd, along with some one-fingered salutes.
 2:18 p.m. 
 Street Food Goes Upscale
 ''Hot chocolate! Hot cider! Muffins!''
 One of Washington's best-known chefs, Todd Gray, was hawking his wares on the sidewalk, outside his restaurant two blocks north of the White House. His upscale eatery, Equinox, was selling hot drinks and pastries out of a tent.
 4:05 p.m. 
 A Glimpse to Remember
 Belinda Mitchell, 48, a nursing assistant from Trenton, was just two rows of spectators back from the barricades when Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, stepped out of the heavily armored presidential limousine and strolled past on their way to the White House.
 ''He was waving,'' Ms. Mitchell said, ''and he had that gorgeous smile.''
 5:13 p.m. 
 A Slow Day at the Salon
 On an ordinary Inauguration Day, the exclusive George Salon at the Four Seasons is the place in town to primp for the nighttime balls. But traffic was light Tuesday. Serhot Azturk, the manager, said many had canceled their appointments, either because they had gotten stuck in the huge crowds, or had simply decided to start their celebrations early. 
 Mr. Azturk did not complain. ''People were so into the inauguration,'' he said. ''It was like the whole world stopped to watch.'' 
 8:40 p.m.
 From Africa to Washington
 If there was any doubt that the Obama inauguration was not a uniquely American affair, it was erased at the ball thrown by African embassies.
 Sekufele M. Lewanika was there, looking every inch the African royal, with a black and red tribal fabric draped elegantly over his tuxedo. His father and grandfathers were the kings of Barotseland, before it was absorbed into modern-day Zambia.
 Today, Mr. Lewanika is the principal of a middle school in Natchez, Miss.; his sister is the Zambian ambassador. 
 The stars of the party, though, were the members of Mr. Obama's extended Kenyan family -- aunts and uncles and cousins, the women in blue and gold tribal dresses and shell necklaces. 
 ''Because of the love we have for him, we had to make ourselves come,'' said Margaret Obama, an Anglican pastor in Nairobi, who is married to a distant uncle of the new president. 
 But though they had traveled far, a distant uncle, Ezra Obama, said the relatives were not certain they would see their famous kin.
 After all, Barack Obama has new responsibilities now. Tuesday may have been for celebrating. On Wednesday, the work begins.

HEADLINE: Rejecting Bush Era, Reclaiming Older Values

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Barack Obama's Inaugural Address on Tuesday was a stark repudiation of the era of George W. Bush and the ideological certainties that surrounded it, wrapped in his pledge to drive the United States into ''a new age'' by reclaiming the values of an older one.
It was a delicate task, with Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney sitting feet from him as Mr. Obama, only minutes into his term as president, described the false turns and the roads not taken.
To read his words literally, Mr. Obama blamed no one other than the country itself, critiquing ''our collective failure to make hard choices'' and a willingness to suspend national ideals ''for expedience's sake'' -- a clear reference to the cascade of decisions ranging from interrogation policies to wiretapping to the invasion of Iraq. 
Yet not since 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt called for a ''restoration'' of American ethics and ''action, and action now'' as Herbert Hoover sat and seethed, has a new president so publicly rejected the essence of his predecessor's path.
When Mr. Obama looked forward, however, he was far less specific about how he would combine his lofty vision and his passion for pragmatism into urgently needed solutions.
Mr. Obama spoke eloquently of the need to ''restore science to its rightful place'' and to ''harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.'' But he never acknowledged that his agenda would eventually have to be reconciled with towering budget deficits or spelled out what ''unpleasant decisions'' he would be willing to make in the service of a renewed America.
At times, Mr. Obama seemed to chastise the nation, quoting Scripture to caution that ''the time has come to set aside childish things.'' It seemed a call to end an age of overconsumption and the presumption that America had a right to lead the world, a right that he reminded ''must be earned.''
The chiding, if most resonant of the last eight years, also harked back to an argument he advanced early in his run for the White House: that the nation had been ill-served by the social, cultural and political divisions of the generation that included Bill Clinton as well as Mr. Bush.
Every time Mr. Obama urged Americans to ''choose our better history,'' to reject a ''false choice'' between safety and American ideals and to recognize that American military power does not ''entitle us to do as we please,'' he was clearly signaling a commitment to remake America's approach to the world and to embrace pragmatism, not just as a governing strategy but also as a basic value.
It was, in many ways, exactly what one might have expected from a man who propelled himself to the highest office in the land by denouncing how an excess of ideological zeal had taken the nation on a disastrous detour. But what was surprising about the speech was how much he dwelled on the choices America faces, rather than the momentousness of his ascension to the presidency.
Following the course Mr. Obama set during his campaign, he barely mentioned his race. He did not need to. The surroundings said it all as he stood on the steps of a Capitol built by the hands of slaves, and as he placed his own hand on the Bible last used by Abraham Lincoln.
Mr. Obama talked, with echoes of Churchill, of the challenges of taking command of a nation beset by what he called ''gathering clouds and raging storms.'' As a student of past Inaugural Addresses, he knew what he needed to accomplish. He had to evoke the clarion call for national unity that Lincoln made the centerpiece of his second Inaugural Address, in 1865, married with Franklin Roosevelt's warning that the market had been allowed to go haywire thanks to the ''stubbornness'' and ''incompetence'' of business leaders. And he needed to recall the combination of national inspiration and resoluteness against new enemies that John F. Kennedy delivered in his Inaugural Address, just over six months before Mr. Obama was born.
As his voice and image resonated down the Mall, Mr. Obama spoke across many generations stretching to the Washington Monument and beyond.
Mixed in the crowd were the last remnants of the World War II generation, led by the all-black Tuskegee Airmen for whom Jim Crow was such a daily presence that the arrival of this day seemed unimaginable.
There were middle-aged veterans of the civil rights movement for whom this seemed the crowning achievement of a lifetime of struggles. And there were young Americans -- and an overwhelming number of young African-Americans -- with no memory of the civil rights movement or of the cold war, for whom Mr. Obama was a symbol of an age of instant messaging, constant networking and integration in every new meaning of the word.
For those three generations, for the veterans who arrived in wheelchairs and the teenagers wearing earphones and tapping on their iPhones, Mr. Obama's speech was far less important than the moment itself. Many of those who braved the 17 degree chill to swarm onto the Mall at daybreak had said they would not believe America would install a black president until they witnessed him taking the oath of office, even if they had to see it on a Jumbotron a mile from the event.
By the time Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered that oath (and stumbling on a few of the words, leading the new president to do the same), Mr. Obama's ascendance was so historic that the address became larger than its own language, more imbued with meaning than anything he could say.
And yet what he did say must have come as a bit of a shock to Mr. Bush. No stranger to criticism, over the past eight years he had rarely been forced to sit in silence listening to a speech about how America had gone off the rails on his watch.
Mr. Obama's recitation of how much had gone wrong was particularly striking to anyone who had followed Mr. Bush around the country, especially during the re-election campaign of 2004, when he said it was his job ''to confront problems, not to pass them on to future presidents and future generations.''
Yet Mr. Obama blamed America's economic peril on an era ''of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some,'' and talked of how ''the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.'' It was an explicit critique of an administration that went to war in the Middle East but rejected the shared sacrifice of conservation, and reluctantly embraced the scientific evidence around global warming.
When Mr. Obama turned to foreign policy, he had a more difficult task: to signal to the world that America's approach would change without appearing to acknowledge that America's military was dangerously overstretched or that its will for victory would wane after Mr. Bush departed for Texas.
Mr. Obama never rose to the heights of Kennedy's ''pay any price, bear any burden.'' Instead, he harked back to the concept that gave birth to the Peace Corps, noting that the cold war was won ''not just with missiles and tanks,'' but by leaders who understood ''that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.''
The new president skirted past the questions of how he would remake American detention policy, how he would set the rules for interrogation and how he would engage Iran and North Korea, beyond promising to ''extend a hand'' to those willing ''to unclench your fist.'' He simply promised to strike the balance differently, as America tries to hew to its ideals while pursuing a strategy of silent strength.
Whether he can execute that change is a test that begins Wednesday morning.

HEADLINE: Abroad, Many Hope for 'New Chapter'

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN and ALAN COWELL; Reporting was contributed by Steven Erlanger from Jerusalem, Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong, Victor Homola from Berlin, Pam Kent from London, Alissa J. Rubin from Baghdad, an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Basra, Marc Lacey from Mexico City, Nicholas Kulish from Berlin, Rachel Donadio from Rome, Simon Romero from Caracas, Venezuela, Robert F. Worth from Beirut, Lebanon, and Jeffrey Gettleman from Nairobi, Kenya.

 BODY:
President Barack Obama reached out to the world in his inaugural address on Tuesday, pledging to help the people of poor nations make their farms flourish and clean waters flow, and promising that America would ''play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.'' 
 The world listened with a mixture of optimism and caution. From Kenya to London, millions gathered around television screens in public squares, cafes and living rooms to watch Mr. Obama accept the mantle of American leadership, and with it, take on the hopes of a world battered by war and recession. 
 While there was jubilation that a difficult era, marked most profoundly by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the wars that followed, might be drawing to a close, there was also skepticism that one man, no matter his aspirations, would be able to bring about such sweeping change. 
 In Mexico City, thousands gathered to watch Mr. Obama in offices, restaurants and on the streets. Some people were so moved they wiped tears from their eyes. Car horns sounded as Mr. Obama finished his address, although in such a traffic-clogged capital it was impossible to know whether the sounds were celebratory or more functional in nature.
 ''He was speaking to the whole world,'' said Rodolfo Sosa-Garcia, an economist who tuned into the speech from his office in Mexico City. ''Obama represents hope not just for America but for the world.''
 But others felt Mr. Obama had not said enough about how America would change its global approach under his leadership. ''For me, as a Mexican, as a foreigner, it lacked a message,'' Manuel Barberena, the president of a Mexico City market research firm, said of the speech. 
 The symbolic significance of an African-American being elected to the nation's highest office resonated widely, especially with those whose lives have been marked by oppression. In Puerto Tejada, a violence-wracked town of 45,000 in Colombia, sugarcane-cutting descendants of African slaves were given Tuesday off to watch Barack Obama's inauguration on a giant TV screen, and celebrated with dancing and singing, The Associated Press reported.
 ''The people here see themselves represented in Obama,'' Mayor Elver Montano said. ''President Barack Obama could us help a lot, promote dialogue, give resources and money to help improve people's livelihood.''
 In Caracas, Venezuela, reactions to the inauguration included a range of emotions. ''I felt immense envy,'' said Daria Carmona, 60, a secretary at a school products company. 
 Why envy?
 ''Envy,'' said Ms. Carmona, pondering the word for a few seconds, ''because we do not have a president with the capability of leaving power in such democratic fashion.'' 
 Indeed, even as Mr. Obama was being sworn in, the police were using tear gas in Caracas to disperse antigovernment protests on Tuesday. President Hugo Chavez used the transition in Washington as an opportunity for some parting barbs against Mr. Bush. ''He is the most repudiated president in his own country and the world,'' said Mr. Chavez while campaigning in the eastern state of Anzoategui. But he also sounded more conciliatory at times on Tuesday. 
 ''From here we salute the people of the United States,'' said Mr. Chavez, emphasizing that he hoped Mr. Obama's presidency would ''mark a change in the relations of the United States with the countries of the third world.''
 Messages from other world leaders -- most of them congratulatory -- poured in. 
 In Britain, Prime Minister Gordon Brown hailed Mr. Obama's ascendance as a ''new chapter in both American history and the world's history.'' In Paris, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he had sent a message to President Obama saying: ''We are eager for him to get to work so that with him we can change the world.''
 But in Tehran, where many newspapers did not judge the inauguration to be front page news Tuesday, Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said he would await the ''practical policies'' of Mr. Obama before passing judgment on his position on Iran, the official Irna news agency reported.
 In Europe and elsewhere around the world, celebrations began hours before the inauguration. In Paris, a party at the ornate Hotel de Ville on the banks of the River Seine was followed by less formal merriment around the city. At Queen, one of the city's best-known gay clubs, live television footage of the new president's triumphant parade was shown to a thumping back-drop of music by Grover Washington Jr. British cities, including Belfast, Liverpool, Leeds and London, also offered big-screen viewings of the inauguration.
 In the stately stone villa that hosts the German-American Center in the historic university town of Heidelberg, Germany, projection screens and televisions were set up on three floors and rock bands played for a mix of young Germans and Americans.
 Matthias Weyland, 29, who works for an environmental organization, said he felt a bit overwhelmed after watching President Obama's address. ''We Germans are not used to things being quite so emotional,'' Mr. Weyland said. ''Generally I don't have much hope for party politics, but this time I'll wait and see. I found it very good in the speech that he included so many groups, not just different nations, poor nations, but within society, different religions -- Muslims, for instance.''
 In Tottenham, a multiethnic neighborhood in north London, Juliet Alexander, the organizer of an inauguration celebration in an arts center, said the significance of the American election lay in the belief that ''he is not just a black president, he is a politically educated man who has touched the imaginations of people all around the world.''
 ''He represents a movement to people -- and we are happy to celebrate that,'' she said.
 While some of the events in Europe were organized by groups representing American Democrats living abroad, they drew in many others who saw the change of leadership in Washington as bearing directly on their own lives and hopes.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped the Obama era would be built on a broad international agreement that ''no single country can solve the problems of the world,'' a hope built in part on the perceived unilateralism and bellicosity of the Bush years.
 But there was a sense, too, that Mr. Obama would seek changes from America's allies in handling international problems, like the war in Afghanistan, where European countries are under American pressure to increase their troop levels in the American-led coalition fighting the resurgent Taliban. 
 ''I think there will be big change, but there will also be demands, and Europeans are going to have to say: 'Yes, we can','' David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, told BBC television.
 That sentiment was echoed by Pope Benedict XVI, who sent a telegram to Mr. Obama saying: ''At a time when so many of our brothers and sisters throughout the world yearn for liberation from the scourge of poverty, hunger and violence, I pray that you will be confirmed in your resolve to promote understanding, cooperation and peace among the nations, so that all may share in the banquet of life, which God wills to set for the whole human family.''
 Kenya, the birthplace of Mr. Obama's father, was swept by Obamamania on Tuesday. Kenyans threw parties, held feasts and packed around television sets to celebrate the ushering in of a man Kenya considers one of its own.
 In Kisumu, in western Kenya, thousands of people gathered in the town's main park to watch the new president be sworn in on movie theater-size screens. There was singing and dancing, vendors hawking Obama calendars and even an Obama imitation contest with Kenyans vying in heavily accented English to do their best to sound like the new president.
 In Kogelo, Obama's ancestral village, cows and chickens were slaughtered and people beat on goatskin drums. Men in black and white colobus monkey wigs hollered the new president's name. From now on, village elders declared, every Jan. 20 will be Barack Obama Day.
 In Nairobi, Kenya's capital, some of the nicest hotels in town were booked for Obama parties. One banquet room was decorated with Kenyan and American flags and cloth printed with Obama's face and Kiswahili sayings. The moment President Obama completed his oath of office, the guests jumped to their feet and sang out in unison, ''Thank God!''
 In Hong Kong, the inauguration took place after 1 a.m. and, amid the economic gloom, some expressed skepticism about the likely impact of a new American president.
 ''I am less than convinced the Obama effect will be so quick or so significant,'' said David Eldon, the former chairman of Asia and Pacific operations at the bank HSBC.
 But in Indonesia, Mr. Obama's boyhood home, the interest was keener. ''We feel that he is an inspiring figure,'' said Enda Nasution, a prominent pro-Obama blogger, ''so we hope, without being naive, that the world will change,'' Reuters reported.
 In the Middle East, Israel hastened to pull its troops out of Gaza by the inauguration. The day was hailed by President Shimon Peres of Israel as ''a great day not only for the United States of America, but for the entire world.''
 ''I pray here in Jerusalem that Barack Obama will be a great president of the United States. If he will be a great president of the United States, he will serve all humankind, all nations and all persons,'' he said.
 But there has been concern in Israel that President Obama will prove a more demanding diplomatic partner than President Bush, a theme underscored by Mr. Obama's inaugural message to the Muslim world.
 ''To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect,'' Mr. Obama said.
 In Lebanon, many who watched the inaugural speech seemed excited by it, and said they felt the new president represented a great improvement over Mr. Bush. Some said Mr. Obama was signaling a new openness to the Muslim world. But they were all deeply skeptical about his ability to change the basic direction of American policy, especially regarding the Israel-Palestinian dispute.
 For many, the three-week war in Gaza, which caused tremendous anger throughout the Arab and Muslim world, overshadowed the inauguration.
 Dana Moukhallati, 23, watched the speech with a crowd of other young people at the Captain's Cabin, a smoky bar in west Beirut. ''I think it's good if he's true to his word,'' she said. ''Things can't get any worse. It was a charismatic speech. But most people in Lebanon are not too excited. They've heard this kind of thing before, and they want action.''

HEADLINE: Bank Crisis Deepens

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Stephen Labaton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON --Even before they have settled into their new jobs, President Obama's economic team faces an acute crisis in the nation's banking system that has no easy answers and that they are not yet prepared to address.
The president's advisers watched most banking shares fall sharply on Tuesday, reinforcing what Obama officials have known for weeks: that their most urgent financial problem is an immense new wave of losses at banks and other lending institutions that threatens to further cripple their ability to resume normal lending.
But when Timothy F. Geithner, the president's nominee to be the Treasury secretary, appears before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday for his confirmation hearing, he is not expected to have a detailed plan ready.
While Mr. Obama's top advisers view the black hole in bank balance sheets as one of their most pressing problems, they cautioned that they would not be pressured into announcing a plan before they had carefully thought through all the options. Instead, they are scrutinizing an array of solutions, each of which has pitfalls and poses its own risks and dangers. 
Obama officials are almost certain to intertwine help to the banks with Mr. Obama's goal of providing up to $100 billion for reducing home foreclosures. The two goals are not necessarily in conflict. Subsidizing loan modifications so that people can keep their homes could relieve banks of the steep losses associated with foreclosures and also prevent further erosions in bank asset values by putting a floor under home prices. ''Mortgages are still the underlying problem, and I really think we need to address that problem head-on,'' said Christopher Mayer, vice dean at the Columbia University School of Business. ''The foreclosure stuff is just trying not to have even bigger losses in mortgages than we have so far.''
Administration officials said they were determined not to repeat the mistakes of former President George W. Bush's Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who sold Congress on an elaborate strategy for shoring up banks and then shifted to an entirely different approach before he even got started.
Industry analysts said the Obama administration's challenge would be to help banks get rid of severely devalued mortgage assets on their balance sheets -- from nonperforming subprime mortgages to pools of mortgages and derivatives -- without wasting taxpayer money or rewarding banks for bad practices.
If policy makers were even remotely honest, analysts said, they would force banks to take huge write-downs and insist on a high price in return for taking bailout money. For practical purposes, that could mean nationalization or partial nationalization for many banks.
One main difference between the options under consideration is how transparent the government would be about the ultimate costs to taxpayers and whether banks would be required to reveal the true magnitude of their likely losses.
The ultimate taxpayer cost could be very high. A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that the taxpayer costs are highest when the government's asset purchases involve opaque transactions that are difficult to understand.
When Mr. Paulson first pleaded with Congress to approve the $700 billion bailout program, known officially as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, he argued that the government might eventually recoup its entire investment because it would be able to resell its holdings when financial markets recovered.
But the Congressional Budget Office, analyzing the program's $247 billion in bailout payments through December, estimated that taxpayers would end up absorbing $64 billion or 26 percent of that bill.
The nonpartisan Congressional agency estimated that taxpayers had already lost 53 percent of the government's $40 billion investment in American International Group, the giant insurance company that had been insuring tens of billions of dollars in junk mortgage-backed securities against default. As part of the rescue, the government helped A.I.G. buy back billions in mortgage securities that it had insured.
As the new Obama economic team pondered a new approach, one alternative, though an unlikely one, would be to revive Mr. Paulson's original idea of buying troubled assets through an auction process. The potential virtue of auctions is that they could get closer to establishing a true market value for the assets.
But the drawback is that many of the securities are so arcane and complex that they are unlikely to generate the volume of bidding needed to establish a real market price.
A second approach, which Mr. Paulson had already used in a second round of bailouts for Citigroup and Bank of America, is to ''ring-fence'' the bad assets by providing federal guarantees against losses, and separating the assets from the rest of a bank's balance sheet.
The virtue of that approach is that it costs relatively little money up front, because the government is essentially providing insurance coverage.
The danger is that the potential cost to taxpayers of federal guarantees can be even less transparent than other approaches. As a result, the final costs to taxpayers could be huge. Indeed, the guarantees would put the government in the same business that led to immense losses from mortgage-backed securities: credit-default swaps.
In its recent report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the $20 billion that the Treasury spent in November to guarantee $306 billion of toxic assets by Citigroup will cost taxpayers $5 billion -- a 26 percent subsidy.
William Seidman, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who was closely involved with the bailout of savings-and-loan institutions in the 1990s, said the government should simply take control of the banks it tries to rescue. ''When we did things like this, we took the banks over,'' Mr. Seidman. ''This is a huge, undeserved gift to the present shareholders.''
One big difference between today and the 1990s is that the government back then was seizing entire failed institutions. On paper, at least, the banks in trouble today are still viable.
That leaves the third and increasingly talked-about approach -- have the government buy up the toxic assets and put them into a government-financed ''bad bank'' or an ''aggregator bank.''
The immediate virtue of the bad bank is that the remaining ''good bank'' would have a clean balance sheet, unburdened by the uncertainty of future losses from bad loans and securities.
Richard Berner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, described the ''bad bank'' strategy as the ''least bad'' of available options. The main advantage, Mr. Berner said, was that the government would have to decide how much it was willing to pay for the toxic assets. In turn, that would make it easier for the public to figure out whether the government was overpaying.
Banks may not want that kind of openness, because accurately valuing the toxic assets could force many to book big losses, admit their insolvency and shut down.

HEADLINE: President Obama

 BODY:
There was no shortage of powerful imagery on Barack Obama's Inauguration Day, starting with the confident man who defied all political conventions -- that he was too young, too inexperienced, too black or not black enough -- to stand on the steps of the Capitol and take the oath of office in a city and a country that are still racially divided in many shameful ways. 
 And there was the crowd that for a day, and we hope much longer, defied those divisions. By the hundreds of thousands they came from every part of a nation that has rarely been in such peril and yet is so optimistic about its new leader. 
 In his Inaugural Address, President Obama gave them the clarity and the respect for which all Americans have hungered. In about 20 minutes, he swept away eight years of President George Bush's false choices and failed policies and promised to recommit to America's most cherished ideals. 
 With Mr. Bush looking on (and we'd like to think feeling some remorse), President Obama declared: ''On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn- out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.''
 The speech was not programmatic, nor was it filled with as much soaring language as F.D.R.'s first Inaugural Address or John Kennedy's only one. But it left no doubt how Mr. Obama sees the nation's problems and how he intends to fix them and, unlike Mr. Bush, the necessary sacrifices he will ask of all Americans. 
 The American story ''has not been the path for the faint-hearted, for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame,'' he said.
 Just as he reshaped the Democratic Party to win its nomination, and the American electorate to defeat John McCain, Mr. Obama said he intended to reshape government so it will truly serve its citizens. 
 ''The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works, whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama was unsparing in condemning the failed ideology of uncontrolled markets. He said the current economic crisis showed how ''without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control'' and that the nation has to extend the reach of prosperity to ''every willing heart, not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.''
 Mr. Obama also did not shrink from the early criticism of his ambitious economic recovery plan. Rather, he said the ''state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift,'' to build roads and bridges and electrical power and digital networks, to transform schools, and ''harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.''
 After more than seven years of Mr. Bush's using fear and xenophobia to justify a disastrous and unnecessary war, and undermine the most fundamental American rights, it was exhilarating to hear Mr. Obama reject ''as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.'' 
 Instead of Mr. Bush's unilateralism, Mr. Obama said the United States is ''ready to lead once more,'' by making itself a ''friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity.'' He said ''our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.'' Mr. Obama told the Muslim world that he wants ''a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.''
 Mr. Obama was steely toward those ''who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents.'' He warned them that ''our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.'' But where Mr. Bush painted this as an epochal, almost biblical battle between America and those who hate us and ''who hate freedom,'' Mr. Obama also offered to ''extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.''
 As the day continued with a parade and parties and balls, the image that stayed with us was the way the 44th president managed to embrace the symbolism and rise above it. It filled us with hope that with Mr. Obama's help, this battered nation will be able to draw together and mend itself.

HEADLINE: Companies Toss Their Brands In the Mixed Martial Arts Ring

BYLINE: By R.M. SCHNEIDERMAN

 BODY:
AT the end of a mixed martial arts bout, the fighters stand in the center of the cage, often donning a T-shirt given to them by their sponsors, as they await the referee's official decision.
But when the referee raised Rashad Evans's hand after a victory last September, Mr. Evans was not wearing a shirt bearing the logo of one of the sport's niche apparel brands like Sprawl or Tapout. Instead, on his shirt appeared a mug shot of Bill Gates, taken after the future billionaire was arrested for a traffic violation in 1977.
Mr. Evans, who became the light heavyweight champion of the Ultimate Fighting Championship last month, said he wore the shirt as part of a cross-promotional partnership with Microsoft. He has also appeared in a recent Windows commercial that is running in the United States, Britain and Japan. 
Mixed martial arts has long been considered too risky for corporate America. But with the success of the U.F.C., the sport's premier brand, mainstream advertisers have begun dabbling in sponsorship deals with the U.F.C. and its fighters.
''Rashad was chosen because he helped illustrate the point of the campaign -- that Windows users represent a broad cross section of society,'' a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an e-mail message.
With the economy sputtering, mixed martial arts fighters are unlikely to sign the type of endorsement deals seen by their counterparts in more established sports. Yet marketers, agents and others associated with the business of the sport say companies are beginning to realize that mixed martial arts has the potential to court a young male audience.
It was not always the case. When Frank Fertitta III, chief executive of Station Casinos, and his brother Lorenzo, the vice chairman, bought the U.F.C. for $2 million in 2001, it was considered little more than a much-maligned spectacle. And an unprofitable and violent one at that.
Slowly, however, the U.F.C. started repairing the sport's image, working with state athletic commissions, which increasingly began regulating mixed martial arts and establishing a unified set of rules.
The real turning point came in 2005 with the creation of ''The Ultimate Fighter,'' a reality television show on Viacom's Spike TV. Since its inception, an average of 1.9 million viewers have watched the show each week. It has given rise to stars like Mr. Evans and led to other U.F.C. programs on Spike.
Since then, mixed martial arts has had increased coverage from mainstream media outlets. That is in part because of the sport's live prime-time debut last May on network television, which was broadcast on CBS and organized by Elite XC, a now-defunct mixed martial arts company.
It is also in part because of the continued success of the U.F.C., which has begun a major international expansion effort and has continued to generate a mass audience.
Dave Meltzer, the editor of The Wrestling Observer, a trade publication that covers wrestling and mixed martial arts, said that in 2008, the U.F.C. very likely posted the biggest per-year revenue numbers in the history of pay per view television.
Over the last year and a half, corporate America has taken notice. The U.F.C., for example, has signed advertising deals with sponsors like Harley-Davidson, Bud Light, Burger King and, most recently, Bacardi.
''I think the door has opened,'' said Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director of Baker Street Partners, a San Francisco-based advertising and marketing agency. ''A lot of mainstream advertisers who were pooh-poohing it are looking at it seriously in their marketing mix.''
A major reason is that the U.F.C. tends to attract young men ages 18 to 34, a group sought by advertisers.
''The growth of mixed martial arts is an opportunity to extend the brand to younger consumers,'' said Adam Geisler, the president of Everlast, the athletic wear company.
Last fall, Everlast began a major push into mixed martial arts clothing and equipment. The company is also working with Crunch gyms to promote a mixed martial arts fitness workout. The face of both campaigns is Randy Couture, the former U.F.C. heavyweight and light heavyweight champion and one of the sport's biggest stars.
Nike also has dabbled in mixed martial arts, pairing LaDainian Tomlinson, a star running back for the San Diego Chargers, with Kimbo Slice, a mixed martial arts fighter and popular YouTube personality, in an Internet training video.
''We want to inspire athletes to train,'' Derek Kent, the company's United States media relations director, said by e-mail. ''Obviously, M.M.A. athletes are some of the best conditioned in the world, so it made sense to include Kimbo.''
Now that Mr. Evans holds the light heavyweight title, his manager, Jervis Cole, expects him to earn $700,000 to several million dollars in total endorsements in 2009. But mixed martial arts has a long way to go before its top fighters like Brock Lesnar, a champion in the heavyweight division, make the type of endorsement dollars that a star like Tiger Woods does.
Mr. Woods, according to an analysis by Sports Illustrated magazine, made $105 million from endorsements in 2007.
''Those major endorsement deals are not there yet for M.M.A. athletes,'' said Shari Spencer, an agent who represents Georges St. Pierre, the U.F.C. welterweight champion.
In part, the state of the economy may be holding them back.
''Once the economy turns around, I think we can possibly see an onslaught of support,'' said Rashaun Smith, the vice president for marketing of Lugz, a clothing company.
Last fall, Mr. Smith began an advertising campaign using two U.F.C. fighters, Lyoto Machida and Houston Alexander. The company also has sponsorship deals with Quinton Jackson, known as Rampage, as well as Mr. Evans.
Three years ago the U.F.C. ''couldn't even get on television,'' Mr. Meltzer, the Wrestling Observer editor, said. ''The negative stigmas are rapidly going away.''

HEADLINE: The Address: 'All This We Will Do'

 BODY:
Following is President Obama's Inaugural Address on Tuesday, as recorded by the Federal News Service:
 My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
 Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.
 Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents. 
 So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.
 That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly. Our schools fail too many. And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
 These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land, a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.
 Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious, and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met. 
 On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
 On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.
 We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.
 'That noble idea'
 The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit, to choose our better history, to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness. 
 In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things -- some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor -- who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
 For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.
 For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West, endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
 For us, they fought and died in places like Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe Sanh.
 Time and again, these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions, greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
 This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions, that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America. 
 For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do.
 'The ground has shifted'
 Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
 What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.
 Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.
 Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched. But this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control; that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity, on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart, not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good. 
 As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our founding fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. 
 And so, to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born, know that America is a friend of each nation, and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity. And that we are ready to lead once more. 
 Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use. Our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
 We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we'll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet.
 We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense. And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. 
 For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth.
 And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.
 To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. 
 To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow, to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders, nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.
 For the world has changed, and we must change with it.
 As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
 For as much as government can do, and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
 'Giving our all'
 Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded, then, is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility: a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.
 This is the price and the promise of citizenship.
 This is the source of our confidence, the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.
 This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed, why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent Mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. 
 So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:
 ''Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.''
 America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter, and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.
 Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Irish Developer Found Dead in His Home

BYLINE: By EAMON QUINN

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
Patrick Rocca, scion of an Irish business family and part of a generation of ''Celtic Tiger Cubs'' whose fortunes have waned in the economic downturn, was found dead in his home in suburban Dublin, the police said Wednesday. Police said Mr. Rocca had apparently taken his own life. 
 Mr. Rocca, 42, reportedly faced financial problems from his real estate investments in Britain and Ireland as their decade-long property booms ended after borrowing costs rose and demand for real estate cooled.
 He was found Monday morning in his home at Castleknock, a prosperous area outside Dublin, said a police spokeswoman who declined to be identified because of department policy. She called the death ''a personal tragedy'' and said that it would not be investigated.
 The global recession has taken other steep personal tolls in recent weeks. The patriarch of the German company HeidelbergCement recently committed suicide after speculation in volatile Volkswagen shares pushed his sprawling business empire to the edge of ruin.
 The French co-founder of Access International Advisors, a fund that had lost money it had invested with the disgraced Bernard L. Madoff, also took his life. An executive at a failed mortgage lender in Maryland and a distraught stock speculator in India who suffered steep losses in the market have also ended their lives.
 Mr. Rocca and others like him rode Ireland's property boom from the mid-1990s -- when the country drew the moniker Celtic Tiger -- until 2006, when prices began to fall. Last week, Dublin nationalized Anglo Irish Bank, whose fortunes also tracked the declining real estate-linked Irish economy. 
 Mr. Rocca had a fortune estimated at $:462.9 million, or $647 million, in 2007, according to The Telegraph in Britain. But by the end of 2007, the assets of his main property vehicle, Accorp Properties, were valued at 13.7 million euros, or $18 million, according to documents lodged at the Companies Registration Office, Bloomberg News reported. The company owed 18.1 million euros to creditors that was due within a year, the documents show. Rocca owned other buildings in Dublin through separate Irish-registered companies.
 His sister, Michelle, a former Miss Ireland, is the partner of the Irish singer Van Morrison.
 Mr. Rocca's grandfather immigrated to Ireland from Italy in the 1920s to help rebuild the Four Courts, the 18th-century criminal courts complex in Dublin. His father, also named Patrick, founded a well-known ceramic kitchen and floor-tile retail business in Ireland, Rocca Tiles, in the mid-1970s.
 The younger Rocca, who helped run the retail chain until the family sold its majority stake about nine years ago, used the proceeds to build a property business.
 He purchased office buildings near London Gatwick Airport and in central London at the height of the property boom. In 2005, Mr. Rocca made his biggest purchase, a retail distribution center in Bedford, Britain, belonging to Argos, the British retail group, for 100 million euros.

HEADLINE: Fund Runs Dry As Joblessness Grows in State

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York State's unemployment insurance system, besieged by claims from laid-off workers, ran out of money on the first business day of the year and is borrowing daily from the federal government to bridge a fast-growing and potentially huge deficit, state labor officials say.
Despite paying lower benefits to its jobless residents than other Northeastern states, the state's unemployment fund has been borrowing about $90 million a week from the federal unemployment trust fund, state officials said. The deficit has already reached $212 million and is expected to exceed $2.5 billion by the end of 2010, they said.
State officials say that the deficit does not threaten the continued payment of benefits. 
But the loans could wind up costing the state's unemployment fund more than $100 million in interest and could result in a punitive tax on all employers across the state two years from now, state officials and experts on the unemployment insurance system said.
More than 500,000 people were collecting unemployment checks in New York State in the first week of this year, nearly three times as many as a year before.
The system's ballooning deficit is a result not only of the flood of new unemployment claims, but also of the relatively low payroll tax that finances unemployment benefits. The state has not increased that tax in nearly a decade, mainly because of opposition from business groups, making it difficult to avoid shortfalls even in milder downturns, officials and experts say.
The state fund also had insolvency troubles, though less severe, after the recession that began in 2001. But disputes over how to fix the system prevented Albany from taking action, leaving the state vulnerable to a replay this year, state officials and advocates for low-wage workers said.
The state's poorly financed unemployment system has had another consequence: New York pays lower benefits than about two dozen other states, including all of its neighbors.
New York's maximum weekly unemployment benefit of $405 has not changed since 2000. Other Northeastern states that offer significantly higher benefits have indexed them to rise with inflation. In New Jersey, for example, the maximum weekly benefit rose to $584 from $560 on Jan. 1. Connecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts also pay higher benefits.
That disparity came as surprise to Yvette Joseph, 51, who worked for an advertising company for 25 years until she was laid off in mid-2008. Since then, Ms. Joseph, who lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, with her husband and three children, has been collecting $405 a week in benefits, far less than the $55,000 annual salary she earned. To keep up the $2,800 monthly mortgage payments on her family's home, she has been borrowing from her 401(k) retirement savings plan, she said.
''Are you serious?'' Ms. Joseph said when told how much higher benefits can be in other states. ''I thought that New York probably pays the most because, you know, it's New York. It's a big state.''
New York applies the payroll tax only to the first $8,500 in annual wages paid to each employee, a limit that also has not changed this decade. Many other states tax a much higher portion of wages. In New Jersey, the taxable base is more than three times as high, at $27,700. In Connecticut, it is $15,000.
''The taxable wage base in comparison to wages is very low,'' said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been lobbying for an overhaul of the entire unemployment insurance system. ''The way I see it is, maybe the solvency problems will spark people in Albany to make some real fixes of the unemployment program at a time when it's really needed.''
The strains on the state's fund began to show almost immediately after the holidays, when the number of New Yorkers applying for jobless benefits spiked. On Jan. 2, the first business day of the new year, more money went out to the unemployed than came in from employers, forcing the state to borrow $39 million from the federal fund, state officials said. Since then, it has borrowed more than $80 million a week.
''I think we went insolvent about two hours into 2009,'' said M. Patricia Smith, the state's labor commissioner. ''We're seeing 50 percent more claimants each week than a year ago.''
Ms. Smith said she would press lawmakers to reconsider a solution to the chronic shortage of funds for the state's unemployed. Republicans have typically fought raising the payroll tax, but this year, for the first time in decades, Democrats control both houses of the Legislature and the executive branch.
Still, worries about raising taxes during a deepening recession may again thwart efforts to overhaul the system, state officials said. Gov. David A. Paterson supported attempts to fix the system last year and has directed state officials to revise their latest proposal ''given the significant changes in our state and national economic climate,'' according to a spokeswoman for the governor.
Assemblywoman Susan V. John, a Democrat from Rochester, the chairwoman of the Assembly's Labor Committee, sponsored a bill last year that would have raised benefits and the taxable base in stages over several years. Had it passed, the legislation would have raised the maximum weekly benefit to $475 last fall, then to $550 this year and $630 next year. After that, it would have been set at half of the state's average weekly wage.
Ms. John said that even if her bill had passed last year, the state's fund would still have run into a deficit this year. But, she added, the proposed changes would gradually have solved the problem of recurring shortfalls. She said she remained optimistic that the Legislature would reconsider updating the system. Still, with the state facing a $13.5 billion budget deficit, she said, ''There may not be the stomach to also raise the revenue to stabilize the unemployment insurance fund.''
Insolvency in the unemployment system can cost both the state and employers. When a state cannot repay loans from the federal fund, as New York failed to do from 2003 through 2006, it incurs interest at a rate set by the United States Treasury. (This year's borrowing rate was set last week at 4.64 percent, according to state officials.)
And if the debt is not paid off within two years, the federal government takes away part of the tax credit that employers receive for complying with the unemployment insurance system.
In 2005, employers in the state paid a penalty that amounted to $14 per worker; in 2006, that penalty doubled to about $28 per worker, Mr. Stettner said. The revenue from that special assessment went into the state's unemployment fund to help repay the debt to the federal fund.
The penalty falls even on businesses that do not lay off workers, and in 2005 and 2006, some small employers who had not added to the unemployment fund's burden complained about having to pay the additional tax, Mr. Stettner said.
Still, the business lobby has remained opposed to raising the payroll tax. Last year, the Business Council of New York State, the largest statewide business organization, also objected to Ms. John's bill, because it would have raised the tax and benefits automatically each year, something other states do.
Michael Moran, a spokesman for the council, said he expected the subject to surface in Albany again soon because of the shortfall in the system. But that is no guarantee of action.
In New Jersey, where the jobless rate jumped to 7.1 percent in December from 6.1 percent in November, the unemployment fund is down to about $400 million. The balance in Connecticut's fund is about $368 million, down from $433 million at the end of 2008, but it is not expected to fall into a deficit anytime soon, a spokesman for Connecticut's Labor Department said.
Of the nine states that had to borrow to pay unemployment benefits during and after the last recession, only Texas borrowed more than New York, according to a study published by the Urban Institute. Texas and four of the other states that borrowed -- Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Missouri -- made legislative changes to try to avoid another bout with insolvency. But New York has not.

HEADLINE: Toyota Moves Ahead of G.M. in 2008 Worldwide Sales

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
For the first time since the early 1930s, General Motors cannot call itself the world's largest automaker. Its sales fell behind Toyota in 2008, a year when G.M. celebrated its 100th anniversary and narrowly avoided a bankruptcy filing amid a significant downturn in the economy. 
 G.M. said on Wednesday that it sold 8.35 million vehicles in 2008, about 620,000 fewer than Toyota's 8.97 million. G.M.'s sales were down 11 percent from 2007, while Toyota's declined 4 percent.
 G.M. had been the largest carmaker since it overtook Ford in 1931, two years before Toyota began making cars in Japan. Toyota had been closing in on G.M. for years; its sales surged around the world while G.M.'s global expansion was tempered by decades of falling market share in the United States. The two had traded places from one quarter to the next in recent years. G.M. had been widely expected to slip into second place in 2007 but held off Toyota by about 3,000 vehicles.
 Both companies struggled in 2008, as global sales for the industry fell by 3.5 million vehicles. Toyota said it expected to report its first operating loss in its history for the year ending March 31.
 But demand fell the most in North American and Europe, regions where G.M. is a larger player. As a result, executives from the Detroit company, which has lost money every year since 2004, warned that it could run out of cash without billions in loans from the United States government.
 G.M.'s global sales fell 26 percent in the fourth quarter, and the company received a $4 billion loan in December; it is expecting another $5.4 billion installment soon.
 ''Our goal is to fight for every profitable sale,'' Michael C. DiGiovanni, G.M.'s executive director of global market and industry analysis, said Wednesday. ''Right now we're focused on getting past this economic crisis we're in and becoming a stronger company for the future.''
 In 2008, 64 percent of G.M.'s sales occurred outside the United States, up from 59 percent the previous year. It still outsells Toyota in the United States by a wide margin -- nearly 800,000 vehicles in 2008, or 33 percent more than Toyota -- but Toyota sells more in the rest of the world.
 G.M., now describing itself on official statements as merely ''one of the world's largest automakers,'' expects a rough road ahead. It recently reduced its United States sales forecast for all automakers in 2009 to 10.5 million, compared with 13.2 million in 2008.
 ''Our target is to hold market share this year,'' Mr. DiGiovanni said, which would translate to a 20 percent decline in sales for the company. But even in such a depressed market, G.M. has expressed confidence that it can remain solvent. 
 ''We want to drive our break-even point down as low as we can get it,'' Mr. DiGiovanni said. ''We want to use this crisis as an opportunity for us to really get the business right.''

HEADLINE: EBay's Income Declines 31% As Economy Reduces Traffic

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The turbulent economy battered eBay, and the online marketplace reported its profit fell 31 percent and that it had its first revenue decline since it started in 1995. 
 The results cap a year in which eBay made considerable efforts to reduce its dependence on its auction business, where growth has slowed in favor of fixed-price sales and eBay's noncore businesses, like its PayPal payment-processing unit. 
 ''This was eBay's first year-over-year quarterly decline, and we're not happy about that,'' said John J. Donahoe, eBay's president and chief executive in a conference call with analysts. ''There's no doubt eBay was impacted by the macroeconomy, and our fourth-quarter results reflect this.'' 
 The report caused shares of eBay to decline more than 6 percent in after-hours trading, after closing up 73 cents a share, or nearly 6 percent, at $13.28 in regular trading before the report was released. 
 Adding to the disappointment, eBay warned that its first-quarter income would also fall short of Wall Street's expectations. For the fiscal 2009 first quarter, eBay expects income, excluding items, of 32 to 34 cents a share on revenue of $1.8 billion to $2.05 billion. Analysts had forecast income of 40 cents on revenue of $2.10 billion.
 EBay's net income in the fourth quarter fell to $367 million, or 29 cents a share, from $530.9 million or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. EBay's full-year revenue of $8.54 billion was up 11 percent over 2007.
 Excluding one-time items, eBay earned 41 cents a share, beating analysts' forecast of 39 cents a share, but it fell slightly short of analysts' revenue forecast of $2.12 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson First Call.
 The company, based in San Jose, Calif., said revenue fell 7 percent, to $2.04 billion, its first drop in sales in 10 years. EBay's Marketplaces unit, which includes the core eBay auction site, reported a 16 percent decline in revenue, which the company attributed to falling demand and the strengthening dollar.
 Gross merchandise volume, the total of all transactions on the eBay Marketplace and an important measure of overall growth at eBay, decreased 12 percent during the quarter, its second consecutive quarter of decline. 
 Revenue at PayPal rose 11 percent as total payments volume increased 14 percent, while Skype revenue increased 26 percent. For the first time, the majority of PayPal's volume came from sites not affiliated with eBay, company executives said.
 Scott Devitt, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, said the results were hardly surprising given slowing demand, though the first-quarter outlook was even weaker than he expected. ''Fundamentally, the business continues to be challenged,'' he said.
 Even as the most-visited retail site on the Web with about 85 million visitors, eBay's traffic in December was about 4 percent lower than the year before. Overall holiday spending online was down about 3 percent from last year, according to the market researcher Obscure.
 The disappointing results come at the end of Mr. Donahoe's first year as chief executive. But Mr. Donahoe said he was pleased with the number of fundamental ''structural'' changes the company made in 2008, focusing on, among other things, the security of the site and a reduction in the fees it charges fixed-price sellers. ''Today, eBay is safer and easier to use than it was a year ago,'' he said. 
 The company laid off 10 percent of its work force of 16,000 during the fourth quarter, and paid $1.35 billion to acquire the online-payment firm Bill Me Later and two Danish advertising companies.

HEADLINE: Feeling Economy's Effects, Carnegie Hall to Scale Back Its 2009-10 Season

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Carnegie Hall said Wednesday that it would present a slimmed-down program next season because of the recession but would forge ahead with its parade of festivals, including a three-week survey of Chinese music and other performing arts. 
 In announcing its plans for the 2009-10 season, Carnegie also said the Kronos Quartet would present a Perspectives series; Louis Andriessen, the Netherlands' leading composer, would be in residence; and clusters of concerts would center on late Haydn, the 200th anniversary of Chopin's birth and the Polish composer Karol Szymanowski. 
 Other musicians given special prominence will be the pianists Maurizio Pollini (with three Chopin programs) and Emanuel Ax; the conductor Valery Gergiev and the Maryinsky Orchestra, performing Berlioz's ''Romeo et Juliette'' and ''Troyens''; and the conductor Pierre Boulez, who will commemorate his 85th birthday by leading the Vienna Philharmonic, the Met Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony. 
 Like almost all arts institutions, Carnegie Hall has seen its endowment shrink and donations drop. Clive Gillinson, the hall's president, said in an interview that he had cut costs by about $4 million this season to bring the budget to $76 million and keep it balanced. The endowment is down nearly 30 percent from $270 million at the end of June, about on a par with other institutions. Donations are off about 18 percent this season. Ticket sales are holding steady, he said.
 The cuts include canceling several projects not previously announced, instituting a hiring freeze and ending the practice of giving dinners for the Met Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic, longtime visitors.
 The number of events next season will drop about 10 percent, to 180, Mr. Gillinson said. 
 ''What we're launching is a smaller season than previous seasons in order to protect the future,'' he said. ''What we will never do is reduce quality.'' He added at a news conference later, ''If you looked at the program you would have no idea it had been reduced.''
 In the last two years, Carnegie has organized festivals dedicated to Berlin, black American culture and Leonard Bernstein. Part of its strategy is to include other New York institutions in putting on the performances, as will happen here.
 The focus on China is a recognition of the prominent role Chinese musicians have come to play in Western concert life and the growing presence of Western classical music in China.
 ''When you look at the world of the 21st century, China is going to be of absolute importance,'' Mr. Gillinson said. ''It has the most fascinating traditional culture. It has a really dynamic contemporary culture. China's culture has had a tremendous influence all around the world.''
 The festival, called ''Ancient Paths, Modern Voices,'' will run from Oct. 21 to Nov. 10 and include 30 events in places around New York as well as on Carnegie's stages. Major figures in programming and performing are Wu Man, the pipa player; Lang Lang, the pianist; Tan Dun, the composer; and Long Yu, the conductor.
 The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra will perform the New York premiere of Angel Lam's ''Awakening From a Disappearing Garden,'' with Robert Spano conducting and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma as soloist. The St. Louis Symphony and David Robertson will play what Carnegie called Chinese-influenced Western works, along with Bright Sheng's ''Colors of Crimson'' and Tan Dun's ''Water Concerto.''
 Mr. Tan's music will also be spotlighted by the China Philharmonic and the Juilliard Orchestra, which will present the premiere of his Violin Concerto. Cho-Liang Lin will be soloist. The festival will offer marionette, dance, film and visual-arts events, and will include appearances in Southern California through a partnership with the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa, in Orange County.
 The Kronos Quartet will join forces with Wu Man in one of the more intriguing events, giving the premiere of ''Yin Yu Tang: A Chinese Home,'' a multimedia work directed and staged by Chen Shi-Zheng. 
 The season opens with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under its music director, James Levine. The soloists will be the pianist Evgeny Kissin, in Chopin's Concerto No. 2, and Ann Hobson Pilot, the orchestra's principal harpist, in the New York premiere of a John Williams piece, ''On Willows and Birches.''
 The Berlin Philharmonic, led by Simon Rattle, will play all four Brahms symphonies over three concerts, juxtaposed with pieces by Arnold Schoenberg.
 Daniel Barenboim will conduct the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in two concerts. Alan Gilbert, who takes over as music director of the New York Philharmonic next season, will bring the orchestra to Carnegie for the American premiere of the Clarinet Concerto by the Finn Magnus Lindberg. The soloist is Kari Kriikku, another Finn, who made a mark at the Mostly Mozart Festival last summer.
 Still another Finn will be featured: Osmo Vanska, the music director of the Minnesota Orchestra, which will perform Sibelius's ''Kullervo,'' a symphonic poem for soprano, baritone and male choir.
 John Eliot Gardiner and his Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique and his Monteverdi Choir will present Haydn's oratorios ''The Seasons'' and ''The Creation.''
 Frederica von Stade, the mezzo-soprano, will present her New York farewell concert on April 22.

HEADLINE: He Exudes Hope Now, but Talk to Him in a Year

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: FLORHAM PARK, N.J. 

 BODY:
 In the aftermath of a historic day in the United States, Rex Ryan could have begun his career as Jets coach quietly, in anonymity.
 But anyone who has watched Ryan's blitz-crazy Baltimore Ravens defense knows he doesn't really do anonymous. So Ryan began a news conference Wednesday mentioning President Obama. Noting the large throng of news media in the auditorium, Ryan said, ''With all the cameras, I was looking for our new president back there.''
 Smiling, Ryan made a prediction: ''I think we'll get to meet him in the next couple of years anyway.'' Presumably after the Jets win a Super Bowl. 
 Someone asked Ryan if he really meant to predict the Jets' winning a Super Bowl. ''Absolutely,'' he said. ''I'm not afraid of expectations being high. They should be high. You're taking over a team that won nine games last year. I'm not running from that. My goal is to win a Super Bowl.'' 
 The new president and the new Jets coach have this much in common: They both hit the ground running the first day on the job. Who has the harder job?
 The president? He's facing the worst economic crisis in decades and two overseas wars. But economic downturns -- no matter how suffocating -- come and go, and the nation never loses the essence of its greatness.
 The Jets, on the other hand, are fighting a curse. It may not matter how great their head coach is or how many free agents they sign. There always seems to be a jack-in-the-box that springs out to hit the Jets with an anvil.
 In late November, the Jets were 8-3 and steaming toward the playoffs, but they collapsed down the stretch, losing four of their last five games. They missed the playoffs and Coach Eric Mangini was fired. The Jets embarked on an extensive -- some might say farcical -- search for a new coach that ended, after a five-hour interview, with Ryan.
 Could he be the Jets' savior?
 Ryan was 6 years old when the Jets shocked the football world on Jan. 12, 1969, by upsetting Baltimore, 16-7, in Super Bowl III. He was at the game because his father, Buddy Ryan, was an assistant coach for the Jets.
 ''I can remember that game; I can remember Matt Snell running over people,'' Ryan recalled. 
 That was the last championship for the Jets, the last time they even reached the championship game. 
 Now Ryan comes back, at 46, as the Jets' 17th head coach, all but promising to bring the team a second championship. 
 What makes him think that he can do the job that other coaches, including Bill Parcells, could not? One that Bill Belichick quit before he even tried? 
 Ryan said he could have taken a job where expectations would not have been as high as they will be in New York. So why here? 
 ''I'm not a one-hit wonder,'' he said. Ryan recited an impressive list of credentials and accomplishments from college to the N.F.L., where he reconstituted the Ravens' defense after Marvin Lewis left to coach the Bengals.
 ''You got the right guy,'' Ryan said. ''I plan on proving that each week.''
 Ryan is driven by something deeper than simply trying to win. He wants to escape from the wide shadow of his famous father. 
 Although Ryan has an excellent reputation as a defensive coordinator, his father, Buddy, is regarded as one of the greatest defensive coaches in N.F.L. history. As long as Rex was an assistant, he knew that he would remain in his father's shadow.
 ''I want to be a better head coach than my father,'' Ryan said. ''That sounds crazy, but it's the truth, and I don't mind saying it.''
 That was the most honest emotion a Jets head coach had expressed in three seasons. Mangini was a mummy, holding back, ever tight-lipped. 
 Ryan has a reputation of speaking from his heart. Perhaps the Jets will play with theirs. 
 ''That's who I am, the formula where I've been successful,'' he said. ''I'm not worried about saying the wrong thing, I just want to tell you the way it is.'' 
 Ryan spoke so convincingly that he had some members of the news media ready to put on pads. 
 He promised to bring fire to the Jets and spoke glowingly about current Jets, casting Darrelle Revis as the Ravens Pro bowl safety Ed Reed, and linebacker Vernon Gholston, the underperforming rookie, as the Ravens' Terrell Suggs. 
 Everything is at its optimistic best at the start of a new season: the political season has Inauguration Day, the baseball season has opening day and the N.F.L. has the season of news conferences for new head coaches. 
 Will Ryan be so effervescent at this time next season, after his first year as an N.F.L. head coach? Will the Jets be headed toward the Super Bowl, or will the jack-in-the box have popped up once more? 
 I have my doubts about the Jets, but Ryan receives the benefit of the doubt. He wears his heart on his sleeve and talks about rejuvenation and hope.
 That will work, for now.

HEADLINE: Ex-K.G.B. Agent Buying London Tabloid

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL and ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
He had been one of the K.G.B.'s men in London, a spy who rose swiftly through the ranks. Yet, when Soviet Communism collapsed, he switched seamlessly to its ideological rival as a banker worth billions in the free-wheeling capitalism of the new Russia. Some British newspapers took to calling him the spy who came in for the gold.
 Now, the former spy, Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, the owner of a major Russian bank, a chunk of the Aeroflot airline and a big share of a newspaper in Moscow, is heading back to London in a different guise altogether. 
 So a man who once spied on Britain for the Kremlin is returning as a press baron, adding one more strand to the weave of wealth binding Russian tycoons to London.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Lebedev announced that he had agreed to buy a majority stake in The Evening Standard, a newspaper that has long been a part of London's fabric, offering commuters a diet of show business listings, celebrity gossip, sharp-edged editorials and lengthy feature articles, as well as being the afternoon newspaper read by Britain's political elite.
 The sale is following a furious press war pitting The Standard against newspapers given free to commuters.
 In a statement, the newspaper's owners described the price as ''a nominal sum,'' said by analysts to be $:1, or about $1.40. The Standard has a circulation of more than 280,000 copies a day and losses estimated by analysts at up to $22 million a year.
 Many foreigners have bought into the British press, including Conrad Black, a Canadian, and Rupert Murdoch, an Australian who later became an American. 
 But this latest acquisition has a particular flavor for a city in thrall to its super-rich Russian elite.
 There is, for instance, Roman A. Abramovich, one of Russia's richest men, who owns the Chelsea soccer club as well as yachts and luxury homes. With overtones of le Carre, there are anti-Kremlin dissidents like Boris A. Berezovsky, whose former aide, Alexander V. Litvinenko, himself a former K.G.B. officer, was killed by a rare radioactive toxin in London in November 2006.
 According to the Russian Embassy, about 300,000 Russians lived in London in 2008, including a sprinkling of billionaires and many millionaires, drawn by favorable tax laws at least until the financial crisis hit home. Mr. Lebedev is by no means the only former Soviet spy attracted to Britain: former agents like Viktor Suvorov and Oleg Gordievsky defected to Britain during the cold war.
 Yet the fact that Moscow-based Mr. Lebedev is presumably the first former Soviet spy to own a major British daily ''adds a different dimension,'' said Roy Greenslade, who writes a column on the media in The Standard and a blog about it on the Web site of The Guardian. ''What you always have to ask yourself is, 'Why is this person buying the paper?' '' Mr. Greenslade said in a telephone interview.
 ''There are five reasons for owning newspapers, and all begin with a P: profit, propaganda, political influence, prestige and public service. There's no profit in The Standard, so you've got to look at the other things.''
 In Moscow, Mr. Lebedev is the major shareholder, along with the former Soviet president Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper that has a reputation for being pro-democracy and independent and whose journalists included Anna Politkovskaya, who was killed in Moscow in October 2006. A freelance journalist for the paper, Anastasia Baburova, was killed on Monday in Moscow. 
 Mr. Lebedev, a political gadfly, has built a reputation for opposing corruption and seeking stronger democratic institutions, even though, like Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, his roots go back to the cold war K.G.B.
 In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Lebedev promised to guarantee The Standard's editorial independence. ''We are strong supporters of a free and independent press and we greatly admire The Evening Standard as an iconic publication with its pedigree of fine journalism and commentary,'' the statement said.
 Mr. Lebedev, 49, is to be the chairman of a new company that will own the paper. His London-based son, Evgeny Lebedev, 28, will be senior executive director. 
 Mr. Lebedev has sought a different profile in London, as a host of glittering events in honor of the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation, which seeks to combat cancer in children. The parties were partly organized by Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, a society magazine, who once remarked that the events ''reinvented the way British society looked at Russians in the U.K.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Vanish As Exports Fall in Asia

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Keith Bradsher reported last month from Karawang and Jakarta and added updated information from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
KARAWANG, Indonesia -- At a three-story factory here that used to make television remote controls, most of the fluorescent lights have been turned off. The hallways are nearly silent, and three-quarters of the workers have been laid off.
A pencil factory down the road closed last September, laying off 100 workers. Another nearby factory that turned out carved and painted wooden window frames shut down and laid off 800 workers. And two Toyota factories, one here in Karawang and another in a nearby city, have not renewed the contracts of 277 temporary workers. 
''In our 11 years here, this is the worst situation with so many layoffs -- not even in 1998 was it this bad,'' said Abraham Sauate, the manager of the TV remote factory, comparing today with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. ''The problem now is we don't know where to go, and we don't know how long it will last.''
On Thursday, Japan said exports fell 35 percent in December from a year earlier as the crisis hurt its main markets. China and Japan draw the most attention, but the global slump in manufacturing is spreading across Asia.
Industrial production is dropping in South Korea at the fastest pace since record keeping began in 1975. Taiwanese exports dived 40 percent in December compared with a year earlier. And ports from Indonesia to Thailand are handling ever fewer shipping containers.
''There's not a country in the region that is not slowing sharply or in outright recession,'' said Stephen S. Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.
During the last crisis, investors took their money out of country after country. Asian leaders thought they had found a solution -- increases in exports to the West, particularly of electronics. But that dependence on exports fed this crisis. Now American and European buyers are pulling their import orders from country after country. And while governments have short-term economic stimulus plans, long-term answers seem more elusive.
Hard times in factory towns are especially troubling in Asia, where countries depend on manufacturing for a far greater share of economic output than Western countries do, as much as 40 percent in the case of China and other big exporters.
That is triple the current 13 percent in the United States, and much higher even than the American peak of 28 percent in 1953.
While all of Asia is suffering, some economies are feeling the effects of the global downturn less than others.
Many of these countries are latecomers to the world market. They have even lower wages than China and were just starting to benefit from the arrival of businesses seeking to avoid increases in wages and other costs in China from 2003 through last summer.
For example, Bangladesh's exports are dominated by the sale of low-cost garments to mass-market retailers like Wal-Mart that have fared well as consumers have begun shifting toward thriftier purchases. Garment workers in Bangladesh still earn $40 to $50 a month, barely half the minimum wage in export-oriented coastal cities in China.
Economic difficulties in the West ''will have an impact on Bangladesh in terms of our growth rate, but I'm not concerned it will eat into our share'' of the global garment market, said Mustafizur Rahman, the executive director of the Center for Policy Dialogue, a nonpartisan research group in Dhaka that specializes in trade and other economic issues.
The numbers bear that out. While overall American imports dropped 12 percent in November compared with a year earlier, imports rose from Bangladesh and from Vietnam. Each country shipped more knit apparel to the United States, and Vietnam also shipped more furniture.
Few countries were hit harder in the Asian financial crisis than Indonesia. Much of the banking system collapsed, economic output plunged, riots ensued and the government fell.
But Indonesia is often described as one of the less vulnerable countries in Asia, because its insular economy relies less on trade than other countries in the region. With the world's fourth-largest population -- after China, India and the United States -- Indonesia has long had a domestic market big enough to sustain large industries without the need for foreign markets.
Yet the difficulties here in Karawang show how far the global downturn now reaches. The factories here have attracted workers from all over Indonesia. More are now losing their jobs, just as tens of thousands of migrant Indonesian workers are coming home after being laid off in neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is expected to seek a second term in elections in July, has already been forced to announce plans for $6.8 billion in extra government spending this year to stimulate the economy.
The stimulus program will help pay for road construction and neighborhood projects. (Indonesia's constitution is unusual in requiring that a fifth of government spending be dedicated to education, so the program may have long-term benefits as well.)
President Obama lived in Jakarta as a boy, and many here hope that he will be able to pull the United States and the rest of the world, including Indonesia, out of its economic slump.
''When Obama is president, everything will be better -- we hope so because there are so many promises from him,'' said Mr. Sauate, the manager of the television remote factory.
Other Indonesians are more cautious. ''It's an illusion that Obama can solve all the problems,'' said Khamid Istakhoria, the secretary general of the Indonesian Trade Union Alliance Congress, ''because no matter who is president, they will face real economic troubles.''

HEADLINE: Upbeat on Cape Cod, Despite a Recession

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
ENTREPRENEURS are pragmatists, after all. And most did not go into business to make money but to call their own shots and have fun.
 So while a report this month from ADP Employer Services and Macroeconomic Advisers showed sharp job losses at small businesses, another recent survey of small-business owners by the online payroll service SurePayroll showed a significant increase in optimism about the economy -- about 73 percent in late December, up from 56 percent a month earlier. 
 An unscientific survey of five business owners on Cape Cod, chosen more or less at random, found them all in good spirits. All said they were looking for angles to exploit in a slumping economy, and all contended that no matter how bad things got, they would do just fine.
 One of the five was Bruce Davis, who made $84,000 last year ridding homes of rodents, raccoons, flying squirrels and other pests. He also made $178,000 shorting stocks, essentially betting that stock prices would go down. That enabled him to buy a 3,600-square-foot home that had been in foreclosure for $270,000, he said, 40 percent less than it sold for in 2006. ''I call it my e*Trade house,'' he said. 
 Mr. Davis says his pest control business has slowed this year, with more callers seeking advice from him than hiring him. He will give the advice if he senses they are desperate. (If you have a skunk in your garage, he tells them, coat the driveway in front of the garage door with flour and open the door. Once you see tracks leading out but not returning, close the door and you have solved the problem.)
 He uses 2,200 gallons of gas a year driving his truck all over Cape Cod, and with the recent fall in prices at the pump, he has cut his prices 10 percent. He plans to continue spending more than $20,000 on Yellow Pages display ads for his company, A to Z Animal and Pest Control, in Mashpee, Mass., but he said he would reduce his service area to save on gas.
 Stock trading, though, is his real passion. He made a lot of money in the dot-com boom, lost most of it, then got back into the market a few years ago after figuring that he could make more money shorting stocks than buying long.
 ''Look at the charts,'' said Mr. Davis, who is 46. ''Stocks always go down a lot quicker than they go up. That's because of the market makers.'' In two weeks recently, he said, he made $10,000 doing ''a double short and a double long on oil.'' As he drives from job to job, he listens to financial news on CNBC and checks the markets on the laptop that occupies the passenger seat. He even takes breaks from setting traps in attics to return to his van to find out what is happening on Wall Street.
 The second of the five is Stephen Sullivan, 56, who spends more than 50 weeks a year staying in the homes of well-heeled residents to care for their dogs, cats, birds and even wild swans while they flee south or go on cruises. He says he does not care how much money he makes. Even so, business at his company, Feathers and Fur, in Dennis, Mass., is up from last year. 
 ''People who put their heart into their work always have work,'' he said. 
 ''People call me the St. Francis of Cape Cod,'' he added. ''I love animals. I love moving from house to house. It's like going on vacation.''
 Ron Landry has reactivated his R. E. Landry Construction Company in Forestdale, Mass., after taking 10 months off in late 2007 and early 2008 to work for another contractor and start a judo club. He is remodeling a basement, a $40,000 job that he says should take two and a half months and earn him $22,000. ''I'm not booked out for two years like I used to be,'' Mr. Landry said. ''But my ace in the hole is that I can do just about anything, I do what I say I'm going to do and I'm not afraid of hard work.'' 
 He has also invested in real estate, deriving about $20,000 a year in rental income from a lakefront home in New Hampshire and a condominium in Florida. He also owns three Florida lots that cost him $72,700, peaked in value at $313,000 and now might be worth $115,000, by his calculations. ''I'm still ahead,'' he said.
 His greatest ardor, however, is reserved for judo. He has a third-degree black belt in the martial art and his 11-year-old son is a national champion. Mr. Landry started Cape Cod Mat Sports in Mashpee in June 2007 after years of coaching young people in his church free. It recently turned profitable, he said, and he plans to expand into wrestling and to begin a big marketing drive soon.
 ''I'd love to do this full time,'' said Mr. Landry, 46. And the recession actually helps, he said. ''All you need to buy in judo is a practice uniform for $45. A good baseball bat costs $150. Also, I think our country is shifting back to the basics of a more structured, disciplined way of life, which judo exemplifies.''
 Symen Kooy, owner of Blossoms Florist and Gifts in Dennis, Mass., says his venture is flourishing in the recession as never before. Blossoms made 750 deliveries on Mother's Day last year, up from 100 the first year, and made 200 deliveries on Christmas, double the 2007 volume. He expects 2009 revenue to grow 25 percent, even though customers are placing smaller orders.
 He attributes his success to ''giving better service than people expect'' and to his lifelong love affair with flowers. ''After all, I'm Dutch,'' said Mr. Kooy, 72. ''Dad won big prizes for his gladiolas. My brother had the largest garden store in Holland.''
 Even Ellen R. Massa, who took out a second mortgage on her house two years ago to start Professional Nurse and Home Care of Cape Cod, and who today is struggling to keep it afloat, is hopeful. The souring economy, competition from national chains and caregivers who work off the books, and state taxes are driving her to distraction, she said. ''Payroll taxes, the business tax, workmen's comp, liability taxes, unemployment taxes, a new insurance tax -- do you want me to keep naming them?'' she asked.
 And yet, Mrs. Massa, 53, said, ''I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm making enough to get by. I'm not giving up. This has always been a dream of mine. I won't go back to punching a clock.''
 Even with a sour economy, then, entrepreneurs' can-do spirit keeps burning. A recent survey of its members by the National Federation of Independent Business showed that pessimists about the economy outnumbered optimists by just 5 percentage points in the last quarter of 2008, shrinking from a 20 percent gap in the first quarter. 
 Why the rebound? ''Entrepreneurs are by definition more creative and more resilient than big companies,'' said Michael Alter, SurePayroll's president. ''They've been struggling with the economic downturn since September, and now they've figured out ways to deal with it.''

HEADLINE: Proposed Budget Shuts Out Zoos, Aquariums and Gardens

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
A zoo director calls a porcupine into his office to break the news. ''There's no easy way to say this,'' the director tells the prickly animal as it squirms on its chair. ''Even though you bring record numbers of people to New York and help the economy, we're going to have to let you go.''
 The humorous video -- made by the Wildlife Conservation Society, which oversees the city's zoos and the New York Aquarium -- has a sobering reality behind it. In New York State's next fiscal year, which starts in April, state financing for all 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums would be eliminated under Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed budget. This after a 55 percent reduction this fiscal year -- a move that was made only last month, surprising many organizations so late in the fiscal year. 
 The state cuts, combined with a precipitous drop in endowment funds and corporate donations, have organizations from the New York Botanical Garden to the Niagara Falls Aquarium to the Utica Zoo reeling. 
 ''It's hard to understand what you're even going to do next,'' said Susan Lacerte, the executive director of the 39-acre Queens Botanical Garden, which had expected to receive $226,000 from the state this year. Assemblyman Steve Englebright, a Democrat from Suffolk County, home to organizations like the Hoyt Farm Park in Commack and the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy in Cold Spring Harbor, called the cuts ''very bad policy.''
 ''A 100 percent cut is essentially a way of forcing zoos to lay off people, reduce their living collections or close,'' he said. 
 Mr. Englebright said he was particularly troubled by the impact on children. ''It is through these institutions -- the excitement of a trip to the zoo, or the ability to touch an exotic plant at the botanical gardens -- that stirs the imagination and leads to a lifetime commitment to caring about the natural world,'' he said.
 Over all, this year's 55 percent state cut means that financing for the zoos, gardens and aquariums -- apportioned through the state's Environmental Protection Fund -- had been cut from $9 million to $4 million. 
 Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget, said the reductions were needed to help close a combined projected gap of $15.4 billion for fiscal 2009 and 2010, and that state officials preferred to focus resources on general capital projects rather than on operating support. 
 ''This is one of many difficult choices that had to be made,'' Mr. Gordon said. He added that state money is ''a small proportion'' of the organizations' budgets -- only 2 percent of the Bronx Zoo's overall budget, for example. 
 Yet because the 55 percent state cut came in the middle of the fiscal year, organizations had to scramble to make up the difference. ''They told us we were going to get $185,000,'' said Donna M. Fernandes, president and chief executive of the Buffalo Zoo, whose budget is $6.6 million for this fiscal year. ''We budgeted that, spent that as if we were getting it. 
 ''If you tell us, 'You're not getting the money we told you nine months ago you were going to get,' we can't even adjust to that. There's nothing you can do so late in the game.''
 In response to its bleak economic situation, the Buffalo Zoo has already frozen four staff positions and Ms. Fernandes took a 10 percent pay cut. 
 ''With live animals, you can't cut back on food, utilities, veterinary care,'' she added. ''There are such high fixed costs, there's no getting around it. This is almost punitive for those with living collections.''
 When the three-month high season opens at the Queens Botanical Garden in April, staff members and trustees will be standing at the gates asking for donations. The garden also plans a spring yard sale. ''We're all going to go into our closets for things that we don't use,'' Ms. Lacerte said. 
 For the first time in its history, the garden closed for two weeks during the year-end holidays. Two staff members have been laid off, two others had their hours halved. The staff has been forced to take off 10 unpaid Mondays, which amounts to a 3.85 percent pay cut. The garden has canceled its annual Arbor Day in April, billed as the city's largest tree planting celebration, and its composting program. 
 The New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx has canceled a composting program for people with neighborhood gardens, scrapped a summer sculpture show and scaled back its environmental education program. Since August, 49 staff positions have been eliminated or left unfilled. ''We don't expect things to get any better,'' said Gregory Long, president of the garden.
 Cultural institutions across New York City are struggling to adjust to the economic downturn. About 80 percent have or are already planning cuts, according to a recent study by the Alliance for the Arts. About half have canceled or postponed programs, 68 percent have frozen hiring and 42 percent are planning layoffs. 
 Some cultural executives say the cuts suggest that the state fails to recognize their institutions' economic contributions. The Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium, for example, draw 2.7 million annual visitors, employ 1,000 staff members and generate $300 million for New York's economy every year, said Steven E. Sanderson, the president and chief executive of the Wildlife Conservation Society. ''There is a huge amount of benefit to our activity,'' Dr. Sanderson added. 
 The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, meanwhile, is determined not to reduce access to its 52 acres of orchids, magnolia trees and forsythias. ''For us to absorb that level of cut is pretty tight,'' said Scot D. Medbury, the president of the garden. ''We are committed to keeping the doors open at a time when people need us most.''

HEADLINE: Getting America Back on Its Feet, the 1933 Version

BYLINE: By JOHN STEELE GORDON. 
John Steele Gordon is the author of ''An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power'' (HarperCollins, 2004).

NOTHING TO FEAR
 FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America 
 By Adam Cohen 
 Illustrated. 372 pages. The Penguin Press. $29.95. 
 By the time Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated as president on March 4, 1933, banks were closed in 38 states, and withdrawals were limited in the other 10. The stock exchange had announced that it wouldn't open that morning and wouldn't say when it would reopen.
 Unemployment was, officially, over 25 percent and actually far higher as many of those counted as employed were working only part time. Farms were being foreclosed at the rate of 20,000 a month. Hundreds of thousands were living in ''Hoovervilles'' and eating at soup kitchens or scavenging food from garbage cans. Farmers could not find a market for their crops. Many thought the end of the American experiment was near. Adam Cohen's new book, ''Nothing to Fear,'' shows why it was not. 
 The country and its political and economic assumptions would change profoundly in the first few months of the new administration. From March 4 to June 16, 1933, the new president signed no fewer than 14 major acts of legislation, an astonishing pace of more than one a week. By the end of the so-called 100 days, the banking and financial system had been remade. Sweeping federal relief for homeowners, farmers and the unemployed was in place. The country was off the gold standard. Though the Great Depression was hardly over (it would take World War II to finally end it), recovery had at least begun. 
 When the stock exchange reopened on March 15, the mood of the country had changed so much that the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 15 percent that day on heavy volume.
 During this period, Roosevelt functioned in a way similar to a dictator in the ancient sense of the Constitution of the Roman Republic: an official given total power for a brief time to handle a grave national emergency. 
 The Emergency Banking Relief Act, for instance, which hadn't even been written on March 4, was sent to Congress on March 9. The chairman of the House banking committee, who had the only copy, with penciled additions, walked down the aisle waving it over his head and shouting, ''Here's the bill; let's pass it.'' 
 The Republican House leader admitted to not having read the bill but said Congress needed ''to give the President what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation.'' The bill passed 40 minutes later by voice vote and passed the Senate later that day, 73 to 7. Roosevelt signed it into law nine hours after he had sent it to the Hill.
 Mr. Cohen, a member of the editorial board of The New York Times, brings this brief but extraordinary period in American history to vivid life. An excellent writer and storyteller, he does so by concentrating not on its central figure, Roosevelt, but on a handful of his aides. Household names in their day, they are largely forgotten now except by historians. As Mr. Cohen makes clear, they should not be. We live in the world they did so much to create.
 Without Frances Perkins, Rexford Tugwell, Lewis Douglas, Henry Wallace, Raymond Moley, William Woodin, Harry Hopkins and others, the New Deal could not have come into being so quickly or changed the country so profoundly. The mini-biographies that Mr. Cohen gives the reader do much both to illuminate the actors in the story he tells and to show the world in which they developed their ideas about how to make it a better one. They are sure-footed and convincing.
 Far less so, however, is his portrait of Herbert Hoover. Hoover, to be sure, was the wrong man at the wrong time. Dour, diffident and beaten down by four years of ever-growing economic disaster, he was the opposite of the ebullient, charming and naturally optimistic Roosevelt. Many early historians of the New Deal presented Hoover as uncaring and devoted to laissez-faire principles and balanced budgets to set the economy right.
 This provided a handy foil to set off the glories of the New Deal. But as more modern scholarship has shown -- see David M. Kennedy's Pulitzer-winning history of the era, ''Freedom From Fear'' (Oxford University Press, 1999) -- it is at best a caricature. Mr. Cohen accepts this earlier partisan view of Hoover. 
 He states that the Hoover administration ordered the destruction of the main encampment of the Bonus Marchers, who had come to Washington to demand early payment of a veterans' bonus. In fact, it was Gen. Douglas MacArthur, then the Army chief of staff, who attacked in flagrant violation of Hoover's direct orders. He says that Hoover did little to help struggling homeowners keep their homes. In fact, Hoover proposed the Home Loan Bank Board in December 1931. Congress took seven months to pass the legislation and limited Hoover's proposal, making many homeowners ineligible.
 Even Rexford Tugwell said in an interview years later that ''practically the whole New Deal was extrapolated from programs Hoover started.'' He added, ''Hoover had wanted -- and had said clearly enough that he wanted -- nearly all the changes now brought under the New Deal label.''
 Hoover aside, Mr. Cohen presents a fair and balanced history. His research is prodigious, making it all the more unfortunate that the endnotes are only by paragraph. This makes it hard to know which source contains which fact or quote. Further, the bibliographical information is incorporated into the notes, forcing the interested reader to hunt back through earlier notes to find the first reference. 
 ''Nothing to Fear'' is a fascinating account of an extraordinary moment in the life of the United States, indeed a page-turner. His subject is no less than the moment when Roosevelt and the people he wisely chose to help him ''turned retreat into advance'' and began the process of creating the country we know today.

HEADLINE: Crisis in Europe and U.S. Hurts Asian Economies

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Sagging demand from recession-struck Europe and the United States is helping to brake Asian economic growth to a halt with extraordinary abruptness, according to fresh data from several of Asia's leading economies.
 Japanese exports, which are crucial to corporate giants like Sony and Toyota, plummeted in December to a level 35 percent lower than a year earlier, the Japanese finance ministry reported. Meanwhile, the South Korean economy contracted sharply in the last quarter of 2008, with output down by 3.4 percent from a year earlier. 
 China's once-roaring economy slowed markedly in the last quarter as well, the government statistical office reported on Thursday. The annual growth rate, which hit 13 percent in 2007, fell to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter and 9 percent for all of 2008. 
 The figures from Japan and South Korea, especially, were much worse than economists were expecting, and illustrated how difficult it has become to accurately forecast the effects of the global economic slowdown, which was brought on by the financial crisis stemming from trouble in American mortgage finance. 
 Asia was once thought to be relatively well-insulated because it had only limited exposure to debt securities derived from ''subprime'' mortgage lending in the United States. But now the region has clearly being scarred by the crisis, as consumers and companies in the West slow their spending on imported goods, knocking over a major pillar of Asian growth. 
 The new figures released on Thursday herald more pain to come, as manufacturers in the region respond to falling export sales by lowering output and cutting their own costs. And they dampened hopes that robust demand in the giant Chinese economy would cushion the downturn for neighboring countries. 
 In Japan, where exporters are suffering the added burden of a strong yen that makes their goods harder for overseas customers to afford, a number of companies have been obliged to tighten belts and lower their earnings expectations. For example, Sony, which may report a loss for the financial year ending March, has already laid off thousands of workers, and is expected soon to announce details of further measures. 
 The latest figures also raise the pressure on policy makers in the region to step up their already considerable efforts to stimulate their economies. 
 The Chinese authorities worry that a slowdown could produce social unrest as factories shut and tens of thousands of jobs are lost. They announced an immense stimulus package in November, focused on infrastructure projects, and economists believe that further measures, such as tax cuts, may be announced around the time of the Chinese New Year holiday next week. 
 China has more room to further reduce interest rates and step up spending than most other countries do. But exports are contracting, and domestic spending is looking painfully feeble, not least because ordinary Chinese tend to spend less and save more of their income than people in other countries do, to compensate for the country's meager state provisions for health care and pensions. 
 In Japan, the central bank, which has already lowered its short-term lending rates to near zero, is expected after its policy meeting on Thursday to announce details of a plan to help companies finance day-to-day operations by buying their commercial paper, a type of unsecured debt. 
 In South Korea, the central bank is expected to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on Feb. 12. It has already lowered the cost of borrowing by 2.75 percentage points since early October. 
 Further rate cuts and stimulus measures are also expected in China, which has much more financial leeway to shore up its giant economy than many of its neighbors do. 
 ''Signs the economy is stalled are rapidly growing more pronounced,'' economists at Goldman Sachs said in a research note issued Wednesday. ''Both exports and production fell much more sharply than expected in October-December 2008. The export/production slump is spreading throughout Asia. A domino effect can be seen, with the impact of the recessions in major Western economies triggering production/inventory corrections in Asia and this, in turn, buffeting Japan.''

HEADLINE: When Governments Take Over Industries in Trouble

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
''Nationalization'' typically refers to a government takeover of privately owned businesses.
 Historically, nationalization has usually taken place for ideological or political reasons. When the Socialist Party came to power in France in the 1980s, for example, politicians decided to bring companies in the banking, aerospace and steel sectors, among others, under state control. 
 Governments have also nationalized highly profitable industries. 
 Often, this takes place when a government decides it does not want foreign ownership of its valuable natural resources, said Catherine L. Mann, an economics professor at the International Business School at Brandeis University. In 2006, for example, Bolivia nationalized the country's oil and natural gas industries.
 While nationalized industries are usually successful at the time of a takeover, governments do sometimes step in when an industry is in trouble. 
 ''Nationalization can apply to industrial losers,'' said Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton. ''In that, it's sometimes called 'lemon socialism' -- taking industrial 'lemons' under the public wing.''
 The debate over whether the United States government should nationalize its banks -- and other industries deemed ''too big to fail'' -- falls into this category. 
 The American government has already injected cash into hundreds of financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 Whether this means the banks have technically been ''nationalized'' is debatable, as the government has so far not been actively running these institutions. Some argue that the government should take more control of these financial institutions, both in terms of ownership and governance, as Sweden did in the 1990s. CATHERINE RAMPELL

HEADLINE: How Green Is My Orange?

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: BRADENTON, Fla. 

 BODY:
How much does your morning glass of orange juice contribute to global warming?
 PepsiCo, which owns the Tropicana brand, decided to try to answer that question. It figured that as public concern grows about the fate of the planet, companies will find themselves under pressure to perform such calculations. Orange juice seemed like a good case study.
 PepsiCo hired experts to do the math, measuring the emissions from such energy-intensive tasks as running a factory and transporting heavy juice cartons. But it turned out that the biggest single source of emissions was simply growing oranges. Citrus groves use a lot of nitrogen fertilizer, which requires natural gas to make and can turn into a potent greenhouse gas when it is spread on fields. 
 PepsiCo finally came up with a number: the equivalent of 3.75 pounds of carbon dioxide are emitted to the atmosphere for each half-gallon carton of orange juice. But the company is still debating how to use that information. Should it cite the number in its marketing, and would consumers have a clue what to make of it? 
 PepsiCo's experience is a harbinger of the complexities other companies may face as they come under pressure to calculate their emission of carbon dioxide, a number known as a carbon footprint, and eventually to lower it.
 ''The main thing is helping us figure out where the carbon is in the chain,'' said Neil Campbell, president of Tropicana North America, a division of PepsiCo. While acknowledging that protocols for measuring greenhouse emissions are far from perfect, Mr. Campbell said, ''you can end up doing nothing if you let that stop you.''
 PepsiCo, a manufacturer of soda, salty snacks and cereal based in Purchase, N.Y., is among a growing number of companies that hope to get ahead of potential government mandates and curb their energy use as prices and long-term supply grow less certain. 
 They also want to promote supposedly low-carbon products to consumers anxious about rising global temperatures; such labeling has already appeared in Europe.
 The list of companies that have taken steps to reduce carbon emissions includes I.B.M., Nike, Coca-Cola and BP, the oil giant. Google, Yahoo and Dell are among the companies that have vowed to become ''carbon neutral.''
 PepsiCo is among the first that will provide consumers with an absolute number for a product's carbon footprint, which many expect to be a trend. The information will be posted on Tropicana's Web site. The company has not yet decided if it will eventually put it on the package. 
 While carbon reduction efforts are generally welcomed by environmentalists, some complain that the marketing claims are backed by fuzzy numbers and dubious assumptions.
 Standards exist for determining a carbon footprint, but companies can apply them in different ways. They can decide how rigorous they want to be in counting emissions in the supply chain, and what data sources they should use in the process. 
 ''Any time people are making a legitimate effort to reduce emissions directly or indirectly with their product and services, most of us would think that is a good thing,'' said Michael Gillenwater, dean of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, a nonprofit organization that teaches greenhouse gas management and accounting.
 ''The trick is when you try to put a strict label that has implications for comparing your product to another product, or implying that you have no climate change impact,'' he said.
 Nancy Hirshberg, vice president for natural resources at the yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm, said measuring a carbon footprint is a ''fabulous tool'' for pinpointing areas to reduce emissions. For instance, her company was surprised to learn that milk production was a far bigger contributor to greenhouse gas emissions than its factory.
 But she said there were so many variables in determining a carbon footprint that an absolute number was meaningless as a marketing tool.
 ''I'm thrilled that people are thinking about their carbon footprint, but to put a number on a package is misleading at best,'' she said.
 PepsiCo's interest in determining the carbon footprint of its products began in England, where carbon anxiety is further advanced than in the United States. In 2007, Walkers, a PepsiCo brand, published the carbon footprint of its potato chips on its Web site and on the package.
 Mr. Campbell, who ran the Walkers brand, championed the idea when he came to Tropicana at the beginning of 2008. As was the case with Walkers, Tropicana hired an outside auditor, the Carbon Trust, to review its calculations and certify its footprint. The Carbon Trust was set up by the British government to accelerate progress toward a low-carbon economy.
 Making orange juice is relatively straightforward: the oranges are picked by hand, trucked to the plant, squeezed, pasteurized and packed into cartons and shipped by train to distribution points around the country. Early on, company officials roughed out the carbon footprint of Tropicana juice. But when the Carbon Trust came back with its own calculations, that initial estimate was off by more than 20 percent.
 Growing the oranges accounted for a larger share -- about a third -- than PepsiCo had expected, almost entirely because of the production and application of fertilizer.
 Now, PepsiCo managers said they planned to work with their growers and with researchers at the University of Florida to find ways to grow oranges using less carbon. And they are starting to grapple with ways to teach the public how to interpret the carbon footprint of a product. 
 PepsiCo is scheduled to announce its Tropicana results on Thursday, and will publish carbon-footprint numbers for products including Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Gatorade. Said Bryan Lembke, a PepsiCo manager on the project: ''If you don't measure it, you can't improve it.''

Internet Giants 
 Return to Basics
 Microsoft and Google have more in common than the dominance of their respective markets. Both are also essentially one-trick ponies that have used their prodigious cash flows to pursue many side projects in attempts to diversify. And neither has had much success.
 A trying economic climate is reining in their efforts. Google, the more recent empire builder, just axed its print advertisement ambitions, and Microsoft sold its long-held stake in the cable operator Comcast. Their other noncore projects should be next. 
 Microsoft's core expertise remains software -- its ubiquitous operating system and other programs. These account for 82 percent of its revenue and nearly all of its operating income. The company has used a lot of those profits to support forays into products like video games and online search. 
 But those have not become the money spinners it hoped for. Microsoft's Xbox game console just turned its first profit last year after seven years on the market. In 2007, the company had to take a $1 billion charge to repair defective units. Microsoft's online search effort has also struggled. Its MSN portal has a dismal 8.5 percent share of the American search market, and the unit that houses it lost $480 million last quarter. 
 Google makes virtually all its revenue from advertising related to Internet searches. Still, that has not stopped it from pouring money -- and employee time -- into online video, cloud computing and lobbying for renewable energy projects.
 For example, it snapped up YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006. Analysts say the video site remains barely profitable. The same goes for Google's free online software initiative, in which it has invested heavily. 
 Of course, some loss leaders can be strategically valuable. Google's online utilities directly threaten its search rival Microsoft's cash-cow software business. And Microsoft's hordes of loyal Xbox gamers may add a crucial bit of cachet to the otherwise stolid reputation of its software.
 But with both companies' shares down sharply over the last year, and few of these noncore projects generating money, shareholders have diminished tolerance for using profits to finance long shots. Investors would probably applaud if Microsoft and Google shed more of these nonessential distractions.
 A Safe Haven
 Huge projected budget deficits in the United States may cause investors to seek a new haven. Germany, with a modest government budget shortfall and only limited stimulus plans, is an excellent candidate. However, profligate southern European economies endanger the euro and reduce Germany's attractions. 
 Investor worry about the credit quality of the United States government is reflected in the cost of insuring government debt against default. This has increased considerably in recent months, to $70,000 for five years of credit protection on $10 million of debt as of Jan. 20, from only $2,000 in July 2007.
 That is well above Japan's $42,000, even though Japan has much more debt outstanding than the United States in proportion to its gross domestic product. The increased cost of insuring United States debt is, however, unsurprising, given that its budget deficit in the 2009 fiscal year is projected to swell to $1.19 trillion, or 8.3 percent of gross domestic product, before adding the cost of President Obama's proposed $825 billion two-year stimulus plan. 
 Recent relatively weak sales of Treasuries suggest that safety-seeking investors are already looking elsewhere. Given its debt load, Japan is an implausible alternative, while Britain and Switzerland carry the risks of their overblown financial sectors. Canada and Australia are somewhat small to offer homes for China's and Japan's trillion-dollar official reserves, and their economies may suffer from the commodity price decline. France has its merits, but over all Germany appears the best safe haven. 
 Germany has a payments surplus of 8 percent of gross domestic product and a budget deficit expected to be no more than 4 percent of the economy in 2009 and 2010. It also has cautious economic policies that delight safety-seeking investors, and $2.5 trillion in government debt, enough to provide liquidity. 
 But there is a catch: Germany's membership in the euro zone. This presents complications because of the perilous fiscal and economic positions of several other members. Portugal, Greece and Spain have had their debt downgraded recently by Standard & Poor's and have payments deficits around 10 percent of G.D.P., while Italy has enormous public debt and poor budgetary control. 
 Germany may eventually be faced with the unpleasant alternative of watching the euro area break up as several countries leave it, or burdening its budget with loans to its southern neighbors. Either way, its safe haven status would no longer look as safe.

HEADLINE: Growing Need for Medicaid Puts Added Financial Burden on States

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK and KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. 

 BODY:
Medicaid rolls are surging, by unprecedented rates in some states, as the recession tightens its grip on the economy and Americans lose their employer-sponsored health coverage along with their jobs. 
 In a number of states, Medicaid populations grew by 5 percent to 10 percent in the last 12 months and, in many, the growth rate was at least double what it had been in the previous year. State Medicaid officials also say that because enrollment often lags behind job losses by several months, the growth in 2008 may represent only the leading edge of heightened demand.
 In most states, much of the growth in Medicaid has been among children from low-income families, who constitute about half of all recipients. The program also provides coverage for those with disabilities, pregnant women, nursing home residents, and in some instances parents of covered children and childless adults. 
 In a nationwide survey, with 40 states responding, The New York Times found that in some cases the surge in enrollment had overwhelmed social services agencies, and prompted state fiscal analysts to shred estimates that were often only six months old. 
 Here in Gwinnett County, an Atlanta suburb that is home to a growing immigrant population, Medicaid enrollment ballooned by 26 percent from July 2007 to July 2008, according to state officials. One day last fall, the waiting area in the office of the county's Department of Family and Children Services was so packed with applicants that the fire marshal insisted that another room be opened for overflow.
 ''There's just been a steady increase in the numbers, and it has followed the economy,'' said Glenda G. McMillan, the regional director over the Gwinnett County office. ''And there's no one population. We're seeing the newly unemployed, the underemployed. There's just an array of need out there.''
 But Georgia was hardly alone in seeing substantial jumps in enrollment. Kentucky, which had budgeted last year for increases of 1,000 new Medicaid enrollees per month, has averaged more than triple that since June. In Colorado, which had forecast enrollment growth of about 1 percent for this fiscal year, state officials now project it will be eight times higher. 
 In Florida, which is experiencing some of the fastest Medicaid growth in the country (10.4 percent for the 12 months ending in November), the current caseload is the highest since the program's creation in 1965, officials there said. Utah officials expect their state's Medicaid enrollment to grow by 13 percent this year, after declining by 3 percent a year earlier. 
 To help states handle what is rapidly becoming an unmanageable burden, President Obama and Congressional Democrats are negotiating a sizable increase in federal aid to state Medicaid programs as part of their economic stimulus package. Among other initiatives, they are considering extending eligibility to those who have lost jobs that did not provide health benefits and who do not therefore have the option of continuing employer-sponsored coverage under the federal Cobra law.
 Some details remain to be worked out, but a bill outlined by House Democrats would provide states with $87 billion in additional Medicaid support from Washington over two years, in a recovery plan worth $825 billion. It would be among the largest expenditures in the stimulus package, and a significant increase over the $10 billion in Medicaid relief that the federal government sent to the states in 2003 and 2004, when the last recession also brought spikes in enrollment. As then, a likely condition for the assistance would be that states not constrict eligibility for the program during the downturn.
 Eligibility for the income-based program can vary widely by state. But at any one time last year, Medicaid was providing coverage to an average of 50 million people, or about one of every six in the United States. The cost of the program -- $333 billion in 2007 -- is shared by state and federal governments, with Washington roughly matching the spending approved by the states. The federal government currently picks up about 57 percent of the tab, eating up 7 percent of the federal budget, and the program is one of the largest drains on every state's budget.
 As in any economic downturn, the countercyclical program now faces a grim fiscal paradox: by definition, demand for Medicaid coverage is highest precisely when states are least able to afford it because of shrinking tax revenues. 
 Lawmakers returning to state capitals across the country are preparing to negotiate significant reductions in Medicaid spending by freezing or reducing reimbursements to hospitals and physicians, by eliminating coverage options like dental and vision benefits, and by narrowing eligibility for the program.
 Although some states are cutting benefits and eligibility, the reductions thus far have been concentrated on reimbursement rates for providers. In Nevada, for instance, the state cut payments for hospital stays by 5 percent in September, prompting the only public hospital in Las Vegas to shut down its outpatient cancer and dialysis clinics. Rates for pediatric specialists were reduced by as much as 41 percent. Provider payments also have been cut in California, Minnesota, New York, South Carolina and Utah, among others.
 As it is, many physicians will not accept Medicaid patients because they say reimbursement rates are too low to be profitable.
 ''We had been on a march to increase our provider rates over the last few years,'' said Dr. Sandeep Wadhwa, Medicaid director for Colorado, ''and that march has come to a complete halt as we try to come up with a plan to manage the increase in caseload with the shortfall in revenues.'' The stimulus plan being negotiated in Washington would most likely divide about half of the Medicaid relief evenly among states, said officials close to the discussions. The rest would be allocated according to a formula that would favor states hit hardest by job losses. 
 In the House proposal, states would be allowed to extend Medicaid eligibility to people who have lost jobs since Sept. 1, with the federal government paying all of the costs. It also would provide a 65 percent subsidy for the first 12 months of Cobra coverage for those who have lost jobs since Sept. 1, as many unemployed people find they cannot afford to continue that insurance without their employer's contributions. 
 The bill would extend Cobra coverage, which is currently limited to 18 months, for terminated workers who are at least 55 or who had kept the same job for 10 years. They would be allowed to maintain Cobra, at their own expense, until they become eligible for Medicare at age 65 or secured health benefits through a new job.
 Taken together, those measures are expected to cost $38.9 billion and to help 8.5 million people maintain coverage, according to Congressional aides. 
 The House stimulus bill also includes $20 billion to speed the computerization of health records, $3 billion to bolster prevention and wellness programs, $1.5 billion to expand community health centers, $1.1 billion to gather data on the effectiveness of medical practices, $600 million to help train primary care providers, and $550 million to modernize Indian Health Service clinics and hospitals.
 Congress is also expected to pass a significant expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, financed largely by an increase in the federal tobacco tax. That program is intended to cover children of the working poor who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford insurance.
 Last week, the House approved a bill that would add $32.3 billion to the program over four and a half years by raising the tobacco tax by 69 cents, to $1 a pack. Supporters believe the bill, which is similar to one vetoed in 2007 by President George W. Bush, could add about four million children to the program, which currently insures about seven million people. Mr. Obama has said he would sign the measure. 
 Government economists expect the unemployment rate, which rose to 7.2 percent in December from 4.9 percent a year earlier, to approach double-digits this year. A study conducted last April for the Kaiser Family Foundation projected that every increase of 1 percentage point in unemployment would generate 1.1 million more uninsured and 1 million more recipients of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
 The Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University estimated in November that 4.1 million people -- including 1.2 million children -- had lost employer-sponsored health coverage in the previous year, and that 1.7 million of them had enrolled in public insurance programs.
 Here in Gwinnett County, Candice N. Freeman, 27, lost her health benefits along with her $41,000-a-year job as an administrative assistant when she was laid off in October after four years with a flooring company. Earlier this month, with her 4-year-old daughter in tow, she found herself applying for the first time for food stamps and Medicaid at the Gwinnett office. Her daughter is already covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program, but Ms. Freeman said that because she had lost her insurance she had been deferring treatment for a gynecological condition, as well as for persistent headaches.
 ''It would be a blessing to be able to get it,'' she said. ''Just being able to go and make sure I'm O.K. would be a big thing to me because I have to take care of my child.'' 
 In many states, the growth in Medicaid caseloads has been particularly striking because it reversed the trend line of two years ago, when enrollment declined nationally for the first time in a decade. That was at least partly because of new federal requirements that applicants provide verification of their identity and citizenship.
 In the last recession, annual enrollment growth peaked at 9.5 percent in 2002. Few states approached that level last year, but many are now on the way and project double-digit increases this year. In the Times's survey, which was conducted over the last month, 16 of the 40 states that responded had experienced growth of at least 5 percent during the last 12 months that data was available. Many states also reported enrollment increases, albeit smaller, in their Children's Health Insurance Program.
 Dr. Rhonda M. Medows, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Health, said the depth and breadth of this recession had made it difficult to forecast caseloads for this year and next. 
 ''Normally, when people lose their jobs or fear they're going to lose their jobs they have some confidence they may find something in a couple of months,'' Dr. Medows said. ''But this recession is unlike any other because it's housing, it's credit, it's the financial industry, it's everything and I don't know that consumers have that confidence.''

HEADLINE: Publisher Rethinks the Daily: It's Free And Printed and Has Blogs All Over

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Amid the din of naysayers who insist that newspapers are on the verge of death, a new company wants to start dozens of new ones -- with a twist. 
 The Printed Blog, a Chicago start-up, plans to reprint blog posts on regular paper, surrounded by local ads, and distribute the publications free in big cities. 
 The first issues of this Internet-era penny-saver will appear in Chicago and San Francisco on Tuesday. They will start as weeklies, but Joshua Karp, the founder and publisher, hopes eventually to publish free neighborhood editions of The Printed Blog twice a day in many cities around the country. 
 ''We are trying to be the first daily newspaper comprised entirely of blogs and other user-generated content,'' he said. ''There were so many techniques that I've seen working online that maybe I could apply to the print industry.'' 
 As pay newspapers lose readers to the Internet, where they can read the same articles without charge, many free papers have held their own. 
 ''The free newspaper business model is still very workable,'' said David Cohen, a founder of Silicon Valley Community Newspapers, a group of free weeklies south of San Francisco that was sold to Knight Ridder in 2005 and is now owned by MediaNews. ''There's a huge readership that wants the local news, and local businesses tend to increase their advertising in bad times because they have to capture people's attention.'' 
 Still, Mr. Karp does not have to look far to see the difficulties of being successful in the newspaper business these days. The Tribune Company, which publishes The Chicago Tribune and its free daily, RedEye, filed for bankruptcy protection in December. 
 Mr. Karp is betting he can make his business work by combining the best of the print and Web models. 
 The Printed Blog will publish blog posts alongside other Weblike content, like user-submitted photographs and readers' comments. The paper will be printed on three or four 11-by-17-inch sheets of white paper and laid out like a blog instead of in columns. 
 Users will eventually be able to log on to its site, theprintedblog.com, to choose which blogs they want in their edition, and editors will decide which posts make the paper. A city the size of Chicago could have 50 separate editions tailored to individual neighborhoods. 
 The Printed Blog also expects to duck many of the major costs that make traditional newspapers expensive to produce. The company will put commercial printers in the homes of its distributors, avoiding the circulation costs of papers with large, central printing presses. Advertisers will eventually be able to buy ads on the Web site, so The Printed Blog will not need to employ many sales people. 
 By publishing articles written by bloggers who are already diligently covering topics as varied as town politics and local fashion, Mr. Karp can slash one of the biggest expenses of a newspaper: reporters. So far, 300 bloggers have given The Printed Blog permission to publish their work for a share of the ad revenue, including small-audience bloggers in Chicago and nationally known blogs like Daily Kos. 
 The arrangement is mutually beneficial, said Lauren Dimet Waters, editor in chief of Second City Style, a Chicago blog that has agreed to be reprinted. ''If they can make money off of our blog, I can't imagine we wouldn't, too, because of the exposure,'' she said. ''If it gets us exposure to 20 new people, then I'll be happy.'' 
 Mr. Karp will still need to pay for paper, ink and contractors to print and distribute the papers. Those costs add up, which is one reason the Internet spawned bloggers in the first place. 
 Advertising remains print's one great advantage over Web publications: advertisers will pay much more for print ads than for online ones. Mr. Karp aims to sell 200 ads an issue. The Printed Blog will charge $5 to $10 for classifieds and $15 to $25 for business ads that reach 1,000 readers. 
 Mr. Karp, who previously founded a software company called Freerain Systems and sold it to ESM Solutions in 2007, has invested $15,000 in The Printed Blog. He receives free office space from the Illinois Technology Association, and his 10 staff members are volunteers who work on their personal laptops. He plans to raise venture capital to pay employee salaries and eventually expand. 
 Mr. Karp expects that each issue, to be distributed twice a day to 1,000 people, will eventually have enough ads to earn a profit of $750 to $1,500 a week. (In comparison, Mr. Cohen said that a typical weekly edition of one of the free Silicon Valley papers that reached about 20,000 people would cost about $10,000 to produce, with an operating profit margin of 11 percent to 15 percent.)
 Advertisers will like The Printed Blog, Mr. Karp said, because it is hyper-local. ''A clothing boutique or snow removal service can advertise to the 2,000 people who are most likely to buy the service, as opposed to many, many more,'' he said. 
 About 15 advertisers have signed on for the first issue, including Flowerpetal.com, a florist in Chicago. ''The great thing about it is you can change your pitch based on different neighborhoods,'' said Brian Crummy, Flowerpetal.com's founder. 
 Ads from local businesses are one reason that free dailies have been a rare bright spot in the newspaper industry. Unlike struggling car companies and department stores, which are mainstay advertisers of metropolitan dailies, small businesses have increased their ad spending during the recession, several publishers said. 
 ''All growth in the newspaper industry for the last 20 years has been in free papers, and the fastest-growing segment of that for the last five years has been in free dailies,'' said H. Harrison Cochran, publisher of The Aurora Sentinel in Colorado and past president of Suburban Newspapers of America. 
 Still, the economic crisis has not spared free papers. In November, free dailies in Kitsap County, Wash.; Eureka, Calif.; and Norfolk, Va., closed. In December, the three-year-old Bluffton Today in Bluffton, S.C., started charging for the paper because of falling advertising and rising costs of ink and newsprint. Its circulation has since shrunk to 6,500, from 15,000, Tim Anderson, the paper's publisher, said. 
 Mr. Cohen, who was recently laid off by MediaNews, said The Printed Blog's potential challenges would be magnified by its plan to publish dozens of niche papers. ''It just sounds daunting,'' he said. ''To me, that's why the Internet was invented.''

HEADLINE: Ethics Panel Chief Vows High Standards

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
The newly appointed chairwoman of the House ethics committee pledged Wednesday to hold members of the House to the highest standard of conduct, but Congressional aides said it was too soon to tell when the panel would resume its investigation into the personal finances and fund-raising of Representative Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 Representative Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California, was chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday to head the ethics committee, or House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, as it is formally known. Ms. Lofgren is an eight-term member of Congress who served on the committee from 1996 through 2002. 
 ''Having served for six years as a member of the committee earlier in my Congressional tenure, I've seen first-hand the immensely important role it plays,'' she said in a statement. ''Without the public's trust and confidence, government loses its legitimacy. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct exists to ensure that the House of Representatives maintains that trust and confidence, and in turn its legitimacy.'' 
 The committee, which conducts its proceedings in secret, began investigating Mr. Rangel this fall, after news reports that he had accepted four rent-stabilized apartments from a prominent New York City developer, failed to pay taxes on rental income from a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic and had used Congressional stationery to solicit donations for a City College of New York project to be named in his honor. 
 The investigation was later expanded after news reports about Mr. Rangel's efforts to preserve a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive pledged $1 million to the City College project and whose lobbyist had discussed legislation authorizing the tax shelter with the congressman on the day it was being considered by the Ways and Means Committee.
 The ethics committee interrupted its work when Congress adjourned last month and will not resume it until Ms. Pelosi names four new Democrats to the panel to replace departing members, and the Democratic caucus votes to affirm the appointment of Ms. Lofgren, most likely later this week.
 Mr. Rangel, a Democrat from Harlem, has figured prominently in developments since Congress reconvened this month. He helped shape President Obama's economic stimulus package, and he suggested that he might once again propose a controversial measure to reinstitute a military draft. 
 Mr. Rangel has said he has no intention of allowing the ethics inquiry to overshadow his legislative agenda.
 ''There are just more important things going on right now,'' he said last week through his spokesman, Matthew Beck. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Beck said Mr. Rangel had no comment on Ms. Lofgren's selection.
 Republicans have repeatedly called for Mr. Rangel to step down as Ways and Means Committee chairman until the inquiry is complete. 
 ''The massive economic stimulus legislation to be considered by the House Ways and Means Committee is tremendously important and will have profound effects,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner, a Republican from Ohio. ''The process of developing this should not be overseen by someone facing such serious charges.''
 Democratic House leaders have rebuffed calls to remove Mr. Rangel as chairman. 
 Some Congressional analysts have argued that because Mr. Rangel's position as Ways and Means Committee chairman gives him immense power over other members, the investigation into his conduct should be handled by an outside body to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Norman J. Ornstein, a Congressional analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Rangel investigation would have been best taken up by the newly created Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent office comprising former representatives.
 Ms. Lofgren's selection as chairwoman was generally applauded by government ethics groups, who say she has built a reputation for independence.
 ''She's not someone who is going to back down for the sake of her party,'' Mr. Ornstein said.

HEADLINE: Cabinet Choices

 BODY:
If ever there was a moment when the Senate should have used the confirmation process to delve into the big issues confronting the nation, it was at Wednesday's hearing for Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy Geithner. 
 Unfortunately, Mr. Geithner's self-inflicted tax problems made that hard. But even after the nominee admitted that his failure to pay tens of thousands of dollars in federal taxes had been ''careless'' but ''unintentional'' (he has since paid back taxes, plus interest) members of the Finance Committee were not terribly sharp in their questions about how Mr. Geithner will help President Obama face down the country's desperate financial problems.
 We were not impressed with Mr. Geithner's excuses for his tax problems, but barring any new damaging disclosures, we heard nothing disqualifying. He is clearly an intelligent man and Mr. Obama is entitled to pick his own team. 
 Wall Street is also comfortable with the choice. That is an endorsement that cuts both ways -- but one that could advance the cause of renewed regulation if Mr. Obama lives up to his promises and is a strong champion for regulatory reform. 
 We still don't have a clear picture of Mr. Geithner's role -- as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the past five years -- in the decisions to bail out Bear Stearns, the American International Group and Citigroup, or the decision to let Lehman Brothers go under. 
 The Finance Committee is expected to approve his nomination Thursday, but before the full Senate votes, we hope that we will hear more from Mr. Geithner and the president on their plans for unraveling the nation's desperate financial mess. 
 At the hearing, Mr. Geithner was unchallenged when he said that the disastrous collapse of Lehman Brothers last September occurred because the government had no legal authority to intervene. That narrative surfaced weeks after the collapse and contradicts explanations given at the time.
 It is certainly not the type of open, transparent, and fully accountable explanation that the new president is promising. 
 At the hearing, Mr. Geithner did give a good general outline of the administration's plan to right the nation's financial system, saying Mr. Obama would lay out, ''we hope in the next few weeks,'' a comprehensive plan to get the banks lending again, to address the foreclosure crisis and to directly address the lack of credit to small businesses and consumers. 
 Like most nominees, Mr. Geithner gave vague answers when asked more detailed questions. He promised new financial regulation, but also referred often to a new regulatory ''framework.'' It remains to be seen if the goal is to put in place robust new rules or -- as the Bush team proposed last year -- just rearrange agencies. 
 The entire Obama economic team earned their stripes -- for good and more often ill -- during the deregulatory and self-regulatory efforts of the 1990s and this decade. The nation needs more and better information and reassurance, about what they have learned from that past and how they will lead the nation in the vastly different direction that Mr. Obama has promised.

HEADLINE: A Busy Night on the Town, Then a Busier Day at the Office

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was 8:35 a.m. when President Obama walked into the Oval Office on Wednesday, taking a seat behind the desk for the first time. An envelope was waiting, affixed with an inscription that needed no explanation: ''To #44, From #43.''
 For the next 10 minutes, Mr. Obama sat alone, reading the note from George W. Bush.
 And with that, the first full day of the Obama administration formally began. The day carried the anticipation and chaos of opening day at a brand new school, which led to a string of basic questions from members of the staff: Which bathroom am I allowed to use? Can we eat lunch at the White House Mess? When will my log-on arrive so I can use a computer? 
 The employees who reported to duty on Wednesday were admittedly bleary-eyed, a fact that was overlooked because the boss was, too. Mr. Obama arrived back to the White House just before 1 a.m. after an appearance at his 10th inaugural ball.
 But by sunrise, framed pictures of Mr. Obama's swearing-in ceremony were already hanging on the walls in the West Wing, a sign that business moves at an extraordinary pace at the White House, where the clock is already ticking. 
 THE OVAL OFFICE
 President Obama had been inside the Oval Office only twice before. When he arrived Wednesday, he seemed to feel more at home than during his previous visits. There he was, sitting behind the desk, which is the same one used by George W. Bush and a string of presidents before him, including John F. Kennedy. 
 A bright morning sunshine, pouring in through the tall windowpanes, illuminated his face. In a photograph distributed by the White House, Mr. Obama could be seen sitting between two flags, holding the telephone to his left ear.
 He wore a white shirt and a blue tie, with his suit coat not visible in the picture. And that simple fact signaled a change in the White House. Mr. Bush had a hard-and-fast rule: neither he nor his guests were allowed in the Oval Office without a jacket and tie. 
 A second photograph sent out by the White House showed Mr. Obama talking with Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff. In this image, both men wore full suits.
 At 9:10 a.m., Michelle Obama walked down from the residence to the West Wing for her first look at the Oval Office. That moment was intended to be private, aides said, with no photographs released.
 THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM
 The briefing room, perhaps one of the most familiar-looking places in the White House, was teeming with reporters. The seats were filled, but the lectern remained dark.
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, dropped his initial plan to hold a briefing on the president's first full day in office. With his staff busy filling out paperwork, being cleared through security and attending orientation, there was too little time to prepare for a full-blown question-and-answer session.
 The Lower Press Office on the first floor of the West Wing was locked until about 9 a.m., when Bill Burton, a deputy White House press secretary, opened the sliding door. He sat in the office alone as a line of reporters waited for any morsel of information about the president's day, which by that point was already well under way.
 ''If you guys give me 15 minutes, I will send something out,'' Mr. Burton said, wearing a smile as he greeted a new correspondent from French TV and shook hands with veteran reporters, like Ann Compton of ABC News, who dropped in to say hello.
 Fresh coats of paint -- a buttery yellow -- covered the walls in the press offices and throughout the West Wing. The computers were freshly cleaned and the ''O's'' remained in place on all of the keyboards. (Eight years ago, When George W. Bush arrived, a few ''W's'' were said to be missing.) 
 ''Welcome,'' read a message on a red note card, marked with the presidential seal, that is placed on the computers. ''For assistance with facility service issues, office layout and furniture please contact the Facilities Management Office.''
 The requests for assistance quickly piled up: Staff members could not log on to their computers and were running out of paper in their white legal pads. The BlackBerries and cellphones had yet to arrive. 
 As midmorning approached, more reporters had arrived than members of the president's staff, who had not yet gained access to the White House. So Mr. Burton was handling the volume of visitors by himself when another reporter walked in.
 ''Good morning,'' Mr. Burton said.
 ''I came to introduce myself,'' the woman said. ''I'm Helen Thomas.''
 THE DAILY TICK-TOCK
 The first public schedule of the day was released at noon, and it drew a round of applause from reporters. Why? It was a sign that the White House e-mail system was up and running -- for a few staff members, anyway.
 This is what Mr. Obama's first public schedule looked like:
 1:15 p.m. - 2:15 p.m. President Obama addresses staff and cabinet secretaries 
 Pool Press 
 2:30 p.m. President Obama attends White House open house 
 Base of staircase on the ground level by State Room.
 Pool Press 
 3:15 p.m. - 3:45 p.m. President Obama meets with economic advisers
 Roosevelt Room
 Closed Press 
 4:15 p.m.-5:15 p.m. President Obama meets with Iraq military commanders
 Closed Press 
 Lest it be thought that Mr. Obama was calling it an early night, the lights remained on at 6 p.m. in the Oval Office, where Mr. Obama was meeting with advisers. 
 And his plans for the evening? Dropping by a celebration for people who worked on his campaign and his inauguration, where the band Arcade Fire was the marquee act. 
 ORDERING IN?
 The tomato soup from the White House Mess comes with a presidential seal.
 Ben LaBolt, an assistant press secretary, made that discovery when he and his colleagues ordered lunch on Wednesday afternoon. Fancy? Not quite. The chicken salad sandwich was served on a paper plate and the soup in plastic foam. But the cup was dressed up in gold-colored lettering that said, ''Seal of the President of the United States.''
 It is the only restaurant in America that can make that claim.
 MEETING THE STAFF
 Welcome to the White House. Did I tell you there won't be any pay raises?
 That was one of the messages that the president delivered to senior members of his administration who were sworn in on Wednesday afternoon. 
 During a ceremony in Room 450 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Obama signed the first executive order of his presidency, which included a measure intended to fulfill a campaign promise by closing what he called the ''revolving door'' of people who immediately move from government to lobbying. 
 But Mr. Obama acknowledged that he was still adjusting to the protocols and formality that go along with his power to change policy with the stroke of a pen.
 As he stepped to the lectern, which was fitted with the presidential seal, he had to tell his aides, who were standing for his entrance to the room, that they could sit. ''I'm still getting used to that whole thing,'' he said.
 AFTERNOON OPEN HOUSE
 There was not enough room to hold the two million people who turned out for the inauguration, but a lucky 200 people were invited to take a look inside the White House.
 After a brief tour, they arrived in the Blue Room, overlooking the Washington Monument. The president and first lady shook hands and stood in a receiving line. 
 ''Welcome, enjoy yourself,'' Mr. Obama told a young man in a black sweater. ''Roam around. Don't break anything.''
 The Obamas received an effusive greeting from Tracie Jones of Bessemer, Ala., who arrived in Washington at almost midnight Monday and watched the inauguration from the Mall.
 ''We just prayed, and thank the Lord!'' Ms. Jones said as she shook the president's hand. ''This is even better than we expected.''
 She told the president he was ''beautiful,'' but quickly corrected herself, saying: ''I mean, First Lady, you're beautiful!''
 As the door to the Blue Room opened, Linda Thomas of Philadelphia spied the Obamas as she pushed her elderly mother in a wheelchair through the North Front lobby.
 ''There's Barack! There's Barack!'' Ms. Thomas exclaimed, trying to maneuver the wheelchair for a better look.
 ''Ma'am,'' a Secret Service agent said, trying to get her attention. ''Ma'am? I can assure you, you're not going in there.''
 ''In there?'' Ms. Thomas asked excitedly, her plan to get a closer look thwarted.
 FUNNY MOMENT, OR NOT
 During the presidential race, it was a popular pastime for campaign workers to keep a list of gaffes -- or botched jokes -- made by Joseph R. Biden Jr. Perhaps the first entry in his vice-presidential file came Wednesday.
 In the swearing-in ceremony for senior staff, Mr. Obama asked Mr. Biden to administer the oath of office. For a moment, it seemed as though the vice president thought the swearing-in included him.
 ''Am I doing this again?'' Mr. Biden asked.
 ''Senior staff,'' Mr. Obama replied.
 ''My memory is not as good as Justice Roberts's, '' Mr. Biden said, referring to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s flubbed lines during the presidential swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday.
 Several staff members in the room laughed. The president did not, perhaps because six hours later, he would be sworn in again by Chief Justice Roberts.
 ALL EYES ON THE HILL
 All eyes in the White House were on the Senate confirmation debate on Hillary Rodham Clinton for secretary of state. There were discussions of whether she would be confirmed in time to make it to the White House for the president's first meeting on Iraq, which took place in the Situation Room.
 Mrs. Clinton was confirmed by a wide majority, but not soon enough to make the briefing.
 So Mr. Obama sat down privately with Secretary of State Clinton in the Oval Office.
 A FIRST SLEEPOVER
 On Tuesday night, their first at the White House, the Obama girls had a party of their own. 
 Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, had a sleepover party with classmates from Sidwell Friends School. They watched two movies -- ''High School Musical 3'' and ''Bolt'' -- and romped around the house in a scavenger hunt arranged by the White House staff.
 Perhaps the highlight? At the end of the hunt, the girls opened a door to find their favorite musical act: the Jonas Brothers. Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas were waiting inside. Surprise!

HEADLINE: Woodstock Without The Mud

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Having been lucky enough to attend two of the most memorable events in modern American history, I am able to report that Inauguration Day in Washington was very much like a cold-weather Woodstock.
 At both, there was a wonderful feeling of community. Along, of course, with the sense that at any moment, you could be trampled to death by thousands of very friendly people who were being moved around like the world's most mellow herd of cattle.
 The big difference was in the national reaction. The only people who felt unified during Woodstock were those who were there -- everybody else was horrified or jealous. But the inauguration left the whole country glued together emotionally, one big American ball of hope. 
 President Obama has made it clear that each of us has a role to perform, sacrifices to make in the great task of rebuilding the country. But his inaugural speech did not actually make those new duties look all that daunting. He mentioned firefighters running into burning buildings and parents nurturing their children, both of which have been going on for some time. He expressed hope that if a levee broke, we would help the refugees, and I have a feeling that in the event of another such crisis we will not disappoint. 
 On Wednesday in the Capitol, our elected officials seemed to be making at least a modest effort to respond to Obama's call to give up ''the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.'' The Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state 94 to 2, with Obama's newest BFF, John McCain, urging his colleagues to work together while other Republicans hopped up to sing Clinton's praises. ''A very ethical person and a wise person,'' chimed in Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
 Can you remember back when Hillary was first elected to the Senate eight years ago, and the Republican majority leader made the wistful suggestion that she might be hit by lightning before she was sworn in? Do you remember that just last year she was supposed to be the most divisive figure in American politics? Now, the Republicans can find only two people cranky enough to vote against putting her fourth in line of succession to the presidency.
 Meanwhile, over in the Finance Committee, most of the senators seemed reluctant to poke too hard at Obama's Treasury secretary nominee, Timothy Geithner, even though Geithner has a record of not having paid all his taxes. The Republicans left most of the real complaining to people like Jim Bunning of Kentucky. Given the fact that Bunning claimed his last opponent looked ''like one of Saddam Hussein's sons,'' we were not expecting him to be an early harbinger of the new era.
 ''Tim has made some mistakes, which he has freely admitted and corrected,'' said Charles Schumer of New York. This is what Geithner's supporters always say. It's their defenses that make him sound really indefensible.
 Despite the aid of a spiffy TurboTax program, Geithner neglected to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for the years he was employed by the International Monetary Fund. When the Internal Revenue Service audited his 2003 and 2004 returns and told him to hand over the money, it apparently did not occur to him that he had been working at the same job and paying taxes the same way in 2001 and 2002. It took a cabinet nomination to jog his memory.
 Nevertheless, most of the senators seem to feel that Geithner is, in the words of Charles Grassley, the Finance Committee's ranking Republican, ''not only the best choice,'' but the only choice. 
 The idea that there's only one man who can save the day in a time of great economic crisis is worrisome, given the number of indispensable financial giants who've turned out to be deeply dispensable on second look. (Let us pause to remember a presidential campaign past, in which McCain said that if Alan Greenspan, then the Federal Reserve chairman, were to die, he should be propped up and kept on the job anyway.) 
 Perhaps there's no time to start digging up a new Treasury secretary at this point. But we are starting the new era with the bar set surprisingly low.
 In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has decided to leave Charles Rangel in charge of the tax-setting Ways and Means Committee during an ethics investigation of his incredibly sloppy personal finances. In defense, she points out that the House leadership does have standards, and that she kicked former Representative William Jefferson off Ways and Means after investigators found $90,000 in marked bills hidden inside his freezer. In the Senate, Schumer argues that Geithner's errors ''pale before the myriad mistakes made by the operators of financial institutions.'' 
 Maybe we should have higher standards for our Treasury secretary than being better organized than Lehman Brothers. Really, we're ready for a new era that looks a little ... newer.

HEADLINE: The Falling Pound Raises Fears of Nationalization

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Julia Werdigier reported from London and Nelson D. Schwartz from Paris.

 BODY:
LONDON -- An island nation that bulked up on debt and lived beyond its means. A plunging currency. And a financial system edging toward nationalization.
With the pound at a multidecade low and British banks requiring ever-larger injections of taxpayer cash, it is no wonder that observers have started to refer to London as ''Reykjavik-on-Thames.''
While that judgment seems exaggerated, there are uncomfortable parallels between Iceland's recent financial downfall and Britain's trajectory. Equally important, news that widening bank losses in Britain have necessitated another round of government life support provides a stark example to the United States.
Washington's attempts to stabilize financial institutions have failed so far, as well. And now the Obama administration, along with the rest of the world, could watch Britain to see what a bank nationalization might look like, and what it might suggest for American banks. 
Ordinary Britons have a more basic worry. After relishing the boom that transformed the drab United Kingdom into Cool Britannia, they fear that the disheartening economic stagnation of the 1970s might return.
The pound, a symbol of British independence from the Continent that is revered nearly as much as the queen, is now down nearly 29 percent against the dollar from a year ago.
There has been a steady drumbeat of gloomy economic news for months, but the mood in Britain has darkened starkly in recent days.
On Monday, Royal Bank of Scotland warned that its 2008 losses could hit $:28 billion, or $38 billion, even as Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a second bailout package for the troubled banking sector worth tens of billions of pounds. Ultimately, the British rescue effort could cost at least $:350 billion, with some estimates ranging far higher.
But in contrast to last autumn, when Mr. Brown's first bailout plan was highly praised, this package has been greeted with anxiety. While few question the need for a quick response, the sheer scale of the borrowing being discussed, as well as the existing debt levels among corporations and consumers alike, alarms many analysts and economists.
''I fully back what the government is doing, but there is a risk of being Iceland on the Thames,'' said Will Hutton, an economic expert who is executive vice chairman of the Work Foundation, a nonprofit research firm. ''And the more sterling falls, the greater our liabilities in terms of what we owe.''
The pound fell to $1.3618 on Wednesday, its lowest level against the dollar since September 1985, before recovering to $1.3922.
Even more than their American counterparts, borrowers in Britain turned to local banks to fuel a real estate boom that was as much a national pastime as a rational decision about what to buy. Household debt as a percentage of disposable income hit 177 percent in 2007, compared with 141 percent in the United States.
Now, with both housing prices dropping and institutions like the Royal Bank of Scotland buckling, the British economic outlook looks even bleaker than the landscape in the United States and the euro zone, the countries that use the euro.
The British economy is expected to shrink by 2.9 percent this year, compared with a 2.6 percent drop in the euro zone and a 2.1 percent contraction in the United States, according to Gilles Moec, senior economist with the Bank of America in London.
To make matters worse, Mr. Moec said, Britain is facing a wave of deficit spending, as tax receipts fall and the costs of unemployment benefits and other services rise. He predicts the budget deficit will equal 9.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, compared with 4.9 percent in the euro zone and 8.4 percent in the United States.
''It's scary,'' he said. ''It reminds me of what you could find in southern Europe 15 years ago, during the worst years in Italy or Greece.''
British stocks have followed the pound lower in recent days as well. The benchmark FTSE index has fallen 2.1 percent this week, led by a plunge in the shares of many leading banks.
The government already controls a majority share in Royal Bank of Scotland, but the prospect of a full nationalization of the bank has alarmed investors, and shares of RBS have plunged 64 percent in the last three days. The prospect of nationalization haunts other troubled banks as well -- Barclays is down 33 percent and Lloyds Banking Group is off 54 percent.
As in Iceland, banks, real estate and other financial services boomed in London in recent years, even as other swaths of the economy withered. In recent years, this sector has been responsible for about half of total job growth in Britain even though it accounts for only about 30 percent of the economy, according to Peter Dixon, economist for Britain at Commerzbank in London.
Consumers were also lulled into taking on more and more debt by the unusually steady economic expansion Britain enjoyed until last year, Mr. Dixon said. Growth averaged 2.7 percent annually over the last decade. ''The last 10 years were phenomenally stable, with volatility at its lowest point since the 19th century,'' he said.
But that prosperity camouflaged a steadily weakening manufacturing base, unlike in Germany, where the industrial sector is a relative counterweight to the outsize problems of financial firms.
For all the debt weighing down British banks, though, Iceland's situation was far worse before the government was forced to nationalize the banking sector last fall as the krona collapsed.
British bank assets total about 4.5 times the country's gross domestic product, but in Iceland they were 10 times as large as the G.D.P., Mr. Hutton said.
That does not mean there is not a price to pay for Britons even now. The pound has plunged before and each time is remembered as a humiliating experience that scarred the nation.
In 1976, the government was forced to approach the International Monetary Fund for help after the pound dropped below $2 for the first time. In 1992, the pound dropped out of the European exchange rate mechanism as interest rates hit 15 percent and Britain was in a recession.
A weak pound also weighs on the psyche of the British, most of whom are reducing spending while watching a flood of euro- and dollar-rich tourists hunt for bargains in their shops.
Jeremy Stretch, senior currency strategist at Rabobank in London, said Britons might learn that a weak pound can be helpful.
A weaker pound would make British exporters more competitive, for example, thus reducing Britain's dependence on the City, as London's financial district is known, for future growth.
Mr. Stretch also said that Britain's current economic problems were different from the 1970s and 1990s because it was far from alone this time around.
''The salvation of the pound is that its problem is not a pound-specific problem,'' he said. ''At the moment, we're looking the ugliest. But if you sell the pound, what will you buy?''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama Takes Oath, and Nation in Crisis Embraces the Moment'' (front page, Jan. 21):
 As on election night, once again the celebrations are worldwide.
 The Rev. Joseph Lowery said Monday on ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' that President Obama may turn into a ''global president.'' 
 If we stay patient, and forgive him the many inevitable reversals and mistakes and setbacks in his efforts to help the American economy once again take off, and to inspire Middle Easterners and so many of the strife-torn around the world to -- in Mr. Lowery's inaugural allusions to Isaiah -- ''beat tanks into tractors,'' then the continuing worldwide party may -- as we all hope and pray it will -- turn out to be a harbinger of many good things to come. 
 James Adler
 Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 21, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 What a wonderful feeling it is to have a president unafraid to remind us that the real American dream is not conspicuous consumption or making a bundle on the stock market but life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that the true American way is not to expect great things for ourselves but to expect great things of ourselves.
 Let's hope President Obama's words will inspire a new generation to alter its collective perspective and work to make that dream and that way of life a reality, not only on our shores but also in every corner of the globe.

 To the Editor:
 Tuesday was historic and emotional, and for everyone who tuned in at 11:30 in the morning, it was a brilliant lesson in the history of our country. 
 As I watched, I kept thinking of my three children and all the thousands of children across our nation whose classroom TVs were tuned in to this historic and unbelievable event. 
 For me, it became bigger than Barack Obama's becoming the first African-American president (as big as that is); it was the first time I felt connected to being part of this country. It was almost like being back in college again, mesmerized by that professor whose passion for the lesson was the only thing that mattered. 
 I did feel as if I were back in college on Tuesday, and the lecture hall was the United States of America and our teacher was the most brilliant professor of all time, our new president!

 With one son in Thailand and the other son and my wife on the Mall, I watched the inauguration alone, because I feared that my own tears of joy and pride might distract others from Barack Obama's magnificent moment, when America decisively turned away from the Bush policies of fear and unilateralism and began to stitch together again the torn fabric of our ideals and our practice, with the help of Lincoln's and our ''better angels.''

 I am a middle-class American who for eight years felt that I was smarter, a more accomplished orator and a better leader than the man occupying the White House. Today, I feel humbled and ready to follow and help a man who far exceeds me in all of these attributes.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''President Obama'' (editorial, Jan. 21):
 The theme of Barack Obama's Inaugural Address was its tone. Often muscular and severe, the speech diagnosed the nation's problems with a cold eye, swept away objections to decisive action, and steeled the American people for the measures that will be necessary, all the while providing a positive vision of a remade America that stands firmly on American values and traditions. 
 Anyone who doubts that Barack Obama will act to address the nation's problems should be reassured.
 Joey Freeman
 Athens, Ga., Jan. 21, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Notwithstanding your front-page celebration of President Obama's supposed repudiation in his Inaugural Address of George W. Bush and all his works (''Rejecting Bush Era, Reclaiming Older Values,'' news analysis, Jan. 21), the president has made a good start in reaching out to conservatives and Republicans. 
 If he can change the tone of our politics so that it is considered inappropriate to demonize, rather than merely oppose, good men with whose policies one disagrees -- as the Democratic leadership and The New York Times have disgracefully reviled President Bush for overthrowing tyrants and seeking to protect us from mortal enemies -- President Obama will make a contribution to our culture for which we can all be grateful. 
 Godspeed, President Obama. May you exceed my expectations, confound my doubts and be so successful as to compel me to vote for your re-election in 2012. Howard F. Jaeckel 
 New York, Jan. 21, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I have heard that others feel that President Obama is lowering expectations. On this day, the expectations I have for myself are raised, not lowered. And I am glad to be asked to be a responsible and participating citizen. I will ask the same of my children.

HEADLINE: Panel Approves Transportation Nominee

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's nominee for transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, answered many questions and dodged a few others at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday and was effectively approved by acclamation. 
 The chairman of the Commerce and Transportation Committee, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, interrupted the mostly softball questions after nearly two hours to say there was a deadline of 4 p.m. for committee approval of any nominee who was going to get Senate confirmation that day.
 The ranking Republican member, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, gently corrected him, saying the deadline was 4:30 p.m.
 ''Being a realistic, responsible Republican here,'' Ms. Hutchison said, to general laughter. But she said she would convey her approval to the Republican leadership.
 In fact, Mr. Rockefeller cut the questioning short a few minutes later because the Senate was preparing to vote on the confirmation of Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state. 
 Mr. LaHood, in his testimony, made several important points. When Mr. Rockefeller asked about modernizing the air traffic control system, Mr. LaHood said his top priority was making labor peace with the controllers. He said he wanted the system run by people who ''like going to work every day.'' 
 The Bush administration imposed a contract on the controllers that eliminated some pay increases, required them to spend more hours at their work stations and made other changes. After the contract went into effect, many of those who were eligible for retirement left their jobs sooner than the agency had planned.
 Mr. LaHood, a Republican former congressman from Illinois, said his second priority was finding an F.A.A. administrator who could supervise modernization, a project called NextGen, working to set interim goals that were achievable in five to eight years to avoid ''having some pie-in-the-sky idea for getting to NextGen, without an avenue to do it.'' 
 He also said he expected his department to play an important role in the work done under the stimulus package that Congress is expected to pass soon.
 One committee member, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said, ''We count on the transportation secretary to keep our trains, buses and cars moving, but now we count on the transportation secretary to get our economy moving.'' 
 Mr. LaHood also promised to do all he could to get full financing for the Amtrak passenger railroad operation, which he called ''the lifeblood of many, many communities around the country.''

HEADLINE: Obama Convenes Financial Team Minus His Chief Economic Spokesman

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama convened his economic team on his first day in the White House amid renewed fears for the financial system's fragility and fresh criticism in Congress of his two-year recovery plan. Yet the seat remained empty for the man he has designated ''the chief economic spokesman for my administration.''
Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama's choice to be Treasury secretary, was instead awaiting confirmation by the Senate Finance Committee, where hours earlier he was grilled less about his prescriptions for the perilous times than about his personal failure to pay more than $34,000 in payroll taxes earlier in the decade. 
The hearing had been postponed after last week's disclosure of the delinquent payments, dashing the Obama team's hopes of having Mr. Geithner confirmed and in office on Wednesday.
Yet the Senate hearing, while uncomfortable for the nominee, showcased that the immensity of the economic threats trumped Mr. Geithner's personal tax controversy, even for some Republicans. In better times, such tax lapses might have doomed even a candidate of his respected credentials.
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Senate's second-ranking Republican, was especially critical and called Mr. Geithner's claims to be unaware of his payroll tax liability while at the International Monetary Fund ''implausible.''
Despite the fire, senators of both parties predicted Mr. Geithner would be confirmed. The Finance Committee will vote Thursday morning. The full Senate could vote next week, but Democrats said timing would depend on agreement from the Senate Republican leadership.
Mr. Geithner insisted his nonreporting of the payroll taxes on income from the I.M.F. from 2001 to 2004 were mistakes that were, in his words, careless and avoidable but unintentional. And he apologized to the senators ''for putting you in the position of having to spend so much time on these issues when there is so much pressing business before the country.''
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Finance Committee's senior Republican, acknowledged the panel's dilemma: He said Mr. Geithner, who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has had a lead role in the past months' financial rescue efforts, had ''unique insight into how we have gotten to where we are today,'' adding, ''To some he isn't merely the best choice; to some he is the only choice.''
''On the other hand,'' Mr. Grassley said, ''we need to consider how much the nominee's tax history could reflect on a secretary of Treasury. As secretary the nominee would be in charge of the I.R.S.'' Mr. Grassley has remained noncommittal.
Mr. Kyl, after the hearing, also chastised Mr. Geithner for extolling Mr. Obama's proposed recovery plan, an $825 billion package of spending and tax cuts as drafted in the House. Mr. Kyl called the package ''indefensible,'' adding to new criticism on Wednesday among lawmakers of both parties after the Congressional Budget Office reported that much of the spending would not occur until after 2010, suggesting the package would do little to jumpstart the economy.
House Republicans, who grouse that Democrats excluded them from work on the stimulus package, asked for a meeting with Mr. Obama. Senior Congressional aides said he would meet with bipartisan leaders of Congress on Friday.
In the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Geithner shed little light on the Obama administration's other plans for the economy but signaled a clear break from the Bush administration and the just-departed Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.
Mr. Geithner said the administration would soon propose overhauls of both the nation's porous system for regulating financial institutions and the $700 billion financial bailout program. Among the changes, he said, the bailout fund would be tapped to address the housing foreclosure crisis more aggressively.
Mr. Geithner declined to endorse several specific ideas for changing the bailout program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, including one to acquire soured mortgage assets from banks and house them in a so-called bad bank.
''I don't want to provide any specific details,'' he said at one point, but confirmed that the bad bank concept was under consideration. To explain his reticence, Mr. Geithner alluded to the biggest criticism lodged against previous financial rescues in which he was a junior partner with Mr. Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke: that the government's responses have zigzagged from one crisis to the next, which further rattled markets.
''We've seen the costs in terms of uncertainty created by tentative signals not followed up by clear actions, with not a lot of clarity on goals,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''And I don't want to, today, be in the position of magnifying the basic problem.''
Mr. Geithner acknowledged that the decision to let Lehman Brothers fail in September, after bailing out other financial giants, ''didn't cause this crisis but it absolutely made things worse.'' He insisted that Congress had not given the Fed or the Treasury the authority to provide the large amount of capital that Lehman needed to survive. He also said he and other officials had done all they could to find a buyer for Lehman, and to limit the fallout from its failure.
Several senators asked whether Mr. Geithner, who as New York Fed president is essentially Wall Street's watchdog, could have seen warning signs earlier. To one, he conceded his own supervision ''absolutely'' could have been better. But he also said he had taken steps at the New York Fed to draw attention to hedge funds, credit default swaps and other exotic instruments that have gone unregulated, and to the need by regulators for new powers.
On both the financial bailout and the stimulus, Mr. Geithner said the government would have to invest much more before the economy revives. Saying timid action had worsened past crises, he added, ''In a crisis of this magnitude, the most prudent course is the most forceful course.''
The $825 billion stimulus plan in the House meets the test, he said. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, disputed him, saying, ''I don't think the package is large enough.'' While some Democrats agree with him, some Republicans are complaining the package is too large.
The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, also said the measure must be revised substantially, but to avoid expanding the government and permanently increasing spending.
The House Appropriations Committee voted, 35 to 22, to send a major component of the recovery package to the House for a final vote, perhaps next week.

HEADLINE: Bank Sector Helps Shares Bounce Back

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Wall Street bounded back on Wednesday as investors hunted for bargains among battered financial stocks and cheered the prospect that Timothy F. Geithner would be confirmed as President Obama's Treasury secretary.
A day after the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 330 points and financial stocks posted their worst single-day drop in years, the banking sector pulled the broader indexes back up. Despite continuing concerns, big banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase recouped some of their losses.
The Dow sustained a rally most of the day and ended up 279.01 points, or 3.5 percent, to 8,228.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 4.3 percent, or 35.02 points, higher at 840.24. The Nasdaq finished up 4.6 percent, at 1,507.07. 
''The markets are searching for any kind of solace,'' said Tim Smalls, head of trading at Execution in Greenwich, Conn. ''The key to getting everything moving again was the Geithner hearing.''
In Washington, Mr. Geithner told a Senate panel that the Obama administration would propose new regulations for the financial system and called for reform of the $700 billion financial bailout. He also apologized for the mistakes he had made related to paying $34,000 in income taxes late several years ago.
Senators said that Mr. Geithner would probably be confirmed as Treasury secretary -- a relief for investors who feared that a protracted confirmation battle could inject more uncertainty and instability into volatile financial markets.
But the gains could be nothing more than a blip. The S.& P., which fell more than 38 percent in 2008, has slid close to an additional 7 percent since the start of the year. Investors are worried that financial companies are in worse shape than previously thought and will continue to languish as the recession deepens.
''There are things that don't seem to add up here,'' said Ed Rombach, a derivatives market analyst at Thomson Reuters. ''That makes me skeptical of this rally.''
The battered banking giant Citigroup bounced back from Tuesday's losses, rising 87 cents to close at $3.67 a share. Bank of America gained $1.58 a share to end at $6.68 after its chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, and other directors bought 500,000 of shares of common stock, an apparent attempt to demonstrate confidence in the bank.
The broader financial sector, which had taken a hard hit on Tuesday, was the biggest gainer on Wednesday.
''It kind of ranges between panic, hope and dashed hopes,'' said Fred Cannon, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''The overriding issue in financials is that equity markets have a hard time dealing with uncertainty.''
A positive earnings report from the technology giant I.B.M. on Tuesday night helped lift stocks when trading began on Wednesday morning. Shares of I.B.M. rose 11.5 percent, to $91.42 a share, after the company announced a fourth-quarter profit of $4.4 billion and provided a better-than-expected profit outlook for 2009.
''I.B.M. obviously helped things by not only aiding the Dow, but by proving that the entire economy had not hit a wall,'' said Art Cashin, director of floor trading operations at UBS.
A range of technology companies and computer makers, including Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Dell, finished higher. Apple gained 6 percent to close at $82.83 a share and rose higher in after-hours trading after it said strong iPod sales raised its income in its fiscal first quarter.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 14/32, to 110 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.53 percent, from 2.38 percent late Tuesday.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and 70-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: On First Day, Obama Quickly Sets a New Tone

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Scott Shane and David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama moved swiftly on Wednesday to impose new rules on government transparency and ethics, using his first full day in office to freeze the salaries of his senior aides, mandate new limits on lobbyists and demand that the government disclose more information.
Mr. Obama called the moves, which overturned two policies of his predecessor, ''a clean break from business as usual.'' Coupled with Tuesday's Inaugural Address, which repudiated the Bush administration's decisions on everything from science policy to fighting terrorism, the actions were another sign of the new president's effort to emphasize an across-the-board shift in priorities, values and tone.
''For a long time now there's been too much secrecy in this city,'' Mr. Obama said at a swearing-in ceremony for senior officials at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House. He added, ''Transparency and rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.'' 
With the pageantry of Tuesday's inaugural festivities behind them, Mr. Obama and his team spent Wednesday grappling with matters as mundane as e-mail access and getting to work (some aides arrived at the gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Tuesday morning to discover they lacked clearance to enter) and as weighty as Senate confirmation of cabinet secretaries.
On Capitol Hill, Hillary Rodham Clinton was confirmed by the Senate as Mr. Obama's secretary of state -- and later sworn in -- and it appeared that Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary nominee, was headed for confirmation. But Republicans forced a one-week delay in the vote on Mr. Obama's nominee for attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., and there are other jobs yet to fill, including that of commerce secretary.
The transparency and ethics moves were set forth in two executive orders and three presidential memorandums; Mr. Obama signed them at the swearing-in ceremony with a left-handed flourish.
The new president effectively reversed a post-9/11 Bush administration policy making it easier for government agencies to deny requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act, and effectively repealed a Bush executive order that allowed former presidents or their heirs to claim executive privilege in an effort to keep records secret.
''Starting today,'' Mr. Obama said, ''every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information, but those who seek to make it known.''
Advocates for openness in government, who had been pressing for the moves, said they were pleased. They said the new president had traded a presumption of secrecy for a presumption of disclosure.
''You couldn't ask for anything better,'' said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that tangled frequently with the Bush administration over records. ''For the president to say this on Day 1 says: 'We mean it. Turn your records over.' ''
A president's first act in office carries great symbolism. Aides to Mr. Obama spent weeks debating a variety of options including an executive order to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a decision that is now expected to come on Thursday.
In the end, Mr. Obama used his first day to send two messages that echoed themes from his campaign: first, that he is intent on keeping his promises to run a clean and open government; and, second, that he understands the pain Americans are feeling as a result of the economic crisis.
''These executive orders are traditional for presidents -- we did them the first day as have others,'' said Dan Bartlett, who was counselor to President George W. Bush. ''But he has decided to put a finer point on it by elevating a clear theme from his campaign, which was, 'We're not going to do business as usual.' I think it's a smart move, and the type of thing that the public wants to hear right now.''
It may not be the type of thing that Mr. Bush wants to hear, however. Experts said Mr. Obama's moves would have the practical effect of allowing reporters and historians to obtain access to records from the Bush administration that might otherwise have been kept under wraps.
''Historians are overjoyed by this,'' said Lee White, executive director of the National Coalition for History.
In announcing the salary freeze, Mr. Obama effectively gave pay cuts to roughly 100 top executive branch officials, like the national security adviser, the press secretary and the White House counsel, who earn more than $100,000 a year. ''Families are tightening their belts,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and so should Washington.''
The new president also moved to fulfill his campaign pledge to end the so-called revolving door, the longstanding Washington practice whereby White House officials depart for the private sector and cash in on their connections by lobbying former colleagues.
In what ethics-in-government advocates described as a particularly far-reaching move, Mr. Obama barred officials of his administration from lobbying their former colleagues ''for as long as I am president.'' He barred former lobbyists from working for agencies they had lobbied within the past two years and required them to recuse themselves from issues they had handled during that time.
The Republican National Committee criticized the Obama administration for violating this new standard in some of its appointments. Mr. Obama's nominee for deputy secretary of defense, William Lynn, has been a lobbyist for the defense contractor Raytheon, and his nominee for deputy secretary of health and human services, William V. Corr, lobbied for stricter tobacco regulations as an official with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
A senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, conceded the two nominees did not adhere to the new rules. But he said that Mr. Lynn had the support of Republicans and Democrats, and would receive a waiver under the policy, and that Mr. Corr did not need a waiver because he had agreed to recuse himself from tobacco issues.
''When you set very tough rules, you need to have a mechanism for the occasional exception,'' this official said, adding, ''We wanted to be really tough, but at the same time we didn't want to hamstring the new administration or turn the town upside down.''
Mr. Obama's pledge for openness and transparency also ran smack into the stark reality that setting up a new administration takes time. During his campaign, Candidate Obama and his team of technically savvy young aides promised to harness the power of the Internet to allow the public easy access to government documents and presidential decisions.
It took six hours on Tuesday for the ordinarily fast-moving aides to Mr. Obama to post his executive orders on the White House Web site. Until then, the site declared, ''The president has not issued any executive orders.''
Correction: January 23, 2009, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about new ethics rules imposed by President Obama on members of his administration paraphrased incorrectly from a statement by the Republican National Committee about a provision barring former lobbyists from working for agencies they had lobbied within the past few years. The committee criticized the Obama administration for violating the new standard in some of its appointments; it did not criticize the new rule.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Ends Bid for Senate, Informing Paterson of Choice

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and DANNY HAKIM; David M. Halbfinger and Raymond Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Caroline Kennedy announced early Thursday that she was withdrawing from consideration for the vacant Senate seat in New York, startling the state's political world after weeks in which she was considered a top contender for the post.
Ms. Kennedy on Wednesday called Gov. David A. Paterson, who will choose a successor to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, to inform him that she was no longer interested.
''I informed Governor Paterson today that for personal reasons I am withdrawing my name from consideration for the United States Senate,'' Ms. Kennedy said in a statement released by her public relations firm.
Ms. Kennedy did not elaborate, but a person who spoke to her suggested that her concerns about the health of her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who suffers from brain cancer and was hospitalized after a seizure on Tuesday, contributed to her decision. 
Ms. Kennedy believed that the job was hers if she would accept it, the person said, but aides to Mr. Paterson would not comment on whether that was true.
Her decision appeared to catch the governor off guard, throwing the Paterson administration into confusion and setting off conflicting news media reports. After frantic talks between the governor's operation and Ms. Kennedy's camp Wednesday evening, Ms. Kennedy appeared to waver on whether to withdraw, and was preparing a statement reasserting her interest in the job. But just after midnight, she decided to make clear she was taking her name out of consideration and released the statement saying so.
Ms. Kennedy declined to be interviewed.
The Paterson administration scrambled to respond to the news, providing contradictory answers to reporters' questions. Just before 7 p.m. Wednesday, Errol Cockfield, Mr. Paterson's press secretary, said the governor had dismissed reports that Ms. Kennedy was withdrawing as ''just the rumor of the day.''
More than an hour later, Mr. Cockfield asked that that statement not be published, and suggested that more information would be provided by the governor's office. But neither he nor the governor's communications director, Risa B. Heller, would respond to further questions about Ms. Kennedy.
Ms. Kennedy's move comes nearly two months after Mrs. Clinton was nominated to be secretary of state.
In the weeks that followed, Ms. Kennedy, along with several members of Congress and leading political officials, began lobbying the governor for the coveted Senate seat. She attracted relentless attention and was viewed by many as the most likely choice for Mr. Paterson, given her national stature and ties to the incoming Obama administration.
''I'm surprised, I'm very surprised,'' said Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, a friend of the governor's who met with Ms. Kennedy in his Harlem office. He added: ''I had just met with her last week and she told me she was in and ready, willing and able.''
Ms. Kennedy had gained the support of some powerful backers in the state, including several labor officials and a top aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Kevin Sheekey.
But her pursuit of the seat also set off resistance, with some local Democratic officials suggesting it smacked of entitlement, and polls showing voters preferring Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo for the position.
Ms. Kennedy, 51, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy and a resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, has never served in public office.
Ms. Kennedy also stumbled initially with the news media, refusing at first to answer questions about why she was running, but later giving a series of interviews in which she elaborated about her interest in the job and her eagerness to enter public life.
Governor Paterson had planned to announce his selection on Friday or Saturday, but it was not clear how Ms. Kennedy's move may affect the timing. The governor has been coy, and while he has praised Ms. Kennedy, he has also spoken approvingly of other candidates, including Mr. Cuomo and Representative Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who is beginning her second term in Congress from the Albany area.
Mrs. Clinton resigned from the Senate on Wednesday, immediately after being sworn in as secretary of state. The governor has said privately and publicly that he would like to select a woman to succeed her, noting that if he were to choose a man, the number of female senators would drop to just 16.
Some have speculated that with the state facing a $15 billion budget deficit, it would be risky for Mr. Paterson to bypass Ms. Kennedy, given her connections to the Obama administration and top Senate Democrats like Majority Leader Harry Reid. Mr. Paterson appeared to like Ms. Kennedy and saw in her a potential star, but was frustrated and angry by what he saw as efforts by her supporters, especially within Mayor Bloomberg's administration, to create a sense of inevitability about her candidacy.
''She has pluses and minuses,'' Mr. Paterson said in a radio interview earlier this month, adding that Ms. Kennedy ''has a tremendous relationship with the president and that's certainly a plus. She does not have much legislative experience, which is a minus.''
There have been conflicting signals in recent days and weeks about whether Mr. Paterson had settled on Ms. Kennedy for the job. Mr. Paterson said earlier this week that he had chosen someone, but some advisers, as recently as Wednesday, remained convinced that he not yet made up his mind.
A friend of the governor's said on Wednesday afternoon that ''I would be totally shocked'' if Mr. Paterson did not pick Ms. Kennedy.
''If he doesn't go with her, how angry is the Democratic leadership going to be with him?'' the friend said.
Ms. Kennedy's departure would reset the political calculus among the remaining contenders, about half a dozen of whom were likely to be serious prospects if Ms. Kennedy were out of the picture. Publicly and privately, Mr. Paterson has talked about the importance of selecting a woman to replace Mrs. Clinton, which could boost such candidates as Ms. Gillibrand, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, and Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers.
Mr. Cuomo remains a top contender for the job. He would be unlikely to face a primary challenge in 2010 and has already proved himself as a statewide office holder, and Mr. Paterson is said to be eager to pick someone who will add political and fund-raising heft to the statewide ticket in 2010.
But picking Mr. Cuomo would allow the State Legislature, in a vote sure to be dominated by the Democratic-controlled Assembly, to pick his replacement. In that event, a new attorney general would come from the legislative ranks, and would not necessarily be someone the governor favors.
Most of the other contenders for the seat declined to comment on the development Wednesday evening, though Ms. Maloney said of Ms. Kennedy: ''It speaks well of her character that she would put her family first.''
Ms. Maloney noted that she had just been appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as chairwoman of the House and Senate Joint Economic Committee, and said that that buttressed her candidacy for the Senate seat.
''The economy is job No. 1, and my experience gives me the background, knowledge and opportunity to represent my state as no one else could when the stimulus package is crafted,'' she said.
A Democrat close to Mr. Cuomo said Ms. Kennedy's withdrawal opened an opportunity for Mr. Cuomo, who up to now has privately expressed mixed feelings about seeking the Senate seat. ''I think Andrew has to act fast and act decisively if he really wants this,'' said the person, who asked not to be identified because of the uncertain nature of the matter. ''He can't afford to equivocate.''
Meanwhile, television news crews were staking out Ms. Gillibrand's home in Washington on Wednesday night. Ms. Gillibrand is scheduled to appear with Mr. Paterson at a joint news conference on the economy in Hyde Park, N.Y., on Monday, but aides said that event was scheduled long ago.

WHILE MIDEAST IS IN CONSTANT FLUX,
A Quick Choice Looms for Obama
President Obama faces a tough policy choice in what to do about Gaza and the West Bank, continue to isolate Hamas or support a unified Palestinian government as other Arab nations have suggested. He has to decide quickly, before Hamas solidifies itself by taking any credit for Gaza's reconstruction. But how to support a unified government in a place so divided? Page A6

NEW LAUGHS AND MAYBE RESPECT

Retail security can be prone to such descriptions as rent-a-cop and flashlight cop, but funny isn't usually one of them. It appears that is changing.

Editorial
FOR TREASURY SECRETARY
Timothy Geithner's tax problems took up much of his confirmation hearing. Barring any new disclosures, we heard nothing disqualifying. He is an intelligent man, and President Obama is entitled to pick his own team. Wall Street is also comfortable with the choice. That is an endorsement that cuts both ways -- but one that could advance the cause of renewed regulation if Mr. Obama lives up to his promises and is a strong champion for reform. PAGE A32

HEADLINE: The Remaking Of America

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
At the end of Bill Clinton's presidency in January 2001, the Web site The Onion declared: ''Our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity is over.''
 That was supposed to be satire, but in retrospect it proved a shrewd analysis. One measure of the bleak trajectory of the last eight years is that today The Onion looks equally astute when it says of the latest transition: ''Black man given nation's worst job.''
 That man is making an excellent start, and news Web sites all over the world capture the globe's eagerness -- even desperation -- for American leadership. 
 ''Let the remaking of America begin today,'' declared The Guardian, in Britain. The Independent called Inauguration Day ''a day for hope.'' 
 In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of ''a truly great hour for America'' that offered ''a multitude of opportunities.'' The Times of India welcomed ''a new beginning.'' In Northern Ireland, The Belfast Telegraph asked: ''Can Obama save us all?''
 A BBC poll in 17 nations found that on average 67 percent believed that President Obama would improve America's relations with the rest of the world; just 5 percent thought the opposite (or maybe feared that if they seemed critical of George W. Bush, they would be waterboarded).
 Two themes were particularly reassuring in Mr. Obama's Inaugural Address. One was his inclusiveness, his effort to tug people into his big tent, a huge contrast from Mr. Bush's years of governing from an ideological pup tent.
 President Obama's inclusiveness started with his celebration of America as a patchwork of ''Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers.'' If you know of any other sitting president who has dared to embrace atheists (Thomas Jefferson did, but not while in office), post the information on my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground).
 Mr. Obama was also the first president to use the word ''Muslim'' in an Inaugural Address. In an oblique olive branch that I took to be directed toward Iran and Syria, he said: ''We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.''
 The second reassuring theme has to do with ''hard power'' and ''soft power,'' in the terminology of Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor. In the Bush-Cheney years, America sought to rely overwhelmingly on military ''hard power,'' and the result was setbacks around the world, from Iran's accelerated nuclear program to North Korea's processing of plutonium for a half-dozen nuclear weapons (compared with zero during the Clinton presidency). 
 As my colleague David Sanger documents in his superb new book, ''The Inheritance'': ''We pursued a path that has left us less admired by our allies, less feared by our enemies, and less capable of convincing the rest of the world that our economic and political model is worthy of emulation.''
 Mr. Obama's first attempt at soft power is the nifty new White House Web site, complete with a White House blog. In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Obama focused on soft power alongside hard power: ''Our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.''
 Tempering qualities? Dick Cheney never wanted to temper anything, including his temper.
 This mix of soft and hard power is what Professor Nye calls ''smart power'' -- an update of Teddy Roosevelt's notion of speaking softly and carrying a big stick -- and it seems to be an emerging theme of the new administration. Hillary Rodham Clinton emphasized it in her confirmation hearings.
 Professor Nye said that Mr. Obama's inaugural was a perfect example of smart power. ''That's not going to make our adversaries roll over, but it'll help in terms of mainstream Muslims and it'll help in terms of allies,'' Mr. Nye said. ''And it'll give a very different tone to foreign policy.''
 Now the world will be watching to see if Mr. Obama's policy matches his rhetoric. The economy will be paramount, of course, but it will take months or years to judge results there.
 In the meantime, there are two immediate litmus tests by which the world will begin to judge Mr. Obama at once. The first will be his handling of Guantanamo and torture -- the architects of those Bush policies did more damage to America than anyone confined in Guantanamo -- and it was reassuring that Mr. Obama promptly suspended action by military tribunals.
 A second test is Middle East policy. The Bush policy of (mostly) disengagement and obliviousness to Palestinian suffering has made it harder to achieve a peace that is the best hope for Israelis and Palestinians alike. Mr. Obama's calls Wednesday to Middle Eastern leaders were helpful, and he should immediately make clear that he wants Israel to halt the settlements and ease repressive restrictions on the West Bank.
 These steps would reassure the world that its hopes for a new day in Washington just may be justified.

HEADLINE: Obama Meets With Officials on Iraq, Signaling His Commitment to Ending War

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama gave his national security team on Wednesday a new mission to end the war in Iraq, nearly six years after United States-led forces invaded, but he held off ordering a troop withdrawal right away to hear concerns and options from his military commanders.
 On his first full day in office, Mr. Obama summoned senior civilian and uniformed officials to the White House to begin fulfilling his campaign promise to pull combat forces out of Iraq in 16 months. Among those meeting with Mr. Obama was Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander of American forces in the Middle East, who had not seen him since the Nov. 4 election. 
 ''I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq,'' Mr. Obama said in a written statement after the meeting. He added that he planned to ''undertake a full review of the situation in Afghanistan in order to develop a comprehensive policy for the entire region.''
 While the economy has overtaken Iraq on Mr. Obama's agenda, his opposition to the war was the original foundation of his presidential race, and ending it stands as perhaps the most salient test of his commitment to his campaign promises. Yet fulfilling his pledge also could put him at odds from the start with generals who worry that acting too quickly may jeopardize the progress achieved since President Bush sent in more forces and General Petraeus revamped the strategy two years ago. 
 The meeting on Wednesday served mainly to brief Mr. Obama on the state of affairs in Iraq. He heard from Gen. Ray Odierno, the commander of forces in Iraq, who participated by secure videoconference from Baghdad, and the departing United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker. The session did not focus on specific withdrawal proposals but instead featured a broad discussion of the political climate and security situation, according to senior officials.
 Among the topics were the challenges as Iraq moves through a series of critical elections this year and the required changes to the location, size and mission of the American military force under a new agreement between Washington and Baghdad, the officials said. General Petraeus also weighed in on the regional implications of Iraq. 
 Military planners have prepared a series of possible withdrawal plans that, in the words of one official, ''range from conservative to aggressive.'' One of them matches the president's 16-month timetable, although Mr. Obama always envisioned a substantial ''residual force'' remaining beyond that to train Iraqi forces and hunt terrorist cells.
 Senior officials said another proposal for a more gradual withdrawal was drawn up to meet the terms of the agreement recently sealed by Mr. Bush and Iraqi officials, which requires the United States to pull combat forces out of Iraqi cities by June and to withdraw all troops from the country by the end of 2011.
 General Odierno initially favored withdrawing just 2 of the remaining 14 combat brigades by summer or fall, and military planners drew up a faster option only in recent weeks, on the assumption Mr. Obama would ask for it. But a number of senior officers have warned about the risks of a rapid withdrawal, military officials said.
 Since the election, Mr. Obama has reaffirmed his intention to end the war, while leaving room to rethink the details by saying he would listen to his commanders before issuing any orders. In his Inaugural Address on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said, ''We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people.'' 
 Aides said he was taking a cautious approach to make sure that his promise would be executed effectively and safely for the troops. ''This will start a planning process,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting. 
 Some opponents of the war said they intended to hold Mr. Obama to his campaign promise. ''I take him at his word,'' said Tom Andrews, national director of Win Without War, a group opposing the Iraq conflict. ''He could not have been clearer as a candidate. There's no reason for me to believe he will not fulfill that campaign pledge of 16 months.''
 At the same time, some veterans of the Bush White House warned against making precipitous moves, or even changing the mission. Peter D. Feaver, a national security aide to Mr. Bush, said a key to the turnaround in Iraq in the past two years was the decision to redefine the mission, focusing it on protecting the civilian population.
 ''It may sound like an easy thing to do, and it is certainly the president's call,'' said Mr. Feaver, now a professor at Duke University. ''But there are risks associated with changing the mission, so it shouldn't be done lightly.''
 Nonetheless, Mr. Obama and his advisers said it was important to signal a commitment from his presidency's inception. On the campaign trail last summer, Mr. Obama said, ''My first day in office, I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission, and that is to end this war responsibly and deliberately but decisively.''
 In fact, he did not call in the Joint Chiefs, but he did invite their chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates; Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser; Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff; and other top advisers. Hillary Rodham Clinton was not confirmed as secretary of state until after the meeting got under way. 
 Officials said Mr. Obama would meet in the coming days with the rest of the Joint Chiefs, who include the heads of all four services.

HEADLINE: Quarterly Losses Grow At American And United

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
American and United, the nation's second- and third-largest airlines, said on Wednesday that their losses widened in the fourth quarter even though prices for jet fuel pulled back from record levels. 
 Full-year results at the two airlines flipped to losses in 2008, from profits in 2007. Each airline said it would take additional steps to cut costs in the wake of the weak economy.
 American, which joined other airlines in cutting routes and flights last year in response to fuel prices, said it would eliminate more capacity this year than it originally projected. 
 Meanwhile, United, which began a series of job cuts in 2008, said it would eliminate 1,000 more management and executive jobs in the coming year.
 Airline industry analysts have been predicting that 2009 would be a better year than 2008, one of the most difficult in recent times. For one thing, jet fuel prices, which reached a record in midsummer, have dropped 75 percent. 
 Meanwhile, many airlines have raised ticket prices after cutting routes and flights and retiring airplanes, which should help bolster profits. 
 But the struggling economy has led to a reduction in air travel, and there are doubts over how quickly it may bounce back. 
 ''There's a lot of uncertainty around where 2009 will take us,'' said Thomas W. Horton, the chief financial officer at American. ''We're in an environment where demand is weak.''
 During the fourth quarter, UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, said it lost $1.3 billion, including special charges, compared with a loss of $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. 
 United's loss translated to $9.91 a share, compared with 47 cents in the quarter a year ago.
 After subtracting costs related to fuel-hedging contracts and other charges, United's loss was $555 million. Its revenue fell 9.6 percent, to $4.55 billion.
 Still, the company said it would cut 1,000 more salaried and management jobs, in addition to 1,500 layoffs last year. At the beginning of 2007, United had about 9,000 salaried employees.
 ''These are difficult actions as they impact our people, but are the responsible steps to take in an environment of reduced capacity and demand,'' United's chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, said in an e-mail message to employees.
 United announced plans last year to retire 100 aircraft, a step it expects to complete this year.
 For 2008, the company lost $5.34 billion compared with a profit of $403 million in 2007.
 The fourth-quarter loss at AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, was $340 million, or $1.22 a share. In the 2007 fourth quarter, American lost $69 million, or 28 cents a share. Both years were affected by special charges. 
 In 2008, American posted $126 million in charges related to job cuts, capacity reductions and pensions. In the 2007 quarter, it had $114 million in gains resulting from asset sales. Revenue slipped to $5.5 billion from $5.7 billion. 
 For the full year, American lost $2.1 billion, including special charges. Without them, the airline would have lost $1.2 billion. It earned $504 million in 2007.
 American said it planned to reduce its flights by 8.5 percent during the first quarter, a percentage point more than it forecast in October. For all of 2009, American said it expected to cut flights in the United States by 9 percent, and international flights by 2.5 percent.
 It attributed the additional reductions to the economy as well as a delay in deliveries of new Boeing 737 jets, because of a strike at Boeing. 
 The airline's passenger traffic fell 10.4 percent in the fourth quarter, and Mr. Horton said bookings in the first quarter were running behind the same period in 2008. 
 American fell to second place among the nation's airlines in October, when the merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines was completed. Delta, as the two airlines are now called, has become the nation's biggest airline. 
 Shares of AMR fell nearly 24 percent on Wednesday, to $7.98, while UAL shares fell 6.1 percent, to $10.91.
 Continental Airlines said Wednesday that it expects to post special charges of $170 million for the fourth quarter and $234 million for all of 2008. It said the charges would reflect costs related to its pensions, employee severance packages, the value of aircraft and losses on fuel contracts.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Try to Maintain Inauguration Euphoria At a Bankruptcy Sale

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 ''The journey begun,'' intoned one woman in the crowd, just like one of the commentators on television, as Barack Obama finished his inaugural address on Tuesday, his high-def visage beaming out from the 28 marked-down flat-screen sets at the back of the Circuit City store on Main Street in White Plains.
 A few were shoppers who had wandered over to watch. Many were nearby office workers, frustrated with the halting video on their computers at work or giving in after thinking they could actually get some work done while the nation's new president took office. 
 They were joined by Circuit City workers and some from the Target store downstairs, about 60 in all, standing or plopped down in the three black leatherette lounge chairs. They wiped away tears. They gaped in wonder. They clapped at the appropriate times as if they were freezing on the Mall in Washington.
 ''I was going to stay at work and make some phone calls and catch it later on the news,'' said Elaine Webley, a financial adviser from Hartsdale, ''and I thought, 'What am I thinking?' I don't want to see the reruns, I want to witness history.''
 A day later, the moment was over, and here we all were, one foot in Tuesday's pageantry, the other in the dreary present, part of us in the drama unfolding in Washington, part in the priced-to-sell boxes of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, the Zen Mozaic MP3 players, the Aloha Hawaii mouse pads, the XP1 gaming chair, the techie detritus at a bankrupt store preparing for liquidation.
 Even if you somehow missed the ''Going Out of Business'' and ''Entire Store on Sale!'' signs, it was hard to miss how many people were hurting. Almost everyone was struggling financially or knew someone who was. 
 Stacey Obsolu, a 19-year-old nurse, has one friend who was among the 55 workers at this Circuit City who would soon be out of work and another who is losing his job with the same chain in Manhattan. 
 Calder McKenzie made his living installing Circuit City's televisions and other gear, four or five on a good day two or three years ago, two or three on a good day this Christmas season, none now. His wife is a senior lab technician at Westchester Medical Center who apparently has kept her job despite its recent announcement of 400 layoffs to help close a $70 million budget gap. 
 Paul Harry, a 51-year-old carpenter, painter and handyman from Stamford, went out on his own a few years back. For a while, he made a pretty good living. Then for another while he pretty much made his expenses. Now he's lucky if he works one week on, two weeks off. The steady customers in Scarsdale who needed the fences touched up, the gutters cleaned, the table moved just so are too strapped to need his help. Some of his friends are finding work in Canada, working Monday through Friday, coming back on weekends. He's doing his best to hang on. 
 ''I hope he has some good brains with him, because he's going to need them -- and you, me and just about everybody,'' he said of the new president. ''I work for people who know a lot more about the markets than I do and they say it's going to be at least three or four years before we get through this.''
 Do we have that kind of patience? Maybe not. ''I just worry that people are expecting too much; we want things solved now,'' said Rob Jackson, an information-technology specialist with Sprint. ''If people call me, they don't want it fixed later this afternoon, they want it now, right away.'' 
 Ms. Obsolu figured that what took eight years to break would take more than four to fix.
 AND then maybe so. For some, the improbable miracle of the Obama presidency was its own reward, an affirmation of positive change that was its own gift, brain-dead economy or no brain-dead economy. 
 ''That moment was enough,'' said Liz Gibbs, a registered nurse from White Plains in a fake-fur coat adorned with an Obama sticker. ''I mean it. For the first time, we have a president who I feel connected to, someone I can believe in. Besides the historic nature of the first African-American president, he has a genuineness that's different than anything I can remember.''
 And amid one failed emporium of gewgaws and gadgets, most people spoke of hope, of new beginnings, of shared burdens and playing their part, as if, for a while at least, they're eager to buy into something not quite formed but full of promise.
 On the marked-down televisions the preternatural single vision of the inauguration was gone and the hyperactive polyglot of American life returned -- President Obama's first full day; the hearings for Timothy F. Geithner, his nominee to be Treasury secretary; Allen Iverson's abilities as a point guard; the latest on Britney; a port-a-potty-themed music video for ''Country Man'' by the Nashville singer Luke Bryan. 
 The journey begun.

HEADLINE: Apple Defies Expectations and the Economy

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Amid a deepening recession and an intensifying controversy over the health of its chief executive, Apple reported strong first-quarter profits on Wednesday that surprised analysts and handily beat Wall Street's expectations. 
 Apple said robust sales of iPods and laptops buoyed the company amid a terrible holiday shopping season that hurt nearly all other technology and consumer electronics firms.
 Apple said its quarterly profit jumped to $1.61 billion, or $1.78 a share, from $1.58 billion, or $1.76 a share, a year earlier. 
 Revenue increased to $10.17 billion, from $7.9 billion. Analysts had expected Apple to announce revenue of $9.74 billion and profit of $1.39 a share.
 The news sent Apple's stock up more than 9 percent to $90.70 in after-hours trading.
 ''Where many of the other consumer-facing companies are missing their expectations and seeing their revenues decline, Apple continues to see growth,'' said David Bailey, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''It is gaining market share in every category and, given the premium price of their products, that is a significant achievement.''
 The earnings news came on a day when reports circulated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Apple for inconsistent disclosures about the health of Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive.
 Two weeks ago, Mr. Jobs said he was suffering from an easily treatable ''hormone imbalance,'' and Apple's stock briefly jumped. Mr. Jobs reversed course a week later and said he was taking a six-month leave of absence because his condition was ''more complex'' than previously thought.
 Spokesmen for Apple and the S.E.C. declined to discuss the possibility of an inquiry into the company's disclosures, which was first reported by Bloomberg News.
 The earnings report presented a picture that was largely at odds with pessimistic speculation about Mr. Jobs's health, and with the company's declining stock price. Before the earnings report, Apple shares reached a two-year low on concerns that the economy was hurting its prospects, and on fears that Mr. Jobs's absence might become permanent.
 Apple said it sold 4.36 million iPhone 3Gs in its holiday quarter, down from 6.9 million phones during the fall quarter, when the 3G version was released. However, that is nearly double the 2.3 million iPhones that were sold in the year-ago quarter.
 Apple also said it had sold 2.5 million Macs, up from 2.3 million in the quarter a year earlier, largely on the strength of its MacBook notebooks, which the company updated in October. Apple is posting those gains at a time when the overall market for personal computers is contracting.
 IPod sales jumped a healthy 3 percent from a year ago, to 22.7 million, driven largely by consumers in Europe and Asia.
 Apple enjoys higher margins than many of its competitors because it can charge a premium for devices that consumers view as more glamorous and better designed. Apple said its gross profit margin last quarter was 34.7 percent, unchanged from a year ago. The company benefited from falling prices for components like memory chips.
 Apple, which is notoriously conservative with its predictions of future earnings, easily exceeded its own forecast for the quarter. But it cautioned on Wednesday that the results for the current quarter would reflect some slowness, projecting profits of 90 cents to $1 a share and sales of $7.6 billion to $8 billion.
 Some analysts and shareholders say the future remains cloudy for Apple, particularly in light of the absence of Mr. Jobs. Speaking in a conference call with analysts, the company's chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, who is filling in for Mr. Jobs during his leave, sought to allay those concerns.
 ''There is extraordinary breadth and depth and tenure among the Apple executive team, and they lead 35,000 employees that I would call wicked smart,'' Mr. Cook said. ''We believe we were put on the face of the earth to make great products, and that is not changing.''
 Mr. Cook also appeared to fire a shot across the bow of Palm, the Silicon Valley cellphone maker that recently unveiled the Pre, a smartphone with some of the same touch-screen tricks as the iPhone. 
 Though he declined to specifically mention any company, Mr. Cook said that Apple would not stand for having its intellectual property ''ripped off,'' and that ''we'll use whatever weapons we have at our disposal.''
 Palm's executive chairman is Jonathan J. Rubinstein, who was instrumental in creating the iPod and left Apple in 2006. The company has hired several other former Apple employees.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island to Test Medicaid Spending Cap

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
Rhode Island will be the first state to cap overall spending on Medicaid in an experiment starting early this year, a result of a controversial deal between Gov. Donald L. Carcieri and the Bush administration. 
 In exchange, the state will be allowed to change health care programs that have been tightly controlled by the federal government. 
 The agreement calls for Rhode Island to limit Medicaid spending to $12 billion over the next five years, a move critics call foolish in light of the worsening economy. The state had an unemployment rate of 9.3 percent in November, one of the nation's highest, and some fear that the $12 billion amount will not begin to suffice if more people qualify for Medicaid. 
 But Gary D. Alexander, director of the state's Department of Human Services, said Rhode Island's Medicaid rolls had bucked the national trend by decreasing over the last year, a phenomenon he could not explain.
 The state spends about $1.7 billion annually, a quarter of its total budget, on Medicaid programs for 180,000 poor, disabled and elderly residents. Medicaid costs have risen by an average of more than 6 percent a year recently, Mr. Alexander said, but state revenue growth has been much smaller. 
 Mr. Carcieri, a Republican, proposed the experiment last year as he and the General Assembly, controlled by Democrats, struggled to balance the state budget. 
 The General Assembly could have rejected the plan, but instead, legislative leaders said they would pass a measure giving them a say in any changes to Medicaid programs. 
 Mr. Alexander said the changes would not take effect until the measure was passed, which he hoped would be within weeks. 
 ''We are working hand in hand with our legislature on this,'' he said, ''and hopefully we will make it work together.'' 
 Legislative leaders did not return calls seeking comment on Wednesday. Rhode Island's Congressional delegation condemned the plan in a letter to Mr. Carcieri last week, predicting that it could leave the state up to $842 million short of what it needed to spend on Medicaid to keep up with enrollment as the recession plays out.
 One of the biggest fears about the spending cap is that it will sharply limit the number of elderly people eligible for nursing homes paid for by Medicaid. Mr. Alexander said that more people would be cared for in their own homes or group homes under the plan, but that no current residents of nursing homes would be forced out. 
 ''We're building capacity right now,'' Mr. Alexander said of alternatives to nursing home care, which he said were not yet sufficient to meet the needs of the state's poor elderly population.
 Critics say the plan is especially risky given that Medicaid rolls around the nation are swelling because of the recession; Rhode Island will not be able to increase spending on Medicaid even if the number of recipients there shoots up. Some other states, like neighboring Massachusetts, have per capita caps on Medicaid spending, which gives them a cushion if enrollment grows. 
 But Mr. Alexander said the deal would allow the state to end the experiment with six months' notice.
 And Rhode Island could get out of the deal immediately, he said, if ''something catastrophic'' should hit, like a natural disaster or an epidemic.
 Mr. Alexander did not rule out waiting lists for some services, and said that certain benefits now available to all Medicaid recipients, like podiatry care or physical therapy, would be limited to those who need them most.
 Instead of having to pay ''any willing provider'' for surgery or another service, he said, the state will be able to collect bids and get the best price. 
 The spending cap assumes an average Medicaid cost increase of 7.8 percent a year over the next five years, Mr. Alexander said. 
 Rhode Island is also counting on a temporary increase in federal Medicaid money through the economic stimulus package Congress is expected to pass. That could allow the state to reduce its own share of Medicaid spending, Mr. Alexander said, and use the savings elsewhere. 
 But a paper released this month by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families called the spending cap ''especially unwise'' during a recession. The stimulus money, it said, would erase the immediate need for a spending cap and give Rhode Island time to think of a less risky solution.

HEADLINE: In the Snows of Sundance, A Marked Chill in the Air

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
The 2009 Sundance Film Festival opened with a whisper that grew more hushed with each passing day. It should have been a time for rowdy celebration: this year, after all, marked the festival's 25th anniversary, a milestone that was largely eclipsed by the grim economic climate that thinned the crowds and fueled the nervous chatter on the icy streets. Only the presidential inauguration, a few sales deals and a couple of punches thrown by a critic (not me!) who had felt hassled by a film representative disturbed the low-key vibe.
These are, as one distributor blurted out to me seconds after saying hello, ''tumultuous times'' in the movie business. No kidding. On the eve of Sundance three more movie critics joined the ranks of the unemployed, including Ella Taylor, a longtime and well-respected critic for The LA Weekly in Los Angeles. And earlier this week Warner Brothers Entertainment -- which last year dismantled three of its specialty divisions, Warner Independent Pictures, Picturehouse and New Line Cinema -- announced that it was laying off an additional 800 workers. 
For independent cinema, which relies on reviewers to get the word out because they don't have money to buy their opening weekends, the thinning of the critical ranks is no small thing. The specter of the big studios getting out of the indie business presents a more ambivalent problem, one put into relief by the festival's silver anniversary and the presence of Steven Soderbergh at this year's event.
In 1989, Mr. Soderbergh helped put Sundance on the world cinema map with his debut feature, ''sex, lies and videotape.'' That spring the movie was at Cannes, where it won the Palme d'Or (beating out ''Do the Right Thing,'' among other titles). A hungry little outfit called Miramax Films swooped down and grabbed it.
Three years later, Miramax was bought by Disney. Soon every big studio that did not have a boutique division opened one. Prices for independently financed movies skyrocketed. Harvey Weinstein became a media fixture, Quentin Tarantino became a rock star, and Parker Posey and Zooey Deschanel became Indie It Girls, while character actors like Sam Rockwell and Paul Giamatti became headliners. Sundance veterans like Bryan Singer, Christopher Nolan and Mr. Soderbergh signed on for blockbuster duty. Sponsors like Entertainment Weekly (and The New York Times) slapped their brand on the event, and the crowds poured in as the festival chatter shifted from questions of art to matters of industry. For 10 days a year, Sundance turned into Hollywood in the snow, and real independent spirit seemed on the wane.
The industry was still in attendance this year, but the high-roller fever that has gripped the festival for the last decade has cooled. Although this made for the most pleasant Sundance in memory, it also presents a host of unknowns. If the studios don't buy independent films, fewer investors in turn may be inclined to bankroll projects, particularly those with bigger budgets. Yet it is precisely those movies with heftier budgets, and the glossier production values and marquee-ready performers that can come with those budgets -- like the ready-made entertainment and 2006 Sundance success story ''Little Miss Sunshine'' -- that distributors believe can help bring in the increasingly finicky audience. If the investors don't invest and the buyers don't buy, will the movies still be made, and what kind?
Films with no-name actors are a tough sell, as is anything considered too arty, brainy, bleak or dark, which is why much of the best work produced today either goes without American distribution or is released by smaller companies that don't require huge returns. This was true when ''sex, lies and videotape'' hit, and it may be even truer now. That doesn't mean that you won't see some of the best work from this year's Sundance, including ''Unmade Beds,'' ''Big Fan,'' ''Big River Man'' and ''In the Loop,'' but it might mean that you'll see these titles only if you live in a large city, or when (if) they're released on DVD. That is, if someone picks them up for American distribution.
The scathingly funny ''In the Loop'' stars a clutch of familiar and somewhat familiar actors, including a very good James Gandolfini and a barely recognizable Steve Coogan, in a political satire about the behind-the-scene power plays in Washington and in London that preceded the Iraq war. Directed at a breakneck pace by Armando Iannucci, the movie essentially restages this tragic chapter as a screwball comedy: I haven't heard dialogue this fast since Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant traded zingers in ''His Girl Friday.'' Although ''In the Loop'' brought down the packed house during at least one screening, it remained up for grabs by Thursday, because these days even a smart, sophisticated (English-language!) comedy isn't a sure bet.
All the pretty bodies rolling around, under and over the sheets in ''Unmade Beds,'' an intimate, tender feature about two young Europeans adrift in and out of a London squat, similarly failed to rouse interest among American buyers. The second feature from the Argentine writer and director Alexis Dos Santos (his first was ''Glue''), this beautifully shot movie has a level of formal ambition -- the narrative is as elliptical as the lives it concerns, and even seemingly throwaway moments catch your eye -- which was generally absent from most of the American fiction films I saw. Though he has clearly watched his share of French New Wave movies, Mr. Dos Santos has absorbed rather than merely parroted his inspirations.
Straight out of Staten Island comes the aggressively grubby, often darkly funny ''Big Fan,'' the very fine feature directing debut from Robert Siegel, who wrote ''The Wrestler'' and was an editor at The Onion. A cautionary tale about the limits and perils of love, ''Big Fan'' centers on Paul (Patton Oswalt, terrific and fearless), a 35-year-old parking lot attendant who lives with his mother and whose every waking hour is devoted to his beloved New York Giants. That love takes an unexpectedly dramatic turn when Paul and his closest (only) friend, Sal (the Sundance fixture Kevin Corrigan, priceless), have an unexpected late-night encounter with Paul's favorite Giants player, who does not return his fan's love in gentle kind. Unlike many hapless American movie characters, Paul comes with a personality rather than a character arc.
The pivotal figure in the excellent American documentary ''Big River Man,'' from the resourceful young director John Maringouin (his only other feature is ''Running Stumbled''), has so much personality it's a wonder he fits on the screen. The big man in question is the Slovenian long-distance swimmer Martin Strel, an extraordinarily larger-than-life, stranger-than-fiction member of the species who, for murky reasons, had decided to promote environmental awareness by swimming some of the world's longest rivers, including the Mississippi and the hideously polluted Yangtze. The movie tracks Mr. Strel -- who is accompanied by a small entourage that includes his son, who also narrates the movie -- as he attempts to swim and survive the Amazon while trying to dodge parasites, piranhas and madness.
The documentary veteran Joe Berlinger (''Brother's Keeper'') adopts a straightforward reportorial approach for ''Crude,'' a forceful, often infuriating story about Big Oil and little people. The story here involves the protracted legal battle between 30,000 Ecuadorean plaintiffs and Chevron, one of the largest oil producers in the world. Mr. Berlinger traces this story from the jungle to the concert stage, as the lawyers representing the Ecuadoreans employ every conceivable tactic -- ground-level protests, news stories about victims that verge on the exploitative, a feature in Vanity Fair magazine and even Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler -- to fight their multinational opponent. Among other things, the movie makes clear that while it's easy to laugh at celebrity do-gooders, they have access to real power unavailable to the merely mortal.
Other high points include ''Cold Souls,'' the keenly intelligent, gravely humorous English-language feature debut from the French writer and director Sophie Barthes, about an actor (Mr. Giamatti as an actor also named Paul Giamatti) who decides to put his troubled soul in cold storage. Just as appealing is Oskar Roehler's visually flamboyant ''Lulu and Jimi,'' a period romance set in Germany during the 1950s. An outstanding Jennifer Decker, in a star-making turn, plays Lulu, the rebellious daughter of a proper bourgeois family, who falls in love with Jimi (Ray Fearon), an American who's a one-man advertisement for black cool. Though Mr. Roehler borrows heavily from David Lynch's ''Wild at Heart'' and Francis Ford Coppola's ''One From the Heart,'' he makes this freaky joy ride his own.
I wish I could be enthusiastic about ''The Girlfriend Experience,'' the latest nonstudio venture from Mr. Soderbergh. The movie, a work in progress that was shown as a sneak preview on Tuesday, is the second in a series (the first was ''Bubble'') of high-definition digital features he is making for 2929 Entertainment, which will be simultaneously released on different platforms. This newest addition to what is shaping up as a rather joyless experiment from Mr. Soderbergh involves a high-end Manhattan escort called both Christine and Chelsea (Sasha Grey, a porn actress), who lives with her boyfriend, a trainer with muscles and no personality, Chris (Chris Santos), and sells her body, and perhaps her soul, to whoever can afford her price.
Shot by the director himself, the movie looks as beautiful as its star and comes across just as cold and flat as she does. Though Mr. Soderbergh name-dropped Michelangelo Antonioni during the question-and-answer session after the movie, ''The Girlfriend Experience'' is very much under the thematic influence of Jean-Luc Godard.
Mr. Soderbergh, who is clearly far more interested in the metaphoric usage of flesh peddling than its impact on real bodies, turns prostitution into an allegory about moviemaking in which the whore is the filmmaker, her clients are the producers and the scum of the earth is -- you guessed it -- the critic who reviews her work (negatively). He shot the movie in October, which suggests that he still wasn't over the bad notices he received for ''Che'' when it played at Cannes last May.
Correction: January 28, 2009, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A film notebook on Friday about the Sundance Festival referred incorrectly to a character in the movie ''Big Fan,'' which was shown at the festival. While often called ''QB'' in the film, the character, Quantrell Bishop, is a linebacker for the New York Giants, not a quarterback.

HEADLINE: A Swim With Manatees: No Splashing, Please

BYLINE: By LOUISE TUTELIAN

 BODY:
IT was just after 8 on a cloudy January morning as the flat-bottomed pontoon boat made its way over the glassy surface of Kings Bay, 600 acres of fresh water in Crystal River, Fla. The bay, actually a spring-fed pool, is rimmed by attractive homes and lush greenery along its many coves and lagoons, but aboard the boat, no one cared.
Huddled on aluminum benches were 10 wet-suited comrades. We represented a variety of countries and ages, but on this particular morning, we all wanted the same thing: to swim with the bay's most famous residents, West Indian manatees.
No, they are not seals or sea lions. Manatees, or sea cows, as they are sometimes called, are aquatic mammals that can grow to 13 feet and over 3,000 pounds, even though they eat only plants. 
No one knows how many live in the Gulf of Mexico, the Amazon Basin, West Africa's coastal area, the Caribbean Sea or their other habitats, but scientists have counted as many as 3,300 in Florida, and we had been promised that some were in the waters now beneath our boat.
From November through March, Crystal River, 70 miles north of Tampa, is the epicenter of manatee-watching. The manatees cannot survive in water below 60 degrees, and come winter, they arrive at Kings Bay and the adjacent rivers, which are fed by warm springs that average 72 degrees year round. As our boat approached, Quinn Atkinson, a dive master for our tour company, American Pro Diving, estimated there were 200 to 400 manatees in this shallow bay.
Manatees are gentle giants that graze slowly in shallow waters or snooze in the silt. As long as they are not disturbed while eating, or touched on the face or under their flippers, they remain calm and approachable -- even friendly and curious, we were told.
There are numerous rules and laws in place to protect the manatees, which are vulnerable to injuries from motorboats. Swimming with them is permitted, but visitors are cautioned to be respectful and protective; after all it is illegal under Florida law ''to annoy, molest, harass, or disturb any manatee.''
After deeming one site snorkel-worthy, Mr. Atkinson dropped anchor and issued instructions. We were to sit on the front of the 30-foot boat, don snorkels and swim fins and ease ourselves into the water, avoiding any splash or noise (''I see one!'') that might spook the manatees or stir up silt from the bottom, obscuring them.
When it was my turn, I slid into the water and swam slowly in large, loopy circles for 10 minutes. Just when I was starting to feel underwhelmed -- where were they? -- a pair rocketed beneath me. A moment later, their chunky, gray, torpedo-shaped bodies flashed by again. This was a far cry from those gentle giants I'd expected.
''That was a mating dance,'' Mr. Atkinson told me when I was back on board. ''It's mating season all year round.'' (Manatees have a single baby every two to five years). The manatees I'd seen were merely conducting a high-speed courting ritual.
Our sightings were decent, but not good enough, Mr. Atkinson deemed. So we were off to another location, but before we arrived, there were shouts from the starboard side. A manatee calf not yet three feet long was paddling right up to the boat while its mother ate complacently nearby.
With its tiny eyes, little flippers, square snout and fan-shaped paddle tail, the calf was at once the cutest and the oddest creature I'd ever seen. We all re-entered the water and greeted it in person, scratching its belly and following it around as it emitted tiny peeps.
I swam to another end of the cove and came upon a huge, algae-splotched manatee resting on the bottom near the docks of waterfront homes. It was so big and so still that from a distance I didn't recognize it as an animal. When I got closer, I compared its bulk to my five-foot frame and gauged it to be at least nine feet long and 1,000 pounds.
In search of snacks, it began slowly shimmying forward. I swam with it for nearly half an hour, up and down, reaching out gently to pat its elephant-like hide (the elephant is the land mammal most closely related to the manatee). At some point, it registered with me that I was swimming with a creature whose lineage went back 50 million years.
Seaweed and silt drifted by my mask as sunlight began to dapple the water around me. There were no sounds except my breathing and a slight swish when the manatee moved. Its little eyes regarded me nonchalantly as I hovered alongside. It was a singular sensation to be alone, underwater, with an animal this large, this gentle and this trusting.
On the way back to the dock, our small band sipped hot chocolate and compared sightings. The trip was the first snorkeling experience for Jessica Langford, 24, a nursing trainee from London. Over an hour in the water had chilled her.
''My fingers are numb,'' she said, rubbing her hands together. ''My toes went blue, too.''
Micheline Vaillancourt, 58, and her husband, Bernard Chabot, 62, of Quebec, said they had wanted to get beyond the plastic surface of conventional tourist spots, and this voyage worked for them. ''This is the natural Florida we came to see,'' Ms. Vaillancourt said.
Crystal River, about five miles east of the Gulf of Mexico, is the commercial center of an area where numerous warm freshwater springs feed rivers and small lakes. A city of 3,600, it has an old-fashioned, slow-paced ease all its own. Yes, CVS and KFC are out on Route 19 (called Suncoast Boulevard), but local residents also sell local stone crab and shrimp on the side of the road. Vacationers load crates of oranges from awning-striped tents.
Houses built in traditional Cracker style, with tall windows and deep shade porches, sit on quiet side streets. A cozy tea bar was selling tall glasses of iced mango mist and other tea drinks one afternoon in the center of town.
But the manatee drives the economy of the city, which bills itself Home of the Manatee. The animal's plump image is on everything, from key rings to cookie cutters, sweatshirts to stationery. A red, white and blue manatee sculpture stands at the entrance to City Hall.
Several dive shops offer swim packages, and kayaking and canoeing companies run manatee-sighting trips on the Crystal River and the nearby Homosassa and Chassahowitzka Rivers, as well as in Kings Bay.
Those who prefer to see the creatures from dry land can do that, too. Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park, a 180-acre preserve about eight miles south of Crystal River, has six resident manatees, some rescued from the wild and some born in captivity, according to Gail Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the park. A 15-minute pontoon ride is an engaging way to get from the visitor center to the park itself, suggestive of a meander through a primordial rain forest in moist, fragrant air.
The park is beautifully laid out, with lagoons, boardwalks, a waterfall and bridges. Enclosures hold native animals like cougars, Key deer and alligators, and in the waterfowl sanctuary, 30 pink flamingos and hundreds of white ibises, great blue herons, moorhens and other birds trill and honk. The manatees dwell in a large spring, and the park offers three educational programs about them each day.
Zoology isn't the only appeal of this chunk of Florida. The 14-acre Crystal River Archaeological State Park, just west of Crystal City, is believed to be the setting of an ancient temple mound, a ceremonial burial site and a midden, or trash area, comprising shells, bones and other detritus. Three groups of Indians lived in this region from 500 B.C. to A.D. 900 and then mysteriously abandoned the site, said Richard Estabrook, a regional director of the Florida Public Archaeology Network.
Excavations began in the early 1900s, and a modest museum displays items found on various digs. Stone and shell pendants, shell drinking cups, tools, vessel shards and even a panpipe-like musical instrument are on display.
On a guided kayak tour, the visitor can see the mounds as the Indians probably approached them -- from Kings Bay. I set out with seven other paddlers and Mr. Estabrook one recent afternoon to take a trip back in time.
Mr. Estabrook shed light on how the tribes might have fished, hunted, lived and buried their dead; much is necessarily speculative. But as we viewed the ancient shell midden from the water, with no other boats in sight and some descendants of prehistoric mammals probably underneath our kayaks, almost anything seemed possible.

HEADLINE: Home Construction Ends Its Worst Year Since 1959

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
In further signs of the dire economic situation, new-home construction fell to record lows in December and jobless claims continued to soar, the government reported Thursday.
 New-home construction fell 15.5 percent from November to December to an annual pace of 550,000 units, the slowest pace since the Commerce Department starting compiling the data in 1959. Home builders have all but shut down projects as home values plunge and potential buyers stay on the sidelines of the troubled housing market. 
 ''What you're seeing is capitulation by home builders,'' said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets. ''The news you got today reinforces the view that stabilization of housing starts is well off into the future.''
 The pace of new-home construction in December was 45 percent below its levels from a year earlier. The government estimated that 904,300 housing units were started in 2008, a drop of 33 percent from 2007. Last year would be the worst for housing starts on record. 
 The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rates to record low levels of zero to 0.25 percent to try to revive the struggling economy and stem the losses in housing, and it has introduced new programs to buy mortgage-secured debt. But homes sales and values have continued to decline.
 ''The magnitude of the housing bubble was unprecedented, and the corrective process promises to be a long and painful one,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a forecasting firm, wrote in a note.
 The Labor Department reported that weekly jobless claims rose 62,000 to a seasonally adjusted 589,000 for the week ended on Saturday. The nationwide unemployment rate has risen to 7.2 percent, and economists warn that the economy could reach 9 percent as the recession drags on.
 ''The worst is not over,'' Mr. Lonski said. ''Rising unemployment and tightening credit conditions are worsening the prospects for housing, which by itself suggests that we could be surprised at how poorly the economy performs in the early part of 2009.''
 Lower rates of construction mean that home builders are not contributing to the glut of homes on the market, currently estimated at 4.2 million. At the current rate of home sales, it would take about 11.2 months to absorb the existing supply.

HEADLINE: China's Route Forward

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
In an effort to hold back the domestic effects of the global downturn, China is starting to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new highways, railroads and other infrastructure projects. 
 The stimulus plan, one of the world's largest, promises to carry the modernity of China's coasts deep into the hinterlands, buying the kind of great leap forward it took the United States decades -- and a world war -- to build, and priming China for a new level of global competition.
 As President Obama and Congress draft an $825 billion stimulus plan for the United States, China is already two months into its effort. And while Democrats have put aside calls for big transportation projects, with the House bill allocating less than 5 percent of spending for the construction of highways, rail lines and mass transit programs, China is furiously pouring concrete and laying rails. 
 A $17.6 billion passenger rail line across the deserts of northwest China, a $22 billion web of freight rail lines in Shanxi province in north-central China and a $24 billion high-speed passenger rail line from Beijing to Guangzhou here in southeastern China are among the biggest projects. But extra spending is being planned in practically every town, city and county across the country. 
 And, unlike the United States, China has the cash to pay for it, with few debts and a tiny deficit.
 China will spend $88 billion constructing intercity rail lines, the highest priority in the plan. It spent $44 billion last year and just $12 billion as recently as 2004, said John Scales, the transport coordinator for China at the World Bank.
 ''I don't think anything compares except maybe the growth of the U.S. rail network at the start of the 20th century,'' Mr. Scales said.
 Fear, not competition, is motivating the building boom. Chinese leaders are increasingly worried about the slowdown of their economy and the growing risk of protests by disgruntled workers. New numbers released Thursday by the government suggested they had cause for concern. 
 Gross domestic product grew just 6.8 percent between the fourth quarter of 2008 and a year earlier. Growth for all of 2008 was 9 percent, down from 13 percent in 2007, and every indication is that expansion has continued to slow. 
 Policy makers ''are already in a mode of panic,'' said Qu Hongbin, the chief China economist at HSBC, even before the new numbers were released. ''They're going to spend like there's no tomorrow.'' 
 When inflation started to become a problem in China in the spring of 2004, Beijing began a four-year effort to prevent the economy from overheating. It barred local and provincial governments from proceeding with plans for many roads, airports, subway systems and other infrastructure.
 Now Beijing is urging local and provincial governments to go ahead with their projects because they are, in Washington's current parlance, ''shovel ready.''
 The combined national, provincial and local spending for economic stimulus promises to change the face of China, giving the country a world-class infrastructure for moving goods and people quickly, cheaply and reliably across great distances.
 ''The increased expenditure on infrastructure will certainly contribute to China's productivity growth and improve its long-term competitiveness, allowing it to pull away from its Asian neighbors who are much more constrained -- by higher levels of budget deficits and public debt -- in their ability to unleash a fiscal stimulus,'' said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 Feng Fei, the director general of industrial economics at the policy research unit of China's cabinet, the State Council, said that steep increases in railroad investments would create lasting benefits. The goal is to slow China's dependence on personal cars and imported oil, to reduce air pollution and to relieve the annual shortage of seats on trains during Chinese New Year, when millions of people visit their families, he said.
 China has already built as many miles of high-speed passenger rail lines in the last four years as Europe has in two decades. A new bullet train from Beijing to Tianjin, opened last summer, travels at up to 217 miles an hour; the top speed of Amtrak's Acela Express trains in the Northeastern United States is 150 m.p.h., and it is only briefly attained.
 The government has nearly finished the construction of a high-speed rail route from Beijing to Shanghai at a cost of $23.5 billion -- almost equal to the price of the entire Three Gorges hydroelectric dam project on the Yangtze River. The authorities recently disclosed that they had 110,000 workers laboring to finish the route as quickly as possible.
 Aside from transportation, most of the rest of China's national stimulus program will be spent on airports, highways and environmental projects, particularly water treatment plants, Mr. Feng said.
 So extensive are the plans being drawn up by government agencies in Beijing and elsewhere that they have collided with the government's longstanding policy of maintaining self-sufficiency in food production.
 China requires that any arable land converted from farming to other uses must be offset by bringing land elsewhere in China into cultivation. But the stimulus plan calls for construction on nearly three times as much arable land this year and next year as can be readily brought into cultivation elsewhere.
 The Ministry of Planning and Land Resources said at the end of December that it was looking at ways to ''borrow'' land that is supposed to be brought into cultivation in 2011 and 2012, and use it for economic stimulus projects now.
 A second issue lies in how quickly China can actually accelerate its construction programs, even if the money is available. ''This is a very key question,'' and nobody has the answers, Mr. Feng said.
 Megaprojects like those now coming off the drawing boards require large numbers of experienced engineers, skilled workers and architects, as well as specialized equipment. A steep swoon in housing construction is starting to put large numbers of laborers out of work but fewer skilled employees. 
 China's actual incremental spending on economic stimulus is hard to calculate.
 The central government announced two months ago that it planned a $586 billion stimulus program spread over two years. If all of that money were new spending, it would equal 14 percent of China's economic output last year. The plan going through the House in Washington is also spread over two years and equals nearly 6 percent of the United States' estimated economic output last year.
 But China's plan included some projects that were already slated for construction. And the government has set aside less than a third of the money. The directors of construction projects have been told to try to raise the rest of the money from local and provincial governments, or borrow it from banks or insurers. 
 Bank lending jumped in November at the fastest annual pace in nearly five years, as the state-controlled banking sector responded to regulatory pressures to step up lending. 
 Insurers have just been given the authority to start lending to infrastructure projects.
 All told, China's stimulus program is likely to add 1 to 3 percent to its economic growth this year, said Dong Tao, a China economist at Credit Suisse. The American program is likely to add close to 3 percent to the United States' growth, he predicted.
 Establishing an expectation is difficult, though, since the American plan is a grab-bag of different initiatives. More than two-thirds of the dollars in the House bill would go toward tax cuts and helping states with health and education needs; most of the rest is for modernizing school buildings, upgrading data systems for health care and improving federal buildings' energy efficiency.
 (China said Wednesday that, separate from its stimulus program, it would spend $123 billion to provide universal health care within two years instead of 11.)
 Of course, there is no guarantee the large chunk of the spending earmarked for poor inland and rural areas will prove economically viable, but there was no guarantee in America, either.
 But with China's once powerful export machine suddenly stalled and its housing bubble deflating, virtually no one questions the urgent need for spending.
 ''China gets hit by an external demand shock,'' Mr. Roach said, ''and the economy hits a wall.''

HEADLINE: Crisis in Europe and U.S. Hurts Asian Economies

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Weak economic data from several Asian countries on Thursday highlighted the accelerating decline of growth in the region, mainly because of sagging demand from recession-struck Europe and the United States. 
 Japanese exports, critical to corporate giants like Sony and Toyota, plummeted in December, down 35 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese finance ministry said. 
 In China, economic growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, to 6.8 percent, and to 9 percent for all of 2008, down from 13 percent in 2007, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics reported. And the South Korean economy shrank 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. 
 The figures -- particularly those from Japan and South Korea -- were much worse than economists had projected, showing how hard it has become to assess the effect of the global slowdown.
 Asia, once thought to have been relatively well insulated because of its limited exposure to American subprime mortgages, is now caught up in the worsening economic slowdown. Economies in the region have seen a pillar of economic growth -- exports to the United States and Europe -- collapse as consumer and corporate spending shrinks. 
 Richard Jerram, an economist at Macquarie in Tokyo, said that the Japan export figures were ''predictably terrible.'' 
 The slowdown in China has cooled hopes that demand from that giant economy might cushion the downturn in neighboring countries, and data Thursday heralded more pain to come as companies around Asia lower output and costs in response to sagging sales. 
 On Thursday, the Sony Corporation warned that it would probably post a net loss of 150 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, for the year ending in March. This is the first such loss for Sony in 14 years and represents a sharp reversal from the 370-billion-yen profit in the previous 12 months.

HEADLINE: Sweden's Fix For Banks: Nationalize

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
The Swedes have a simple message to the Americans: Bite the bullet and nationalize.
Officials in Washington are trying to figure out how to shore up American banks that once ruled the financial world but now seem to weaken by the day, despite receiving hundreds of billions of dollars in government aid.
With Sweden's banks effectively bankrupt in the early 1990s, a center-right government pulled off a rapid recovery that led to taxpayers making money in the long run.
Former government officials in Sweden, many of whom come from the market-oriented end of the political spectrum, say the only way to solve the crisis in the United States is for the government to be prepared to temporarily take full ownership of the banks. 
Sweden placed its banks with troubled assets into a so-called bad bank, where they could be held and then sold over time when market and economic conditions improved. In the meantime, it used taxpayer money to provide enough capital to allow banks to resume normal lending.
In the process, Sweden wiped out existing shareholders.
By contrast, the United States government, so far, has bailed out banks without receiving large equity stakes in return, said Bo Lundgren, Sweden's minister of fiscal and financial affairs during the Swedish bank takeover.
''For me, that is a problem,'' said Mr. Lundgren, who called himself more of a free marketer than some Republicans. ''If you go in with capital, you should have full voting rights.''
To be sure, the United States has a much larger economy than Sweden's, with a vast and international banking system. The toxic assets Sweden took from its banks improved when the economy improved, but Sweden was not confronted with a global recession.
Still, many analysts believe that Stockholm has lessons for Washington.
In effect, the Swedish state took on all the assets that were worthless or impossible to value at the time, and then managed them or sold them with the aim of getting as good a deal as possible for the taxpayer.
''We hired real estate people,'' said Lars H. Thunell, the former chief executive of Securum, the institution that became Sweden's repository of all the underwater assets. ''We hired industrial M.& A. people. We needed to manage real assets.''
The United States has become embroiled in a debate about creating its own bad bank after months of decisions to recapitalize American banks without taking control of them.
For all the billions of dollars committed to the banks by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, American taxpayers have, in effect, used mostly loans to turn themselves into emergency creditors of the financial system.
For their part, bank shareholders have taken big hits as the stocks plummeted. But the government has largely avoided acquiring equity and diluting the value held by existing shareholders.
Former Swedish officials said that was a mistake, for political reasons if nothing else, because owners of bank stocks did so well in the boom years early in the decade.
Fears of bank nationalization are diverse -- skeptics worry that nationalization would cost too much, the government would not run banks effectively or nationalization would be too complicated. Mr. Lundgren, the former minister of financial affairs, said the costs of nationalization have to be measured against the perils a hobbled banking system creates for an economy.
Moreover, he said the mere threat of nationalization nudged some Swedish bankers to find creative solutions to their problems in the 1990s.
SEB, the bank controlled by the Wallenbergs, the first family of Swedish business, engineered a private recapitalization to plug the hole in its balance sheet. Distressed assets were then placed in a bad bank of its own, freeing management to run the sound parts of the business.
Nordbanken, a Swedish bank that had expanded in the go-go years of the late 1980s, fell entirely under the control of the government because its losses were so great. It is now Nordea, a banking giant in the Baltic Sea region, and still partly government-owned.
Securum was capitalized with 24 billion kronor ($2.88 billion), a sum equal to the country's military budget at the time. (The total United States military budget is less than the $700 billion allocated to TARP.)
A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland concluded that Securum eventually returned about 58 percent of that upfront cost to the Swedish treasury, though in depreciated krona.
That does not mean Sweden has escaped the current banking turmoil unscathed. As credit markets froze last fall, it created a financial stabilization package intended to ensure new lending from banks. Only Swedbank initially signed up for the plan. Other banks have moved to raise capital in the market.
To make Securum work in the 1990s, the Swedish state had to become a specialist in such diverse industries as chemicals, biotechnology, office supplies, aerospace industry services and, as would certainly be the case in the United States, real estate.
Chunks of real estate from Stockholm to London to Atlanta had been collateral for loans and occupied 70 percent of the portfolio of Securum.
''As a result of the bubble, a lot of Swedish real estate people thought they were the best in the world,'' recalled Mr. Thunell, who now heads the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank.
Securum owned the Australian Embassy building in Myanmar, as well as a guitar that was said to have belonged to John Lennon and a company that employed military advisers in Yemen.
Since the whole idea was to eventually put Securum out of business, managing it required a deft touch that rewarded financial success with incentives for employees but also stressed their work's nature as a public trust.
''I think people felt a tremendous responsibility for the taxpayer,'' Mr. Thunell said. ''But it was extremely stimulating from an intellectual and business standpoint because you were doing completely new things.''
Securum hemorrhaged money in its first year in business, which was 1993, but recovered quickly, as savvy deal-making combined with a swift pickup in the Swedish economy created markets for what once seemed so worthless. Early on, Securum sold a chemical company it controlled, Nobel Industries, to Akzo of the Netherlands, to form the largest paint producer in the world. With 18.2 percent of the combined company, Securum later reaped a hefty profit when it sold out.
Property proved less nettlesome than feared as the Swedish economy recovered. Pandox, a Swedish hotel company, was privatized and finds itself today trolling for distressed assets in North America.
There is no guarantee the Obama administration will be so fortunate, with a global economy facing its most severe downturn in decades.
If there is any criticism of how Sweden handled the bad bank, it is that it might have managed an even better return if Securum had sat on its assets longer.
Swedish law envisioned a 15-year life span for Securum when it was created in 1993. It closed four years later.

HEADLINE: Press Secretary Offers Humor and Even a Little News

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For the last two months, Robert Gibbs has been attending press secretary school, complete with thick briefing books, dress rehearsals and practiced answers for an array of prospective questions.
 So on Thursday, for his first White House press briefing, Mr. Gibbs came equipped with a handful of jokes, a few morsels of news and a pledge that this presidency would be awash in a spirit of openness.
 But only a few minutes into the session, as the talk turned to President Obama's re-doing his oath of office, a reporter raised this question: ''In the service of transparency, why didn't you show the world this?'' 
 ''We did show the world this,'' Mr. Gibbs replied, defending the decision not to allow television cameras to capture the second swearing-in ceremony with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who had stepped on a few lines in the constitutional oath and agreed to come to the White House Map Room on Wednesday evening for a second try.
 To defuse the situation, Mr. Gibbs sought to use humor. 
 ''I was there,'' the new press secretary said with a smile, using his own presence to suggest that the proceeding had not been done under a cloak of darkness. ''It was far easier to get tickets for this one.''
 With that, another era began inside the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, which was filled to such capacity on Thursday that it swelled at the seams, with some television correspondents sitting on the floor as they craned their necks to see Mr. Gibbs.
 For precisely 50 minutes, considerably longer than he has appeared on television before in a single sitting, Mr. Gibbs fielded questions about the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, the president's views on torture and the $825 billion economic recovery package in Congress. He spoke in measured tones, lacing his responses with bursts of humor.
 ''We should sell tickets and have the money go to the deficit or something,'' Mr. Gibbs said, taking note of the capacity crowd, the likes of which the briefing room has not seen in a long time.
 A few minutes into the briefing, Mr. Gibbs stumbled through a bit of White House procedure, when he repeatedly referred to an official as ''Greg'' who earlier had briefed reporters about the president's decision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. 
 Was he, perhaps, referring to the White House counsel, Gregory B. Craig? The byzantine rules of the new White House, the same ones regularly imposed by the old White House, required that reporters should identify him simply as ''a senior administration official,'' even though Mr. Gibbs all but identified him.
 The briefing, which was broadcast live on cable television networks, gave Mr. Gibbs his biggest introduction yet as one of the leading faces of the administration. While he has yet to become a household name, Mr. Gibbs made it clear on Thursday that he had a close relationship with the president, whom he has worked alongside since 2004.
 Asked how the president was settling in, Mr. Gibbs said, ''I do think he enjoys the phrase 'living above the company store.' ''
 Four hours after the briefing, Mr. Obama made a surprise visit to the slightly less crowded press room of the White House, saying with a smile, ''I wanted to thank you guys for not completely ripping into Gibbs.''
 On the first day, at least. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 28, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the first briefing by Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, quoted incorrectly from his comment about how President Obama was settling in. He said, ''I do think he enjoys, to use a phrase, 'living above the company store.' '' Mr. Gibbs did not say that Mr. Obama ''enjoys the phrase 'living above the company store.' ''

HEADLINE: Sales Decline by One-Third at A.M.D. as It Prepares to Spin Off Manufacturing

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
Advanced Micro Devices said on Thursday that slumping demand for computer chips sent its quarterly sales down 33 percent last quarter, while its losses, though narrower, were still substantial. 
 The results put additional pressure on a company that has already lost money for eight consecutive quarters and has struggled against its bigger and stronger rival, Intel. 
 A.M.D.'s report, coupled with Intel's disclosure last week that its sales fell 23 percent in the quarter, suggests that technology hardware companies are struggling even more than previously thought.
 ''The fourth quarter of 2008 is going to be remembered for the severe stresses placed on the global economy and on our industry,'' Dirk Meyer, A.M.D.'s president and chief executive, told analysts. ''The global economic environment led to a softening in end-customer demand for PCs and servers in what is usually the year's strongest quarter.'' 
 Revenue fell to $1.16 billion in the fourth quarter, from $1.74 billion in the same period last year.
 A bright spot in A..M.D.'s report was that its loss narrowed slightly. The company reported a loss of $1.4 billion, or $2.34 a share, for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $1.77 billion, or and $3.06 a share, in the same period last year.
 Excluding certain items, the loss was 69 cents a share. On that basis, the earnings fell short of analysts' average forecast of a loss of 54 cents a share on revenue of $1.23 billion. 
 A.M.D. declined to provide a forecast for its current quarter, saying only that it expected sales to keep declining ''in light of the current macroeconomic conditions, very limited visibility and continued corrections in the supply chain.'' 
 A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is preparing to spin off its manufacturing operations into a separate company in order to focus on chip design. The Advanced Technology Investment Company, an organization created by the Abu Dhabi government, has committed to investing up to $8 billion in the spinoff and will take a 55.6 percent stake in the company, which has been temporarily named the Foundry Company. 
 Tim Luke, an analyst with Barclay's Capital, called the fourth quarter a weak one for A.M.D. 
 ''The outlook is very uncertain,'' Mr. Luke said. ''The outlook is very much dominated by the need to close the deal with the Middle Eastern investors.''
 Also on Thursday, A.M.D. disclosed a letter from Intel requesting a meeting to discuss whether A.M.D.'s spinoff plan violates a patent cross-licensing agreement between the companies. A.M.D. officials said they did not believe the transaction violated the agreement.
 A.M.D. shares have lost more than 50 percent of their value since the start of the fourth quarter. On Thursday, the shares fell 23 cents, or more than 10 percent, to close at $2.02 before the release of the report.
 The results included a $684 million write-down of good will and other assets related to the acquisition of ATI Technologies, while last year's fourth quarter included charges of $1.68 billion mostly related to ATI.

HEADLINE: Nashville Rejects a Law Making English Its Official Language

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
Nashville voters on Thursday rejected a proposal to make English the city's official language and largely to prevent government workers from communicating in other languages.
 The proposal was introduced by Eric Crafton, a metropolitan councilman. It was opposed by a broad coalition including the mayor, civil rights groups, business leaders, ministers and the heads of nine institutions of higher education. 
 ''The results of this special election reaffirm Nashville's identity as a welcoming and friendly city,'' Mayor Karl Dean said in a statement.
 Mr. Crafton had said the policy would encourage immigrants to learn English and save the city more than $100,000 in translation and related costs. The policy allowed exceptions to its English-only rule for issues of health and safety. 
 Critics said the proposal would tarnish Nashville's reputation as a cultural mixing pot and drive away immigrants and international businesses. They also accused Mr. Crafton of worsening anti-immigrant sentiment and wasting at least $350,000 of taxpayer's money on a special election.
 Thirty states, including Tennessee, and at least 19 cities have declared English their official language, according to the U.S. English Foundation, which advocates such policies.
 The proposal needed 50 percent to pass, and drew only 43.5 percent. It would have made Nashville, with a population of about 600,000, by far the nation's largest city to adopt such a policy, which supporters call English First and critics call English Only.
 ''People here said Nashville is a warm, welcoming and friendly environment that celebrates diversity,'' said Tom Oreck, an opponent of the proposal and the chairman of the Oreck Corporation, a vacuum cleaner manufacturer. ''If this had passed, it would have sent an isolationist message in a global economy.''
 Mr. Crafton, who has pushing for the measure for two years, could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Finally Arriving in Manhattan, With Balanchine as Its Calling Card

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
Miami City Ballet made its Manhattan debut on Wednesday night at City Center. To watch it dance Balanchine is to see aspects of his choreography more clearly than with any other company today. Energy; crispness; stretch; dance as a demonstration of music rather than as a response to it; the multidimensionality of the body in space: these basic ingredients of the ballet master's style shine bright here. 
 The company opened its first program with a brilliantly dissimilar pair of Balanchine ballets, ''Symphony in Three Movements'' (1972) and ''La Valse'' (1951), before winning final ovations for Twyla Tharp's ''In the Upper Room'' (1986). The Tharp impressively shows, among other things, that the Miami troupe is not an exclusively Balanchinean company. The first two works, though, provided the evening's most substantial fare. 
 Both are to music by composers Balanchine knew, Stravinsky and Ravel. Each shows Balanchine's way of entering the music by reimagining its historical world: the Second World War-era clash of East and West cultures as dreamed by Stravinsky in his ''Symphony,'' and the morbid apotheosis of the Romantic ballroom as dreamed by Ravel in two scores (in this ballet, his ''Valse'' is preceded by his ''Valses Nobles et Sentimentales'' ). 
 To see these two in this theater is striking for separate reasons. Balanchine made the ''Symphony'' for the far larger stage of the New York State (now the David H. Koch) Theater. In City Center's more intimate setting, it loses sweep and scale but gains in immediacy. ''La Valse'' had its premiere at City Center, but I am one of thousands to have known it only in other auditoriums: here its stream of dramatic incidents has an extraordinary proximity. 
 Beyond the differences between these two works, Miami City Ballet shows, in particular, how the whole box of stage space is lighted up by the human body: the physics of time and space become a continually changing drama. A dancer may merely shift from facing one diagonal to facing the other, but the effect is to make all the air behind the proscenium shift and realign. 
 As a dancegoer, I feel I have much to learn from watching this company; I hope others feel the same. (It was good to see New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater dancers among Wednesday's audience.) The ''Symphony'' -- notwithstanding two tiny slips that suggested opening nerves -- was danced with bite and force, ''La Valse'' with mordant sophistication. 
 Though it is many years since I first saw these ballets, and though I have seen each danced by other companies, I kept noticing new details in each. That's not so unusual: few of us can feel we know Balanchine choreography inside out. 
 What is rarer is the heightened clarity with which the Miami dancers make it register. Though they bring their own warmth, this kind of high-density visibility seems to me a thoroughly New York quality, and I remember it as the principal thrill of New York City Ballet's dancing in Balanchine's lifetime. To see it -- to feel it -- again is a marvel. 
 An appearance in Manhattan is the ambition of dance companies across the nation and the world. Thanks, however, to the horrifying economic pressure of presenting dance here, the borough has had to wait too long to see this company, and it has been our loss. The Miamians -- directed by the former New York City Ballet star Edward Villella -- have had success nationally and abroad, while Manhattan has been deprived of a connection to its own dance history. 
 Now, because of the latest round of financial setbacks, Miami City Ballet arrives with taped music. This certainly makes a difference. As played at City Center, there is an echo around the quieter sections of both the Ravel and Stravinsky scores, and on Wednesday there were a few passages where the dancers, atypically, didn't show us the choreography's musical point. 
 The loss of live music is even greater than with most ballet companies. In my experience the Miamians have excellent orchestral accompaniment at home; this, too, is being threatened by the current slump. Even so, the choreography still had that celebrated Balanchine effect. You heard the scores more clearly for watching. 
 The Philip Glass score for ''In the Upper Room'' is always played in a recording and so comes with no acoustic problem. Although this ballet usually wins an ovation, the one here seemed especially deserved: the Miami company has developed a rich association with Ms. Tharp in recent years and delivers this choreography with marvelous detail and richness. Nonetheless, even while I admire much of this ballet's detail and enjoy parts of it, I resist choreography and music as a theatrical whole: ''In the Upper Room'' feels both conceptual and manipulative. 
 There are ways in which the 23-year-old Miami company, founded by Mr. Villella, has yet to mature. Not all the feet here have full Balanchinean articulation and, though all the principal dancers have distinct and adult personalities, not all command full Balanchinean style. But this is already as good an advertisement for its home city as any ballet company in America. (Every season it gives South Florida more programs that I would like to see than I am able to attend.) New Yorkers should be refreshed by its brief season, and Miamians proud of its achievement. 
 The Miami City Ballet performs through Sunday at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org.

HEADLINE: Overseas, Vacation-Home Rentals Abound

BYLINE: By KEVIN BRASS

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Carol and Paul Pearson decided to take the plunge. With the real estate market booming, the couple bought an old house on a country lane in their hometown of Windermere, in the Lake District of England -- their first foray into the second-home market. 
 The plan was to fix up the four-bedroom cottage and quickly resell it as a vacation getaway. But it hasn't worked out that way. 
 After extensive renovations, the Pearsons put the house on the market in August 2007, just as the British market began to slow. Priced at $:359,000 (about $517,000 at $1.44 to the pound), it attracted no offers. 
 So instead of a quick flip, the Pearsons joined the fast-growing legion of second-home owners in Europe racing to rent properties that, in many cases, they can't sell and can't afford to keep. 
 ''Basically it was something we had to do'' to cover the mortgage, Mrs. Pearson said. ''We didn't have a choice.''
 The number of vacation homes available for rent in Europe and elsewhere is soaring as owners look for ways to generate revenue with their properties. 
 HomeAway.com, a United States-based online rental site, says its global listings jumped 25 percent in 2008, to 320,000 from 255,000 in 2007. And 75 percent of the clients behind those listings said in a HomeAway survey that they had not expected to rent when they first bought their properties. 
 HomeAway also says its records show the site is retaining more customers than ever before. ''Historically about 15 percent of our owners were selling their properties on an annual basis,'' Brian Sharples, the HomeAway chief executive, said. ''Now the rate of sales has gone way down.'' 
 Many of HomeAway's new clients are like Debra and Bill Finerman of Greenwich, Conn., who paid 800,000 euros (about $1 million at $1.32 to the euro) in 2007 for a two-bedroom apartment in the Sixth Arrondissement of Paris, near the Seine. They decided to rent the apartment only as the dollar weakened, increasing their monthly costs. 
 ''At one point the mortgage was 15 percent higher than when we first bought the place,'' Mrs. Finerman said. 
 On Holidaylettings.co.uk, a site owned by the British real estate Web portal Rightmove, 43 percent of the property owners say they are renting to pay their mortgages, taxes and maintenance costs, according to the company's survey of clients. The total was 30 percent in 2007. 
 The same survey found a third of Holidaylettings's clients have mortgages covering 75 percent or more of the value of their property. Forty-one percent said they are renting their second homes as a way to generate extra revenue. 
 ''We're seeing a far higher number of people who bought for lifestyle who are now letting out,'' said Kate Stinchcombe, a spokeswoman for the site, which has seen the number of listings increase to 30,000 this month from 10,000 in January 2007. 
 Last October Pure International, a London-based property company, spun off a new travel company, Pure Destinations, specifically designed to help second-home owners rent their vacation properties. 
 ''It turns out to be a timely launch,'' said Matthew Fox, the company's co-founder. ''We're getting a lot of people, who -- maybe they're not panicking -- they're just thinking I have something here that might work for me.'' 
 Some developers also are turning to the rental market, as the global construction boom over the last five years produced a glut of vacation homes for sale. In Spain alone, as many as 800,000 homes built in recent years are empty, according to industry estimates. 
 Three years ago, Ampella, a property development company, started construction on Podere Ampella, a development of 11 stone houses and villas in Tuscany. With financing in place, the company chose to finish the project, despite the slowdown in the second-home market, said Robert Drennan, the managing director. 
 Now Mr. Drennan has decided to furnish the units, which are priced from 400,000 to 800,000 euros, and to offer them for rent for 500 to 3,500 euros a week, depending on the season. 
 ''We just didn't have any sales; it was as simple as that,'' Mr. Drennan said. ''We have nothing to lose by renting.'' 
 With so many second homes entering the rental market, there has been a marked increase in competition in many popular vacation destinations. 
 Jean-David Bordonaro lives in New York and rents his family home in Flassan, a small village in Provence. ''There used to be two houses in my village renting in the summer; now there are 20,'' he said. 
 Some industry executives fear that the market can't handle the glut of rental units, especially if tough economic times cut travel budgets. Rental prices are already starting to come down in many markets. 
 ''We're seeing more willingness to discount apartments in the context of the economy,'' said Drew Graham, owner of Cobblestay.com, a United States-based company focused on renting apartments in Paris. ''Owners understand the market is softer.'' 
 And companies are betting that home rentals will grow more attractive as travelers look to save money. A recent study by PhoCusWright, a travel research company, predicts that the market for online vacation home rentals in the United States will grow to $4.7 billion in 2010 from $3.3 billion last year. 
 For the Pearsons in Windermere, renting has helped avert a financial crisis. They offer the cottage for $:450 to $:885 a week, depending on the season, and say it already is booked for several weeks in 2009. 
 ''If we do have to ride it out, we'll be all right,'' Mrs. Pearson said.

HEADLINE: Still Alternative After All These Years

BYLINE: By LISA SELIN DAVIS

 BODY:
THE former ashram on Route 63, at the foot of Mount Toby, perhaps best illuminates the spirit of Leverett, Mass. The modest house, fenced by sugar maples, includes four apartments, which are currently home to a purveyor of organic teas, a nurse, three college students studying sustainable agriculture at the University of Massachusetts and a glass blower who doubles as landlord.
That kind of alternative feel isn't unusual in Leverett, a town tucked next to Amherst in Western Massachusetts, and it's one of the things that draws second-home buyers. ''Leverett is full of people seriously living the green life. In practice, not just in theory,'' said Henry Astor of Brooklyn, who bought a second home there 10 years ago.
And with nine houses of worship that include a Quaker meetinghouse and the Peace Pagoda, a Buddhist temple, Leverett is something of a model of religious diversity. 
The town was founded in 1774 and named for John Leverett, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1670s. It's rural and, through zoning laws, aims to stay that way. There are 28 houses and 76.4 people per square mile. The names of local roads give a good sense of the topography: Mill Hill, Chestnut Hill, Hubbard Hill.
In the shadow of the hills sits Happy Valley, so-called for the youthful energy in the towns of Northampton and Amherst, home to the University of Massachusetts and Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges.
All those colleges clustered together are a magnet for cultural events that complement the region's natural setting, and they're all just a few miles from Leverett. ''We get all the shows that New York gets at a third of the price,'' said Victoria Cliche, chief executive of the Creative Education Foundation in Amherst, who started spending summers in Leverett with her family in 2002.
John Colby, the owner of Colby Realty in Athol nearby, estimates at least a tenth of the town's properties are second homes and that many of their owners went to college in the region. He added that many of Leverett's second-home owners come from New York City, some of them arriving after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. ''It was a lot of people looking for safe houses after 9/11,'' he said.
That group included Ms. Cliche, her husband, Bert, and their two children. The family had lived a mile from ground zero, and Mr. Cliche, a former director of engineering at Merrill Lynch, had watched the towers fall. After 9/11, they started to shift toward Leverett.
''We went from wanting to be in town and within walking distance to everything'' Ms. Cliche said, ''to wanting to be completely in nature.'' After renting at first, in 2006 they bought a 3,000-square-foot house and the 1.5-acre lot next to it for $650,000 in the town's one subdivision, Laurel Hill. They still have their Manhattan apartment.
For Mr. Astor, the draw was Leverett's resemblance to his home -- Milton-under-Wychwood in England -- and its proximity to skiing in Vermont, hiking in New Hampshire and boating and fishing on the Quabbin Reservoir.
Mr. Astor, who owns a company that stages events for fans of hot rods and vintage cars, attended Hampshire College in the late 1980s. And in 1998, he decided to buy a house in Leverett, certain he could find a New England farmhouse far off the road -- preferably a dirt one -- with 100 acres for $200,000.
''He wanted to be able to stand naked in the front yard,'' said his wife, Leslie. A year later, the Astors found a five-bedroom, five-bathroom 1797 farmhouse with 54 acres listed at $900,000. Mr. Astor offered $400,000 and bought it for $450,000.
The Scene
Leverett is a year-round second-home spot, but its winters appeal to those who crave to be outdoors no matter the season. It's common to see people cross-country skiing and snowshoeing throughout town, and Berkshire ski areas like Butternut Basin in Great Barrington and Berkshire East in Charlemont are less than an hour away. The Vermont resorts aren't so far, either.
The town's many waterfalls continue to bubble, but backyard ponds freeze to create ephemeral skating rinks. ''When we lived in the city, we were always planning our nature trips,'' Ms. Cliche said. ''Here, we live in nature.'' She added that Leverett, with its emphasis on health food, yoga and nature, ''is the health and healing center of the world.''
Mr. Astor, though, simply likes it because he can hang out with the town mechanic, who sells tires in his front yard at $10 a pop, in the morning, and with a professor of economics in the afternoon. Downtown Leverett, if you can call it that, consists of the Leverett Crafts and Arts Center, the post office and the town hall. At the intersection of Rattlesnake Gutter and North Leverett Roads, the 600-member Village Co-op is the town's heart, with pizza night on Fridays, dial-up Internet access and DVDs, local pottery, organic popcorn and cherry Danish among its offerings.
Most entertaining is at home. The Astors, who are considering selling their current second home, said they are often invited to potlucks, and in winter people might snowshoe from one house to another. Still, for many second-home owners, the privacy is alluring. ''We mainly socialize at the co-op,'' Mr. Astor said, ''and do our own thing at home.''
Another gathering spot, even in winter, is the dump -- that other town hall of many New England villages. Leverett has the highest recycling rate of any town in Massachusetts, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection, and the dump includes ''take it or leave it'' sections for clothes, books, toys and furniture. ''We run into everyone there,'' Ms. Cliche said.
Pros
Culture plus nature is Leverett's alluring combination. And there is that counterculture vibe. ''It's not uncommon to see an old hippie showering outside in summer,'' Mr. Colby said.
Cons
Leverett has no public transportation, even with the colleges nearby, so driving is required. Cellphone reception is spotty, and high-speed Internet service is not a given. (And there is that old hippie showering outside.)
The Real Estate Market
Leverett has only 634 single-family parcels, but the housing stock ranges from mobile homes to 18th-century farmhouses to contemporaries -- some pristine, some perpetually under construction. The listing prices for houses currently on the market range from $110,000 to $1.2 million.
The market peaked three years ago, real estate agents say. ''I'm not getting the same number of buyers,'' Mr. Colby said. ''People are still coming, but without that sense of superurgency.''
According to Trulia.com, an Internet real estate company, the average listing for Leverett for the week ended Jan. 14 was $528,816, and the median sale price for the three months ended November was $292,000, nearly 6 percent below the comparable period a year earlier.
Even so, because of the many colleges nearby, the market hasn't been hit as hard as others. ''Western Mass. is much more stable than Eastern Mass.,'' Mr. Colby said.
LAY OF THE LAND
POPULATION 1,746, according a 2007 Census Bureau estimate.
SIZE About 23 square miles.
WHERE Leverett is about 100 miles west of Boston.
WHO'S BUYING Professionals from Boston and New York, many of whom went to college in the area.
WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING Leverett has no hotels or B & Bs. The Deerfield Inn (81 Main Street, Deerfield; 800-926-3865; www.deerfieldinn.com) is about 10 miles northwest in a 24-room farmhouse built in 1884. Rooms start at $185 on weekdays and $225 on weekends.

HEADLINE: Possibly On Sale At Barneys: Barneys

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
THE owners of Barneys New York are doing all they can to move merchandise these days, but soon they could top themselves. The luxury chain itself may end up for sale, possibly at a bargain-bin price. 
 Istithmar, the private equity firm from Dubai that owns Barneys, is considering selling the retailer, according to people with knowledge of the company, who emphasized that the situation was fluid and that no deal was imminent. Bloomberg News first reported the potential sale. 
 David Jackson, chief executive of Istithmar, declined to comment about whether the chain was or would be for sale in the future. 
 Barneys was bought by Istithmar in 2007 for $942 million after a fierce bidding war with Fast Retailing, the Japanese clothing conglomerate that owns the Uniqlo specialty clothing chain. That was at the peak of a private equity buying binge, when investors snapped up chains like Lord & Taylor, Toys ''R'' Us and Neiman Marcus for record prices.
 Istithmar's purchase of Barneys left the chain, which has nearly 40 stores and outlets, burdened by heavy debt and weakened credit. Barneys, based in New York, was relying on sales from new store openings to pay the interest on that debt, analysts at Moody's Investors Service said. But when the economy soured and consumers stopped buying anything but necessities, Barneys -- along with its luxury retailing peers -- was hit hard.
 Sales fell by double digits in December, a critical month for retailers, at both Saks and Neiman Marcus, two other luxury chains. Barneys does not report sales figures but Moody's said sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health, were negative for the chain. 
 Like most retailers these days, Barneys has been forced to discount merchandise heavily, eroding its profit margin. Recent promotions have offered merchandise at a 75 percent discount. 
 Retailing analysts say the Barneys brand has a lot of cachet. But cachet is not the same as cash. In November, Moody's downgraded Barneys credit ratings, citing deteriorating business conditions. Additionally, the company has been trying to endure a recession without a chief. The former president and chief executive, Howard Socol, resigned in July and has yet to be replaced. 
 People knowledgeable about the company said Barneys would probably fetch $300 million to $400 million now, considerably less than the $942 million Istithmar paid. Istithmar -- ''investment'' in Arabic -- is an investment arm of the Dubai government. 
 ''The price they paid is fantasyland given what is happening now,'' one of these people said. 
 For the last few years, fashion-conscious shoppers with money or credit to burn were more than willing to buy $300 T-shirts at the chic retailer. But no more. 
 For the overall retail industry, sales of luxury goods fell 27.6 percent in December compared with December 2007, according to SpendingPulse, a report by MasterCard Advisors that estimates sales from all forms of payment, including credit cards and cash. That is worse than the performance of other categories like electronics and appliances, though all were down as consumers retrenched amid the economic gloom.

HEADLINE: Plan to Close Chinese-Language Paper Deepens a Shadow Over the Ethnic Press

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
There is nothing overt at the modest headquarters of The Ming Pao Daily News to suggest that the 12-year-old newspaper is under siege. In the paper's small warren of offices in an industrial building in Long Island City, Queens, the advertising and reporting staffs are still working the phones and putting out their scrappy broadsheet as if nothing were amiss. 
 But looming over the entire enterprise is a plan by the paper's corporate parent, Media Chinese International Limited, based in Hong Kong, to shut it down. Though the plan has yet to be formally announced, and several of the paper's employees said they still remained in the dark about their future, the paper's general manager confirmed in an interview with The New York Times last week that the daily would indeed disappear from newsstands, possibly as soon as the end of the month. 
 News of Ming Pao's demise has shaken New York's ethnic press industry, which until recently remained extremely robust but, like many other industries, has been buffeted by the nation's economic slowdown in the past few months. 
 In recent weeks, two other prominent ethnic newspapers have also closed. Hoy New York, a Spanish-language daily started in 1998, published its last print issue on Dec. 30, though it retains a presence on the Internet. AsianWeek, a widely respected English-language Asian-American weekly based in San Francisco, published its last print issue on Jan. 2, though it, too, remains online. 
 Ning Wang, editor in chief of The Sing Tao Daily, one of Ming Pao's three rival Chinese-language dailies in New York, said Ming Pao's departure would diminish the city's Chinese-American community, which as recently as the mid-1980s supported 10 daily newspapers. 
 ''For the community it's a very depressing thing,'' Mr. Wang said.
 But in an interview, Ming Pao's general manager, Thong Lai Teng, said that the news was not all bad and cast the paper's closing as something of a new beginning. 
 While the company planned to cease publication of the daily, which costs 50 cents a copy on the newsstand, it would continue publishing a free, six-day-a-week newspaper, called MP (NY) Free Daily, introduced more than a year ago. 
 The Ming Pao staff has already been supplying most of the free daily's content, Mr. Teng said. And though there would be some layoffs, he added, most of the workers would remain, ensuring that The Ming Pao Daily News would survive in substance and spirit, if not in name. 
 He said the shift and belt-tightening were necessary for the company to stay alive. 
 ''We are here to stay!'' he exclaimed, with a bit more gusto than the paper's struggles would seem to allow.
 Circulation of the free daily has been increasing in proportion to the decrease in the paid daily's circulation, propelled by an enthusiastic response from advertisers, Mr. Teng claimed. 
 Some 35,000 copies of the free daily are distributed daily, he said. Meanwhile, he added, the circulation of the paid daily has declined significantly from about 45,000 early last year, though he did not divulge the current circulation numbers. 
 News of Ming Pao's plans have filtered out in a curious way. Two rival newspapers published thinly sourced articles in late December reporting Ming Pao's closure. Then in an article on Dec. 31, Ming Pao published a vague article about the change. 
 But when first approached about the plans last week, the paper's staff members and managers refused to confirm the closing, deferring instead to the corporate parent company for comment. When it was pointed out to Mr. Teng that the corporation's plans had already been reported by one of his own correspondents, he appeared confused, then insisted that the article had been printed prematurely. ''The editor wasn't in the office that day,'' he said.
 Analysts of the ethnic news media say that Ming Pao's plans, and the recent closings of Hoy and AsianWeek, are most likely a harbinger of much more contraction in this sector of the media industry. 
 Until the middle of last year, analysts say, the ethnic press was largely insulated from the vicissitudes of the newspaper industry, including severe downturns in advertising revenue and circulation, which have brought many mainstream newspapers to their knees.
 Devoutly focused on local, largely immigrant communities, ethnic newspapers provide readers with news particular to those populations and reports from the immigrants' homelands that are hard to find elsewhere. They also address the specific needs of immigrants trying to adjust to a new country and new lifestyle. 
 ''People don't necessarily see themselves reflected in the mainstream media, so different cultural populations were turning to the ethnic media more and more,'' said Cristina L. Azocar, director of the Center for Integration and Improvement of Journalism at San Francisco State University. 
 In addition, advertisers are often the neighbors and acquaintances of the newspapers' staff, creating an intimate relationship between the newspapers and the communities they serve, analysts said. Many ethnic papers have not gone online in any comprehensive way, but until the broader economic downturn, that did not much matter since much of the readership, particularly in working-class and poorer communities, may not have been connected to the Internet anyway. 
 But beginning last year, growth in the ethnic press began to level off and the footing of many papers has not been secure enough to withstand the recession.
 Ethnic newspapers are now having to scramble to stay alive, cutting staff, printing less frequently and shifting to the Internet. 
 ''Some are finding very innovative ways to keep afloat and others are committed to operating in the red,'' said Sandy Close, director of New America Media, a nationwide association of more than 2,000 ethnic media organizations. 
 According to several current and former Ming Pao staff members, the paper has always struggled to find a niche for itself in the rough-and-tumble market of Chinese-language dailies. 
 Ming Pao was founded in 1997 as an offshoot of a well-respected daily in Hong Kong that also publishes iterations in San Francisco, Toronto and Vancouver. It has tried to cast itself as the most intellectual of the four Chinese-language dailies in New York, mirroring the reputation of the Hong Kong paper. But it has not been able to cut deeply enough into their market share, industry experts say.
 An employee smoking a cigarette outside Ming Pao's offices in Long Island City last week said he was unsettled by the possibility of layoffs, but he was also philosophical about the matter. The economic malaise, he pointed out, was ubiquitous. ''It's happening to everybody,'' he shrugged. ''Not just us.''

HEADLINE: Making Every Second, or $100,000, Count

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MARKETERS that advertise on the Super Bowl are always seeking more bang for their buck. This year, with each 30-second commercial during the game estimated to cost a record $3 million -- yes, $100,000 a second -- and the recession threatening to dampen viewer enthusiasm, the sponsors are intensifying efforts to amplify the force of what they plan for Super Bowl XLIII.
 ''Especially in this economy, people are saying, 'I'd better get my money's worth,' '' said Andrew Graff, president and chief executive at Allen & Gerritsen in Watertown, Mass., which conducts an annual survey online, with New England Cable News, on the Super Bowl spots viewers consider most meaningful.
 So a first-time Super Bowl advertiser, the General Electric Company, intends to make its commercial the springboard for an elaborate campaign -- in print and online as well as on TV -- focused on innovative ideas ''now'' in areas like energy and the environment. 
 The campaign, from two Omnicom Group agencies -- BBDO Worldwide and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners -- promotes G.E. products like Smart Grid energy technology as ''innovation you don't have to wait for'' rather than far-off fantasies. The various aspects of the campaign, including digital holograms, online films and a special Web site, are all scheduled to go live on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 1.
 A returning sponsor, the Coca-Cola Company, is using the Super Bowl to help introduce an ''Open happiness'' campaign for its flagship soft drink. The campaign, by Wieden & Kennedy, will be supplemented by everything from short spots on ''American Idol'' to 16-ounce bottles of Coke at lower, recession-friendlier prices of 99 cents each.
 In addition to two commercials during the game for Coca-Cola Classic, there will be a Coke Zero spot created by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners.
 Another returning advertiser, the E*Trade Financial Corporation, is surrounding its Super Bowl spot with a variety of Internet initiatives, including some that will begin on Facebook and YouTube (youtube.com/etrade) on Friday and on Twitter early next week. 
 The E*Trade commercial will bring back a character from two popular spots the company ran in the game last year, a talking baby wise beyond his years. The campaign, which also includes ads in newspapers and movie theaters and on Web sites that range from A (AOL) to Y (Yahoo), is by the Grey New York unit of the Grey Group, owned by WPP.
 ''It's more than a 30-second spot,'' said Nick Utton, chief marketing officer at E*Trade in New York. ''The Super Bowl is part of a total plan.''
 ''This environment is very different from what it was last year, so we spent a lot of time thinking about this,'' he added. ''And we've done extensive testing to be doubly sure, triply sure, all the elements of the mix are right.''
 Similarly, G.E. pondered the decision to make its Super Bowl debut at such a tense moment, said Judy Hu, global executive director for advertising and brand at G.E. in Fairfield, Conn.
 One reason the company is going ahead with the campaign, she said, is that it has what she called a ''positive, optimistic'' spirit. The Super Bowl commercial, by the BBDO New York office, features a song by the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) from the 1939 film ''The Wizard of Oz'' and concludes with the company's upbeat ''Imagination at work'' theme.
 ''We try never to do depressing commercials,'' Ms. Hu said.
 Another reason to proceed, Ms. Hu said, is that G.E. wanted to address what company executives perceived as ''an impatience'' among consumers ''to fix things now'' in critical realms like reducing energy use.
 ''Bringing in a new agency was really helpful'' in framing the approach, she added, referring to the Goodby, Silverstein work on the digital aspects of the campaign. Among the elements are the holograms and the special Web site, which will be found at plugintothesmartgrid.com. 
 Goodby, Silverstein was ''a recent addition'' to the G.E. roster of interactive agencies, which is composed of five or six shops, said Jen Walsh, global director for digital media at G.E. 
 The coming Super Bowl will be the third year in a row that Coca-Cola is advertising Coke Classic during the game after an absence of almost a decade. Coke Zero, a sugar-free soda, is getting its first Super Bowl berth.
 As for the advisability of making so large an ad investment these days, ''we know we're living in challenging times,'' acknowledged Joseph V. Tripodi, senior vice president and chief marketing and commercial officer at Coca-Cola. ''What people want right now is to step back, pause and refresh a little.''
 (Clever marketer that he is, Mr. Tripodi's remark quoted a famous Coke ad slogan, ''The pause that refreshes,'' which a rival soft drink, Pepsi-Cola, is echoing in a new campaign of its own, ''Refresh everything.'' Pepsi-Cola is also likely to advertise during the Super Bowl with one or more commercials from TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom.) 
 ''The cola wars are revved up again in a way they haven't been in a decade,'' said John D. Sicher, at Beverage Digest, a trade publication.
 ''It's to the benefit of both companies,'' he added, because flagging sales of colas means that ''both companies need to talk about the products and convey it's fun to drink them.''
 To that end, Mr. Tripodi said, the idea of the new ''Open happiness'' campaign for Coke is to offer consumers ''more of a call to action'' than the previous Coke campaign, which carried the theme ''The Coke side of life.'' The new ads include paeans to product attributes like refreshment and quenching thirst.
 In one spot scheduled for the Super Bowl, insects conspire to swipe a bottle of Coke Classic from a youth sleeping in a park. A second spot, commenting on the popularity of online and onscreen avatars, suggests that a bottle of Coke Classic can restore some human interaction to the interactive world.
 Among the other advertisers on Super Bowl XLIII, to be broadcast by NBC, are Anheuser-Busch InBev, Audi, Bridgestone, CareerBuilder, Cars.com, Castrol, Denny's, DreamWorks Animation, GoDaddy.com, H&R Block, Hyundai Motor, Monster.com, PepsiCo and Teleflora.

HEADLINE: Time-Share Rentals a Click Away

BYLINE: By PETER WAYNER

 BODY:
ABOUT 20 years ago, Craig Carty visited Vail, Colo., skied and fell in love with a time-share resort there called the Wren. He liked it so much that he bought the right to spend one week there, and then he bought another and another, which he planned to rent out. 
 ''It turned out, I ran the numbers and found that it would pay for itself in four years,'' he said.
 At the beginning, Mr. Carty paid someone else a commission of up to 40 percent just to find a renter. In 2001, he created a Web site, TheWren.net, where he and the other time-share owners could list their units without a big fee. 
 When this proved successful, he founded MyResortNetwork.com and started listing units from other time-share resorts for sale or rent.
 ''We don't take a commission,'' he said. ''We do charge $19.95 for another owner to post their week up for rent. When they rent it, they keep the proceeds.'' 
 Increasingly popular online marketplaces like Mr. Carty's are changing the process of finding vacation units by making it easier for owners and renters to find each other, examine the property, and check out each other's reputations. 
 Both sides can get a feel for supply and demand, allowing prices to find their own natural level -- often significantly lower without the sales force that expects a commission. What's more, the marketplaces are slowly standardizing what has traditionally been a handshake business. 
 These Web sites are also responding quickly to the economic downturn, and lower prices are appearing frequently. 
 John Locher, a vice president of marketing at RedWeek.com, says that his site has seen a 40 percent jump in postings between November and January, an increase that is much larger than the 10 to 20 percent jump that happened at the same time in years past. He says that he believes that more owners are looking to cover their costs instead of using the unit themselves. 
 Renters, he said, will find ''good news with plenty of inventory and competitive prices.'' 
 The Web sites are also driving interest in renting out time shares, a new option for many people. 
 ''People have no idea that you can rent your time share,'' said Brian Rogers, owner of the Timeshare Users Group, which hosts the Web site tug2.net. ''It's not explained to them. It's not in any of their paperwork. Most people don't know that there's a rental market out there.'' 
 Mr. Rogers, who both owns a time share and often rents others from his members, easily ticks off the advantages of renting a time share over a hotel room: the rooms are bigger and they usually have kitchens, laundry rooms and extra bedrooms. 
 The biggest challenge for renters can be making sense of time shares' sometimes complicated rules. The owners have contracts that let them stay for a fixed period of time each year. Some contracts specify a particular week while others give the owners ''points'' that can be used to reserve any particular days. Many let the owners trade or exchange their ownership with others who have bought from the same developer, allowing people to, say, swap a week in a ski resort for a stay in the Caribbean. But some systems also have complex rules prohibiting certain trades, which can push owners to rent their units when they can't use them.
 In some cases, though, renters must learn to decode the terms in order to rent a time share.
 ''We've nearly bought into Disney Vacation Club several times, so we know how the point system works and how reservations work,'' said Andrea Snead, from Ohio, who calls her family ''Disney-crazed.'' 
 Web discussion forums are often filled with suggestions from other visitors, which can help prospective renters better understand what renting is like. Ms. Snead said she learned much about the Disney Vacation Club from forums like disboards.com, which are devoted to mastering the complexities of relaxing in Orlando, Fla. She spends several days watching the offers to buy points in Disney Vacation Club time shares on the site to get a good estimate of the going rate. The lowest offers are snapped up quickly while the higher prices often lie stagnant until the owner lowers the price. 
 When Ms. Snead sees an offer she finds attractive, she contacts the owner by e-mail. In the past, she said prices were $10 to $11 per point, but have since dropped a bit, in part because Disney is offering its own deals. It's not unusual to see offers for $8 to $9 a point and Ms. Snead says that she's rented in May for $9 a point. 
 A week in a one-bedroom suite at Disney's Wilderness Lodge, for instance, requires 200 points in January and 350 points during Easter week in April. If the renter buys the points at $10 apiece, these weeks would cost $2,000 or $3,500, respectively. The renter wires the money to the nominal owner and the owner makes the reservation through Disney.
 ''Typically, we pay 50 percent up front and 50 percent 45 days prior to the trip,'' she explained. 
 While many renters and owners say they've had great luck renting vacation spots, all quickly add notes of caution and suggest that people double- and even triple-check references. Some owners rent so frequently that potential renters can read their old ads if they're still available. Many frequent renters answer questions for newcomers to help build trust and understanding. Most of the sites offer sample rental agreements, but they do not take part in the contract. In return for a fee, some offer escrow services that hold the renter's money until the vacation is over. Security deposits for damages are often extra.
 While there are some bumps in the system, most of the complaints are not related to the Internet. Owners complain about renters who are picky or cancel their plans. Renters say that owners demand too much money up front and don't describe the property correctly. While the Internet can offer endless photographs and multimedia presentations, it can't remove the need for both to extend some trust.
 Perry Myklebost, an owner who says he's rented his 20 different weeks through Web sites like tugbbs.com for 10 years, has a few sets of rules and a contract that he's honed over 150 transactions. First, he sets a realistic rate; second, he demands 100 percent of the money up front; third, he asks everyone to sign a three-page agreement that codifies the fees and the duration; and fourth, he makes all deals final. If someone wants insurance, they should find it through a broker.
 He urges the owners to come up with a ''realistic marketing plan'' that includes thorough descriptions to post on a Web site. He lists some of his at skitheholidays.com.
 ''Remember landlords that your job is to offer a rock bottom price for a fantastic vacation at a fantastic resort,'' he wrote in an e-mail message from St. Louis. ''If a renter distrusts you and demands escrow you can bet your bottom dollar that they will be a huge pain.'' 
 The Web sites themselves are also working to bridge the trust gap. 
 Mr. Locher says that RedWeek lets everyone search for free, but charges for both listing and inquiring.
 ''In order to contact another member, you have to become a member yourself,'' he explained. ''We charge both sides of the marketplace. Both the owner and an inquiring traveler has paid. That makes for a more serious prospect.'' 
 HomeAway.com (which offers vacation rentals for all sorts of homes, not just time shares) offers a guarantee of up to $5,000 if there's a problem with any of the rentals listed on its many different sites, including VRBO.com, VacationRentals.com, A1Vacations.com, GreatRentals.com or CyberRentals.com. The conditions require the renter to register the deal before payment and send the money through one of the approved methods. The guarantee, while generous, is only meant to compensate people when the ''listing is not legitimate in accordance with our policy.'' It won't cover ''renter's remorse,'' lost airfare or a long list of other losses. 
 The biggest contribution of the sites may be the way they nurture a relationship between the nominal owner and renter who are not locked in the same sort of relationship as a typical landlord and tenant. 
 Dawn Vandeman, a Disney Vacation Club owner for over 10 years from Minnesota, has been renting her points more often recently as her children have gotten older. (Her eldest is a senior in high school, and they spent most of their vacation time visiting colleges last year.)
 She says she works closely with her renters to help them plan their trips, often spending hours on the phone. This familiarity also helps her grow to trust the renter. In one recent case, she spent four hours on the phone suggesting restaurants and the best times to visit parks.
 ''Quite a few of us who rent points act like travel agents,'' she said. ''We want to make sure that the people we're renting to have a good time.''
